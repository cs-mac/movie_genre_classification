1
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,455
Q-u-a-r...

2
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,432
a-n-t...

3
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,146
i-n-e.

4
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,460
Quarantine.

5
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,386
Q-u-a-r...

6
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,226
a-n-t...

7
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,217
i-n-e.

8
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:48,307
Quarantine.

9
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:51,726
- You know the cholera?
- Yes, Mother.

10
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,935
You've seen the signs on the houses
where the coloureds live?

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,732
Yes, Mother.

12
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:59,744
- You know the typhus?
- I do, Mother.

13
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,033
You know what they can do to you?

14
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:08,500
Yes, Mother.

15
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,908
You are not safe.

16
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:24,589
You may be directing this movie, Howard,
but what you're asking, we can't do it.

17
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:27,468
Don't tell me I can't do it.
Don't tell me it can't be done.

18
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:29,680
The gyro forces are too much here.

19
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,455
You send these planes into simultaneous...

20
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:35,265
It's the goddamn climax of the picture,
Frank, all right? You make it work.

21
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:37,649
Look, decrease the vertical trajectory,
if you have to.

22
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:40,523
A LeRhone rotary won't stall at 60 degrees,
I've done it.

23
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,399
Howard, we're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down...

24
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,887
We're not cutting anything, all right.
I'll get those extra cameras.

25
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,784
Set up for rehearsals in five.

26
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,620
Mr Hughes, I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I might find you here.

27
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:55,539
Dietrich. You're a man on the come. I read
your résumé and talked to your references.

28
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,289
You know what I'm looking for?

29
00:02:57,394 --> 00:03:00,463
As I understand it, you're looking for
a second in command at Hughes Tools.

30
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:03,379
Someone to help oversee
the financial aspects of the business.

31
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,257
Yeah. I'm looking for somebody
to run it and do a damn good job.

32
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,635
Look, there's really one thing
you've got to know.

33
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,762
My folks, they're gone now,
so it's my money.

34
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:14,102
Now, what I choose to do with
that money may seem crazy

35
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,917
to those sons of bitches in Houston -
and I'm sure as hell it does -

36
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,312
but it all makes good sense to me.
You got that?

37
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,312
- Got it.
- Good.

38
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,608
Now, you made, what,
$5,200 a year on your last job?

39
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:27,070
I'll pay you 10,000.

40
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,243
- Guess I'll be working twice as hard.
- You'll be working four times as hard.

41
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:33,910
I just got you at half-price, Mr Dietrich.
Welcome aboard.

42
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:35,853
You're my voice now.
Make 'em understand that.

43
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:38,543
Look, some of those fine folks down there
still call me "Junior".

44
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,792
- You tell them it's "Mr Hughes" now.
- You bet.

45
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:45,547
- So, when do we go to Houston?
- We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.

46
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,424
2,000 dead. Whole place is
nothing but pestilential swamp.

47
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,845
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever -
you name it, they got it.

48
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,345
You see that, Mr Dietrich?

49
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,685
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.

50
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:04,160
- What do you think of that, now?
- It's your money.

51
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:07,305
Start 'em up.

52
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,737
I just saw the rough cut of
the new Tod Browning movie,

53
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:39,245
<i>London After Midnight.</i>
Lon Chaney is incredible.

54
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:44,050
It's his best performance in a long time. It's
gonna be a big hit. The cards are great.

55
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,295
Hello, Mr Mayer.

56
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,505
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.

57
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,967
I was wondering
if I could have a moment of your time.

58
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,678
Yeah, Howard Hughes.
The airplane picture, right?

59
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:58,223
- Exactly.
- Yeah, I remember.

60
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:01,060
- <i>Hell's Angels.</i> You heard of it. Good.
- Yes.

61
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,730
Listen, I was wondering
if I could have a moment of your time.

62
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,310
I need a few cameras.

63
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:08,108
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

64
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:10,106
Two, to be exact.

65
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,946
I already bought every camera I could find,

66
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,136
but we're shooting
our big dogfight sequence this week

67
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,904
and I need two more, desperately.
Do you think MGM could help me out?

68
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,619
- With what?
- Cameras.

69
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:25,674
With the actual cam... We're not usually in
the practice of helping out the competition.

70
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:30,679
- How many cameras do you have now?
- 24.

71
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:36,596
Wait a minute.

72
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,803
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.

73
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,810
- And you need two more?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:46,517
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.

75
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,275
You know, I think we've got them all...

76
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,855
Don't we have them all?
They're all used.

77
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,319
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.

78
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,447
- Jesus Christ, sonny...
- Howard.

79
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,406
Howard.
Let me give you a little advice.

80
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,907
- Why don't you take your oil money...
- Drill bits.

81
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:05,037
Take your drill bit money,
and why don't you put it in the bank?

82
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,648
Because if you continue making the movie
the way that you are,

83
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:10,171
there isn't gonna be a distributor
who'll want to distribute it.

84
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,878
You're not gonna find anybody
who wants to see the movie,

85
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:15,968
and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.

86
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:19,176
So, welcome to Hollywood.

87
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,765
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr Mayer.

88
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,892
- Good luck.
- All right.

89
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:28,155
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.

90
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:39,163
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.

91
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:40,962
Boss.

92
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:45,289
Scram, love boat, let's go.
Another soda. You know what I mean.

93
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:48,292
Milk, please, in the bottle.
With the cap still on.

94
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:50,024
OK, Howard, what did "His Highness" say?

95
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:53,392
The son of a bitch won't part with a single
goddamn camera. Can you believe it?

96
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:56,796
Howard, why don't you try
and make do with what you have?

97
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,218
What I have isn't enough, John.
Not for how I see it. Look.

98
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,931
My name depends on this picture.

99
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:05,706
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston
with my tail between my legs,

100
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,310
making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.

101
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,711
Couldn't you find a way to do it
with the cameras you have?

102
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:13,797
I mean, jeez, you ought to hear what's
going on with DeMille over at Paramount.

103
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:16,571
He's shooting this Bible picture, right,
and he's gotta do a crucifixion.

104
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,155
- Johnny.
- He's doing it in Fresno.

105
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,116
- Johnny. Johnny.
- All of a sudden there's...

106
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:21,700
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

107
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:24,159
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:27,663
And you're supposed to know all the little
ins and outs of Hollywood? Do you?

109
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:33,043
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Then you leave the big ideas to me.

110
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:36,057
- Yeah, of course, boss.
- Cigar, cigarettes, Sen-Sen?

111
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:41,425
Thelma. I thought you were over at
the Brown Derby with Trixie. No, Theresa.

112
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,303
- Margaret, yeah.
- Exactly. What happened to Margaret?

113
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,932
- She lost her shoes?
- Thank God that's settled.

114
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:50,436
I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.

115
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,149
Howard and I were just discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.

116
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:59,907
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

117
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:05,241
Whew. Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?

118
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,745
My God.

119
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,161
Would you do me a favour and just...

120
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:13,795
Would you just smile for me one time?
Just once?

121
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:19,090
Whew. Yeah. Yeah.
You see, you got a short upper lip.

122
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:22,471
Makes for a much nicer smile.

123
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:29,808
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.

124
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:33,645
I mean, say you're just standing there,
right? And I just touch you.

125
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:37,732
Just like this,
through my fingertips.

126
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:41,154
Do you...
Do you like that?

127
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,658
Do you?

128
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,872
See, I want to learn what pleases you.

129
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:55,331
I want to learn everything about you.

130
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:59,973
Would you let me do that?
Would you give me that job?

131
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,849
I'm off in a half an hour.

132
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:11,223
- Well, I'm in room...
- 217.

133
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:12,128
217.

134
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,988
See you there.

135
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,945
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warner's.

136
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,034
I need two more cameras by Saturday.
Rent 'em if you can.

137
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,788
Steal 'em if you have to.

138
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:33,547
Abso-tively, boss.
Abso-tively.

139
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,212
Rumours coming from
a lonely airstrip out in Van Nuys.

140
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,714
Sources whisper that young
Texas industrialist Howard Hughes

141
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:45,550
just won't stop pouring money
into his war epic. And do we mean epic.

142
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:51,679
137 pilots, 87 airplanes,
35 cameramen, 2,000 extras.

143
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,115
How long will it be before this picture
ends up costing as much as the real war?

144
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,315
Goddamn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?

145
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:04,662
This isn't what it was like up there. They
look like a bunch of goddamn models.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,588
Son of a bitch.

147
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,325
Howard?

148
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,874
Without something standing still
behind the planes

149
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,460
we've got no idea of how fast we're moving.

150
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:27,506
We got no sense of relative motion.

151
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,220
Call over to UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.

152
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:33,768
You get him here in an hour, all right?

153
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:38,814
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?

154
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,563
- The bad news, always.
- All right.

155
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,691
We installed the 450 radial
but the struts won't take the vibration.

156
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:48,028
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.

157
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,073
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.

158
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,950
Goddamn it, Odie, if the 450's too big,
we just got to figure something else out.

159
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:57,958
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.

160
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,832
Now, if we drain the fuel tank, for a couple
of runs, she might make 180mph.

161
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,796
I want minimum 200, all right?

162
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,530
I want a date with Theda Bara,
but that ain't gonna happen either.

163
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:07,591
Don't be so sure.

164
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:13,098
So if the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we got to get rid of the struts.

165
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:16,111
No, then the top wing falls off.

166
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,976
Then let it.

167
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
What?

168
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:27,156
Who says we need a top wing?
I mean, who says we need anything?

169
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:32,114
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right.

170
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,246
I mean, they're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and the struts.

171
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:38,287
- Put in a 550 Wasp engine.
- 100 octane fuel.

172
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,541
- That'd give us a top horsepower of what?
- 700.

173
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:47,764
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we've got the fastest plane ever built.

174
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:55,934
You know, I just got to say we've already
spent over $ 200,000 rebuilding this plane.

175
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:59,187
To hell with it.

176
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,317
Tear it up, Odie.
Go on.

177
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:06,662
Well.

178
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:13,835
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak...

179
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:17,325
that look like...

180
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,203
Giant breasts full of milk.
I want clouds, damn it.

181
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:27,213
Yes, clouds that look like
giant breasts full of milk

182
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:31,049
cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.

183
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,518
So you might have to...

184
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,999
to wait.

185
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:40,724
Then we'll wait.

186
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,274
Look, whatever they pay you at UCLA, I'm
doubling it, all right? You work for me now.

187
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:48,566
Find some clouds.

188
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,238
Find some clouds.
Find me some clouds.

189
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,825
Welcome to <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

190
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:59,038
Thank you.

191
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,216
We've been to Chatsworth, Santa Cruz,
Encino, San Diego, Riverside,

192
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:15,137
Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months.

193
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:19,683
- Where are my goddamn clouds?
- They move, Mr Hughes.

194
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:23,269
Clouds move.
That's what they do. They move.

195
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:29,314
See that? It is costing me $5,271 a day
to keep those planes on the ground.

196
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:33,161
You find me some goddamn clouds.

197
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:41,431
Nice day.

198
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,661
Yeah, very funny.

199
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:46,774
Listen, I got a call from Houston.
They're getting real nervous about all this.

200
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:50,126
- Stop showing them the damn bills, Noah.
- That would be illegal, Howard.

201
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,794
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.

202
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:58,094
Hughes Tools is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.

203
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,599
Incorporate a new division out here,
all right? We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.

204
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:04,264
Odie, do we need
these rivets on the cowling?

205
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,479
Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.

206
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,977
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that, OK?

207
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,423
- Wind resistance on the rivets?
- Yeah, I want her slippery.

208
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:14,527
There are serious tax consequences
to incorporating in California.

209
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,699
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes.

210
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:22,079
Oakland.
We have clouds in Oakland.

211
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,454
- You mean it this time?
- Yes.

212
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:29,252
Goddamn it, yes. I can promise you.
Clouds in Oakland.

213
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,235
All right, all right,
don't get all jittery now.

214
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:34,739
Oakland.
Oakland.

215
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,856
We're going to Oakland.
Oakland.

216
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,718
Down and to the left.

217
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:44,294
That was perfect.

218
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:53,880
Yes, young Howard Hughes
has pulled it off.

219
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:57,548
After two years, <i>Hell's Angels</i>
has finally finished filming.

220
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,591
There's going to be one heck
of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.

221
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:03,680
The price tag?
A staggering $ 2 million.

222
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:06,178
So, if every human being
in America buys a ticket,

223
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:08,187
heck, he might
even make a profit.

224
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:17,147
First the clouds don't come, then the
planes break down, then the planes crash.

225
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,901
Then the Zeppelins don't work.

226
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,866
Seems we've had everything but
a damn plague of locusts on this thing.

227
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,405
I mean, you have to admit.

228
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:29,293
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?

229
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:31,260
Come with me.

230
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,543
Mama, darling,
if I'm a success in this show,

231
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,644
- well, we're going to move from here.
- Oh, no.

232
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,800
Oh, yes.
We're gonna move up in the Bronx.

233
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:43,409
Lot of nice green grass up there
and a whole lot of people you know.

234
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:45,887
There's the Ginsbergs,
the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs.

235
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:47,819
A whole lot of bergs.
I don't know them all.

236
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:53,183
You see, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.

237
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,901
So I figure we gotta reshoot
<i>Hell's Angels</i> for sound.

238
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:01,447
- How much of it?
- All of it.

239
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:06,697
Before you even ask, I'll tell you. An
additional 1.7 million. We got that much?

240
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:10,037
- No.
- Well, we'll make it.

241
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,165
Take care of that, would you?

242
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,459
Now get this.

243
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:27,973
In the halls of 7000 Romaine, it goes on
day after day, month after month.

244
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:31,935
Howard Hughes is now editing
some 25 miles of film.

245
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:38,316
Heck, I say release it now and give
the world its first 560-hour movie.

246
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,483
Pat. Mr Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now.

247
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,282
Enough is enough, Mr Hughes.

248
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,490
Are you ever gonna let us actually see
this little epic of yours?

249
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,395
Hurry up.

250
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:12,559
- Who is it?
- Noah.

251
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,730
Come on in.

252
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,285
I've been on the phone to Houston
for three solid hours.

253
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,313
We're fixing every goddamn book we have.

254
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,610
Wait, wait, wait.

255
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:26,114
Yeah. Run reel ten again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.

256
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:30,033
And tell Jimmy I want
ten chocolate chip cookies, all right?

257
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:33,831
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside. Got it?

258
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:37,329
Do you remember
that goddamn shot from reel ten?

259
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:42,462
No. I don't remember anything from
reel ten. I don't know what reel ten is.

260
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm a businessman, Howard,
and so are you.

261
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:47,716
Now, look.

262
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:51,760
This has been a great ride.
We've had a hell of a lot of fun.

263
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:55,722
But you're losing
$ 25,000 a day doing this.

264
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,827
Every day.

265
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,242
So, what are my options?

266
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,493
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.

267
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:13,662
I'm afraid you got to close it down.

268
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,500
Dig your way out.

269
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:24,588
I'm sorry, Howard.

270
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,892
I truly am.

271
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,229
Reel ten, Mr Hughes.

272
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:44,356
Mortgage Toolco.

273
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:46,774
Every asset.

274
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,571
- You heard me.
- If you do that, you could lose everything.

275
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:51,744
Well, I won't.

276
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:55,981
I won't.

277
00:20:57,144 --> 00:20:59,144
All right.

278
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:02,089
I'll get into it.

279
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,507
Thanks, Noah.

280
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:43,747
More than half a million good souls
lining the curb of Hollywood Boulevard.

281
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:45,714
Look at the automobiles,
ladies and gentlemen.

282
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:49,090
There are at least 45,000 cars here,
making it the greatest traffic jam...

283
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:52,261
Young Howard Hughes must have
quite a lump in his throat tonight.

284
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:56,390
Six months after the stock market crashes
and after the death of three of his pilots,

285
00:21:56,494 --> 00:21:59,598
he's finally unveiling
his $4-million baby doll.

286
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:04,064
It's the most expensive movie ever.
Nothing five-and-dime for our Mr Hughes.

287
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:06,274
Nothing like tonight
has ever been seen before,

288
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:09,400
and I can certainly say
it will never be seen again.

289
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:12,444
500,000 people are crowding the streets
to get a glimpse

290
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:16,117
of the stars and celebrities.
Three companies of Marines were called

291
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:20,036
to assist the 250 special police
who are handling this enormous crowd.

292
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:21,704
This is an industry town, my friends,

293
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:25,126
and nobody, but nobody,
makes a movie outside a studio.

294
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,708
Sure, some Hollywood insiders
over at the Brown Derby...

295
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,961
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I think...

296
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:33,174
Yes, yes. I can just see
Mr Hughes's car arriving now.

297
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,012
Mr Hughes escorts
the lovely starlet Jean Harlow tonight.

298
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:40,765
He discovered her for this picture,
and we think her platinum-blonde locks

299
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,524
and hot-jazz, baby-doll style
are gonna make her a big star.

300
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:11,835
Mr Hughes.

301
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:15,298
Mr Hughes, how about a word?

302
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:19,848
Big night for you, Mr Hughes.

303
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:22,851
Big night for you tonight.

304
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,061
Very big.
Very big.

305
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:29,285
Tell us what it was like
making this fabulous picture.

306
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:31,587
Yes.

307
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:33,674
Yeah.

308
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:39,997
So, four million clams from your own
pocket. Nervous how the flick will fly?

309
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:46,039
Big night.
You enjoy the show.

310
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:51,630
Yes, well, let me present the feminine star
of this spectacle, <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

311
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,211
- Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.

312
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:57,508
I would like to use this occasion
to publicly thank Mr Hughes

313
00:23:57,612 --> 00:24:01,135
for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.

314
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,097
Thank you. And now
I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle

315
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,561
to introduce his pet lion cub, Gilmore.

316
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:10,129
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you remember my name?

317
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:14,531
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner.
And this would be Gilmore.

318
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,326
We've got him.
We've got him.

319
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:04,116
Murder. That's what
this dirty rotten politician war is.

320
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,088
Murder. You know it as well as I do.

321
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:46,506
Stand up, Slim, take a bow.

322
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:01,092
Reel four played way too long.
Too many coughs.

323
00:26:01,196 --> 00:26:03,784
Get Harry and the team out of the party,
get them over to the office.

324
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:05,177
I want to cut a few shots tonight.

325
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:09,099
Find Glenn Odekirk. Somebody write
this down. "Flush rivets." You got that?

326
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,060
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.

327
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:12,855
Lickety split, boss.

328
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,026
Here he is.

329
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:19,064
<i>Variety</i> says,
"This one won't miss."

330
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,444
Magnificently photographed...

331
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:24,988
Scenes that never
have been approached...

332
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:28,411
Not for a long time have I seen
anything as enthralling...

333
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:33,465
It cost four million dollars
and it has four million thrills...

334
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:35,857
The lighter shade. I don't want to look like
Boris Karloff, if you know what I mean.

335
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:40,816
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.

336
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,611
On occasion.

337
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:45,197
Well, how about nine holes?

338
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,740
Now, Mr Hughes?

339
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:52,874
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

340
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,560
You're not extending enough
on your follow-through.

341
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,899
Follow-through is everything in golf,
just like life. Ha-ha-ha.

342
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:23,150
Don't you find?

343
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:25,316
Saw your <i>Scarface</i> picture.

344
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,236
- Violent.
- Realistic.

345
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,572
Movies are movies, Howard, not life.
Now, the stage - the stage is real.

346
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:36,874
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right up there in front of you, buster.

347
00:28:36,978 --> 00:28:40,082
Can't look away.
Can't munch popcorn. That would be rude.

348
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,044
- Do you like the theatre?
- No.

349
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:44,338
I adore the theatre.

350
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:46,632
Only alive on stage.
I'll teach you.

351
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:50,763
We'll see some Ibsen, if the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now. Ha-ha.

352
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:53,996
You're not a Republican, are you? Couldn't
abide that. How did you vote in '32?

353
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,191
- Well, I didn't.
- You must. It's your sacred franchise.

354
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:04,192
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?

355
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:06,025
Aw, she's just a friend.

356
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:08,737
Ha. Men can't be friends
with women, Howard.

357
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:12,779
They must possess them or leave them be.
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.

358
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,159
It's all in Darwin.
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.

359
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:20,120
That's the male sex all over.

360
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:22,224
Excuse me?

361
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:27,544
Well, if you're deaf you must own up to it.
Get a hearing aid, or see my father.

362
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:31,340
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?

363
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:35,596
Me, I keep healthy.
I take seven showers a day to keep clean.

364
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,389
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy".

365
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:43,352
Well, I'm not "outdoorsy".
I'm athletic. I sweat.

366
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:46,232
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.

367
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:48,860
I sweat and you're deaf.

368
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:52,326
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

369
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:56,622
Three.

370
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,841
Noble effort.

371
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:12,173
So I suppose you're wooing me now.

372
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,077
Oh, well.

373
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:38,493
Not enough. Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.

374
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:41,748
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

375
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:44,541
I want no wind resistance on the fuselage.

376
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:47,962
She has got to be clean, Odie.
Clean. Understand?

377
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:51,798
- OK, Howard.
- I don't know what else to tell you.

378
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,133
What have you got for me?

379
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:56,804
The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.
A modern plane.

380
00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:59,137
- Yeah? What kind of plane?
- OK.

381
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:02,560
The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats
and 14 overnight berths.

382
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:05,058
- Something bigger.
- Try 50 seats.

383
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,189
- With a ceiling of 12,000 feet.
- No.

384
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:12,027
20,000. Think about it, Jack.
What does 20,000 feet give you?

385
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,574
- Less turbulence.
- Right, because it's above the weather.

386
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:17,282
Jack, we want to fly above the weather.

387
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:20,955
Only 1 per cent of the American population
has ever set foot on a commercial airliner.

388
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,041
Why? Because they're scared to death,
Jack, and they should be.

389
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:26,833
I mean, 7,000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.

390
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:29,461
We build a plane
that flies above the weather,

391
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:33,420
we could get every man, woman and child
in this country to feel safe up there.

392
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,677
An airplane with the ability
to fly in the substratosphere.

393
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:40,053
Across the country.
Across the world.

394
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:42,554
Now, that is the future.

395
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:43,892
- You with me?
- Yeah.

396
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:46,210
Shoot straight with me now,
cos I don't wanna get into all this

397
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:48,061
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.

398
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,819
- Would they support us?
- I don't know. They're tight bastards.

399
00:31:50,923 --> 00:31:52,946
- Well, what's your financial picture?
- Not great.

400
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,154
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.

401
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:57,864
- What's it selling at?
- About eight dollars a share.

402
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:01,785
That's the lowest it's been.

403
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,329
- I could do that.
- Do what?

404
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,663
- Buy it.
- You want to buy the airline?

405
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,587
For crying out loud, Jack. We don't want
a bunch of damn pencil-pushers

406
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:12,087
getting in the way
of us making our plane, do we?

407
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:17,006
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?

408
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:20,762
- Call it 15 million.
- Whew.

409
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:23,813
- That is a chunk of change.
- Yeah.

410
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:30,646
You call Noah Dietrich.
You have him start buying.

411
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,067
Howard, hold on. Are you sure? You want
to think about it for five minutes?

412
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:39,163
Hell, Jack, I've got a tiger by the tail here,
and I ain't gonna let it go.

413
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,253
Good evening, Mr Hughes.
Welcome. Your table is ready.

414
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:56,380
- How goes the aviation, Mr Hughes?
- Just fine, Pete.

415
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,850
I'm so glad.

416
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,140
- Good evening, Mr Hughes. Madame.
- It's "Miss".

417
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:06,681
- Miss. The usual, Mr Hughes?
- Please, yes.

418
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,227
And may I recommend for the lady
our clementine soup,

419
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:13,231
followed by roast wild duck with currant
glaze and poached pears in rose sauce?

420
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:16,531
- It's truly divine.
- Yeah. That sounds fine.

421
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,362
Your kind of a joint, is it?

422
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,910
- Wouldn't have thought.
- They're open late.

423
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:28,869
I go to a hot dog stand on La Cienega, too.
They're open till about four.

424
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,773
Are they?

425
00:33:32,264 --> 00:33:34,719
How marvellous.

426
00:33:49,948 --> 00:33:52,940
Howard. Howard.

427
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,398
Hi. Son of a gun.

428
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:59,402
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer. I suppose
you could call him my press agent.

429
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:01,220
Pleased to meet you.
Loved you in <i>Alice Adams.</i>

430
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:03,114
- You're too kind.
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?

431
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,953
- Mr Flynn. Yes.
- Kate. Kate.

432
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:10,120
Kate of the clenched-jawed Hepburns.
Enchanting as always.

433
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,582
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.

434
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,880
Kate, sweetie, you and Howard ought
to cook up a picture. Co-star with Errol...

435
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:17,551
My chair.

436
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:24,467
I think not.
Don't you read <i>Variety.</i> Mr Meyer?

437
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:28,223
I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.

438
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:32,060
Washed up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.

439
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:35,687
To hell with them. To hell with them,
my dear. Soulless pricks to a man, right?

440
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:42,073
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.

441
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:46,866
Are you making a Western, Howard?

442
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,578
Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it <i>The Outlaw.</i>

443
00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:53,914
Yeah. And you know what it's about?
S-e-x. It's all about s-e-x.

444
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,749
It's a Western.

445
00:34:55,854 --> 00:35:00,004
- You can't have fornication in a Western.
- It's not real sex, Skinny. It's movie sex.

446
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:03,842
What <i>Scarface</i> did for the gangster picture,
<i>The Outlaw</i> is gonna do for the Western.

447
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:06,886
Put the sex and guts and blood
right up there on the screen...

448
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,098
- Have any cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.

449
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:12,640
New York-cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.

450
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:16,019
You're the only movie star I know
can't afford his own goddamn cigarettes.

451
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:20,486
I hope your food isn't getting cold over
at your table somewhere, or something.

452
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,983
No, no, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.

453
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,657
Now, Howard.
Now, Howard, Howard. Howard.

454
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:30,161
If you're seriously talking about putting
carnality back on the silver screen,

455
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:34,835
you must swear to let me in
on the casting sessions.

456
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:39,919
I've somewhat of an eye -
an eye for talent, isn't that right, Johnny?

457
00:35:40,023 --> 00:35:42,592
You ought to give up that prancing
in tights, be a talent scout.

458
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:46,887
That prancing in tights paid for my new
yacht. You must all come sailing with me.

459
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:48,556
Catalina, this weekend.
What do you say?

460
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,887
- Yeah, Catalina. Sounds grand.
- Let's have some fun.

461
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:53,645
I've even managed to coax
the luscious Miss de Havilland

462
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:56,019
and her equally luscious sister
to accompany me.

463
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,337
Though I fear their mother
will insist on coming along

464
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,941
to preserve their questionable virtue.

465
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:05,738
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.

466
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:07,987
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?

467
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,490
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

468
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,594
Yeah.

469
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:17,247
I gotta... I gotta go.

470
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:20,543
If you'll excuse us,
we have to be somewhere.

471
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:23,420
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.

472
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:26,549
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.

473
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:30,931
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.

474
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:34,556
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.

475
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,976
Was that meant for me?

476
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,519
My hero.
God, all that Hollywood talk bores me silly.

477
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:42,652
As if there aren't more important things
in the world. Mussolini, for one.

478
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:46,822
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?

479
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,948
Do your worst, Mr Hughes.

480
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:50,320
...you limey bastard.

481
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:53,284
I'm a Tasmanian bastard,
you ignorant prick.

482
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:55,458
That a way, Errol.

483
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:32,114
That's Mr Mayer's house right there.

484
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:35,498
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

485
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:47,294
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.

486
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:51,678
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands...

487
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,093
What kind of crap?

488
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:56,399
You don't want to know.

489
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:03,903
Hold onto the wheel for a bit.

490
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,451
That's too hard.
Relax your hand. Relax your hand.

491
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:25,082
You see, you've got to feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.

492
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:28,545
- Feel that?
- Yes.

493
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:29,649
Yeah.

494
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:32,969
Well, that's good.

495
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:34,273
Golly.

496
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:41,140
Well, she's all yours.

497
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:45,729
- Where are you going?
- I think there's some milk back here.

498
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:49,742
- You just keep us steady now.
- All right.

499
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,548
- Howard.
- Yeah?

500
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:12,045
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.

501
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,016
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.

502
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:20,811
Golly.

503
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:33,867
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly".

504
00:39:40,257 --> 00:39:42,537
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?

505
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:46,502
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

506
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:54,258
- You... You want some milk?
- Please.

507
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:19,866
Utterly smashing.
We'll do it again. I'm free Wednesday.

508
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:21,830
It's a little early for golf, though,
don't you think?

509
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:24,289
Oh, no. I live right there.

510
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:27,219
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.

511
00:40:28,263 --> 00:40:31,793
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.

512
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:36,009
My decorator picked out
the wallpaper and such.

513
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:41,221
He's queer as a bed bug, but...
I just hate this room.

514
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,555
Gives me the willies. Ugh.

515
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:47,817
Feel I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of <i>Town & Country.</i>

516
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,405
What room do you like?

517
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:01,309
My study.

518
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:05,333
Take me there.

519
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:25,182
You are the tallest woman I know.

520
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,893
And all sharp elbows and knees.

521
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:29,397
Beware.

522
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:55,008
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

523
00:41:57,603 --> 00:42:00,438
It is tomorrow.

524
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:54,064
Keep your eye on the fuel gauge.

525
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:57,772
She's got a minimum of fuel to keep
her weight down. Two runs, that's it.

526
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,926
After that, you're flying on vapours.
And then you crash and then you die.

527
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,698
- Right.
- Just give her easy flying.

528
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:05,656
Don't worry about speed.
And don't think about the record today.

529
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,101
I wish to God you'd let someone else take
her up. You've got damn 20 test pilots...

530
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:12,166
Hell, why should I let
someone else have all the fun?

531
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,048
See you in a bit.

532
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:36,675
Contact.

533
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:06,214
Whoo-hoo.

534
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,350
339.

535
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:10,874
Goddamn.

536
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:34,118
347.

537
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:37,687
Whoo.
Son of a bitch.

538
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:12,747
- 352.
- 352.

539
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,145
Good girl.

540
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:26,345
Damn it.

541
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,447
Goddamn it.
Oh, God.

542
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:37,044
- There goes our meal ticket.
- Come on.

543
00:47:16,922 --> 00:47:19,202
Howard. Howard.

544
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:21,746
How did we do?

545
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:25,789
352 on the last run.

546
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:27,597
She'll go faster.

547
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,380
Country mouse.

548
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:31,964
Kate. Katie.

549
00:47:32,068 --> 00:47:34,138
Upstairs, city mouse.

550
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:38,017
Hello.

551
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:42,516
- Good Lord, what happened to you?
- Nothing. Hard landing. I cut my foot.

552
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,477
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.

553
00:47:45,582 --> 00:47:49,316
Well, you cannot imagine what it was like,
Katie. You cannot imagine the speed.

554
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,482
She was like a winged bullet up there.

555
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:55,654
- What did she make?
- Around...

556
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:56,559
352.

557
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:06,377
You did it.

558
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:08,878
Fastest man on the planet.

559
00:48:08,982 --> 00:48:13,425
- Hot dog. I'm so proud of you.
- She did it, baby.

560
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:17,055
- You knew she would.
- She was fine. She was just fine.

561
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,648
- Now let me see your foot.
- Yeah.

562
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,395
Good God.
You're covered in blood.

563
00:48:24,499 --> 00:48:27,686
No, no. That's just beet juice.
I crashed into a beet field.

564
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:31,616
- What?
- Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

565
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:37,032
Let me get you cleaned up.

566
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:39,242
Heavens, what is this?
Electrical tape?

567
00:48:39,346 --> 00:48:42,700
Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.

568
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:48,838
But all I could think about was
getting home to see you.

569
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:56,094
I am so proud of you.

570
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,970
Now, this is going to sting a little bit.

571
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:06,481
This is useless. Come to the bathroom.

572
00:49:07,532 --> 00:49:10,312
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't.

573
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:13,245
- Too hot.
- Don't be a baby.

574
00:49:14,873 --> 00:49:18,448
Was the press there?

575
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:20,952
Some, but...

576
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,423
They're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.

577
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,967
What is it?

578
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:39,188
Kate?

579
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:46,431
I've been famous,
for better or worse,

580
00:49:46,535 --> 00:49:49,365
for a long time now, and...

581
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:55,535
I wonder if you know
what it really means.

582
00:49:56,623 --> 00:50:00,447
Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

583
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,916
I'm used to it.

584
00:50:04,256 --> 00:50:05,856
Are you?

585
00:50:09,636 --> 00:50:11,712
Howard, we're...

586
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:17,101
We're not like everyone else.

587
00:50:18,854 --> 00:50:24,431
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.

588
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:29,765
We have to be very careful
not to let people in,

589
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:32,819
or they'll make us into freaks.

590
00:50:33,785 --> 00:50:34,785
Kate.

591
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:38,776
They can't get in here.
We're safe.

592
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,910
They can always get in.

593
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:47,539
When my brother killed himself,

594
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:52,205
there were photographers at the funeral.

595
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:55,221
There's no decency to it.

596
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:09,103
You know, sometimes I...

597
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:15,404
I get these feelings, Katie.

598
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:22,827
I get these ideas, these...

599
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:27,751
crazy ideas about...

600
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,052
things that may not...

601
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:37,458
things that may not really be there.

602
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:38,563
Yeah.

603
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:49,060
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm...

604
00:51:50,529 --> 00:51:53,529
losing my mind.

605
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:02,654
And if I did, it would...

606
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:08,044
It'd be like flying blind.

607
00:52:15,762 --> 00:52:18,762
You understand?

608
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:24,596
You taught me to fly, Howard.

609
00:52:27,274 --> 00:52:29,765
I'll take the wheel.

610
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:49,243
Smashing all records, Howard Hughes
outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.

611
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:52,495
Around the world from New York
to New York in four days,

612
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,915
even beating Wiley Post's mark
by over three days.

613
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,626
New aviation history is written

614
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:01,461
when his Lockheed monoplane
returns swiftly and safely.

615
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:05,631
A daring aviator.
A true pioneer of the world's airways.

616
00:53:05,735 --> 00:53:08,509
From New York to Paris,
he cuts Lindbergh's time in half.

617
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:09,928
Then on to Moscow.

618
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:14,559
35 hours out of New York, he roars
across Siberia's trackless wastes.

619
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:19,272
60 hours out of New York, he heads
for Alaska, most hazardous hop of all.

620
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:21,898
Continuing the terrific pace,
he comes home,

621
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:24,481
bringing new laurels
to American aviation.

622
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:28,994
Howard Hughes and his crew may find
more worlds to conq...

623
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,938
You're not gonna believe this.
It just came across the wires.

624
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:41,504
Howard Hughes
has bought control of TWA.

625
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,008
I thought Mr Hughes
was flying around the world.

626
00:53:46,112 --> 00:53:51,097
Apparently, he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.

627
00:53:56,822 --> 00:54:01,606
I have heard some disquieting rumours
about Mr Hughes.

628
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,411
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr Hughes.

629
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:11,669
I'd like you to attend
to that for me, thoroughly.

630
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:15,410
Ah, the Pantages is glittering tonight.

631
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:17,770
Right over here, Mr Hughes.
This way, over to the left.

632
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:19,874
Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes,
how was your flight?

633
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:22,358
Miss Hepburn, Miss Hepburn.
When are you gonna name the day?

634
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:26,338
- Right over here, Mr Hughes.
- What's your next movie, Howard?

635
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:30,048
Right here, Howard. How many more
records are you gonna set?

636
00:54:30,152 --> 00:54:34,092
Come on, Howard.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.

637
00:54:34,197 --> 00:54:36,267
- Raise your head a little.
- Over here. Over here.

638
00:54:36,372 --> 00:54:38,018
Don't forget this side.

639
00:54:38,122 --> 00:54:40,271
Mr Hughes, when are you
gonna fly round the world again?

640
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:44,233
You going to fly with Kate next time?
Did you get Ionely without her?

641
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:46,778
Did you talk to Lindbergh
about your round-the-world flight yet?

642
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:49,693
Mr Hughes,
where is Linda Darnell tonight?

643
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:51,945
Right here.
Right here, Mr Hughes. That's it.

644
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:55,284
Are you trying to be
more famous than Lindbergh?

645
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:59,248
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.

646
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:01,861
LB.

647
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,296
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.

648
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:11,180
Ah, you look so beautiful.

649
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:20,644
Is that true?

650
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:25,116
...Mr Randolph Scott.
They make a handsome couple...

651
00:55:29,331 --> 00:55:31,195
Don't worry about it, Howard.

652
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,406
She's just working the room.

653
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,874
It's her job, baby.

654
00:55:37,172 --> 00:55:41,789
Sultry southern tigress
Ava Gardner dazzles the room tonight.

655
00:55:41,893 --> 00:55:46,761
She's the newest star in the MGM galaxy.
And believe you me...

656
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:55,103
Jane Eyre has been selling
popcorn for over a hundred years, LB.

657
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:37,932
Hello.

658
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:41,018
Hello.

659
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:49,327
Could you reach me a towel?

660
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:57,593
I...

661
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:02,957
I really can't do that.

662
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,551
I'm sorry.

663
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm an idiot.
I'm a complete idiot and I'm sorry.

664
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:36,608
- Forget it.
- No, no.

665
00:57:36,712 --> 00:57:41,031
I'm a vain, preening ass
without a single redeeming feature.

666
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:44,742
That's not true.
You have very good teeth.

667
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:46,447
Come on.

668
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,330
I've got a better idea.
Take me flying.

669
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:53,379
- Or better yet, I'll take you flying.
- Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

670
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,220
Don't be so squirmy, Howard.

671
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:06,436
You're going to get on famously
with Father and Mother.

672
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,277
And I'm sure they'll like you, too.
Once they get to know you.

673
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:19,568
Hello. Hello.

674
00:58:19,672 --> 00:58:22,585
- Kath, hello.
- Kathy.

675
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:28,062
Sweetheart, who's that
with the camera right there?

676
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:32,002
That's my ex-husband, Ludlow. Father
and Mother are just mad about Luddie.

677
00:58:32,106 --> 00:58:34,877
What the hell is he doing here?

678
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:37,339
He's here all the time.

679
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:38,643
Hello.

680
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:43,555
Sorry we're late. Mom.

681
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,304
- Thank you.
- Dad.

682
00:58:45,408 --> 00:58:47,682
- Darling.
- Uncle Willy.

683
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:51,270
Who've we got here?
Don't feel self-conscious.

684
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:54,396
Hepburns. Hepburns.
Attention, please.

685
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,858
This is Howard.

686
00:58:56,963 --> 00:59:00,069
Howard, welcome.

687
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:02,705
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

688
00:59:03,795 --> 00:59:05,993
He likes you.
That's unusual.

689
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:09,247
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.

690
00:59:09,351 --> 00:59:11,957
Julian's a painter.
Abstract, of course.

691
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:14,066
What the hell's the point
of painting something real

692
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,961
when you can just take a picture
nowadays, don't you agree?

693
00:59:17,065 --> 00:59:19,967
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr Hughes?

694
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:22,509
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.

695
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:24,813
We are not.

696
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:27,980
You've met Mr Roosevelt.
What make you of him?

697
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:33,186
What are you sniggering at?

698
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:36,358
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.

699
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:39,528
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.

700
00:59:39,632 --> 00:59:41,609
- Oh, my God.
- Buster.

701
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:43,084
Hey. Hey.

702
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,656
Don't you like dogs?

703
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,664
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr Roosevelt at my table. Please leave.

704
00:59:49,768 --> 00:59:52,080
- No, no, I wasn't.
- I thought everybody liked dogs.

705
00:59:52,184 --> 00:59:53,668
Perhaps he had a bad experience
as a child.

706
00:59:53,772 --> 00:59:56,734
So, Kathy, does it stick in your craw that
Howard here gets more press than you?

707
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:00,006
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.

708
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,757
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.

709
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:06,368
The press can be a damned nuisance...

710
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:08,678
- Was it a Doberman?
- It burns my goat.

711
01:00:08,782 --> 01:00:10,476
A Doberman, Mr Hughes, or a dachshund?

712
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,479
- Neither, sir.
- Dachshunds are little dogs.

713
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,732
They should all be lined up
against a wall and shot.

714
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:18,689
What's that Spanish painting? The...

715
01:00:18,793 --> 01:00:22,694
- The Goya.
- Goya. Of course. Yes.

716
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:25,905
- Yes. Mexicans. Poor lambs.
- What was that called?

717
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:30,748
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr Hughes?

718
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:34,662
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.

719
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:35,967
Snuff?

720
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:39,548
These would be flying magazines?

721
01:00:40,392 --> 01:00:42,839
- What was that?
- He's a little deaf.

722
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:45,761
- Pass the goddamn butter.
- You read flying magazines?

723
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:49,513
- Take the butter.
- Trade journals on engineering, aviation.

724
01:00:49,617 --> 01:00:51,808
We read books.

725
01:00:51,912 --> 01:00:55,938
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new airplane.

726
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:58,274
Oh, really? Do tell.

727
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:03,022
Well...

728
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:09,447
It's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.

729
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:12,454
A twin-engine plane with some,
I must admit,

730
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,952
some rather unique design features.

731
01:01:15,056 --> 01:01:18,082
You see, it has these two booms...

732
01:01:18,186 --> 01:01:21,421
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that?

733
01:01:21,525 --> 01:01:24,380
- Yes, well, a mere trifle.
- I remember the painting.

734
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:27,175
- It's called "May 18" or something.
- Hey. Hey.

735
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:30,052
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.

736
01:01:30,156 --> 01:01:33,097
- Nonsense. Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.

737
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:36,333
- It was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster, that's what Picasso is.

738
01:01:36,438 --> 01:01:39,024
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.

739
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,315
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk.

740
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,819
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs Hepburn, nothing.

741
01:01:44,923 --> 01:01:48,822
Then why did you speak? I can't abide
people who speak but have nothing to say.

742
01:01:48,926 --> 01:01:52,659
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?

743
01:01:52,763 --> 01:01:53,994
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

744
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:57,121
Well, Howard just flew
round the world in three days.

745
01:01:57,225 --> 01:02:00,332
- We've heard enough about airplanes.
- And dogs, apparently.

746
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:04,337
- Then how'd you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.

747
01:02:04,442 --> 01:02:08,135
Well, that's because you have it.

748
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:13,051
Would you repeat that?

749
01:02:13,156 --> 01:02:15,849
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.

750
01:02:15,953 --> 01:02:18,893
- Well then, how did you make...
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.

751
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:20,689
- OK.
- Thank you.

752
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:22,278
All right.

753
01:02:22,744 --> 01:02:25,192
Some of us choose to work for a living.

754
01:02:25,296 --> 01:02:31,872
Speaking of which, I have more of that
"airplane guff" to attend to. Excuse me.

755
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:43,296
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

756
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,889
Well, you're a fine bunch
of bullies, aren't you?

757
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:50,132
Have you talked to Mr Mayer
about letting you do <i>Jane Eyre?</i>

758
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:53,926
The old Philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.

759
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,184
Daddy, I'm convinced,
the man hasn't read anything longer than

760
01:02:56,288 --> 01:02:59,111
a Sunday <i>Katzenjammer Kids</i> in his life.

761
01:03:00,157 --> 01:03:03,526
No fair kicking.
You have to use the mallet.

762
01:03:05,495 --> 01:03:09,191
Really, though, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that

763
01:03:09,295 --> 01:03:13,070
- or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.

764
01:03:13,174 --> 01:03:15,490
You were like a different person in there.

765
01:03:15,594 --> 01:03:19,207
They just expect me to be a certain way.

766
01:03:21,053 --> 01:03:23,583
There's only one real Kate.

767
01:03:23,688 --> 01:03:26,006
And that's your Kate.

768
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:31,552
And over in Hollywood,
aviation tycoon Howard Hughes

769
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:33,467
seems to be cooking up something big.

770
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:35,846
Even as he edits
his newest motion picture,

771
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,306
he's been secretly meeting
with the US Air Corps.

772
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:42,060
We applaud his patriotism and look
forward to his newest mechanical marvel.

773
01:03:42,164 --> 01:03:45,337
Do you know how many Allied ships we
lost this year because of U-boat attacks?

774
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:49,109
- No.
- 681 ships, just this year so far.

775
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:52,363
Now, the army needs a new airplane
to fly the troops over to Europe.

776
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:56,283
These ships, they're sitting ducks.
They're sitting ducks for the U-boats.

777
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:59,909
- You want to build a troop carrier plane.
- Stop thinking like an insect, Odie.

778
01:04:00,013 --> 01:04:03,249
Not just a plane to carry the troops.
A plane to carry everything.

779
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:07,923
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.

780
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:11,467
No, other side.

781
01:04:13,772 --> 01:04:17,385
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan around 300.

782
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:21,346
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.

783
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:24,393
Now, this, this is just what Kaiser
and the army are looking for.

784
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:26,274
And don't worry,
they're gonna pay for it this time.

785
01:04:26,378 --> 01:04:27,730
Christ.
What are you getting us into?

786
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:31,485
Well, it's a big plane.
So I'm calling it the Hercules.

787
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:33,529
Swell name, isn't it?

788
01:04:33,634 --> 01:04:38,501
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.

789
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,831
Well, I didn't say it was going to be easy.

790
01:04:42,936 --> 01:04:46,167
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.

791
01:04:46,271 --> 01:04:48,127
Should give the proper uplift ratios

792
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:51,018
while reducing the need
for additional torque support on the front.

793
01:04:51,143 --> 01:04:54,051
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.

794
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:57,312
All right, I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.

795
01:04:59,985 --> 01:05:03,725
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard.

796
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:08,439
Do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?

797
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:11,821
Sure.
Who doesn't like tits?

798
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:25,162
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

799
01:05:25,266 --> 01:05:27,958
Will the secretary please record
that Mr Hughes has arrived,

800
01:05:28,062 --> 01:05:31,546
and that this session is now called
to order? I yield the floor to Mr Breen.

801
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,756
Mr Hughes, members of the committee,

802
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,966
I have reviewed Mr Hughes' photoplay
entitled <i>The Outlaw</i>

803
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:40,926
and I can state categorically that I have
never seen anything quite so unacceptable

804
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:45,310
as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.

805
01:05:45,415 --> 01:05:48,269
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries,

806
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:53,650
which are quite large and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.

807
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:57,865
For this reason I have concluded the
picture appeals only to prurient interests

808
01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:03,115
and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.

809
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:05,579
Really, Mr Hughes.

810
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:09,710
- Thank you, Mr Breen. Mr Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr Chairman.

811
01:06:09,814 --> 01:06:11,542
Mr Breen,
it's good to see you again.

812
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:16,174
I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in <i>Scarface.</i>

813
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:19,344
The situation here seems to revolve
around Miss Russell's mammaries.

814
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:22,137
Mr Breen feels that
they are too prominent, yes?

815
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:25,680
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?

816
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:29,824
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

817
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:34,277
Jean Harlow.

818
01:06:35,455 --> 01:06:37,413
Ann Sheridan.

819
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:39,905
Irene Dunne.

820
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:42,282
Claudette Colbert.

821
01:06:42,386 --> 01:06:44,243
Rita Hayworth.

822
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:45,577
Betty Grable.

823
01:06:45,681 --> 01:06:48,871
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.

824
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:52,044
Now, all these shots,
save for Miss Russell,

825
01:06:52,148 --> 01:06:57,128
were enlarged from pictures
that received Mr Breen's seal of approval.

826
01:06:57,232 --> 01:07:02,566
Now, as you have probably noticed
by now, they all contain mammaries.

827
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,303
I will ask my associate to join me now.

828
01:07:05,407 --> 01:07:09,731
May I introduce Dr Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University?

829
01:07:11,742 --> 01:07:13,742
Dr Branson

830
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:17,774
is a mathematician of some note.

831
01:07:17,878 --> 01:07:18,905
Yes, you.

832
01:07:19,009 --> 01:07:22,323
And he will now demonstrate that, in fact,

833
01:07:22,427 --> 01:07:25,993
Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent

834
01:07:26,098 --> 01:07:29,293
than any of these other fine ladies'.

835
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,845
Doctor.

836
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:35,622
Doctor,

837
01:07:36,813 --> 01:07:40,224
you forgot your callipers.

838
01:07:45,734 --> 01:07:48,307
Gentlemen, Mr Hughes.

839
01:07:51,698 --> 01:07:57,443
Let us commence by calling this
Mammary Exhibit Number One.

840
01:07:57,547 --> 01:08:04,030
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage,

841
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:06,535
if I may, is

842
01:08:08,266 --> 01:08:12,413
five inches and quarter.
Now, if we move to Mammary Exhibit...

843
01:08:12,517 --> 01:08:14,053
Dateline Hollywoodland.

844
01:08:14,888 --> 01:08:17,464
Movie tycoon Howard Hughes
must have the greatest job in the land.

845
01:08:17,568 --> 01:08:21,592
Each and every night the lucky guy
has to escort a different beautiful woman

846
01:08:21,696 --> 01:08:25,677
to a different dazzling event.
The TWA king always talks up his airline

847
01:08:25,781 --> 01:08:28,645
as he escorts a succession...

848
01:08:30,696 --> 01:08:34,225
The Hercules, ladies and gentlemen.
The Hercules.

849
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:38,397
A plane, a boat, a flying city.

850
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:41,819
Now, don't forget. Every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.

851
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:45,572
Those men decide whether or not to fund
the plane, so I need them real happy.

852
01:08:45,676 --> 01:08:48,200
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.

853
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,911
What about the girls?
How are they in the bomb department?

854
01:08:51,015 --> 01:08:54,998
Well, let's put it this way.
It'll be a regular boob buffet.

855
01:08:55,102 --> 01:08:58,463
I don't think the gentlemen from the Air
Corps will have any trouble scoring tonight.

856
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:04,173
And inside, 700 brave American soldiers,
a dozen Sherman tanks,

857
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:09,343
all winging their way over the Atlantic,
free from the threats of the U-boats below.

858
01:09:09,447 --> 01:09:13,933
Could Jules Verne himself have ever
imagined anything so magnificent?

859
01:09:14,037 --> 01:09:17,893
Could he have imagined her mammoth
wingspan, longer than a football field?

860
01:09:17,997 --> 01:09:19,896
Don't you see how this demeans me?

861
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,903
Since when do you care about
the scandal rags?

862
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:25,859
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's like a slap in the face.

863
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:29,034
- Don't you understand that?
- That's overstating it just a bit.

864
01:09:29,138 --> 01:09:32,537
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine,

865
01:09:32,641 --> 01:09:35,633
and now Bette Davis, for God's sake.

866
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:42,684
Look. They're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.

867
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:45,685
Very nice.

868
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:50,346
Well, you're the one that said
that all men are predators, right?

869
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,389
I mean, it's all in Darwin.
Remember?

870
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:57,432
And am I to expect this behaviour
to continue after the wedding?

871
01:09:57,537 --> 01:10:04,069
What is really bothering you, Kate?
Is it the women? Or the publicity?

872
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:12,711
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?

873
01:10:19,513 --> 01:10:22,513
Don't you dare.

874
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:35,695
Yeah.

875
01:10:37,201 --> 01:10:40,892
No. Odie, this is not a good time.

876
01:10:40,997 --> 01:10:45,232
For Christ's sakes, we can't make the
Hercules if we don't have any aluminum.

877
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:48,527
Wait. No, no.
I can hear you better now.

878
01:10:48,631 --> 01:10:53,658
Look, you tell the War Production Board
that this is an essential strategic operation.

879
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:56,227
Odie, if they're giving aluminum
to Douglas, Northrop and Boeing,

880
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:58,371
they sure as hell
can give some to Hughes Aircraft.

881
01:10:58,476 --> 01:11:01,665
Don't set the ice cream...

882
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,484
Meantime, we've got to think
of something else.

883
01:11:03,588 --> 01:11:06,090
If we can't get aluminum,
we'll just have to find another way.

884
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:07,883
Christ, I don't know.
You tell me.

885
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:12,800
We'll find some alloy that works
just as well. Right. Look...

886
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,100
If we can't get any aluminum,
we'll just have to use wood.

887
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,305
You can't make
a 200-ton plane out of wood.

888
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:19,771
Why the hell not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?

889
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,752
- What do they use to make boats out of?
- Oak.

890
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:24,980
Think of the Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.

891
01:11:25,085 --> 01:11:28,358
Spanish galleons could weigh 1,200 tons.

892
01:11:28,462 --> 01:11:31,026
Good luck today.

893
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:34,450
We just have to find the right kind of wood.
Something light but strong.

894
01:11:34,554 --> 01:11:37,547
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.

895
01:11:47,893 --> 01:11:49,093
Catch.

896
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:55,679
From my farm.

897
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:58,730
If you like it,
I can get you a bushel.

898
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,084
Trouble with Mr Hughes?

899
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,549
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.

900
01:12:25,222 --> 01:12:27,298
That's the trouble.

901
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,570
Beautiful.

902
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:47,022
Don't you even take Christmas off?

903
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:49,899
Nice to see you, Bob.
Sorry, I've got grease on my hands.

904
01:12:50,003 --> 01:12:52,570
Have we got something to show you?

905
01:12:56,753 --> 01:13:02,453
Take a look. She's the XF-11
reconnaissance flier. Spy plane, really.

906
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:05,331
Designed every inch of her myself.

907
01:13:05,435 --> 01:13:07,582
She's got a top speed of 450,

908
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:10,506
which means she can outrun
anything they throw against her.

909
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:13,758
After the Japs stole my H-1 design
for their goddamn Zeros,

910
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:16,967
I figured I needed to do them one better.

911
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:20,389
Yeah. She's my Buck Rogers ship.

912
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:22,683
She's a looker.

913
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:24,855
OK, what have you got for me?

914
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:34,486
Jiminy Cricket.

915
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:38,323
Seating capacity for 60.
Wingspan, 123 feet.

916
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:41,783
Four double Cyclone engines.
Her ceiling's 25,000 feet.

917
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:45,206
- Gross weight?
- 86,000. Wing loading of 41 pounds.

918
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,210
So less drag on the plane in thinner air.

919
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:52,756
At high cruise power, you're looking
at a top speed of around 340.

920
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:57,468
Giving her a range of about 3,000 miles.

921
01:13:57,572 --> 01:14:00,601
- Cross-country.
- Nonstop.

922
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:03,638
Bob, you know something?

923
01:14:03,742 --> 01:14:06,442
You are a son of a bitch.

924
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:21,040
Bob, you got something on your suit.

925
01:14:22,297 --> 01:14:23,297
Yeah.

926
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:28,628
On your lapel there.
You got something on your lapel.

927
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,756
Right there, Bob.

928
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:37,007
You missed it.
Right there.

929
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,218
Clean it off, would you?

930
01:14:39,323 --> 01:14:41,923
Here. Thanks.

931
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:48,071
Now throw it away.

932
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:53,155
No, over there.

933
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:02,407
Thanks.
So, what do you call her?

934
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:04,784
The Constellation.
But we can change that.

935
01:15:04,889 --> 01:15:06,663
No, no, no.

936
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,428
It's pretty. I like her.

937
01:15:10,596 --> 01:15:14,586
So, what kind of deal can you give me?
What kind of deal can you give me?

938
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:17,252
We'll give you the first 40 planes
off the assembly line.

939
01:15:17,356 --> 01:15:19,838
That should give us
about two years exclusivity with her?

940
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:21,387
Hell, more than that.

941
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:25,554
United and American don't have
the imagination for a plane like this.

942
01:15:25,658 --> 01:15:28,772
Two years ahead of Juan Trippe, then.

943
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:37,075
- How much?
- 450,000 each.

944
01:15:37,706 --> 01:15:41,446
That's 18 million for the first 40.

945
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:47,000
Hell, TWA can't afford that.
The damn airline's flat broke.

946
01:15:48,675 --> 01:15:51,380
Guess I'll just have
to pay for them myself.

947
01:15:52,095 --> 01:15:55,209
Build them, Bob.
Send the bill to Noah Dietrich.

948
01:15:55,313 --> 01:15:57,050
And thank you.

949
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:02,632
Merry Christmas.

950
01:16:02,736 --> 01:16:06,360
You have just placed the largest order for
airplanes in the history of the damn planet.

951
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:09,102
Lockheed just sent us a bill for $18 million.

952
01:16:09,206 --> 01:16:12,770
Now now, don't get all hysterical on me,
Noah. It isn't good for you.

953
01:16:12,874 --> 01:16:16,561
- This is a lot of money for some planes.
- Yes. Yes, I know it's a lot of money.

954
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:20,318
It's too damn much. You think I've just got
$18 million in petty cash?

955
01:16:20,423 --> 01:16:22,490
I should have told you earlier.
It slipped my mind.

956
01:16:22,595 --> 01:16:25,201
- Slipped your mind? For God's sake.
- Right. Well, look...

957
01:16:25,306 --> 01:16:29,074
- How could $18 million slip your mind?
- I'll get back to you. Goodbye, now.

958
01:16:29,178 --> 01:16:32,424
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home?

959
01:16:36,682 --> 01:16:40,589
You're not one for tears
and, well, neither am I.

960
01:16:40,693 --> 01:16:44,137
So it's best to come out with it.

961
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:51,854
I've met someone.
I've fallen in love and I'm moving out.

962
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:58,730
If I could make it any more gentle, I would.

963
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:01,234
But I can't.

964
01:17:01,547 --> 01:17:05,205
So there we both are.

965
01:17:09,506 --> 01:17:11,454
Let's be honest.

966
01:17:11,558 --> 01:17:16,040
It's all been a grand adventure,
but it couldn't possibly last.

967
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:20,135
We're too alike, you and I.

968
01:17:22,144 --> 01:17:25,423
- You met someone?
- Someone more appropriate.

969
01:17:25,527 --> 01:17:27,728
To me, I mean.

970
01:17:30,402 --> 01:17:33,349
What does that mean,
more appropriate?

971
01:17:33,453 --> 01:17:38,019
Someone more attuned to my needs.

972
01:17:38,123 --> 01:17:41,736
Look at me, Katie.
Stop acting.

973
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:45,491
I'm not acting.

974
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:52,917
I wonder if you even know any more.

975
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,755
Don't be unkind.

976
01:18:02,559 --> 01:18:03,759
You...

977
01:18:05,655 --> 01:18:08,655
You want to go?

978
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:11,809
Go on.

979
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,848
Actresses are cheap in this town, darling.
I got a lot of money.

980
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:21,400
- Howard, please. This is beneath you.
- No, no, this is exactly me.

981
01:18:21,504 --> 01:18:24,404
You come in here out of the blue and
tell me you're leaving me just like that,

982
01:18:24,508 --> 01:18:26,733
and you have the nerve
to expect graciousness?

983
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:32,283
I expect a little maturity. I expect you
to face the situation like an adult who...

984
01:18:32,387 --> 01:18:36,243
Don't talk down to me.
Don't you ever talk down to me.

985
01:18:36,347 --> 01:18:39,712
You are a movie star, nothing more.

986
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:54,871
Don't answer it.

987
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:58,246
What is it, Howard?

988
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:00,350
Hey, Noah.

989
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:03,751
I need you to get to Penney's
and buy me new clothes.

990
01:20:03,855 --> 01:20:05,878
- Penney's isn't open.
- Shit.

991
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:10,297
- It's two in the morning.
- Yeah, that's right. Ah, well.

992
01:20:10,402 --> 01:20:11,886
First thing tomorrow, then, all right?

993
01:20:11,991 --> 01:20:15,010
I need two suits off the rack.
One light and one dark.

994
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:18,555
Three white shirts and three pairs
of white tennis shoes. You got that?

995
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:21,729
- Yeah.
- No, no. Make it Woolworths.

996
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:25,353
- Woolworths.
- No, no. Penney's. Penney's.

997
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:27,732
All right, then.

998
01:20:27,837 --> 01:20:31,320
I'll get into it as soon as I can, Howard.

999
01:20:31,425 --> 01:20:34,740
- Noah, do you have a recorder?
- No.

1000
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:38,366
- Are you recording this conversation?
- No.

1001
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:39,070
OK.

1002
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,668
I trust you.

1003
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:43,668
Howard...

1004
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:46,542
Listen, I need those suits
first thing tomorrow, all right?

1005
01:20:46,646 --> 01:20:47,833
- All right.
- Wait, wait.

1006
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:51,090
- Did I say Penney's or Woolworths?
- Penney's.

1007
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:54,935
- Better make it Sears.
- All right, then. Sears.

1008
01:20:58,443 --> 01:21:00,519
I'm sorry, honey.

1009
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,188
If I don't answer,
he'll just call back.

1010
01:21:25,762 --> 01:21:29,381
Stop there, if you please,
Miss Domergue.

1011
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:38,428
Have you had surgery, Miss Domergue?

1012
01:21:38,532 --> 01:21:39,132
No.

1013
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:44,153
Do you have scars of any kind?

1014
01:21:45,365 --> 01:21:45,965
No.

1015
01:21:48,577 --> 01:21:51,115
Wipe off your lipstick.

1016
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:57,989
That's much better.

1017
01:21:58,094 --> 01:22:03,211
Now, you understand that you'd be
under contract to me, personally?

1018
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:06,500
Do you know what that means?

1019
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:17,433
Turn around for me.

1020
01:22:24,696 --> 01:22:26,696
Very nice.

1021
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:29,441
You move well.

1022
01:22:31,745 --> 01:22:35,402
You live with your family, do you?

1023
01:22:35,506 --> 01:22:36,306
Yes.

1024
01:22:38,089 --> 01:22:40,489
That's nice.

1025
01:22:40,969 --> 01:22:43,909
Tell me something.

1026
01:22:44,014 --> 01:22:46,545
How old are you, Miss Domergue?

1027
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:49,863
15.

1028
01:22:54,476 --> 01:22:56,801
Holy mother of God.

1029
01:23:15,122 --> 01:23:19,239
Well, a car picks me up
every morning at eight, and off I go.

1030
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:25,161
I am getting my high-school diploma.
Howard thinks that education is important.

1031
01:23:25,265 --> 01:23:27,577
- That's right.
- And then after classes,

1032
01:23:27,681 --> 01:23:31,250
I'm off for elocution
and grooming and fittings.

1033
01:23:31,355 --> 01:23:33,422
Well, blow me down.

1034
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:36,966
Don't tell me Pan Am's
working out of the Cocoanut Grove now?

1035
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:39,008
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Juan.

1036
01:23:39,112 --> 01:23:40,758
Helen, good to see you.

1037
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:43,470
- How are you, Howard?
- Good, thanks.

1038
01:23:43,574 --> 01:23:47,390
- This is Miss Faith Domergue.
- Sit down. Now, what you doing out here?

1039
01:23:47,495 --> 01:23:50,479
Well, I'm out this way to meet
with Douglas about the DC-4.

1040
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:54,481
That's our new plane
and it is gonna be a pip, let me tell you.

1041
01:23:54,585 --> 01:23:58,024
- How's the Constellation coming?
- Good.

1042
01:23:58,128 --> 01:23:59,328
Great.

1043
01:24:00,675 --> 01:24:03,419
So, how about letting me steal a peek?

1044
01:24:05,255 --> 01:24:07,203
Don't think so.

1045
01:24:07,307 --> 01:24:11,161
You know, I should be cross with you.
You stole Ray Loewy from us.

1046
01:24:11,265 --> 01:24:13,128
He's doing our interior design.
That's right.

1047
01:24:13,232 --> 01:24:15,713
He was doing ours.

1048
01:24:17,267 --> 01:24:20,259
So, what are your colours?

1049
01:24:20,363 --> 01:24:22,145
Stop fishing.

1050
01:24:23,774 --> 01:24:27,930
So, you have buttons or zippers?

1051
01:24:28,034 --> 01:24:29,688
I'm sorry?

1052
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:33,310
Buttons or zippers?

1053
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:36,575
For the drapes on the sleeping berths.

1054
01:24:38,956 --> 01:24:40,556
Zippers.

1055
01:24:49,424 --> 01:24:51,024
Buttons?

1056
01:25:00,727 --> 01:25:03,802
So, I suppose you'll be
expanding on down to Mexico.

1057
01:25:03,907 --> 01:25:07,094
- Why do you say that?
- Well, your range is 3,000 miles.

1058
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:10,139
I would imagine you'd expand
from Los Angeles to Mexico.

1059
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:13,516
- And maybe on down to South America.
- Hey, that's a good idea.

1060
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:17,067
- Anyone got a pen?
- Or across the Atlantic.

1061
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:22,692
Now, honey, you've had enough of this
ice cream. You give me that spoon.

1062
01:25:22,796 --> 01:25:26,207
You don't want to get your gloves all sticky.

1063
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:29,293
Isn't that too far?

1064
01:25:34,261 --> 01:25:37,926
New York to Newfoundland...

1065
01:25:39,182 --> 01:25:41,673
to Ireland...

1066
01:25:45,397 --> 01:25:47,197
to Paris.

1067
01:25:54,114 --> 01:25:55,114
Well,

1068
01:25:56,372 --> 01:26:00,567
Pan Am welcomes you.
We're overbooked as it is.

1069
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:04,319
It's such a burden doing it all on your own,
let me tell you.

1070
01:26:04,423 --> 01:26:06,614
So, when's the Connie gonna be ready?

1071
01:26:06,718 --> 01:26:09,407
- Next year, maybe. DC-4?
- Next year.

1072
01:26:09,512 --> 01:26:12,784
Well, we look forward to her, then.

1073
01:26:12,888 --> 01:26:15,837
And I to the Connie.

1074
01:26:16,678 --> 01:26:20,585
I've ordered the next 40 after you.

1075
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:22,003
It's Miss?

1076
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:23,654
- Domergue.
- Domergue. Yes, of course.

1077
01:26:23,758 --> 01:26:26,302
Now, was that a rumba or a samba
you were doing out there, my dear?

1078
01:26:26,407 --> 01:26:29,343
- It was a samba.
- A samba, yes.

1079
01:26:29,447 --> 01:26:32,775
Howard, I never knew
you were such a good dancer.

1080
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:35,854
Helen, Jack.

1081
01:26:37,282 --> 01:26:40,690
Good going, boss. You just gave away
our entire postwar strategy.

1082
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:42,689
- He can't stop us.
- He's Pan Am, Howard.

1083
01:26:42,793 --> 01:26:45,076
He can stop anything.

1084
01:26:46,792 --> 01:26:48,575
Waiter, give me
the largest Scotch you've got.

1085
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:53,289
I don't know what in the hell you're
so goddamn giddy about. Excuse me.

1086
01:28:44,409 --> 01:28:45,409
Jack.

1087
01:28:45,962 --> 01:28:48,570
All right. I want you to get in touch
with Mr Joyce and Mr Berg.

1088
01:28:48,674 --> 01:28:49,884
Those are my boys in Washington.

1089
01:28:49,988 --> 01:28:52,449
Set up a meeting with Jesse Jones,
he's the secretary of commerce.

1090
01:28:52,553 --> 01:28:53,949
- Old golfing buddy.
- Slow down.

1091
01:28:54,053 --> 01:28:56,446
We're gonna need terminals
in both Ireland and France,

1092
01:28:56,551 --> 01:28:57,975
and I want to get tax breaks from them.

1093
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,038
If that shit-ass thinks that he owns
the entire goddamn world,

1094
01:29:01,143 --> 01:29:03,418
- he's got another think coming.
- Pan Am owns Europe, you know.

1095
01:29:03,522 --> 01:29:04,919
He's smart.
We ought to think about Mexico.

1096
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,025
To hell with Mexico, Jack.

1097
01:29:06,129 --> 01:29:09,003
No one airline should have
a monopoly on flying the Atlantic.

1098
01:29:09,107 --> 01:29:12,592
For Christ's sakes, it isn't fair. Look,
he owns Pan Am. He owns Congress.

1099
01:29:12,696 --> 01:29:16,678
He owns the Civil Aeronautics Board,
but he does not own the sky.

1100
01:29:16,782 --> 01:29:19,768
We are in a street fight with that
son of a bitch now, and I'm not gonna lose.

1101
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,224
I've been fighting high-hat, Ivy-League
pricks like him my whole goddamn life.

1102
01:29:23,328 --> 01:29:27,102
And listen, fire Ray Loewy.
You goddamn heard me? Fire Ray Loewy.

1103
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:30,526
He's spying for Trippe. That shit-heel
knew all about the goddamn buttons.

1104
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:34,620
Spies in my midst, Jack.
Spies in my midst.

1105
01:29:49,641 --> 01:29:53,093
- Hello, Howard.
- Roland.

1106
01:29:54,438 --> 01:29:57,889
So, what can I do for you?

1107
01:30:00,986 --> 01:30:05,020
I want all the pictures you have
of Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

1108
01:30:05,124 --> 01:30:08,728
All the negatives.
And I want you to kill the story.

1109
01:30:08,832 --> 01:30:12,235
Howard, he's a married man.
He's a Catholic.

1110
01:30:12,339 --> 01:30:16,280
They're both movie stars.
Fair game all around.

1111
01:30:23,091 --> 01:30:26,166
My office knows where I am, Howard.

1112
01:30:26,271 --> 01:30:29,169
I'm not gonna kill you, Roland.

1113
01:30:29,274 --> 01:30:31,720
I don't do that.

1114
01:30:35,938 --> 01:30:38,725
- How much?
- Not for sale.

1115
01:30:41,485 --> 01:30:43,285
How much?

1116
01:30:44,287 --> 01:30:46,887
Not for sale.

1117
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:54,568
You ever cheat on your wife, Roland?

1118
01:30:54,672 --> 01:30:57,695
You ever screw a coloured girl?

1119
01:30:57,799 --> 01:31:01,209
You ever steal anything?
You ever hurt anyone?

1120
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:05,329
Good night, Howard.

1121
01:31:05,434 --> 01:31:09,755
You ever go to
a Communist Party meeting, Roland?

1122
01:31:18,188 --> 01:31:20,188
TWA stock.

1123
01:31:21,406 --> 01:31:23,206
How much?

1124
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:27,936
- 50,000 shares.
- Ten.

1125
01:31:30,867 --> 01:31:32,867
All right.

1126
01:31:35,497 --> 01:31:37,234
This isn't gonna be that easy.

1127
01:31:37,339 --> 01:31:40,907
He's been making big contributions
on both sides of the aisle.

1128
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:44,616
And Jack Frye is out there lobbying
everybody in town.

1129
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:48,749
The French and British ambassadors
are all lined up on his side now.

1130
01:31:48,853 --> 01:31:52,878
I'm telling you, TWA is serious
about going international.

1131
01:31:52,982 --> 01:31:57,757
OK. Point, Mr Hughes.
Very well. You know what I think?

1132
01:31:57,861 --> 01:32:00,512
I think it's time for you to introduce
the Community Airline Bill

1133
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:02,928
on the floor of the Senate.

1134
01:32:03,032 --> 01:32:05,804
- Is it done?
- My people are finishing it right now.

1135
01:32:05,909 --> 01:32:12,023
I also have to get you on the committee
investigating the national defence.

1136
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:16,234
On the committee or chairman?

1137
01:32:16,338 --> 01:32:19,109
You know, I could be
much more effective as chairman.

1138
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:22,986
It's a great public platform.
You know, it generates a lot of press.

1139
01:32:23,091 --> 01:32:25,034
Wasn't Truman chairman
of that committee?

1140
01:32:25,138 --> 01:32:29,076
Yeah, right. Now he's vice president.
Look what he did with it.

1141
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:31,980
No, I think...

1142
01:32:32,105 --> 01:32:34,581
I think chairman.

1143
01:32:34,685 --> 01:32:38,044
What do you think?

1144
01:32:38,148 --> 01:32:40,923
- Chairman. That is interesting.
- Yeah.

1145
01:32:41,027 --> 01:32:44,512
Let me show you these specs
for the DC-4.

1146
01:32:44,616 --> 01:32:48,348
Ava, what do you think about
"Trans World Airlines"?

1147
01:32:48,452 --> 01:32:50,931
"Transcontinental and Western"
just doesn't fit any more.

1148
01:32:51,035 --> 01:32:53,811
Now that we're international,
we need a name that reflects that.

1149
01:32:53,915 --> 01:32:56,772
"Trans World" is good.
Kind of peppy.

1150
01:32:56,876 --> 01:32:59,076
TWA. Right?

1151
01:32:59,544 --> 01:33:02,490
Keep the same initials. That way you
don't need to repaint any of the planes.

1152
01:33:02,595 --> 01:33:05,780
That's you, always pinching pennies.

1153
01:33:05,884 --> 01:33:07,955
Hand me my wrap.

1154
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:24,226
Knock it off.

1155
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,895
I have something for you.

1156
01:33:33,999 --> 01:33:35,999
Stay here.

1157
01:33:41,331 --> 01:33:44,111
- What the hell is this?
- It's a present.

1158
01:33:44,215 --> 01:33:47,323
Go on and open it.

1159
01:33:47,427 --> 01:33:50,828
A box of trash.
You shouldn't have.

1160
01:33:50,933 --> 01:33:53,498
Keep looking.
Keep looking.

1161
01:33:57,472 --> 01:34:00,464
It's a Kashmiri sapphire.
Best in the world.

1162
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,923
I had my boys all over the damn globe
looking for this.

1163
01:34:03,027 --> 01:34:05,799
- Why?
- Because.

1164
01:34:05,904 --> 01:34:09,760
Look.
It matches your eyes.

1165
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:12,346
I am not for sale.

1166
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:14,560
For Christ sakes, Ava,
it's just a present.

1167
01:34:14,665 --> 01:34:18,019
You can't buy me, Howard,
so stop trying.

1168
01:34:18,123 --> 01:34:21,648
Don't buy me any more diamonds or
sapphires or any other goddamn thing.

1169
01:34:21,752 --> 01:34:24,944
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

1170
01:34:25,048 --> 01:34:26,370
Jesus, Ava.

1171
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:30,407
It's bad enough I have to endure
those filthy gym shoes of yours,

1172
01:34:30,512 --> 01:34:35,495
but then I get all dolled up and we have
to go out in this old jalopy without a hood.

1173
01:34:35,599 --> 01:34:38,791
Ava, will you marry me?

1174
01:34:38,895 --> 01:34:40,210
No, Howard.

1175
01:34:40,314 --> 01:34:44,425
- Why not, for heaven's sake?
- In the first place, I don't love you.

1176
01:34:44,529 --> 01:34:46,967
In the second place, I'm still married.

1177
01:34:47,071 --> 01:34:51,848
Look, you got girls stashed all over town.
You got a damn harem just at the Bel-Air.

1178
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,904
Why don't you marry
one of your bungalow girls?

1179
01:34:54,029 --> 01:34:56,312
Those are employees.
I'm not going to marry an employee.

1180
01:34:56,417 --> 01:34:59,319
Jesus Christ, how would that look?

1181
01:35:04,915 --> 01:35:07,406
Good Lord, what is going on?

1182
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:13,334
- Oh, my God.
- Goddamn it.

1183
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:16,041
Faith.

1184
01:35:16,893 --> 01:35:18,955
- Faith. What the hell?
- Look out.

1185
01:35:19,059 --> 01:35:22,008
Goddamn, what the hell are you doing?

1186
01:35:24,851 --> 01:35:27,715
- You OK, lady?
- What are you doing with her?

1187
01:35:27,819 --> 01:35:30,554
We're going to dinner, that's all.
Now get out of there.

1188
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:32,719
Get that crazy bitch away from me.

1189
01:35:32,823 --> 01:35:36,225
- Don't you love me any more?
- Course I love you, pork chop.

1190
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:38,558
- Ava, look over here.
- Howard.

1191
01:35:38,662 --> 01:35:40,899
- Hey.
- Come on, Howard.

1192
01:35:44,246 --> 01:35:46,550
Juan Trippe is working with
that goddamn Senator Brewster now.

1193
01:35:46,654 --> 01:35:47,482
They're after you, Howard.

1194
01:35:47,587 --> 01:35:50,740
If the Community Airline Bill becomes law,
we are finished, my friend.

1195
01:35:50,844 --> 01:35:53,140
Pan Am will have a legal monopoly
on international travel.

1196
01:35:53,244 --> 01:35:55,616
How can they justify it, Jack?
It's un-American.

1197
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,062
Senator Brewster's saying that
nationalised foreign carriers,

1198
01:35:58,166 --> 01:35:59,538
like Air France and Lufthansa,

1199
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:02,500
can offer lower rates
cos they don't have to compete, right?

1200
01:36:02,604 --> 01:36:04,777
So, hey, let's just get rid of
all that messy competition

1201
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:07,759
and have a nationalised airline of our own,
and why don't we make it Pan Am?

1202
01:36:07,863 --> 01:36:09,636
I'm not kowtowing to Washington
or anyone else.

1203
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,716
- Howard, I need you up here.
- One sec, Odie.

1204
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,595
Look, we are Trans World Airlines,
all right?

1205
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:19,265
Get me something with a circle or a globe
or something round, for God's sake.

1206
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:22,106
Speak up. I know.
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

1207
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:25,109
I'm not making a single cut.
Tell him I'm releasing without a seal.

1208
01:36:25,213 --> 01:36:26,941
All right.
We gotta go public with this.

1209
01:36:27,045 --> 01:36:29,051
I'm gonna talk to Hearst,
see what press he can give me,

1210
01:36:29,155 --> 01:36:31,136
but sooner or later it's gonna come down
to a vote in the Senate,

1211
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:32,367
so we gotta get senators on our side.

1212
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:35,078
- What do you want me to do?
- Do what Trippe does, for Christ sake.

1213
01:36:35,182 --> 01:36:36,450
Set up some offshore operations.

1214
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:38,811
See who's up for re-election.
Let's start making donations.

1215
01:36:38,915 --> 01:36:42,291
- So, you want me to bribe senators?
- I don't want them bribed, Jack.

1216
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:45,001
I want it done legally.
I want them bought.

1217
01:36:45,106 --> 01:36:47,027
And put a team of investigators
on Senator Brewster.

1218
01:36:47,132 --> 01:36:49,633
I need to know everything there is to know
about that shit bag.

1219
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:52,720
Where he goes, what he says
and who he screws.

1220
01:36:52,824 --> 01:36:56,018
- Get into it right now, Jack.
- You got it.

1221
01:37:02,532 --> 01:37:05,284
Just give me a second.

1222
01:37:06,203 --> 01:37:09,816
- All right. What do you need?
- Rudder and elevators.

1223
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,737
These are fine. Have Simon and Pete get
back to me on the hydraulic assemblies.

1224
01:37:14,842 --> 01:37:18,615
- We need a secondary system here.
- OK.

1225
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,579
And listen, we need to take
another look at the wheel.

1226
01:37:21,683 --> 01:37:26,167
- Jesus. The damn wheel?
- Yeah. It just doesn't feel right.

1227
01:37:26,271 --> 01:37:30,466
Christ almighty, you've seen 8,000
goddamn wheels. Choose one, please.

1228
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:32,298
- Just one of them.
- I know. I know.

1229
01:37:32,402 --> 01:37:34,798
- This one?
- I know. This one...

1230
01:37:34,902 --> 01:37:37,013
This one's pretty close.

1231
01:37:37,117 --> 01:37:39,185
Pretty close.

1232
01:38:14,771 --> 01:38:15,771
Odie?

1233
01:38:17,112 --> 01:38:19,805
That man sweeping up over there.

1234
01:38:19,909 --> 01:38:23,059
Does he work for me?
I mean, have you seen him before?

1235
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:25,906
Name's Nick.
Something like that.

1236
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:29,825
Why's he looking at me?

1237
01:38:31,955 --> 01:38:34,031
I don't know.

1238
01:38:35,292 --> 01:38:38,699
Fire him. And make sure they use
damp brooms from now on.

1239
01:38:38,804 --> 01:38:42,203
Respiratory diseases are expensive, and
I don't want a bunch of damn lawsuits.

1240
01:38:42,307 --> 01:38:45,166
OK. But can we at least proceed
with the instrument panel we discussed?

1241
01:38:45,271 --> 01:38:46,334
The tool shop's ready to go.

1242
01:38:46,438 --> 01:38:48,357
- No. I wanna see the blueprints again.
- Howard,

1243
01:38:48,461 --> 01:38:50,961
the deadline is now completely unrealistic.

1244
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:53,755
At this rate, the war is gonna be over
by the time she's done.

1245
01:38:53,859 --> 01:38:56,299
Now, I need you here
to help consult on vital decisions

1246
01:38:56,404 --> 01:38:58,095
and you're off dealing with movies.

1247
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:01,287
You got a thousand goddamn workers
waiting for you to make a decision here...

1248
01:39:01,391 --> 01:39:02,975
Hey. Odie.

1249
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:06,561
Take it easy, all right?
I understand you're under a lot of pressure,

1250
01:39:06,665 --> 01:39:11,895
but it's gonna do me no good if you
crack up on me like that. All right? Look.

1251
01:39:11,999 --> 01:39:14,315
Take a couple of hours off, all right?

1252
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:16,362
- You relax a little.
- OK.

1253
01:39:16,466 --> 01:39:19,072
- See your wife.
- OK.

1254
01:39:19,176 --> 01:39:21,176
All right.

1255
01:39:21,427 --> 01:39:25,205
- Be sure to show me all the blueprints.
- All right.

1256
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,751
Show me all the blueprints.

1257
01:39:28,971 --> 01:39:31,040
Show me all the blueprints.

1258
01:39:31,145 --> 01:39:36,211
I'm serious, now.
Show me all the blueprints.

1259
01:39:36,315 --> 01:39:38,324
Show me all the blue...
Show me all the blueprints.

1260
01:39:38,428 --> 01:39:41,093
- Howard...
- Show me all the blueprints.

1261
01:39:41,197 --> 01:39:43,350
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

1262
01:39:43,454 --> 01:39:47,225
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

1263
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:50,064
I want to get this done right,
so show me all the blueprints.

1264
01:39:50,168 --> 01:39:51,729
Show me all the blueprints.

1265
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:53,860
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

1266
01:39:53,964 --> 01:39:56,363
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

1267
01:39:56,467 --> 01:39:58,859
- Show me all the blueprints.
- Howard.

1268
01:39:58,963 --> 01:40:02,375
Show me all the blueprints.

1269
01:40:02,588 --> 01:40:06,537
Show me all the blueprints.

1270
01:40:06,758 --> 01:40:09,878
Show me all the blueprints.

1271
01:40:31,033 --> 01:40:33,233
Quarantine.

1272
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:34,928
Q...

1273
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,010
U...

1274
01:40:38,462 --> 01:40:39,262
A...

1275
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:42,102
R...

1276
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:44,811
A...

1277
01:40:46,095 --> 01:40:46,895
N...

1278
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:48,692
T...

1279
01:40:50,307 --> 01:40:51,107
I...

1280
01:40:52,143 --> 01:40:52,943
N...

1281
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:58,960
E.

1282
01:41:03,398 --> 01:41:05,474
Quarantine.

1283
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:46,677
General McEwan. Colonel Bertrang.
Thanks for coming down.

1284
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:52,232
- Odie, you reading me OK?
- Yeah, Howard. You're A-OK.

1285
01:41:56,034 --> 01:42:01,455
All right, flight controls are active.
She's all yours.

1286
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:10,497
She's spotless, Odie.
No wiggle on the wheel or throttles.

1287
01:42:10,601 --> 01:42:12,667
Take it easy.

1288
01:42:29,318 --> 01:42:33,141
- How does she sound, Howard?
- She's whispering to me, buddy.

1289
01:42:33,245 --> 01:42:36,025
All right, make her sing.

1290
01:42:55,886 --> 01:42:59,332
Well, Odie, she can fly.
Congratulations.

1291
01:42:59,436 --> 01:43:04,631
I'm glad to hear it. Retract landing gear and
climb to 5,000 feet on a heading of 2-7-0.

1292
01:43:04,735 --> 01:43:11,181
Retracting landing gear and climbing
to 5,000 feet on a heading 2-7-0.

1293
01:43:15,197 --> 01:43:17,477
- Jesus, she's fast.
- What's your airspeed, Howard?

1294
01:43:17,581 --> 01:43:21,353
- 292.
- All right, take her back to 200.

1295
01:43:21,457 --> 01:43:23,078
No damn way.

1296
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,551
All right, Howard, we gotta bring her home.

1297
01:43:50,655 --> 01:43:53,973
Scheduled time of one hour and 45
minutes has elapsed. Set course for 0-9-0.

1298
01:43:54,077 --> 01:43:59,141
- Give me ten more minutes. Roger that.
- Negative. Howard, bring her home.

1299
01:43:59,245 --> 01:44:00,434
OK. OK.

1300
01:44:00,538 --> 01:44:05,484
Setting course for 0-9-0.

1301
01:44:05,588 --> 01:44:07,739
Preparing to descend.

1302
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:14,710
- Jesus.
- What is it, Howard?

1303
01:44:15,757 --> 01:44:19,414
The right wing just dipped.
I'm losing starboard engine.

1304
01:44:19,518 --> 01:44:22,458
Increasing power to 2800 rpm.

1305
01:44:22,562 --> 01:44:24,210
Cutting back.

1306
01:44:24,314 --> 01:44:26,514
Increasing starboard engine only.

1307
01:44:27,603 --> 01:44:30,760
Cutting back.
I'm losing altitude.

1308
01:44:30,864 --> 01:44:34,385
Howard, check starboard engine
manifold pressure.

1309
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,809
- It's good, but rpms are low.
- Are both starboard props turning?

1310
01:44:37,913 --> 01:44:39,513
Hold on.

1311
01:44:39,707 --> 01:44:42,728
It looks like they are, but she's pulling me
back and starboard, Odie.

1312
01:44:42,832 --> 01:44:46,521
- How bad is your cross control?
- I'm at full left rudder and full left aileron,

1313
01:44:46,626 --> 01:44:49,069
but she won't stay level.
Goddamn it.

1314
01:44:49,173 --> 01:44:52,157
- Howard, give us your position.
- 2,000 feet over...

1315
01:44:52,262 --> 01:44:56,325
Oh, Christ, I don't know.
Beverly Hills. 1,500 feet.

1316
01:44:56,429 --> 01:44:58,250
We're going down.

1317
01:44:59,134 --> 01:45:02,747
I'm gonna try for the Wilshire Country
Club. Ninth hole. You reading me?

1318
01:45:02,851 --> 01:45:06,891
Wilshire Country Club. Copy that.
Howard, reduce engines to one thousand.

1319
01:45:07,517 --> 01:45:09,965
I'm going down.

1320
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:12,553
I'm not gonna make it, buddy.

1321
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:19,941
Goddamn it.

1322
01:47:23,153 --> 01:47:26,644
Is there anyone else inside?
Is there anyone else?

1323
01:47:26,748 --> 01:47:27,348
No.

1324
01:47:32,246 --> 01:47:35,192
I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator.

1325
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,896
Come on.

1326
01:47:44,591 --> 01:47:47,832
Every inch of wiring and fluid connection...

1327
01:47:47,936 --> 01:47:50,625
He has burns to 78 per cent of his body.

1328
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:53,797
Nine ribs are shattered.
Not broken, shattered.

1329
01:47:53,902 --> 01:47:58,426
As are his nose, his chin, his cheek,
his left knee, his left elbow.

1330
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:01,635
He has 60 lacerations on his face
to the bone.

1331
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:04,597
His chest was crushed,
so his left lung has collapsed

1332
01:48:04,701 --> 01:48:09,146
and his heart has shifted entirely
to the right side of his chest cavity.

1333
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:11,144
Jesus, God.

1334
01:48:11,248 --> 01:48:14,606
He's getting blood transfusions now, but...

1335
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:18,196
- Whose blood?
- I'm sorry?

1336
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,616
- Whose blood?
- From our stock.

1337
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,576
He's not gonna like that.

1338
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:29,371
Mr Dietrich, I doubt he's ever
gonna like or dislike anything again.

1339
01:48:29,476 --> 01:48:31,842
I'm terribly sorry.

1340
01:49:00,081 --> 01:49:02,068
Orange juice.

1341
01:49:02,172 --> 01:49:03,572
It's...

1342
01:49:05,012 --> 01:49:08,253
It's not fresh from the kitchen, so I...

1343
01:49:09,299 --> 01:49:13,427
I have them make it here so I can see.

1344
01:49:18,516 --> 01:49:20,592
Look at me.

1345
01:49:23,104 --> 01:49:26,800
I'm a monster.
Yeah.

1346
01:49:26,904 --> 01:49:30,600
Orange juice has nutritional value.

1347
01:49:31,654 --> 01:49:36,983
There's some flies
outside my window, though.

1348
01:49:37,087 --> 01:49:38,087
So...

1349
01:49:40,872 --> 01:49:42,948
little Howard likes...

1350
01:49:44,876 --> 01:49:46,276
citrus.

1351
01:49:47,927 --> 01:49:49,997
Don't he just?

1352
01:49:52,926 --> 01:49:54,526
Tell me.

1353
01:49:56,271 --> 01:50:00,125
An oil seal ripped off
the starboard rear propeller.

1354
01:50:00,229 --> 01:50:04,132
When the pressure dropped,
the prop reversed pitch.

1355
01:50:04,236 --> 01:50:06,427
Do you understand me?

1356
01:50:06,531 --> 01:50:11,512
Howard, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this now, but there's something else.

1357
01:50:11,616 --> 01:50:14,067
- You following me?
- Yeah.

1358
01:50:15,865 --> 01:50:21,692
The Air Force cancelled
the contract on the Hercules.

1359
01:50:21,796 --> 01:50:27,487
The war's over now,
and they say they don't need it any more.

1360
01:50:27,592 --> 01:50:32,203
I have to know what you want me to do.
Should I release the staff?

1361
01:50:32,307 --> 01:50:34,307
How far...

1362
01:50:34,805 --> 01:50:37,755
from finishing?

1363
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:41,671
- About six months.
- No, no.

1364
01:50:41,776 --> 01:50:43,576
In money.

1365
01:50:47,022 --> 01:50:51,102
Seven million.
Maybe more.

1366
01:50:56,823 --> 01:50:58,623
Build it.

1367
01:50:59,752 --> 01:51:02,752
Build it, Odie.

1368
01:51:03,587 --> 01:51:04,987
Howard,

1369
01:51:05,715 --> 01:51:09,741
a Constellation crashed
outside Reading, Pennsylvania.

1370
01:51:09,845 --> 01:51:13,703
The Civil Aeronautics Board
has grounded the whole fleet.

1371
01:51:23,641 --> 01:51:29,727
You know, Juan Trippe sent me flowers.

1372
01:51:31,816 --> 01:51:33,892
Take a look.

1373
01:51:37,405 --> 01:51:42,311
- What did you do with all the others?
- I had them taken out.

1374
01:51:42,415 --> 01:51:45,613
They attract aphids.

1375
01:51:46,623 --> 01:51:52,033
Aphids are...
They're just awful little creatures.

1376
01:51:52,138 --> 01:51:53,338
But...

1377
01:51:56,216 --> 01:51:58,292
But these ones...

1378
01:51:59,469 --> 01:52:03,597
I wanted to see these ones every day.

1379
01:52:10,689 --> 01:52:13,763
Can white elephants really fly?
That's everybody's question.

1380
01:52:13,868 --> 01:52:16,638
It's the hull of the world's
mightiest airplane,

1381
01:52:16,742 --> 01:52:19,100
a flying boat built
by Howard Hughes.

1382
01:52:19,204 --> 01:52:23,353
220 feet long, it towers higher
than a five-storey building.

1383
01:52:23,458 --> 01:52:27,524
Power lines have to be cut as it starts
the trip from Culver City, California,

1384
01:52:27,628 --> 01:52:29,775
to the Pacific, 30 miles away.

1385
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:33,199
Moving the 60-ton load
is quite an engineering problem.

1386
01:52:33,303 --> 01:52:37,240
But you gotta ask, "Was anything this big
ever supposed to fly?"

1387
01:52:37,344 --> 01:52:41,874
There goes one wing section.
160 feet long with four engine housings.

1388
01:52:41,978 --> 01:52:45,377
Double that, and you've got
some idea of the wing spread.

1389
01:52:45,482 --> 01:52:49,637
An airplane that challenges
a mountain for sheer size.

1390
01:52:56,401 --> 01:52:58,721
How long can they keep us grounded?

1391
01:52:58,825 --> 01:53:02,228
Till they finish investigating
the Reading crash. Could be months.

1392
01:53:02,332 --> 01:53:06,979
Jesus. You're already running a
$14 million deficit. How you gonna afford...

1393
01:53:07,083 --> 01:53:09,398
We go international,
we'll make it up.

1394
01:53:09,503 --> 01:53:12,156
Look, Brewster's CAB bill
just isn't going away.

1395
01:53:12,261 --> 01:53:14,846
That bill passes and you bought
all these goddamn planes for nothing.

1396
01:53:14,951 --> 01:53:16,244
- We're fighting the CAB bill.
- Yeah.

1397
01:53:16,348 --> 01:53:18,658
Meanwhile, how do you suggest
we keep TWA flying?

1398
01:53:18,762 --> 01:53:20,644
And don't say, "Just go to Toolco,"
this time.

1399
01:53:20,748 --> 01:53:23,188
As it is we're pumping every damn cent
we have into the Hercules,

1400
01:53:23,292 --> 01:53:26,415
which, I might add,
the Air Force doesn't even want any more.

1401
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:29,340
Now look, Howard, I'm glad Jack here
is feeling so sunny about things,

1402
01:53:29,444 --> 01:53:30,362
but I've seen the books.

1403
01:53:30,466 --> 01:53:33,261
And I'm telling it to you straight,
I'm not just crying wolf this time,

1404
01:53:33,365 --> 01:53:36,387
we're in serious trouble.
You've got to make a choice.

1405
01:53:36,491 --> 01:53:41,857
You want to be bankrupted by
the big plane or by the big airline?

1406
01:53:48,787 --> 01:53:52,527
Go see Thomas Parkinson
at the Equitable in New York.

1407
01:53:52,631 --> 01:53:57,740
Get a loan against all the TWA equipment
and capital. Use the planes as collateral.

1408
01:53:57,845 --> 01:54:02,289
Hell, use the desks, use the pens,
use everything we got.

1409
01:54:02,393 --> 01:54:07,123
- Try to get me 40 million.
- And if TWA defaults on the loan?

1410
01:54:07,227 --> 01:54:10,342
Well, then Juan Trippe buys us cheap.

1411
01:54:12,644 --> 01:54:15,719
Under my bed. You put
a goddamn microphone under my bed.

1412
01:54:15,823 --> 01:54:18,050
Honey, listen to me.
I am concerned about you, baby.

1413
01:54:18,155 --> 01:54:21,679
- I just want to make sure you're OK.
- And who is in that car?

1414
01:54:21,783 --> 01:54:24,180
That goddamn car
has been with me 24 hours a day.

1415
01:54:24,285 --> 01:54:26,183
That car is there for your protection.

1416
01:54:26,288 --> 01:54:29,729
The only one I need protection from is you,
you sick bastard.

1417
01:54:29,833 --> 01:54:31,481
You don't own me, Howard.

1418
01:54:31,586 --> 01:54:34,737
I'm not one of your teenage whores,
and I'm not some damn airplane.

1419
01:54:34,841 --> 01:54:36,908
Now look, honey,
I'll have them take all the bugs out.

1420
01:54:37,012 --> 01:54:39,285
You just have to understand
that I need to know where you are.

1421
01:54:39,389 --> 01:54:41,995
- Why?
- Because I worry about you, that's why.

1422
01:54:42,099 --> 01:54:43,899
Bullshit.

1423
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:49,886
What do you mean, all the bugs?

1424
01:54:54,811 --> 01:54:57,516
What do you mean, all the bugs?

1425
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:01,764
There's more.

1426
01:55:01,868 --> 01:55:03,668
How many?

1427
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:06,140
I don't know, 12.
12, maybe.

1428
01:55:06,244 --> 01:55:10,644
And on the telephones.

1429
01:55:10,795 --> 01:55:14,481
Oh, Christ, Howard, on the telephone?

1430
01:55:14,585 --> 01:55:16,234
You listen to my phone calls?

1431
01:55:16,339 --> 01:55:20,195
No, no, no, honey. I would never do that.
I'd never do that. I...

1432
01:55:20,299 --> 01:55:23,462
I just read the transcripts, that's all.

1433
01:55:27,844 --> 01:55:30,124
What do you want to know, Howard?

1434
01:55:30,229 --> 01:55:32,458
Was I screwing Artie Shaw last night?

1435
01:55:32,562 --> 01:55:35,337
Was I screwing Sinatra the night before?
You bet.

1436
01:55:35,441 --> 01:55:38,094
Everyone told me you were
a goddamn lunatic but I didn't listen.

1437
01:55:38,198 --> 01:55:41,179
It's no wonder Kate Hepburn
dumped your demented ass.

1438
01:55:41,283 --> 01:55:43,231
Shut your goddamn mouth.

1439
01:55:47,989 --> 01:55:51,109
Get out, you pathetic freak.

1440
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:00,350
Get out.

1441
01:56:00,885 --> 01:56:02,825
Is everything all right, sir?

1442
01:56:02,929 --> 01:56:06,124
Take out all the bugs.

1443
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,581
Except for the one on the bedroom phone.

1444
01:56:09,685 --> 01:56:12,762
Sir, the FBI are at the house.

1445
01:56:13,765 --> 01:56:16,726
This is outrageous. Everything in these
offices is the private property

1446
01:56:16,851 --> 01:56:19,843
of Hughes Productions.
My legal counsel is on the way...

1447
01:56:19,947 --> 01:56:23,888
Federal warrant.
Don't interfere with this search, sir.

1448
01:56:43,044 --> 01:56:46,368
Dateline Los Angeles.
Howard Hughes has a new house guest.

1449
01:56:46,473 --> 01:56:50,243
No, it's not another beautiful starlet
this time. It's the FBI.

1450
01:56:50,347 --> 01:56:51,958
Noah, you have got to help, all right?

1451
01:56:52,063 --> 01:56:54,373
This is the tenth goddamn time
they have been here.

1452
01:56:54,478 --> 01:56:57,963
Rumour has it that federal agents working
for Senator Ralph Owen Brewster

1453
01:56:58,068 --> 01:57:01,966
have practically taken up residence
in the aviation mogul's Hollywood home.

1454
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:06,764
Look, they are touching things.
Noah, Noah, they are touching things.

1455
01:57:06,868 --> 01:57:10,894
Just keep yourself calm and I'll be
down there as soon as I can, Howard.

1456
01:57:10,998 --> 01:57:13,859
Howard?
Howard?

1457
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,131
Howard, hello.

1458
01:57:41,236 --> 01:57:44,590
- Owen, nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Come on inside.

1459
01:57:44,694 --> 01:57:47,303
- Emma, you can start the lunch now.
- Yes, sir.

1460
01:57:47,408 --> 01:57:51,973
Well, really lovely room.
Nicely decorated.

1461
01:57:52,077 --> 01:57:53,936
Thank you.
Here, have a seat.

1462
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,408
- Thanks.
- Thanks for coming by.

1463
01:57:55,533 --> 01:57:58,563
I just thought you and I should have
a chance to talk privately.

1464
01:57:58,668 --> 01:58:01,692
You know, outside the office.

1465
01:58:01,796 --> 01:58:03,196
Well...

1466
01:58:04,553 --> 01:58:06,582
I appreciate that, Owen.

1467
01:58:13,885 --> 01:58:19,546
So, you're coming out pretty strong
against the CAB bill.

1468
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:24,924
- You're coming on pretty strong for it.
- Well, it's my bill, Howard. You know?

1469
01:58:25,028 --> 01:58:27,719
Look, I believe sincerely that

1470
01:58:27,823 --> 01:58:32,110
America cannot afford to have
more than one international carrier.

1471
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:38,769
So, do you think it's fair that one airline
should have a monopoly on...

1472
01:58:38,874 --> 01:58:42,481
A monopoly? No, no, no.
No, no, no. Oh, no.

1473
01:58:42,586 --> 01:58:48,113
No, I think one airline could do it better,
see, without competition.

1474
01:58:48,217 --> 01:58:52,995
All I'm thinking about are the interests,
the needs of the American passenger.

1475
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:56,092
That's just beautiful.
What is that?

1476
01:59:00,306 --> 01:59:02,627
What is that?
Is that a...

1477
01:59:02,731 --> 01:59:05,717
Is that a yak?
Some kind of a yak?

1478
01:59:05,821 --> 01:59:09,930
No, that's a llama. My wife picked that up
when we were in Peru a year ago.

1479
01:59:10,034 --> 01:59:13,440
Son of a gun.
A real llama.

1480
01:59:15,905 --> 01:59:18,814
- From Peru?
- Yeah. A year ago.

1481
01:59:18,918 --> 01:59:21,356
Yeah, it was about a year ago.

1482
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:23,689
- Lunch is served, Senator.
- Good. OK.

1483
01:59:23,794 --> 01:59:26,410
Come on, let's go have some lunch.

1484
01:59:27,459 --> 01:59:31,404
Now did you...
Did you actually get to see any llamas?

1485
01:59:31,509 --> 01:59:33,452
No, no.
My wife just liked the painting.

1486
01:59:33,556 --> 01:59:37,327
It's a hell of an interesting animal.
I'll have to read up on those.

1487
01:59:37,431 --> 01:59:42,166
How do you spell that?
Like Fernando Lamas?

1488
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:44,668
No, no, no. It's...

1489
01:59:44,772 --> 01:59:47,971
It's the animal. It's got two Ls.
Here, come on, have a seat.

1490
01:59:57,947 --> 02:00:01,316
It's brook trout.
Hope you like fish.

1491
02:00:02,952 --> 02:00:04,773
I love it.

1492
02:00:04,877 --> 02:00:06,277
Thanks.

1493
02:00:21,763 --> 02:00:25,926
I know you're not a drinking man,
so I hope water's OK.

1494
02:00:38,697 --> 02:00:40,097
Thanks.

1495
02:00:45,954 --> 02:00:50,360
All right, let's get down to business.
Let's talk turkey.

1496
02:00:50,465 --> 02:00:53,572
My investigators...

1497
02:00:53,676 --> 02:00:56,911
My investigators
have turned up a lot of dirt.

1498
02:00:57,015 --> 02:01:00,869
Could be really embarrassing
if this stuff got out.

1499
02:01:00,973 --> 02:01:04,664
I'd like to save you
from that embarrassment.

1500
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:07,006
That's very kind of you, Owen.

1501
02:01:09,936 --> 02:01:13,768
My committee has the power
to hold public hearings.

1502
02:01:15,316 --> 02:01:17,847
I'd like to spare you that.

1503
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:20,391
Would you, now?

1504
02:01:20,496 --> 02:01:21,496
Look.

1505
02:01:22,124 --> 02:01:26,899
Do you want to go down in history
as a war profiteer, Howard?

1506
02:01:27,003 --> 02:01:29,616
Is that what you want?

1507
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:33,460
What do you want, Owen?

1508
02:01:34,586 --> 02:01:40,830
You agree to support my CAB bill
and I won't hold public hearings.

1509
02:01:40,934 --> 02:01:42,579
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

1510
02:01:42,683 --> 02:01:46,501
I can't do that, Owen.
The CAB would kill TWA.

1511
02:01:46,605 --> 02:01:50,211
Sell TWA to Pan Am.

1512
02:01:50,315 --> 02:01:54,466
You'll get a good price.
You'll get a fair price, I'm telling you.

1513
02:01:54,570 --> 02:01:56,762
And then?
Then you won't go public?

1514
02:01:56,866 --> 02:02:01,847
Right. That's right. The investigation's
closed. Nobody knows a thing.

1515
02:02:01,952 --> 02:02:05,315
It's better for everybody.

1516
02:02:09,579 --> 02:02:11,527
You know, Owen, I'm...

1517
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:13,583
- I'm still wondering one thing.
- What's that?

1518
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:17,071
You know the picture of the llama
you got last year?

1519
02:02:17,175 --> 02:02:19,922
- Yeah.
- Where'd you sail from?

1520
02:02:20,674 --> 02:02:22,666
We didn't sail.
We flew.

1521
02:02:23,927 --> 02:02:26,334
- You flew?
- Yeah.

1522
02:02:33,937 --> 02:02:37,799
Are you sure you want to do this, Owen?

1523
02:02:37,903 --> 02:02:40,437
You want to go to war with me?

1524
02:02:45,156 --> 02:02:50,311
It isn't me, Howard.
It's the United States government.

1525
02:02:50,416 --> 02:02:53,525
We just beat Germany and Japan.

1526
02:02:53,629 --> 02:02:55,830
Who the hell are you?

1527
02:03:01,006 --> 02:03:06,122
You tell Juan Trippe something for me,
all right?

1528
02:03:06,226 --> 02:03:09,166
Tell him thanks for the flowers.

1529
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:14,685
And he can kiss both sides of my ass.

1530
02:03:38,585 --> 02:03:41,071
Well, we have a long list of particulars.

1531
02:03:41,175 --> 02:03:45,577
Chief among them is that
he defrauded the American government

1532
02:03:45,681 --> 02:03:49,250
of $56 million while we were at war,
when we could least afford it.

1533
02:03:49,354 --> 02:03:52,420
While brave men were dying
on the beaches of Normandy,

1534
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:55,423
Mr Hughes was picking the pocket
of the American taxpayer.

1535
02:03:55,528 --> 02:03:56,928
I sleep

1536
02:03:58,364 --> 02:04:03,364
in this room in the dark.

1537
02:04:03,826 --> 02:04:06,848
I'll have him dragged here
to Washington if I have to.

1538
02:04:06,953 --> 02:04:09,183
I want to see the whites of his lies.

1539
02:04:09,287 --> 02:04:13,772
I have a place where I sleep.

1540
02:04:13,876 --> 02:04:16,984
- He has a lot of questions to answer.
- I have a chair.

1541
02:04:17,088 --> 02:04:22,031
Particularly about that
monstrous boondoggle of his.

1542
02:04:22,136 --> 02:04:26,912
That model airplane he's building.
You know, that flying lumberyard.

1543
02:04:27,017 --> 02:04:30,166
That Spruce Goose.

1544
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:33,013
No, we'll get him here.

1545
02:04:36,059 --> 02:04:39,966
That's just beautiful.

1546
02:04:40,070 --> 02:04:42,305
I like the desert.

1547
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:49,523
It's hot there in the desert, but it's clean.
It's clean.

1548
02:04:51,658 --> 02:04:54,493
I need to sleep.

1549
02:04:56,746 --> 02:05:00,162
I should drink something first.

1550
02:05:03,378 --> 02:05:05,703
I should drink something first.

1551
02:05:09,926 --> 02:05:12,726
Wait a minute.

1552
02:05:12,938 --> 02:05:15,670
What if that milk is sour?

1553
02:05:15,775 --> 02:05:18,085
If that milk is bad,

1554
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:23,551
I shouldn't pick up the bottle of milk
with my right hand,

1555
02:05:23,655 --> 02:05:29,484
and I shouldn't take the top off
with my left hand.

1556
02:05:30,822 --> 02:05:34,063
Put it in my pocket.

1557
02:05:34,167 --> 02:05:36,235
My left pocket.

1558
02:05:53,511 --> 02:05:55,376
Howard, it's Kate.

1559
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:57,879
I need to talk to you.

1560
02:05:59,017 --> 02:06:01,009
Can you hear me?

1561
02:06:03,396 --> 02:06:05,934
I'm coming in.

1562
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:13,072
Howard, unlock this door immediately.

1563
02:06:21,414 --> 02:06:24,451
I can't, sweetie.

1564
02:06:26,836 --> 02:06:29,410
You mean you won't.

1565
02:06:30,632 --> 02:06:34,455
Howard, please let me see you.

1566
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,455
I haven't shaved.

1567
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,508
Well, neither have I.

1568
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,160
Come on.

1569
02:06:44,696 --> 02:06:47,496
You let me in.

1570
02:06:54,489 --> 02:06:58,313
I can hear you, Katie.

1571
02:06:58,417 --> 02:07:03,648
I could always hear you.
Even in the cockpit, with the engines on.

1572
02:07:03,752 --> 02:07:07,497
Well, that's because I'm so goddamn loud.

1573
02:07:12,799 --> 02:07:14,875
Howard, I...

1574
02:07:17,012 --> 02:07:19,920
I came to thank you.

1575
02:07:20,024 --> 02:07:23,377
I found out what you did
for Spence and me.

1576
02:07:23,482 --> 02:07:26,228
Buying those awful pictures.

1577
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:33,103
You love him.

1578
02:07:39,784 --> 02:07:42,358
He's everything I have.

1579
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:51,820
Howard.

1580
02:07:53,432 --> 02:07:56,756
I'm glad for you, Kate.

1581
02:07:57,302 --> 02:08:00,748
Go away now.
Would you do that?

1582
02:08:00,852 --> 02:08:02,962
Howard, please.

1583
02:08:03,066 --> 02:08:08,007
Go away.
Just for now. I'll see you soon.

1584
02:08:08,112 --> 02:08:10,507
- We'll go flying together.
- Yes.

1585
02:08:10,611 --> 02:08:13,553
Yes, please.
You take me flying again.

1586
02:08:13,658 --> 02:08:16,818
Howard, I can take the wheel.

1587
02:08:22,452 --> 02:08:23,852
Howard?

1588
02:08:30,377 --> 02:08:33,081
Howard, are you there?

1589
02:08:38,134 --> 02:08:39,534
Howard?

1590
02:08:41,638 --> 02:08:44,045
Howard, are you there?

1591
02:08:46,059 --> 02:08:48,135
Come on, Howard.

1592
02:08:51,064 --> 02:08:53,637
Howard, are you there?

1593
02:09:19,134 --> 02:09:21,120
Come in with the milk.
Come in with the milk.

1594
02:09:21,224 --> 02:09:24,876
Come in with the milk. Come in with
the milk. Come in with the milk.

1595
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:26,127
Come in with the milk.

1596
02:09:26,231 --> 02:09:29,503
He is to open the bag with his right hand

1597
02:09:29,608 --> 02:09:32,799
and hold the bag out to me
at a 45-degree angle

1598
02:09:32,904 --> 02:09:38,136
so I may reach
into the bag without...

1599
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:41,854
without touching the paper.

1600
02:09:45,452 --> 02:09:47,982
Repeated from the beginning.

1601
02:09:48,087 --> 02:09:52,540
Repeated from the beginning.
Repeated from the beginning.

1602
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:11,128
If there is any variation of these
instructions, even to the smallest degree,

1603
02:10:11,233 --> 02:10:17,343
the entire process
must be repeated from the beginning.

1604
02:10:17,447 --> 02:10:19,345
- Come in with the milk.
- Repeated...

1605
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:21,373
- Come in with the milk.
...from the beginning.

1606
02:10:21,477 --> 02:10:24,770
- Come in with the milk.
- Repeated from the beginning.

1607
02:10:24,874 --> 02:10:28,939
- Repeated from the beginning.
- Come in with the milk.

1608
02:10:29,043 --> 02:10:29,843
Q...

1609
02:10:33,083 --> 02:10:33,883
R...

1610
02:10:34,508 --> 02:10:35,308
N...

1611
02:10:37,921 --> 02:10:38,721
T...

1612
02:10:40,389 --> 02:10:41,189
Q...

1613
02:10:43,677 --> 02:10:44,477
U...

1614
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:48,230
E...

1615
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:51,442
I...

1616
02:10:53,026 --> 02:10:53,826
T...

1617
02:10:56,022 --> 02:10:56,822
I...

1618
02:10:58,113 --> 02:10:58,913
N...

1619
02:11:00,826 --> 02:11:01,626
E...

1620
02:11:03,492 --> 02:11:04,292
N...

1621
02:11:06,574 --> 02:11:07,374
E...

1622
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,400
E.

1623
02:11:10,295 --> 02:11:11,095
I...

1624
02:11:22,882 --> 02:11:24,282
Howard?

1625
02:11:26,845 --> 02:11:28,045
Hello?

1626
02:11:30,682 --> 02:11:34,845
- Who is it?
- Howard, it's Juan.

1627
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:43,110
Juan.

1628
02:11:45,289 --> 02:11:47,682
Juan, right. Yeah.

1629
02:11:47,786 --> 02:11:50,480
We had an appointment, right? Yeah.

1630
02:11:50,584 --> 02:11:53,607
I remember that. Look...

1631
02:11:53,711 --> 02:11:56,319
I've got a hell of a cold in here.
A hell of a cold.

1632
02:11:56,423 --> 02:11:58,116
So why don't you just take
a seat out there?

1633
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,154
Cos you know,
I don't want to get you sick.

1634
02:12:00,258 --> 02:12:06,505
I'd never forgive myself if I got you sick.
I don't want to get you sick. I don't want to...

1635
02:12:12,807 --> 02:12:14,807
Thank you.

1636
02:12:17,228 --> 02:12:19,631
OK, Howard, I'm sitting.

1637
02:12:19,735 --> 02:12:21,846
I've brought along our accountings.

1638
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:26,181
Now, Pan Am is trading
at 13 and five-eighths.

1639
02:12:26,285 --> 02:12:29,020
TWA at four and a quarter...

1640
02:12:29,125 --> 02:12:30,602
Come on.

1641
02:12:30,706 --> 02:12:33,186
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1642
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:38,275
We both know I'm not gonna sell TWA.
Besides, you couldn't afford her anyway.

1643
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:42,742
Our domestic routes alone
are worth more than twice Pan Am.

1644
02:12:42,847 --> 02:12:45,912
Well, considering our stock
is trading at three times yours,

1645
02:12:46,017 --> 02:12:49,248
I find that a dubious claim, Howard.

1646
02:12:49,352 --> 02:12:51,152
What I...

1647
02:12:52,972 --> 02:12:57,590
What I mean is,
you have no domestic routes. All right?

1648
02:12:57,694 --> 02:12:59,922
I mean, you get TWA,
you span the globe.

1649
02:13:00,026 --> 02:13:03,013
Now, I'm not gonna sell,
and you know I'm not gonna sell.

1650
02:13:03,117 --> 02:13:07,401
Here's the point.
Owen Brewster works for you.

1651
02:13:08,029 --> 02:13:14,281
Howard, I didn't elect Senator Brewster.
We can thank the voters of Maine for that.

1652
02:13:21,334 --> 02:13:26,912
Now, if I appear at his hearings, Juan,
it could get nasty.

1653
02:13:27,016 --> 02:13:29,243
Real nasty for all of us.

1654
02:13:29,347 --> 02:13:33,914
Well, I think considerably more so for you.

1655
02:13:34,019 --> 02:13:37,044
While the good people of America
were losing sons at Anzio,

1656
02:13:37,148 --> 02:13:41,214
you produced a dirty movie
and built airplanes that don't fly.

1657
02:13:41,319 --> 02:13:43,882
Well, that's just not fair, is it?

1658
02:13:43,986 --> 02:13:47,972
I mean, the XF-11 flew quite well
for an hour and 45 minutes.

1659
02:13:48,077 --> 02:13:53,019
I mean, I wish you were up there with me,
Juan. It was exhilarating.

1660
02:13:53,123 --> 02:13:57,234
Be that as it may, you still have
to answer for the Spruce Goose.

1661
02:13:57,338 --> 02:13:59,859
It's called the Hercules.

1662
02:13:59,963 --> 02:14:03,818
- And it will fly, goddamn it.
- I certainly hope so.

1663
02:14:03,923 --> 02:14:07,493
The American people deserve something
for their $13 million.

1664
02:14:07,597 --> 02:14:10,702
I won't sell TWA.

1665
02:14:10,807 --> 02:14:12,045
I won't.

1666
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:19,631
I know that, Howard.

1667
02:14:19,735 --> 02:14:21,802
I know that.

1668
02:14:23,188 --> 02:14:26,679
But I'm going to get it anyway.

1669
02:14:26,783 --> 02:14:29,177
You're going to default on
your loan from Equitable

1670
02:14:29,281 --> 02:14:31,558
after Senator Brewster
destroys your reputation

1671
02:14:31,662 --> 02:14:35,062
and you can't find additional capital
for the airline.

1672
02:14:35,166 --> 02:14:38,649
The hearings will also show
Hughes Aircraft to be mismanaged

1673
02:14:38,753 --> 02:14:42,863
and incompetent,
and it will go bankrupt, too.

1674
02:14:42,967 --> 02:14:46,532
But you won't be insolvent.
You'll still have Toolco.

1675
02:14:46,636 --> 02:14:50,662
Perhaps you'll head back to Houston
to rebuild your empire.

1676
02:14:50,766 --> 02:14:53,204
I rather hope you do.

1677
02:14:53,308 --> 02:14:55,915
By that time,
Pan Am will have bought TWA

1678
02:14:56,019 --> 02:15:00,835
and painted all those
magnificent Connies blue and white.

1679
02:15:00,939 --> 02:15:05,928
So when you do return,
it will be on a Pan Am plane.

1680
02:15:09,401 --> 02:15:10,801
Well...

1681
02:15:12,987 --> 02:15:16,811
You seem to have me
in a corner here, buddy.

1682
02:15:16,915 --> 02:15:21,036
Not a position in which
I'm very comfortable.

1683
02:15:21,913 --> 02:15:26,780
I think you're gonna be less comfortable
at Senator Brewster's hearings.

1684
02:15:26,885 --> 02:15:30,495
Very public, Howard.

1685
02:15:31,256 --> 02:15:34,663
Lots of cameras and newsmen.

1686
02:15:34,768 --> 02:15:39,338
I understand you're not
particularly fond of crowds.

1687
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:43,593
Perhaps we should spare you that.

1688
02:15:45,562 --> 02:15:50,468
Well, thank you for your concern, Juan.

1689
02:15:50,572 --> 02:15:52,772
I find that

1690
02:15:53,746 --> 02:15:56,146
very moving.

1691
02:15:56,621 --> 02:15:58,856
It's been a real pleasure.

1692
02:16:00,368 --> 02:16:04,314
Noah will see you back to the airport.
Now you...

1693
02:16:04,418 --> 02:16:05,992
You fly safe.

1694
02:16:09,586 --> 02:16:11,993
You fly safe.

1695
02:16:16,843 --> 02:16:18,897
Thank you, Howard.
And you take care of that cold.

1696
02:16:19,001 --> 02:16:21,668
Don't you worry.

1697
02:16:21,772 --> 02:16:24,878
I certainly will.

1698
02:16:24,982 --> 02:16:26,582
Bye-bye.

1699
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:36,138
If you let him appear at those hearings,
the whole world will see what he's become.

1700
02:16:36,243 --> 02:16:39,357
People should remember him as he was.

1701
02:16:44,329 --> 02:16:48,946
He'll have a subpoena in three days
to appear in Washington.

1702
02:16:49,050 --> 02:16:51,794
If you can get him out of there by then.

1703
02:17:41,511 --> 02:17:43,468
Mr Hughes?

1704
02:17:49,394 --> 02:17:51,885
I don't have any shoes.

1705
02:17:53,648 --> 02:17:56,511
- Could you get me some shoes?
- Shoes.

1706
02:17:56,616 --> 02:17:57,616
Yeah.

1707
02:18:24,179 --> 02:18:26,883
How nice of you to dress for me.

1708
02:18:30,018 --> 02:18:32,260
Can I come in?

1709
02:18:32,812 --> 02:18:36,513
Yeah. Yeah.
You can come in.

1710
02:18:44,199 --> 02:18:46,737
Thank you for coming.

1711
02:18:58,546 --> 02:19:00,700
Now, let's get a drink.

1712
02:19:00,804 --> 02:19:03,790
Wait, wait, wait, honey.
You can't move. You can't move.

1713
02:19:03,894 --> 02:19:08,292
You're safe here. You're in the germ-free
zone now. You understand?

1714
02:19:08,396 --> 02:19:12,085
- I'll take my chances.
- Oh, no. No, no, honey.

1715
02:19:12,189 --> 02:19:14,758
Wait, wait, wait.

1716
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:30,948
Love what you've done with the place.

1717
02:19:36,167 --> 02:19:40,331
Now, let me look at you.

1718
02:19:44,926 --> 02:19:47,834
When do you go to Washington?

1719
02:19:47,938 --> 02:19:49,338
A week.

1720
02:19:49,936 --> 02:19:52,168
No, no.
Just under a week.

1721
02:19:52,272 --> 02:19:57,634
I don't know the date today,
but I have to be... I have to be...

1722
02:19:57,738 --> 02:20:00,186
All right, take it easy.

1723
02:20:13,163 --> 02:20:15,950
There's nothing there, Howard.

1724
02:20:17,834 --> 02:20:18,434
Mm.

1725
02:20:22,672 --> 02:20:26,255
You know, I...
I see things.

1726
02:20:27,093 --> 02:20:29,584
I know, baby.

1727
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:32,468
Rinse your face off now.

1728
02:20:41,358 --> 02:20:43,888
Put your hands in the water
and wash off the soap.

1729
02:20:43,992 --> 02:20:47,354
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

1730
02:20:51,743 --> 02:20:55,189
- Does that look clean to you?
- Nothing's clean, Howard.

1731
02:20:55,293 --> 02:20:58,408
But we do our best, right?

1732
02:20:59,125 --> 02:21:00,125
Yeah.

1733
02:21:20,105 --> 02:21:23,180
- What do you think?
- I look all right?

1734
02:21:23,284 --> 02:21:25,472
You look great.

1735
02:21:25,577 --> 02:21:29,269
- Will you marry me?
- You're too crazy for me.

1736
02:21:31,741 --> 02:21:34,982
I gotta go, baby.

1737
02:21:35,086 --> 02:21:35,686
OK.

1738
02:21:37,463 --> 02:21:38,863
Thanks.

1739
02:21:45,171 --> 02:21:47,745
You'd do it for me.

1740
02:21:53,596 --> 02:21:55,885
Hi, Howard.
How are you doing?

1741
02:22:36,514 --> 02:22:39,339
The Committee will come to order.

1742
02:22:39,443 --> 02:22:44,301
Ladies and gentlemen, I must insist that we
maintain quiet during these proceedings.

1743
02:22:44,406 --> 02:22:48,229
All right, Mr Hughes,
will you stand to be sworn?

1744
02:22:49,527 --> 02:22:53,434
Do you solemnly swear that in the matter
now pending before this committee,

1745
02:22:53,539 --> 02:22:57,816
you will tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1746
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:00,313
- I do.
- Pardon me for speaking loudly,

1747
02:23:00,417 --> 02:23:02,777
but I understand
you have some difficulty hearing.

1748
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:07,869
That's quite all right. Everybody knows
I'm deaf. I'm not gonna try to hide it.

1749
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:13,535
Mr Hughes,
it is the intention of this committee...

1750
02:23:13,639 --> 02:23:16,582
Mr Hughes has a statement.

1751
02:23:16,686 --> 02:23:22,765
All right. All right. You may proceed
with this statement, Mr Hughes.

1752
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:32,269
Mr Hughes, do you have a statement?

1753
02:23:38,618 --> 02:23:42,995
I'm gonna attempt to be honest here.

1754
02:23:43,665 --> 02:23:49,326
My reputation's being destroyed, so I might
as well lay the cards on the table.

1755
02:23:49,430 --> 02:23:53,744
Senator Brewster,
if you hadn't have gone too far overboard,

1756
02:23:53,848 --> 02:23:56,411
if you hadn't have put
the red-hot iron in my side,

1757
02:23:56,515 --> 02:24:01,083
I might have been willing to take a
shellacking in this publicity spree of yours.

1758
02:24:01,188 --> 02:24:04,545
I might have been willing to sit back
and take a certain amount of abuse.

1759
02:24:04,649 --> 02:24:07,424
Simply because, well...

1760
02:24:07,528 --> 02:24:10,181
Well, I am only a private citizen,

1761
02:24:10,285 --> 02:24:15,150
whereas you are a senator,
with all sorts of powers.

1762
02:24:16,322 --> 02:24:19,102
But I think this goddamn circus
has gone on long enough.

1763
02:24:19,207 --> 02:24:20,521
That's quite sufficient.

1764
02:24:20,626 --> 02:24:23,443
You have called me a liar, sir, in the press.

1765
02:24:23,547 --> 02:24:26,530
You have called me a liar
and a thief and a war profiteer.

1766
02:24:26,634 --> 02:24:30,742
- The witness will restrain his comments...
- Why not tell the truth for once, Senator?

1767
02:24:30,846 --> 02:24:34,034
Why not tell the truth
that this investigation was really born

1768
02:24:34,138 --> 02:24:37,162
on the day that TWA
first decided to fly to Europe?

1769
02:24:37,266 --> 02:24:40,584
On the day that TWA
first invaded Juan Trippe's territory.

1770
02:24:40,689 --> 02:24:42,045
Sit down, Mr Hughes.

1771
02:24:42,149 --> 02:24:45,670
On the day that TWA first challenged
the generally accepted theory

1772
02:24:45,774 --> 02:24:48,466
that only Juan Trippe's
great Pan American Airways

1773
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:53,802
- had the sacred right to fly the Atlantic.
- You are not here to make a speech.

1774
02:24:53,906 --> 02:24:57,309
I asked for silence.
I asked for quiet in this room...

1775
02:24:57,414 --> 02:25:02,228
We have in our possession receipts
in the amount of $170,000

1776
02:25:02,332 --> 02:25:04,441
acquired from Mr John Meyer.

1777
02:25:04,546 --> 02:25:07,023
Mr Meyer works for you,
does he not?

1778
02:25:07,127 --> 02:25:12,073
- He does.
- And what is his official title?

1779
02:25:12,177 --> 02:25:16,032
Well, I don't exactly know, Senator.
A lot of people work for me.

1780
02:25:16,136 --> 02:25:21,582
Can you explain why your press agent
would pay out more than a $170,000

1781
02:25:21,686 --> 02:25:24,127
to representatives of
the United States Air Force?

1782
02:25:24,231 --> 02:25:27,004
I don't know.
I suppose you'd have to ask him, Senator.

1783
02:25:27,108 --> 02:25:31,009
- Well, would you produce him?
- Produce him?

1784
02:25:31,113 --> 02:25:33,259
- Will you cause him to appear?
- Well, Senator,

1785
02:25:33,363 --> 02:25:36,221
you had John Meyer on
the stand for three days last week.

1786
02:25:36,325 --> 02:25:42,737
Well, be that as it may, we would like him
to reappear. Would you ask him to return?

1787
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:52,402
No, I don't think I will.

1788
02:25:52,506 --> 02:25:54,910
Will you try to have him return?

1789
02:25:56,172 --> 02:25:59,829
Well, no, I don't think I'll try.

1790
02:25:59,933 --> 02:26:02,382
You don't think you'll try?

1791
02:26:03,346 --> 02:26:06,504
No, I don't think so.

1792
02:26:06,608 --> 02:26:11,383
The $170,000 paid out to the Air Force
in the form of hotel suites,

1793
02:26:11,488 --> 02:26:13,488
TWA stock,

1794
02:26:13,737 --> 02:26:16,390
female companionship...

1795
02:26:16,495 --> 02:26:20,862
Now, is it possible
that these could be considered bribes?

1796
02:26:21,364 --> 02:26:24,939
I suppose you could call them that, yes.

1797
02:26:25,043 --> 02:26:27,315
Would you repeat that?

1798
02:26:27,419 --> 02:26:31,410
I said, I suppose you could
consider them bribes, yes.

1799
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:37,490
Well, would you like
to explain that, Mr Hughes?

1800
02:26:37,594 --> 02:26:42,744
Well, I'm afraid you don't know how
the aviation business works, Senator.

1801
02:26:42,848 --> 02:26:47,461
See, wining and dining Air Force
dignitaries is common in our business.

1802
02:26:47,565 --> 02:26:51,381
It's because we all want the big contracts.
All the major aircraft companies do it.

1803
02:26:51,485 --> 02:26:55,846
Now, I don't know whether it's a good
system or not. I just know it's not illegal.

1804
02:26:55,950 --> 02:26:59,137
You, Senator, you are the lawmaker.

1805
02:26:59,242 --> 02:27:02,560
If you pass a law that states
no one can entertain Air Force officers,

1806
02:27:02,664 --> 02:27:06,356
well, hell,
I'd be happy to abide by it.

1807
02:27:08,286 --> 02:27:10,356
Senator Brewster,
your story is a pack of lies,

1808
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,986
and I can tear it apart
if allowed to cross-examine you.

1809
02:27:13,090 --> 02:27:15,485
- We're not gonna have this bickering...
- Yes.

1810
02:27:15,589 --> 02:27:18,202
Somewhere between two and five hundred,
if you'll just let me...

1811
02:27:18,307 --> 02:27:21,034
Now, if you believe that
because of your great wealth and power,

1812
02:27:21,139 --> 02:27:23,618
you can intimidate
any member of this committee,

1813
02:27:23,722 --> 02:27:25,583
I want to advise you that you're mistaken.

1814
02:27:25,687 --> 02:27:28,671
- Now, submit your questions to the chair.
- Now, I'll put this very simply.

1815
02:27:28,775 --> 02:27:31,922
On February 12th at the Mayflower Hotel,

1816
02:27:32,027 --> 02:27:37,679
did you, or did you not, tell me
that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am

1817
02:27:37,783 --> 02:27:40,599
that this entire investigation
would be called off?

1818
02:27:40,703 --> 02:27:44,517
No, I did not. I have asked you repeatedly
to submit your questions in writing.

1819
02:27:44,621 --> 02:27:48,271
- How long have you known Juan Trippe?
- I've known Mr Trippe for some time now,

1820
02:27:48,375 --> 02:27:50,105
and that's not the question here.

1821
02:27:50,209 --> 02:27:54,737
Is it not true that Juan Trippe donated
$ 20,000 to your last campaign?

1822
02:27:54,841 --> 02:27:58,195
I mean, he spoke to me
as if you worked for him.

1823
02:27:58,300 --> 02:27:59,954
All right.

1824
02:28:01,923 --> 02:28:03,727
I have a personal friendship
with Mr Trippe...

1825
02:28:03,831 --> 02:28:07,330
Is it true that you accept free tickets
from Pan Am so you can circle the globe

1826
02:28:07,434 --> 02:28:10,504
- in support of your CAB bill?
- No, no, it is not true.

1827
02:28:10,608 --> 02:28:14,883
Well, who wrote that bill, Senator?
Who actually wrote the CAB bill?

1828
02:28:14,987 --> 02:28:17,176
The actual words in the bill,
did you write them?

1829
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:19,952
This is not how these hearings
are gonna be conducted, Mr Hughes.

1830
02:28:20,056 --> 02:28:23,221
I have it right here.
Maybe it'll refresh your memory.

1831
02:28:23,326 --> 02:28:26,644
"Bill S-987,
to amend the Civil Aeronautics Act."

1832
02:28:26,748 --> 02:28:30,607
Now, you introduced
this bill to the Senate.

1833
02:28:33,538 --> 02:28:35,902
Lot of words.

1834
02:28:36,006 --> 02:28:38,363
You write all of them?

1835
02:28:38,467 --> 02:28:41,406
- Did you write any of them, Senator?
- Now look, Mr Hughes.

1836
02:28:41,511 --> 02:28:44,662
Now, this entire bill
was written by Pan Am executives

1837
02:28:44,766 --> 02:28:48,959
and designed to give that airline
a monopoly on international travel.

1838
02:28:49,063 --> 02:28:52,294
And you've been flogging this bill
all around the world on their behalf,

1839
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:53,667
have you not?

1840
02:28:53,771 --> 02:28:57,674
I have duties that take me
all over the world, Mr Hughes.

1841
02:28:57,778 --> 02:29:02,848
Well, what the hell does a senator
from Maine need to visit Peru for?

1842
02:29:03,401 --> 02:29:07,686
I was seeking outlets
for our trade goods.

1843
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:11,280
Buy a lot of lobsters down there,
do they?

1844
02:29:14,621 --> 02:29:17,984
Senator Brewster, how many times
have you visited Juan Trippe's office

1845
02:29:18,088 --> 02:29:22,211
in New York in the last three months?

1846
02:29:23,713 --> 02:29:26,500
Would you like me to tell you, Senator?

1847
02:29:27,092 --> 02:29:30,538
All right, this has gone on long enough.
Juan Trippe is a great American.

1848
02:29:30,642 --> 02:29:34,460
His airline has advanced the cause
of commercial aviation in this country

1849
02:29:34,565 --> 02:29:36,838
for decades.
Juan Trippe is a patriot.

1850
02:29:36,942 --> 02:29:40,268
Juan Trippe is not a man
who is interested in making money.

1851
02:29:41,731 --> 02:29:44,934
Well, I'm sure his stockholders
will be happy to hear that.

1852
02:29:47,112 --> 02:29:49,104
I'm telling you,
we're gonna clear this room.

1853
02:29:50,198 --> 02:29:51,585
This is James McNamara
speaking to you

1854
02:29:51,689 --> 02:29:55,897
from aboard the Howard Hughes 2000-ton
flying boat, the world's largest aircraft.

1855
02:29:56,002 --> 02:29:58,565
This is the sky giant
which has prompted Congress

1856
02:29:58,669 --> 02:30:01,362
to investigate
the war contracts of Mr Hughes.

1857
02:30:01,467 --> 02:30:04,284
Today, before boarding the craft,
Mr Hughes told newsmen

1858
02:30:04,388 --> 02:30:07,120
that this test would
be solely a taxi experiment.

1859
02:30:07,224 --> 02:30:09,201
He said he didn't know
what might happen.

1860
02:30:09,306 --> 02:30:11,959
He pointed out that the mammoth
flying plywood shell

1861
02:30:12,064 --> 02:30:15,960
might ship some water under high-speed
taxi pressure. He said definitely, however,

1862
02:30:16,065 --> 02:30:19,548
that he would not take the craft into the air
until next spring.

1863
02:30:19,652 --> 02:30:23,717
The thin man from Culver City pronounced
the craft an unknown quantity.

1864
02:30:23,821 --> 02:30:25,385
Hi, boys.

1865
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:27,246
All right, none of that, now.
None of that.

1866
02:30:27,350 --> 02:30:30,598
As we speak to you, we're about
five feet in back of Mr Hughes,

1867
02:30:30,702 --> 02:30:34,604
and we are looking through
one of the side windows in the cockpit.

1868
02:30:34,708 --> 02:30:37,360
Professor, why don't you
come on up front here?

1869
02:30:37,464 --> 02:30:41,028
In other words,
we are 30 feet high in this aircraft.

1870
02:30:41,132 --> 02:30:44,012
Strap yourself in right there.
You ought to be able to see just great.

1871
02:30:44,117 --> 02:30:46,699
...just how gigantic this ship is.

1872
02:30:46,804 --> 02:30:50,037
Huge crowds jammed
the surrounding shoreline this morning...

1873
02:30:50,141 --> 02:30:53,467
All right, boys.
Let's fire it up.

1874
02:30:57,223 --> 02:30:59,423
One's good.

1875
02:30:59,897 --> 02:31:01,963
Two's good.

1876
02:31:02,067 --> 02:31:03,760
Three's good.

1877
02:31:03,864 --> 02:31:06,008
Four's good.

1878
02:31:06,112 --> 02:31:07,928
Five's good.

1879
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:09,558
Six is good.

1880
02:31:09,662 --> 02:31:11,101
Seven's good.

1881
02:31:11,205 --> 02:31:13,805
Eight's good.

1882
02:31:13,959 --> 02:31:19,481
- Advancing master throttles.
- Advancing master throttles.

1883
02:31:19,585 --> 02:31:20,736
As you probably know by now,

1884
02:31:20,841 --> 02:31:23,489
I have to do a great deal of screaming
here into my microphone.

1885
02:31:23,594 --> 02:31:25,653
- Prop start up.
- Understood.

1886
02:31:25,757 --> 02:31:29,742
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.

1887
02:31:29,847 --> 02:31:31,204
Howard.

1888
02:31:31,309 --> 02:31:33,663
She's gotta hit 70
to have any kind of chance.

1889
02:31:33,767 --> 02:31:35,542
Yeah, I know. I know.

1890
02:31:35,646 --> 02:31:39,416
I might add that it's a beautiful day over
here off the coast of Southern California.

1891
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:42,046
Crystal blue skies, a warm sun...

1892
02:31:42,151 --> 02:31:44,930
25 miles per hour.

1893
02:31:46,064 --> 02:31:46,664
30.

1894
02:31:48,321 --> 02:31:48,921
35.

1895
02:31:49,697 --> 02:31:53,683
One would think these eight power plants
might shake the mighty craft to pieces.

1896
02:31:53,787 --> 02:31:55,644
Take it easy, Howard.

1897
02:31:55,749 --> 02:31:57,810
...and certainly, it's holding up...

1898
02:31:57,914 --> 02:32:01,816
- 40.
- Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1899
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:05,662
Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1900
02:32:09,295 --> 02:32:12,075
The flight crew itself consists of four men.

1901
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:16,246
Mr Hughes, however, has added 11
maintenance men to this maiden taxi test,

1902
02:32:16,350 --> 02:32:18,875
stationed at various places
throughout the ship,

1903
02:32:18,979 --> 02:32:22,341
checking points of stress and strain.

1904
02:32:24,394 --> 02:32:26,880
How does she sound, Odie?

1905
02:32:26,984 --> 02:32:29,056
Sounds good, Howard.

1906
02:32:32,152 --> 02:32:34,432
- Professor.
- Yes?

1907
02:32:34,536 --> 02:32:36,809
Would you do me a favour?

1908
02:32:36,914 --> 02:32:43,158
Would you take a look out that window
there and tell me what the wind is doing?

1909
02:32:46,041 --> 02:32:49,948
I would say that we have
a 15-knot wind.

1910
02:32:50,052 --> 02:32:54,042
Would you call that a headwind,
Professor?

1911
02:32:54,632 --> 02:32:56,119
I would, Mr Hughes.

1912
02:32:56,224 --> 02:32:58,537
I must insist that we maintain silence.

1913
02:32:58,642 --> 02:33:00,623
We must have quiet during
these proceedings.

1914
02:33:00,727 --> 02:33:03,169
All right, Mr Hughes,
will you stand to be sworn?

1915
02:33:03,273 --> 02:33:07,045
Mr Hughes,
did you receive $43 million

1916
02:33:07,149 --> 02:33:13,427
to manufacture one hundred XF-11
spy planes for the United States Air Force?

1917
02:33:13,532 --> 02:33:14,719
I did.

1918
02:33:14,823 --> 02:33:19,187
How many functional planes did you
deliver to the United States Air Force?

1919
02:33:19,292 --> 02:33:20,292
None.

1920
02:33:20,624 --> 02:33:24,274
Would you lean a little closer
to the microphone, sir?

1921
02:33:24,378 --> 02:33:25,378
None.

1922
02:33:25,713 --> 02:33:29,612
Did you receive $13 million to manufacture

1923
02:33:29,717 --> 02:33:34,667
a prototype of a flying boat
known as the Hercules?

1924
02:33:35,256 --> 02:33:36,456
I did.

1925
02:33:37,559 --> 02:33:40,459
And did you deliver that plane?

1926
02:33:40,563 --> 02:33:42,563
I did not.

1927
02:33:42,811 --> 02:33:46,297
So, by your admission in this chamber,
Mr Hughes,

1928
02:33:46,401 --> 02:33:51,593
you have received $56 million
from the United States government

1929
02:33:51,697 --> 02:33:54,553
for planes you never delivered.

1930
02:33:54,657 --> 02:33:57,521
That is correct.

1931
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:04,019
Well, excuse me for asking, Mr Hughes,
but where did all that money go?

1932
02:34:04,123 --> 02:34:08,941
Well, it went into the plane, Senator,
and a lot more.

1933
02:34:09,045 --> 02:34:13,946
More? Do tell, Mr Hughes.
What other larcenies did you commit?

1934
02:34:14,050 --> 02:34:19,466
I mean, I put my money
into the plane, Senator. My money.

1935
02:34:21,803 --> 02:34:23,624
- See, the thing is...
- Mr Hughes,

1936
02:34:23,728 --> 02:34:26,501
your personal finances are not...

1937
02:34:26,606 --> 02:34:29,351
Let him speak.

1938
02:34:32,564 --> 02:34:35,888
All right, proceed, Mr Hughes.

1939
02:34:35,992 --> 02:34:41,478
See, the thing is,
I care very much about aviation.

1940
02:34:41,582 --> 02:34:45,435
It has been the great joy of my life. That's
why I put my own money into these planes.

1941
02:34:45,539 --> 02:34:47,937
And I have lost millions, Senator Brewster.

1942
02:34:48,042 --> 02:34:53,109
And I'll go on losing millions.
It's just what I do.

1943
02:34:53,214 --> 02:34:56,988
Now, if I've lost a lot of the government's
money during the war,

1944
02:34:57,092 --> 02:35:00,412
well, I hope folks
will put that into perspective.

1945
02:35:00,517 --> 02:35:02,578
You see, more than 60 other airplanes,

1946
02:35:02,682 --> 02:35:05,957
ordered from such firms as Lockheed,
Douglas, Northrop and Boeing,

1947
02:35:06,061 --> 02:35:08,087
never saw action, either.

1948
02:35:08,191 --> 02:35:14,798
In all, more than $800 million was spent
during the war on planes that never flew.

1949
02:35:14,902 --> 02:35:19,266
Over six billion on other weapons
that were never delivered.

1950
02:35:19,370 --> 02:35:24,644
Yet Hughes Aircraft, with her 56 million,

1951
02:35:24,748 --> 02:35:27,400
is the only firm
under investigation here today.

1952
02:35:27,504 --> 02:35:30,651
Now, I cannot help but think
that has a little more to do with TWA

1953
02:35:30,755 --> 02:35:32,650
than planes that did not fly.

1954
02:35:32,754 --> 02:35:35,657
- I think you've made your point...
- One second.

1955
02:35:35,761 --> 02:35:39,870
Senator Brewster, I have one more thing
to say here to this committee,

1956
02:35:39,974 --> 02:35:43,078
and that has to do with the Hercules.

1957
02:35:43,182 --> 02:35:48,504
Now, I am supposed to be many things
which are not complimentary.

1958
02:35:48,609 --> 02:35:50,751
I am supposed to be capricious.

1959
02:35:50,856 --> 02:35:54,968
I have been called a playboy.
I've even been called an eccentric.

1960
02:35:55,072 --> 02:36:00,013
But I do not believe that I have
the reputation of being a liar.

1961
02:36:00,117 --> 02:36:03,684
Now, needless to say, the Hercules
was a monumental undertaking.

1962
02:36:03,788 --> 02:36:06,521
It is the largest plane ever built.

1963
02:36:06,626 --> 02:36:10,273
It's over five storeys tall,
with a wingspan longer than a football field.

1964
02:36:10,377 --> 02:36:12,484
That's more than a city block.

1965
02:36:12,589 --> 02:36:17,070
Now, I put the sweat of my life into this
thing, I got my reputation all rolled up in it,

1966
02:36:17,175 --> 02:36:20,576
and I have stated several times
that if the Hercules fails to fly

1967
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:23,497
I will leave this country
and never come back.

1968
02:36:23,601 --> 02:36:26,333
And I mean it.

1969
02:36:26,437 --> 02:36:31,417
Now, Senator Brewster,
you can subpoena me. You can arrest me.

1970
02:36:31,521 --> 02:36:36,755
You can even claim that I've folded up
and taken a run-out powder, but, well...

1971
02:36:36,859 --> 02:36:40,511
I've had just about enough
of this nonsense. Good afternoon.

1972
02:36:40,616 --> 02:36:42,224
I had to do it.

1973
02:36:42,328 --> 02:36:45,438
Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes.

1974
02:36:46,406 --> 02:36:49,103
I'd love to see the Hercules in the air.

1975
02:36:49,208 --> 02:36:51,573
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1976
02:36:53,496 --> 02:36:56,616
Excuse us.
Excuse us, please. Thank you.

1977
02:36:57,792 --> 02:37:00,081
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1978
02:37:00,628 --> 02:37:02,630
- Switch it off.
- The hearings aren't over yet.

1979
02:37:02,756 --> 02:37:04,748
The hearings are over.

1980
02:37:07,469 --> 02:37:10,377
The airline bill
will be defeated in the Senate.

1981
02:37:10,481 --> 02:37:13,585
TWA will begin flights
from New York to Paris.

1982
02:37:13,689 --> 02:37:18,475
Then on to Moscow, to Japan,
to Hawaii, to Los Angeles...

1983
02:37:21,608 --> 02:37:23,684
to New York.

1984
02:37:27,322 --> 02:37:28,322
Fuck.

1985
02:37:33,119 --> 02:37:36,737
- Power coming up.
- Power coming up.

1986
02:37:40,251 --> 02:37:42,782
Howard Hughes has just alerted us.

1987
02:37:42,886 --> 02:37:48,579
He has asked everyone to hold on.
Tremendous horsepower picking up.

1988
02:37:48,683 --> 02:37:52,711
- Let me hear it, Odie.
- 25 miles per hour.

1989
02:37:52,815 --> 02:37:53,415
30.

1990
02:37:54,186 --> 02:37:56,713
Here we go.
Here we go.

1991
02:37:56,817 --> 02:37:57,417
35.

1992
02:37:59,278 --> 02:38:02,800
...has moved up to 25. It's 30.

1993
02:38:02,904 --> 02:38:05,263
- It's 35.
- 40.

1994
02:38:05,367 --> 02:38:07,263
As he pushes the throttle, it's 40.

1995
02:38:07,367 --> 02:38:11,730
- 45.
- 45. More throttle. It's 45.

1996
02:38:11,834 --> 02:38:14,855
- 50.
- 50. It's 50 over a choppy sea.

1997
02:38:14,959 --> 02:38:17,959
- 55.
- 55. 55.

1998
02:38:18,587 --> 02:38:21,778
- 60.
- More throttle. It's 60.

1999
02:38:21,883 --> 02:38:24,165
- 65.
- 65.

2000
02:38:27,674 --> 02:38:29,660
- 70.
- It's 70.

2001
02:38:29,764 --> 02:38:31,586
- 75.
- It's 75.

2002
02:38:39,936 --> 02:38:42,550
And something momentarily
has just cut out.

2003
02:38:42,654 --> 02:38:46,932
I believe we are airborne.
We are airborne, ladies and gentlemen.

2004
02:38:47,036 --> 02:38:50,727
I don't believe that Howard Hughes
meant this to be. I don't know.

2005
02:38:54,117 --> 02:38:59,573
And we're really up in the air.
We're really up in the air.

2006
02:39:03,877 --> 02:39:07,323
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Hughes mammoth aircraft

2007
02:39:07,427 --> 02:39:12,078
has flown this afternoon
in Los Angeles Harbour.

2008
02:39:12,182 --> 02:39:15,374
It certainly looks, at this moment,
that Howard Hughes

2009
02:39:15,478 --> 02:39:20,679
will be around the United States
for quite some time to come.

2010
02:39:31,279 --> 02:39:34,393
What we must understand
is that technologies like these

2011
02:39:34,497 --> 02:39:36,753
are the way of the future.
That's enough questions for now.

2012
02:39:36,858 --> 02:39:39,568
TWA and Hughes Aircraft are delighted
to have you come here

2013
02:39:39,672 --> 02:39:42,609
and witness this wonderful sight.

2014
02:39:42,713 --> 02:39:44,944
- Excuse us for just a second.
- Sorry.

2015
02:39:45,048 --> 02:39:47,196
- So you feel like going to Paris?
- Now?

2016
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:50,825
TWA is starting up flights to Europe.
Thought I might pilot the first one myself.

2017
02:39:50,929 --> 02:39:52,994
Ought to be some fun.

2018
02:39:53,098 --> 02:39:55,887
- Lots of good shopping in Paris.
- I'll buy you anything you want.

2019
02:39:56,012 --> 02:40:01,002
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

2020
02:40:01,106 --> 02:40:03,670
Dinner, then.
We got a date?

2021
02:40:03,774 --> 02:40:06,226
OK, baby, you got a date.

2022
02:40:07,732 --> 02:40:11,639
I'll be back in a second.
But don't you go anywhere, now. I mean it.

2023
02:40:11,744 --> 02:40:15,770
Al right, listen, boys. Something new. Jet
airplanes. You know anything about jets?

2024
02:40:15,875 --> 02:40:21,610
- No. But it sounds expensive.
- It will be. But we got to get started.

2025
02:40:21,714 --> 02:40:24,446
Come on, walk with me.

2026
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:28,115
Whoever can start utilising jet technology
on commercial airliners

2027
02:40:28,219 --> 02:40:29,952
is gonna win all the marbles,
you understand?

2028
02:40:30,057 --> 02:40:31,370
Odie, what do you know
about the science?

2029
02:40:31,475 --> 02:40:36,374
I know a little. I can work something
to show you. Basic turbine stuff.

2030
02:40:40,348 --> 02:40:43,848
Noah, who are those fellows?

2031
02:40:45,061 --> 02:40:46,935
Do they work for me?

2032
02:40:48,189 --> 02:40:50,562
Everybody works for you, Howard.

2033
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:59,878
Lockheed worked on the F-80,
so let's get Bob Gross on the phone.

2034
02:40:59,982 --> 02:41:03,272
- See if he can help us out.
- OK. What, now?

2035
02:41:03,376 --> 02:41:07,572
Of course, now. We gotta get into it.
Jets are gonna be the way of the future.

2036
02:41:07,677 --> 02:41:08,821
It's 4:30.

2037
02:41:08,926 --> 02:41:11,782
I talked to Bob last week.
He's in New York, so it's 7:30.

2038
02:41:11,886 --> 02:41:13,073
He won't be in the office.

2039
02:41:13,177 --> 02:41:15,164
We'll get Nancy
to figure out what hotel he's at.

2040
02:41:15,269 --> 02:41:17,020
The question is,
do you want a telephone call

2041
02:41:17,125 --> 02:41:18,855
or do you want
some kind of meeting right away?

2042
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,751
We want a meeting,
don't we, Howard?

2043
02:41:20,855 --> 02:41:24,965
All right. Well, do you want me to bring
him out here tomorrow, then, Howard?

2044
02:41:25,069 --> 02:41:27,718
- The way of the future.
- Howard?

2045
02:41:27,823 --> 02:41:31,009
- Howard.
- The way of the future.

2046
02:41:31,114 --> 02:41:33,887
- The way of the future.
- Let's take a walk, Howard.

2047
02:41:33,991 --> 02:41:36,227
- The way of the future.
- Give me a hand here, will you, Glenn?

2048
02:41:36,331 --> 02:41:39,478
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2049
02:41:39,582 --> 02:41:43,398
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

2050
02:41:43,502 --> 02:41:46,358
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2051
02:41:46,462 --> 02:41:50,113
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

2052
02:41:50,217 --> 02:41:52,696
The way of the future.
The way of the future. The way...

2053
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:56,868
All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
Do you understand, Howard?

2054
02:41:56,973 --> 02:41:58,812
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2055
02:41:58,916 --> 02:42:02,542
Guard the door. I'll get a doctor.
No one sees him like this.

2056
02:42:02,646 --> 02:42:06,055
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

2057
02:42:07,227 --> 02:42:10,634
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

2058
02:42:10,739 --> 02:42:13,216
The way of the fut...

2059
02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:16,768
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2060
02:42:22,909 --> 02:42:26,309
You are not safe.

2061
02:42:33,545 --> 02:42:38,367
When I grow up, I'm gonna fly
the fastest planes ever built,

2062
02:42:38,472 --> 02:42:41,125
make the biggest movies ever,

2063
02:42:41,229 --> 02:42:44,255
and be the richest man in the world.

2064
02:42:57,444 --> 02:42:59,807
The way of the future.

2065
02:43:07,579 --> 02:43:09,825
The way of the future.

2066
02:43:17,839 --> 02:43:19,824
The way of the future.

2067
02:43:23,136 --> 02:43:25,048
The way of the future.

2068
02:43:27,057 --> 02:43:28,961
The way of the future.

2069
02:43:30,602 --> 02:43:32,345
The way of the future.
