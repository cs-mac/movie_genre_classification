1
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,058
Who the hell is he?.

2
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,546
He's a friend I can vouch for him.

3
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,754
He's here to help.
He's from Consolidated Goldfields.

4
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,990
To talk about fund raising for our
schools programme.

5
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,383
We didn't ask for his hand-outs.

6
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,559
- Leave him be!. Let him be!.

7
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,963
I've waited a long time
for this opportunity, Doctor.

8
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,877
Likewise, sir.

9
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,630
A! W! B!

10
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,868
Good night, Doctor.

11
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,790
- Good night.

12
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,939
The departmental conference
is postponed, professor.

13
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,013
We know exactly what's going on
in the UK...

14
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,563
between you and
the ANC thugs professor.

15
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:34,726
Think carefully before going next time
or learn to sleep with your eyes open.

16
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,725
yes, I understand well.
Are you absolutely sure?.

17
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,210
We can't put it like that.

18
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:49,784
yes, it's important, but
it's a waste of time.
