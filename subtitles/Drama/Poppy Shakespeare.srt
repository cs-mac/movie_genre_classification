Mr. Suzuki.

up a mock test for the upcoming physics exam.

00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,028
This way for the historic debate. Future
of the Latin Quarter to be decided.

469
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,622
[RESOLVED THE LATIN QUARTER SHOULD BE PRESERVED!]

470
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,160
Alright. Good. Stop there.

471
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,955
This is gonna get rough.

472
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,881
Umi.  You heading home? At least I got
you a really nice flounder.

473
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,966
Um, sure, I'll take some.

474
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:21,987
Coming right up.

475
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,332
Hay is your mom
back from America?

476
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:25,249
Not yet.

477
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:27,639
I'll come back for the fish later!

478
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,050
How much later?

479
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:37,579
Stuck a new state of the arts
student center in it's place!

480
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,317
Transformation in transition.

481
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,247
We've suffered the scars of war

482
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,535
and have emerged a stronger people.

483
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:45,726
A peaceful people.

484
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,408
A modern people.

485
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,495
A Tokyo where we can
showcase our new democracy.

486
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,982
We can not stand in the way of progress.

487
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:58,122
The Tokyo exhibition
will showcase our democracy

488
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,914
as a prime leader in democracy...

489
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,006
Oh, Umi!

490
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,674
What's he yelling about?

491
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,593
I have no idea.

492
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:06,533
We still cling to the past.

493
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:09,157
It is time we throw these old buildings out

494
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:11,354
as relics of a bygone era.

495
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:14,025
Our poles say 80% of you

496
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:16,486
want the Latin Quarter torn down.

497
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:20,102
Ah ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haa.

498
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,836
You're ideas of democracy make me laugh.

499
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,925
We've come here to debate, you
already made up our minds for us.

500
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,406
Sit back down or I'll have you thrown out!

501
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,230

men who run this country.

Listen!

504
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:55,704
If you're so hell-bent on demolition,
demolish your shortsighted thinking!...

505
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:57,018
That's enough! Sit down!

506
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,108
You cannot move into the future
without first knowing the past!

507
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:05,262
Destroy everything old and you dishonor
those who lived and died before us.

508
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,688

512

I think it was amazing.
You're all so passionate.

Yeah, debates are always like that.

Hey, I know. Why don't you
all just clean the place up?

537
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,538
It's a great old building but no
one can see through the dust.

538
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:24,626
So clean it up.  Make it look like new again.
Make it cool.  Maybe invite a few girls.

539

Then the boys will like it too.

You're probably right.

541
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:29,989
I would just have
to convince everyone

542

that dust isn't an important
part of its history.

Forgive my sense of tradition

579

but why not get married

00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:02,621
and start a practice right here.

581
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:04,661
Would that mean we'd all have to move out?

582
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,924
You'll probably be married by then.

583
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,797
Oh, if only that were true.

584

00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:15,043
The trustees are the problem.

587
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:17,307
We can't let them tear the place down.

588
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,931
Agreed. What can we do?

589
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:21,032
We need to go over their heads.

590

does what the board tells him.

593

00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:39,765
- You take that out.
- Ok.

598
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,994
Ok every one, Sushi's ready.

00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:47,365
Yes!

600
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,850
This building was built
at the turn of the century.

601
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,663
It actually used to be a hospital.

602
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:01,628
See that carving up there?

603
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,230
It's over a hundred years old.

604
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:05,459
My Great Grandfather loved cats.

605
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,364
Compared to the clubhouse, this
all looks practically brand new.

606
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:10,809
It's incredible.

607
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,675
And I'm guessing your part
of the reason why.

608
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:14,550
Uh-huh.

609
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,962
So your Grandfather was a doctor.

610
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:18,874
Was your dad a doctor too?

611
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,571
Uh-uh.  He was the captain of a ship.

615
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,756
So your mom married a sailor.

616
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,920
My Grandpa and Grand, they didn't
approve of the marriage

617
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:45,037
and so they tried to stop
it from happening.

618
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:49,036
But my mom wouldn't let anything
stand in the way of true love.

619
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,731

Uh-huh.

622
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,565
And your dad, he taught you
how to use the signal flags?

623
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,783
Yeah he did. When I was just a girl.

624
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,883
He said they helped him
find his way back to us.

625
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,482
So I raised them every day.

626
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:19,156
That was at our old house.

627
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,226
I raise them from the balcony
until his ship docked again.

628
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:25,631
Everyday.

629
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,611
Every single day.

630
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,438
Then, we got news
about his ship.

631
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,510
That it sank during the Korean war.

632
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,482
They never found him and that was that.

633
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:41,955
But I kept raising the flags

634
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,801
hoping they might help him find me.

635
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:47,692
And when we moved here, I was so
upset I couldn't stop crying.

636
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:49,360
There was nowhere 
 to raise the flags.

637
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:51,120
I felt so lost.

638
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,997
So Grandpa built
me that flagpole.

639
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:10,395
We could use a little light.

640
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,478
Grandmother said, this used
to be my Grandfather's office.

641
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,897
But now it's sorta' becomes
my mom's private study.

642
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,024
She sure likes to read.

643
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,361
This is your family?

644
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,612
Yes.

645
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,739
Your father?

646
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,082
Uh-uh.

647
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,917
That's my Grandfather.

648
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,819
My dad's right there.

649
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,225
Handsome isn't he?

650
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:41,374
That's from around the 
 time they got married.

651
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,714
Now this is the photo
I really love.

652
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:57,055
Υuichiro Sawamura?

653
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,939
That's my dad name. My mom
kept the name Matsuzaki.

654
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,441
Umi, come on, your gonna
miss Miki's speech.

655
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:06,903
Ok, coming. We better get back.

656
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:20,739
Thanks for coming.

657
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:26,478
Goodbye.

658
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:57,839
Hay, I'm home.

659
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,630
You're late.

660
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,134
When your late your mother worries.

661
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:13,915
Mmm.

662
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,265
Shun, would you like some dinner?

663
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:25,128
I ate already.

Υuichiro Sawamura...

670
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:18,181
Welcome.

671
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:20,910
Thanks for coming.

672
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:25,863
Ohh!

673
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:31,023
We members of the Latin Quarter
welcome, all volunteers.

674
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:33,485
And for offering
to help us to restore

675
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:36,792
and preserve this treasured
and magnificent cultural landmark,

676
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:38,741
we humbly salute you.

677
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,739
Ohh!

678
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,940
Fellow club members, are you ready
to fight for what you cherish?

679
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:51,704
Yeah!

680
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,819
Let's get to work!

681
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,343
No! My hut!

682
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:14,480
- No exceptions.
- That's the rule.

683
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:17,084
Ok men. Lift.

684
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,416
Hay watch out.

685
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,803
No, no, no! The rail!...

686
00:43:34,538 --> 00:43:35,772
Watch out below!

687
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,443
- Aah!-Ahh!
- Ahh!

688
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,651
Hey, your welcome.

689
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,056
1st year math... 2nd year math...
Wow, these are really old exams.

690
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,850
We use all these for the
mock test we print.

691
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,480
Woa! This is Miki's math final.
She got a perfect score.

692
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:11,516
Oh.

693
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:21,241
I gotta go.

694
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,818
Yamazaki, take over for me will you?

695
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,662
Sure thing.

696
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:29,918
Here Umi.

697
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,309
Huh? Oh!

698
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:33,836
Mizunuma said to toss
anything we don't need.

699
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:36,131
No reason to get sentimental.

700
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,639
Ugh, what a mess.

701
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,766
Didn't you guys ever clean this place?

702
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,394
Nope, and neither did the guys before us.

703
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:50,851
Eugh.

704
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:53,721
I think tomorrow we better
bring the badminton team.

705
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,525
We love badminton.

706
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,466
Wow its really hot.

707
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,209
Fire often is.

708
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,798
Sora, its time to go home now.

709
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,059
Okay.

710
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,492
I'm just gonna stay
a little while longer.

711
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:33,612
Bye.

712
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,498
So what's going on between you and Umi?

713
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:56,406
Uh, nothing's going on.

714
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,744
I'll see you tomorrow.

715
00:45:59,747 --> 00:46:00,815
Yeah.

716
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,814
Father, there something
I would like to ask you.

717
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,651
I have to concentrate so make it short.

718
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:07,698
Υuichiro Sawamura, is the man in this
photo and he's my real father right?

719
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,330
We've already discussed all of this.

720
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:18,876
You're my son and that's that.

721
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,609
Hum.

722
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,877
We didn't know what to think
the night he brought you.

723
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:07,216
We had recently lost a child of our own and
were struggling through a difficult time.

724
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:15,936
Sawamura came to our
door with you in his arms

725
00:48:16,141 --> 00:48:18,922
and a copy of his family
register in his pocket.

726
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,779
The war had taken its toll.

727
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:24,989
He was going off to sea and his wife
was unable to care for you.

728
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:26,908
Before I knew it,

729
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:30,060
your mother had you
in her arms, nursing you.

730
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,915
She wouldn't let you go.

731
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,746
Sawamura was a good sailor.

732
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:41,500
In the Korean war he was on the supply
ship that sank and all of the men died.

733
00:48:42,205 --> 00:48:44,665
He sent money and asked about you often.

734
00:48:46,779 --> 00:48:48,940
You remind me of him
more and more everyday.

735
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:52,315
But you will always be our son.

736
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:57,144
Thank you father.

737
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:23,566
Sachiko do you see it? Is there any answer?

738
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:24,974
Not yet.

739
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,307
I guess its not coming by today.

Umi, come on in.

743
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,702
You're really leaving aren't you?

744
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,704
We all have to move on don't we.

745
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,786
I wish I could see you off.

746
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:46,210
It's ok, I know you have to get to school.

747
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,544
I'm going to miss you.

748
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,569
I'll drop by now and then.
Now, go, before I start crying.

749
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,231
Uh-huh.

Oh.

775
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,895
Ok, I'm confused. Why are you mad at me?

776
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,576
Υuichiro Sawamura,
is my real father.

777
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:27,342
Huh?

778
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,872
It's like a cheap melodrama.

779
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,376
I don't understand.

780
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,668
I didn't want to believe it either. But
I checked with city hall and it's true.

781
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:39,858
No.

782
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,260
Umi, we're brother and sister.

783
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,183
So what do we do now?

784
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,270
I guess, we stopped feeling how we feel.

785
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,030
We'll just have to go
back to being friends.

786
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,680
Hey, Sora, did something
happen to Umi at school today?

787
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,684
I don't think so. At least
not that I'm aware of.

788
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,686
Are you certain?

789
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,772
That dinner was surprisingly odd.

790
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,816
And she was soaking wet.

791
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,773
Something must've happened.

792
00:54:41,776 --> 00:54:44,657
Umi's never made a bad
meal that I can remember.

793
00:54:45,152 --> 00:54:45,963
- Mmm.

794
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:46,885
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

795
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,165
It's me Umi, the bath's ready.

796
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,668
Not tonight.

797
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,671
You ok?

798
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,762
Umi?

799
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,695
Umi.

800
00:55:53,576 --> 00:55:54,701
Umi!

801
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:46,151
Good morning, Umi.
Did you sleep well?

802
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,655
Mom? Your home. When did you get back?

803
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,784
Don't be silly. You know
I've been here all along.

804
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,861
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.

805
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,426
Come give me a hand.

806
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,806
Dad is that you?

807
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,686
Your flags led me home Umi.

808
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,993
You're such a big girl now.

809
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:11,776
As Latin Quarter alumni,
we are more than happy to help.

810
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:14,775
And if you need more supplies,
Jiro here is in construction.

811
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:16,485
So just give him a call.

812
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:17,703
Not for free!

813
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:20,753
No? Why not? You told me
business was booming didn't you?

814
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,474
Goodbye and good luck to ya'.

815
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,226
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

816
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:26,142
That was cool.

817
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,017
Good thing we went to Miki's party.

818
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,205
That Umi comes through for us again.

819
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,734
She must be our goddess of good luck.

820
00:59:33,234 --> 00:59:33,685
- Hi guys.

821
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:34,291
- Hi guys. - Morning.

822
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:34,908
- Hi guys. - Morning.
- Morning.

823
00:59:36,461 --> 00:59:39,087
Wow, this looks like a real
construction site.

824
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,076
- You call that plastering?
- Well ah…

825
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,795
Give me that trowel and let
me show you how it's done.

826
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:55,229
First you have to swirl it into a smooth
paste to get all the lumps out.

827
00:59:57,146 --> 00:59:58,435
Then up,

828
00:59:58,509 --> 01:00:00,103
over, left,

829
01:00:00,244 --> 01:00:01,682
right, left,

830
01:00:01,707 --> 01:00:03,910
right, spin and up.

831
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,602
Awesome!

832
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:09,315
Yeah, they don't call my dad
the plaster king for nothing.

833
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:11,458
You are beautiful.

834
01:00:11,505 --> 01:00:12,924
What did you say?

835
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,315
The wall, I was talking to the wall.

836
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:15,911
No you weren't.

837
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,327
Hey.

838
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,787
It's already looking better.

839
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,516
Sorry you had to stay late.

840
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:31,212
I hope you won't be in trouble.

841
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,770
Sora actually agreed to cover for me.

842
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,693
Anything you need help with Shun.

843
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:39,278
Mmm, ah, well.

844
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,803
These papers need transcribing.

845
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:42,873
Ok.

846
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,254
So, is that all you need from me?

847
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,639
Yup', that's all I can think of.
At least for now.

848
01:00:51,642 --> 01:00:53,935
- Ok then.
- Ok.

849
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:05,528
So, everything cool between you two?

850
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:09,521
All cool.

Hooray!

864
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,763
Umi, don't go anywhere!

865
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,294
Shun, we're holding an emergency meeting.

866
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:52,316
The board just voted to tear down the
Latin Quarter over the summer break!

867
01:02:52,573 --> 01:02:55,753
I did, I tried reasoning with them.
Believe me.

868
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,375
But the principle says,
it's out of his hands.

869
01:02:58,406 --> 01:03:00,148
What about all our hard work!

870
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:02,005
They decided without even looking at it?

871
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:04,506
The massive ego's wouldn't
fit through the doors.

872
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:05,509
Right!

873
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,967
Let's start a revolt!

874
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,213
Why don't we just take it
straight to the chairman.

875
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:14,332
The chairman's running
a huge company in Tokyo.

876
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:15,667
We'll never get to see him.

877
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:17,623
In the words of Plato:

878
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,334
Tyranny must not prevail.

879
01:03:19,446 --> 01:03:21,447
Go! Flight the good fight!

880
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,841
Let's go to Tokyo and make our case.

881
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,047
That's right Shun.

882
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:29,009
Please!

883
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:29,922
You have to.

884
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:35,543
Only, if our goddess of good luck joins us.

885
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,563
Umi! Of course she'll go.

886
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,201
Hey Umi, good luck tomorrow.

887
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:52,490
Mmm.

888
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:09,690
Good morning thanks for waiting.

889
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:11,067
You're welcome.

890
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,824
We're very happy you're coming with us.

891
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,851
Me too. It'll help take my
mind off... other... things.

892
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,229
Yes, ok, let's go.

[A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPIC,
MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL]

894
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:06,400
Well, into the breech?

895
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,536
Uh-huh.

896
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,898
Students from the Konαn Academy.

897
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,941
That's right.

898
01:05:12,777 --> 01:05:14,391
You don't have an appointment?

899
01:05:14,394 --> 01:05:16,937
No sir. We're appealing directly
to Mr. Tokumaru.

900
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,623
Something about a direct appeal.

901
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,792
Nope. No, they don't seem like radicals.

902
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,961
There's three of them.

903
01:05:26,017 --> 01:05:27,518
All right, I'll tell them.

904
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,973
Take the elevator at the end
of the hall to the fourth floor

905
01:05:31,976 --> 01:05:33,471
and his office will be on the right.

906
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,283
Thank you very much for your help.

907
01:05:35,286 --> 01:05:38,344
Don't forget to sign in.
And next time make an appointment.

908
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,278
Are you those students from Konan?

909
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,821
Ma'am.

910
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,325
Mr. Tokumaru is a very busy man.

911
01:05:55,396 --> 01:05:58,857
He doesn't normally see people
who haven't made an appointment.

912
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,413
Yes ma'am, we understand.

913
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,737
But speaking frankly ma'am,

914
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,873
we didn't actually believe we would get
an appointment if we called to make one.

915
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:06,030
Ma'am.

916
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,306
Your probably
wasting your time...

917
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:10,086
But since you seemed determined.

918
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,072
You can wait on the bench as long
as you don't disturb anyone.

919
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,579
We thank you for your time ma'am.
We thank you for your time ma'am.

920
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:18,974
I wanna hear Nagashima's heavy.
He could win another MVP.

921
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,628
He scored a lotta' goals.

922
01:06:20,631 --> 01:06:23,803
"Goals???" Have you even seen baseball?

923
01:06:30,295 --> 01:06:31,633
Thank you ma'am.

924
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:52,994
Ooh!

925
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,434
- Let's go get a drink.
- Quick before he makes us stay.

926
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,240
Your still here? Well, come on in.

927
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,875
Thank you.

928
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,268
- Ah yes. Right.

929
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,576
- Ah yes. Right.
- Thank you for seeing us.

930
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,486
Uh-huh.

931
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:26,945
Yes.

932
01:07:27,094 --> 01:07:29,266
Uh... hang on.

933
01:07:29,373 --> 01:07:30,654
Have a seat.

934
01:07:30,657 --> 01:07:32,658
I'll be with you gentlemen in a minute.

935
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:37,927
Alright I've made my decision.
I can't agree to that right now.

936
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,307
Yes.

937
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,213
Bye.

938
01:07:46,064 --> 01:07:47,270
Sit down.

939
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:50,273
Why are you kids here
today and not in school?

940
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,275
Because sir, we escaped.

941
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:55,945
Escaped huh. I did
that a lot myself.

942
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:59,803
Well I guess you're here to talk
to me about that old clubhouse.

943
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,321
Yes, we've come to you directly to ask
you to see the building for yourself.

944
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:04,892
We've put a lot of work into it.

945
01:08:04,976 --> 01:08:07,460
Come see what we've done
that all were asking.

946
01:08:08,925 --> 01:08:10,500
What year are you young lady?

947
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,755
Second year. My name is Umi Matsuzaki.

948
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,257
Sir, that building is more
than just a building.

949
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,521
And tell me, how is it "more
than just a building?"

950
01:08:21,322 --> 01:08:23,055
Because, we all love it.

951
01:08:23,135 --> 01:08:25,738
And it makes us feel
connected to our past.

952
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:27,801
Like we belong to something.

953
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,815
"Connected to our past."

954
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,090
Hum...

955
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:35,488
May I ask what your father did?

956
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,239
He was a captain...
on a supply ship..

957
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,825
But his ship sank during the Korean war.

958
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:49,218
It made a delivery and were coming home.

959
01:08:51,456 --> 01:08:52,901
But his ship hit a mine.

960
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:14,686
Hum.

961
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,526
A supply ship?

962
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,861
Yes sir.

963
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,530
I'm sorry.

964
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:25,535
I know it must've been very hard
for your mother, raising you on her own.

965
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:28,200
She obviously did a fine job.

966
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,540
Thank you.

967
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:34,308
All right, I'll go.

968
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,215
Thank you Mr. Chairman!

969
01:09:41,517 --> 01:09:43,184
So tomorrow.

970
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:44,554
How's it look?

971
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,724
Right, that's in the evening.

972
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,560
Move the rest to Friday.

973
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,012
Now, I'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

974
01:09:55,047 --> 01:09:59,091
I'll handel everything with your principal,
the rest will be your job.

975
01:10:04,139 --> 01:10:05,874
I actually didn't think that would work.

976
01:10:05,877 --> 01:10:07,727
Yeah, I'm not sure it has.

977
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,777
Well, I'm glad we came.

978
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:16,912
I promised my mom I'd go visit my uncle.
See you tomorrow.

What do you think you'll do,
you know after graduation?

983
01:10:56,942 --> 01:11:00,611
Mmm, well, we don't have much money
so probably National University.

984
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:02,947
What will happen to The Weekly?

985
01:11:03,615 --> 01:11:06,617
I'll have to find somebody
dedicated enough to take over.

986
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,392
What about you?

987
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,594
I haven't decided but...

988
01:11:11,972 --> 01:11:15,016
I'm sort of thinking I might
like to be a doctor.

989
01:11:15,097 --> 01:11:15,980
Mmm.

990
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:24,492
Shun, are you...

991
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:26,762
Are you the one who wrote
that poem in the paper?

992
01:11:26,863 --> 01:11:28,004
Uh-huh.

993
01:11:28,182 --> 01:11:30,950
I saw those flags every morning
from my dad's tugboat,

994
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,334
and I found out it was you.

995
01:11:33,645 --> 01:11:36,814
Well, I can't really see any of
the boats from the garden.

996
01:11:37,254 --> 01:11:41,905
So that's why, I never noticed there
was somebody out there answering me.

997
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:54,968
Can I tell you something?

998
01:11:54,971 --> 01:11:55,825
Huh.

999
01:11:57,752 --> 01:12:00,337
Those flags that I raise...

1000
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:06,332
There a message to my father that's
says, "I pray for your safe return."

1001
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:08,586
But he knows he can
never come back to me.

1002
01:12:08,589 --> 01:12:10,803
So what I think he did
was send you instead.

1003
01:12:15,645 --> 01:12:18,022
And I don't really know
what to do because we're...

1004
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:19,025
Umi...

1005
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:22,359
Look I know we can't do anything
about it but just know

1006
01:12:22,362 --> 01:12:24,196
I love you.

1007
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:35,831
And I love you too.

1008
01:12:56,269 --> 01:12:57,728
Ok, I'm home.

1009
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,284
Mom, your home!

1010
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:08,043
Umi, it's good to be back.

1011
01:13:09,383 --> 01:13:11,242
Tell me about America and your study's?

1012
01:13:11,282 --> 01:13:14,159
Oh, I learned something new every day.

1013
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:16,835
But mostly how much I missed home.

1014
01:13:16,838 --> 01:13:18,374
And we missed you.

1015
01:13:18,414 --> 01:13:20,918
- This is the best thing I ever ate!
- Uh-huh.

1016
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:22,628
It's beef jerky.

1017
01:13:23,046 --> 01:13:23,963
So is it pork?

1018
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:27,091
Sachiko, beef means cow.

1019
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,004
Mom?

1020
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:44,934
What's wrong? Why are you awake?

1021
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:51,534
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

1022
01:13:51,783 --> 01:13:53,450
Of course Umi.

1023
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,459
It must be the time change.

1024
01:14:00,762 --> 01:14:04,205
I can't sleep, so I thought I'd organize
these books I got in America.

1025
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:08,090
There's this boy at school
his name is Shun Kazama.

1026
01:14:11,193 --> 01:14:13,940
I'm so confused because he
came here for Miki's party

1027
01:14:13,964 --> 01:14:15,683
and I showed him
the photograph of dad

1028
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:17,598
and he had the exact same photo.

1029
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:20,978
And he said his father and my father
were one in the same.

1030
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:41,498
This photo?

1031
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:46,795
Uh-huh.

1032
01:14:47,339 --> 01:14:51,675
Well, I knew the day would come when
I would have to explain this to you.

1033
01:14:52,551 --> 01:14:56,400
I told you the story about how your
father and I eloped. Didn't I?

1034
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:57,804
Uh-huh.

1035
01:14:57,807 --> 01:14:59,620
And you remember where we used to live?

1036
01:14:59,623 --> 01:15:02,086
Downtown in that second-floor apartment

1037
01:15:02,202 --> 01:15:04,304
with the balcony off the living room.

1038
01:15:05,023 --> 01:15:07,733
We were newly married
and I was pregnant with you.

1039
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:09,737
And your dad was 
away at sea a lot,

1040
01:15:09,745 --> 01:15:12,938
and I was working on my 
degree studying very hard.

1041
01:15:13,865 --> 01:15:18,202
I was determined to do well in school,
in case something happened.

1042
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,972
Our lives were already complicated.

1043
01:15:24,974 --> 01:15:28,263
When your father returned
home that night with a baby.

1044
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:29,525
Hey?

1045
01:15:34,678 --> 01:15:35,844
Welcome...

1046
01:15:36,846 --> 01:15:39,223
Υuichiro, whose baby is that?

1047
01:15:40,058 --> 01:15:42,726
He's Τachibana's.
We need to take him.

1048
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:43,942
What?

1049
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:49,233
Τachibana was killed in an accident
aboard a repatriation ship.

1050
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:53,028
His poor wife died from 
complications during childbirth.

1051
01:15:53,113 --> 01:15:56,477
The rest of his family
was killed at Nagasaki.

1052
01:15:56,571 --> 01:15:59,673
I won't have this child
sent to an orphanage.

1053
01:16:01,037 --> 01:16:06,250
Your father had legally adopted a 
newborn baby without even asking me.

1054
01:16:06,584 --> 01:16:10,754
The war had just ended. And things
like this was were happening everywhere.

1055
01:16:11,786 --> 01:16:17,052
Still, there was just no way I could give
the child the love and care it deserved.

1056
01:16:17,429 --> 01:16:22,057
One of Υuichiro's friend recently lost
a child, so we gave the baby to him.

1057
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:26,061
How is he? Tell me, is he doing well?

1058
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:28,102
Uh-huh.

1059
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,774
I'm glad.

1060
01:16:31,568 --> 01:16:36,113
Your father was impulsive but he always
did what he thought was right.

1061
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,128
It was a relief to see the baby
end up with a loving family.

1062
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:46,957
Are you absolutely sure that Shun
couldn't possibly be dads real son?

1063
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:50,294
I don't think I ever considered it.

1064
01:16:50,841 --> 01:16:52,384
Why do you ask?

1065
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,816
Don't tell me he actually
looks like your father.

1066
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,588
Uh-huh.

1067
01:17:05,927 --> 01:17:07,219
Oh Umi.

1068
01:17:09,322 --> 01:17:10,892
Sweetheart.

1069
01:17:41,805 --> 01:17:43,967
- See you tonight.
- Yeah mom, see you tonight.

1070
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:45,682
Have a great day girls.

1071
01:18:32,843 --> 01:18:34,163
Mmm.

1072
01:18:48,697 --> 01:18:50,914
Hello again Mr. Chairman and welcome.

1073
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:52,740
Egh.

1074

[LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES
CHAIRMAN ΤOKUMΑRU]

1075
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,383
Never knew this existed
underneath all that dust.

1076
01:19:20,386 --> 01:19:22,279
Oh yes sir, they've done a good job.

1077
01:19:23,948 --> 01:19:26,283
And what is your club studying young man?

1078
01:19:26,409 --> 01:19:30,245
Sir! The astronomy club has been studying
sunspots for the last 10 years. Sir!

1079
01:19:30,327 --> 01:19:32,052
The last 10 years huh?

1080
01:19:32,055 --> 01:19:34,249
Tell me, what discoveries have you made?

1081
01:19:34,762 --> 01:19:38,689
That the sun is very very old
and our life span is very very short.

1082
01:19:38,924 --> 01:19:40,791
No discoveries so far! Sir!

1083
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,093
Honest answer.

1084
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:51,808
Philosophy club?

1085
01:19:51,935 --> 01:19:55,228
Seems to me you could really benefit
from a brand new clubhouse.

1086
01:19:56,522 --> 01:19:58,982
Something nice for your junior members?

1087
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:03,487
We as human beings have complicated
every simple gift of the gods.

1088
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:05,531
Quoting Diogenes!

1089
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,497
I must say principle these students
of yours are very very impressive.

1090
01:20:13,748 --> 01:20:15,856
I'm gonna take a little look inside.

1091
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:17,902
- Shun Kazama?
- Yes.

1092
01:20:19,762 --> 01:20:21,332
Well where's Plato?

1093
01:20:21,403 --> 01:20:22,973
And what's that dog doing in there?

1094
01:20:24,764 --> 01:20:26,326
Hello, dad? What's wrong?

1095
01:20:26,552 --> 01:20:29,012
The third man in that photo
is here at the harbor.

1096
01:20:29,305 --> 01:20:31,348
I know he can tell you about your father.

1097
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:35,978
But his ship is leaving at… four o'clock.

1098
01:20:36,043 --> 01:20:38,369
And he'll be away for several months.
Get here!

1099
01:20:38,372 --> 01:20:39,726

1109

1110

1112
01:21:48,926 --> 01:21:52,988
Students, while I am very
impressed with your dedication,

1113
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:57,103
it doesn't change the fact,
that a new building is needed.

1114
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:03,774
So I guess that makes it my job
to find a different place to put it.

1115
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,278
All right!

1116
01:22:08,742 --> 01:22:10,868
Umi, you did it.

1117
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,783
We all did it.

1118
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:15,619
Thank you, thank you sir.

1119
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:17,685
Hooray!

1120
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:24,461
On to the next experiment.

1121
01:22:25,325 --> 01:22:27,964
None of this would have happened without our goddess Umi.

1122
01:22:28,966 --> 01:22:31,468
Thanks but I... really didn't do anything.

1123
01:22:31,761 --> 01:22:34,421
Come on, quit being so modest
and say you're welcome.

1124
01:22:34,465 --> 01:22:35,382
She's right.

1125
01:22:35,473 --> 01:22:37,193
You are heaven sent!

1126
01:22:37,196 --> 01:22:38,241
Thank you, Umi.

1127
01:22:38,389 --> 01:22:39,389
Thank you.

1128
01:22:39,769 --> 01:22:41,520
She's our little angel, Umi.

1129
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:43,647
Umi!

1130
01:22:45,725 --> 01:22:47,155
You have to come!

1131
01:22:49,403 --> 01:22:50,987
The perfect couple.

1132
01:22:51,381 --> 01:22:52,248
Good luck!

1133
01:22:53,658 --> 01:22:54,925
Sorry sir,

1134
01:22:55,152 --> 01:22:58,495
I am certain Umi and Shun wish they could
be here to thank you personally.

1135
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,539
But urgent matters have taken them away.

1136
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:04,756
Urgent matters eh.
Ah, to be young.

1137
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:10,507
Hay Shun!

1138
01:23:10,807 --> 01:23:12,766
Gen! Can you give us a ride?

1139
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,178
Umi!

1140
01:23:21,879 --> 01:23:22,856
Ahh!

1141
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:26,246
Umi, don't you worry and hang on.

1142
01:23:26,249 --> 01:23:27,860
I'll get you there with time to spare.

1143
01:23:38,732 --> 01:23:40,153
If we're going to make it we'd better run!

1144
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:40,755
Ok.

1145
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:42,205
Thanks Gen!

1146
01:23:43,624 --> 01:23:45,542
Sorry I could get you there, Umi!

1147
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:55,719
Shun. Hurry!

1148
01:23:57,553 --> 01:23:58,678
Thanks.

1149
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:29,294
That's my dad's tug.

1150
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:46,415
C'mon.

1151
01:24:56,322 --> 01:24:58,448
The kids are here to see you captain.

1152
01:25:07,611 --> 01:25:09,904
- Push our departure back 15.
- Ay.

1153
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:18,006
So when, you're my good
friend Τachibana's boy.

1154
01:25:18,009 --> 01:25:19,031
Yes sir.

1155
01:25:19,595 --> 01:25:22,138
And you must be
Sawamura's daughter.

1156
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:23,807
Pleasure to meet you both.

1157
01:25:39,427 --> 01:25:41,136
Your name is Shun, right?

1158
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:42,028
Yes sir.

1159
01:25:42,076 --> 01:25:44,828
Your father was Hiroshi Τachibana.

1160
01:25:45,121 --> 01:25:47,998
And that's him sitting in the front
row, fourth from the right.

1161
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:51,080
And sitting next to him is Sawamura.

1162
01:25:51,874 --> 01:25:55,078
We were just like brothers,
the three of us.

1163
01:25:55,381 --> 01:25:58,008
Τachibana, you should
take the seat of honor.

1164
01:25:58,134 --> 01:25:59,009
But why me?

1165
01:25:59,135 --> 01:26:01,344
Because you're our fearless leader.
You belong there.

1166
01:26:01,595 --> 01:26:04,014
If I'm your leader, we're in trouble.

1167
01:26:06,726 --> 01:26:09,352
Don't be the hero and die before me, ok.

1168
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:11,855
Same goes for you.

1169
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:13,888
Gentlemen, hold still.

1170
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:30,707
They were the best friend's a man ever had.
I think about them every day.

1171
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:34,671
They were brave and honest and I am
honored to have known them.

1172
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:40,075
When I look at you, what I see is 
the legacy of those two great man.

1173
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:43,678
And I know they would be very proud.
