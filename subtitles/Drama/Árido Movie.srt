1
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,108
Jonas, five minutes to go.

2
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,548
<i>Things are really heating up
in Brasilia.</i>

3
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,281
<i>It's confirmed that
a further three politicians...</i>

4
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,119
<i>whose names have
not been released...</i>

5
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,387
<i>may also be involved
in the irrigation fraud.</i>

6
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,724
<i>And speaking of the heat,
what's the forecast for tomorrow?</i>

7
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,533
<i>Not a lot of change.</i>

8
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,934
<i>On Friday, some heavy rain over
South and Southeast Brazil.</i>

9
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,406
<i>The large mass of dry air, causing
the long drought in the Northeast...</i>

10
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,842
<i>will remain.</i>

11
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,723
Just five minutes.
You're not that strong!

12
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,920
Jandira, same room as usual.

13
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,353
Six minutes then, Lázaro.

14
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,895
Home, Wedja!

15
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,633
- Jurandir, I only...
- Move, Wedja! Home!

16
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,463
- Let's go up!
- Do you hear me woman?

17
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,572
- You're not going anywhere!
- Oh, really?

18
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,341
You must be joking!

19
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:15,605
You keep your nose clean, I keep
mine. That's the way of the world.

20
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,046
Now, come on.
Stop that!

21
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,015
You fucking shit! Let's...

22
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,631
<i>No change in the large mass of
dry air causing this drought.</i>

23
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:50,263
ARIDO MOVIE

24
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,586
Could you switch down the volume?

25
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,124
Thanks.

26
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,826
Recife is hotter than ever,
or is it me?

27
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,334
Really sultry.

28
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,472
By the end of the day
you're done for.

29
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,173
And then,
there's the water problem.

30
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,213
Fuck me backwards! Excuse the
expression. But it's a real pain!

31
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,988
Water rationing! I don't get it.
Recife is surrounded by water...

32
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,717
and yet there's no water.
It really pisses me off.

33
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,526
A rifle-hot sun.

34
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,396
- What?
- Nothing.

35
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:43,743
How did it happen, Stella?
Was he really murdered?

36
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,308
I don't know.

37
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,352
They told me almost nothing.
And I didn't ask.

38
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,351
Your uncle Salustiano phoned.
At the request of your grandmother.

39
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,387
You know how he was. Any trouble,
and he was always mixed up in it.

40
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,460
I know nothing.
I can't even remember his face.

41
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:07,403
The last person in the world
I wanted to meet was your father.

42
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,972
You know that.

43
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,337
It's a shame what happened.

44
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,276
I feel sorry for you.

45
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,779
Don't know what else to say.

46
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,215
It's been ages since I saw
that family, thank God.

47
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,417
You want a whisky?

48
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,355
No thanks, mum.
I don't like drinking before I eat.

49
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,052
What São Paulo does to a person!

50
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,200
Mum. Dr. Feliciano has arrived
for the funeral.

51
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,874
That's all I know.

52
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,110
Salustiano told me that
Dona Carmo would only rest...

53
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,222
after I promised I'd convince you
to go to Lázaro's funeral.

54
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,624
Funny, isn't it?

55
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:40,492
But after all, you are her grandson.
And although you left long ago...

56
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,328
You should realize that
you are on TV almost everyday.

57
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,938
Funny.
It's never really occurred to me...

58
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,378
that dad and grandma
see me everyday.

59
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,214
Television turns you into a phantom.

60
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,611
You have no idea
the places you appear.

61
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,585
Anyway, you need to remember
that you're the star of Rocha.

62
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,880
The town celebrity!

63
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,419
I think I will have that whisky.

64
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,967
I'm so sorry, Márcio.

65
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,567
So sad!

66
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,238
Dona Carmo, my sympathies.

67
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,580
You can count on me for anything.

68
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,783
As if we needed this, Feliciano!

69
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,622
Look what they've done!

70
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,095
But life is just
one day after another.

71
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,690
And God, who has given me
so much joy...

72
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:54,600
- won't let things stay like this.
- You must remain strong.

73
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,075
Isn't he being buried today?
Wasn't that the plan?

74
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,141
I've already told her.
We shouldn't wait so long.

75
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,078
You can't put it off
for so long.

76
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,416
Salustiano is right.
The dead don't like long goodbyes.

77
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,615
It's already decided.

78
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:19,321
Only when Jonas arrives.
He's coming, isn't he, Salustiano?

79
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,329
They say he is.
They say he is.

80
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,193
BATH HOUSE BAR

81
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,944
For fuck's sake!

82
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,863
Have you decided?

83
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,997
The powder's a little bit rough.
Isn't, it?

84
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,670
I'm talking about the trip.
You're going or not?

85
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,807
We're thinking about
going with you.

86
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:40,570
There's no need. It's boring there.
And then for a funeral! No need.

87
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,771
No! We're going with you.
Are you going by car?

88
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,817
Don't know yet. But there's no need.
I prefer to go alone.

89
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,612
That's what friends are for.

90
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,950
Fuck off, Bob! He wants to be the
do-it-yourself man. Leave it out!

91
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,150
I'm pushing off.
I'm fucking knackered.

92
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,053
We'll sort it out.

93
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,091
I need to talk to the office.

94
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,425
I don't know who is going
to replace me.

95
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,762
Tomorrow we see what we're
going to do.

96
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,561
Stay a little longer.
Just a little.

97
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,640
Stay. I promise I'll be
as quiet as a fish.

98
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,708
We'll talk tomorrow. All right?

99
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,377
- Right.
- See you, man!

100
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,977
You're too fucking much.
You're a fucking bastard, Bob.

101
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,154
Now what have I done?

102
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,916
- The very essence of sensitivity!
- A real sweetie, huh?

103
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,029
- Watch out! You off your head?
- Sorry. I'm really sorry!

104
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,530
You see that?

105
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,762
God, Wedja!

106
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,727
What've you got yourself
caught up in?

107
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,237
Not so much you,
but your brother...

108
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,506
You think we can get
Jurandir away?

109
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:27,375
We'll see.
Why get mixed up with Lázaro?

110
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,787
You never imagined Jurandir
would accept that, did you?

111
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,752
Anyone except Lázaro.

112
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,593
Wedja, life can be fun...

113
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,632
but you've got to walk
as if you were treading on eggs.

114
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,858
Not to get mixed up in trouble.

115
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,732
And you go rushing straight in!

116
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,243
Just like your mother.

117
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,987
Pass me the food,
I'm off to the pasture.

118
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:22,536
I hope this helps to get Jurandir
out of trouble. What's the matter?

119
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,108
OK.

120
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,248
I'll be back soon.
Keep your nose clean.

121
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,812
If anyone asks,
I've gone to meditate...

122
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,817
because the world's gone
off the rails.

123
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,219
Don't serve any drink.
Not even for the CG boys.

124
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,620
Special orders.

125
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,203
Wedja, prohibition!

126
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:10,014
I once read that the most important
invention ever is page numbering.

127
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,452
- Toilet flush.
- Plastic!

128
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:17,721
Fuck off! Falcão, I read it
for fuck's sake! Don't fuck about!

129
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,096
The toilet flush was the greatest
invention of the last century!

130
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,861
Maybe in the last century!

131
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,038
The greatest invention ever
is page numbering!

132
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:35,476
Page numbering, paper, toilet flush.
Who fucking cares!

133
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,139
- Then there's cotton buds.
- Fucking cotton buds!

134
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,477
Beto!

135
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,033
Mum...

136
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,065
do you really think
this is the best way?

137
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,476
Shouldn't we sort it out,
our way?

138
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,505
He's no better than anyone else,
and he has the right.

139
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,343
He'll see everything our way.

140
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,420
He will.

141
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,468
- Márcio.
- I'm outside with the boys, mum.

142
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,304
Call me if you need me.

143
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,702
Márcio Greyck, Márcio Greyck!
Open your eyes!

144
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,850
It'll be all right, you'll see!

145
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:56,186
I think Jonas is going to fuck up
everything. It sticks here.

146
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,732
- And the stink?
- It's fucking rotten!

147
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:21,316
There are many ways to roll a joint.
I prefer the classical way.

148
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,418
You give the little 'shrimp'
a good rub...

149
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,818
and it has to be very dry.

150
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,624
And preferably...

151
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,891
the weed has to come from Cabrobó,
the famous "goat's shit".

152
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,829
Real rat poison!

153
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,303
You take the skin...

154
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,970
and throw everything inside.

155
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,208
Work it over a little,
taking out the seeds.

156
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,246
Seeds only give you a headache
and make it bitter.

157
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,077
They make it bitter.

158
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,852
Then comes the most
important factor - rolling.

159
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,457
If you don't roll
it really well...

160
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,424
then it's difficult to light.

161
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,225
And don't make it too thin.

162
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,404
Thin spliffs are for
the fags down south.

163
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,139
You smoke to get high,
and to get high...

164
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,311
it's got to be thick.

165
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:30,682
Then you close one end and leave
the other free to press it down.

166
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,092
Push it nice and tight.

167
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,858
Take off this piece...

168
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,796
light it...

169
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:50,839
You're a real crack.
Pass the ball, King Pelé.

170
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,709
Keep this one, fag.
There's a thicker one for me!

171
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,489
Guys... Guys...

172
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,254
I think we should go after Jonas.
He's really upset. No, thanks.

173
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,733
I'm worried about him too.

174
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,868
And I love the hinterland!
It's great!

175
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,405
The 'shrimps' there are this big!
Look the size!

176
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,546
What are you on about!
Jonas needs his friends. Let's go!

177
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,074
- Let's go.
- Come on!

178
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,529
How are you, Vera?
Looking for Jonas?

179
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,367
We said we'd give him
a lift to Rocha.

180
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,671
- He's not answering his mobile.
- He arrived strangely last night...

181
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,542
and left early this morning.
I hope he calls me.

182
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,545
He went after his father.
But I think he w'ont find him.

183
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,814
Well... I'd better go.
The boys are waiting.

184
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,460
Come round some time.
You only appear when he's here.

185
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,563
OK, madam.
I'll call round. Bye!

186
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,628
You see her? She was always
with us, even called me auntie.

187
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,036
Now she only comes when
Jonas comes. She calls me ma'am.

188
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,843
The only people that call me that
are the people here.

189
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,984
- She's such a pain!
- Where's the weather man?

190
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,751
- Spit it out Verinha.
- Madam says he's already left.

191
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:01,202
"And Jesus,
when he was baptized...

192
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,943
went up out of the water,
and lo the heavens...

193
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:12,615
were opened unto him...

194
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:18,282
and he saw
the Spirit of God...

195
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,025
descending like a dove.

196
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,593
And lo a voice
from Heaven saying:

197
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:37,836
This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased. "

198
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,142
He went by car?

199
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,785
That's why even Lázaro
couldn't take this woman.

200
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,454
A real fucking pain!

201
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,488
Let's get going?

202
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,784
I need to stop at home
to take a shower.

203
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,993
Hold on Bob!
There's no time for that!

204
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,290
If we're going to lend him support,
it has to be now.

205
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,333
- Take a shower on the way.
- They don't have any water there.

206
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,670
"The Pharisees also with
the Sadducees came...

207
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:16,143
and tempting him that he would
show them a sign from heaven.

208
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,881
He answered and said unto them,
When it is evening...

209
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,690
ye say, "It will be" fair weather:
For the sky is red.

210
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,094
And in the morning...

211
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:34,091
it will be foul weather today:
For the sky is lowring.

212
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,363
O ye hypocrites.

213
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:41,704
Ye can discern
the face of the sky...

214
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,338
but can ye not discern
the signs of the time".

215
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,970
Matthew.

216
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,073
Oh, glory!

217
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,588
There's no time to have a shower?
You're both too edgy.

218
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,125
What use would it be, Bob?

219
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,632
By this time there is
no water at your place.

220
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,997
Don't fuck about, Bob.

221
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,503
You were never really
that fond of water.

222
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,203
Let's go!

223
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,244
If it's philosophical, I'll disappear
without a trace of smell.

224
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,558
Concentrate, Madame Bernadette.

225
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,528
I'm passing you
my positive energies.

226
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,670
What's going on? Predict.
Concentrate. Strength!

227
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:51,137
The vibrations are beginning.
What's happening?

228
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,141
That young man, Madame Bernadette.
This city boy.

229
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,473
He's got a backpack!

230
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:01,049
What's in the backpack?
On his back.

231
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,221
This young man in front of me.

232
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,616
What is he carrying?

233
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,816
The city boy is carrying...

234
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,186
- clothes...
- Clothes!

235
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,295
...doubts.
- Doubts!

236
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,658
Doubts!
Very good!

237
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,061
And in front!
On his arm.

238
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,870
Time.
What is he carrying in front?

239
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,062
- In front?
- In front, Madame Bernadete.

240
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,236
No one escapes the inevitable!

241
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,850
This young man has no future!

242
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,747
It's like this...

243
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,657
I want Jurandir at any cost!

244
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,595
He's here.

245
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,657
He can't leave here
without me knowing.

246
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,390
He's not invisible!

247
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:54,496
I want to see him six foot under.

248
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,667
No sweat. No bother.

249
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,875
I've talked to uncle Salustiano,
and he agrees.

250
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,539
Jucão!

251
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:12,921
Go over to the farm and see
if you can calm things down.

252
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,122
The work must go on.

253
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,497
Keep the CG boys occupied
so that they don't get any ideas.

254
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,527
Don't want anyone
causing trouble.

255
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,132
Get it?

256
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,768
Move!

257
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,233
<i>It's 8 o'clock here in Vietnam...</i>

258
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,774
<i>and our team is trying to get used
to the time difference.</i>

259
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,868
It's mad!

260
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,707
There it's 8 o'clock at night,
and here it's 9 in the morning.

261
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,313
It's a real science!

262
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,559
A beer, please.

263
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,824
- What?
- A beer.

264
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,857
Remember me?

265
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,684
- Sorry?
- Remember me?

266
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,596
You knocked my drink
all over me yesterday.

267
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,159
And you screamed at me.
Sorry.

268
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,704
Aren't you Jonas Andrade?
The weatherman?

269
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,976
I thought it was you, but it's not
easy to recognise a weatherman...

270
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,150
without his jacket
and digital clouds.

271
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,287
I must be the only person to be seen
on TV everyday...

272
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,117
who remains anonymous
outside the studio.

273
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,952
Is that good or bad?

274
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,458
I find it more or less good.

275
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,295
Soledad.

276
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,802
Pleasure. Jonas.

277
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,469
What're you doing here?

278
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,698
Wow!
Is this game live or indirect?

279
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,983
I was born near here,
in Rocha.

280
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,493
I went to Recife and from there
to São Paulo, where I live.

281
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,332
Rocha?

282
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,724
- I'm going there.
- Really?

283
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,694
- You're on the bus?
- Yes.

284
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,164
If you want,
I could give you a lift.

285
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,004
I'd better stay on the bus.
I'm in a hurry to get to Rocha.

286
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,841
I only have to stop off quickly
in Deserto Feliz for an interview.

287
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,979
It'll be quick! Really.

288
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,945
And I'd enjoy the company.

289
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,558
No, thanks. I'd better go by bus.
It's leaving in a minute.

290
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,659
It's much quicker by car.

291
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,688
- Aren't you in a hurry?
- Yes.

292
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,494
So, It'll cost me nothing.
On the contrary.

293
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,728
I normally travel alone...

294
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,200
but I miss having someone
to talk to.

295
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,609
To talk about things as we go.

296
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,846
All right then. If it's not going
to put you out, I accept.

297
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,880
- Did you leave anything in the bus?
- I've got my jacket.

298
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,587
I think I left the digital clouds!

299
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,825
That was almost funny.

300
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,818
Soledad!

301
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,890
Why Soledad?

302
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,589
Why not?

303
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,300
- Dona Carmo!
- Father Antonio...

304
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,401
I give great regard
to your words.

305
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,472
I thank you for your concern
and your work.

306
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,919
But this is not a request.
I am determined...

307
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,722
to wait until
my grandson gets here.

308
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,452
Salustiano phoned his mother...

309
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,426
and that woman said
he was on his way.

310
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,366
Lázaro will only be buried
when his son arrives.

311
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,859
You see, Father...

312
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,199
Salustiano is my son,
but he is limited.

313
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,934
Dedé and Márcio are treated
like family.

314
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,837
You more than anyone,
know that.

315
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,150
Adopted into the family with my mercy.

316
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,750
Apart from this universe of
distant cousins and nephews...

317
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:20,455
my family is now my grandson
and Salustiano.

318
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,292
Lázaro will only be buried
when he arrives.

319
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,132
We can only wait
until the end of the afternoon.

320
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,605
I'm afraid to say that the situation
is becoming unbearable.

321
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,482
Yes! Water is difficult.

322
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,294
We can only count
on luck and God.

323
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,486
The two have to come together.

324
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,222
Luck, which is a divine blessing,
manifests itself in nature.

325
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,195
And is the face of God on earth.

326
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,168
Well, as I was saying...

327
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,600
I take my forked stick...

328
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,574
and walk around.

329
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,777
I've found a lot of water
for a lot of people.

330
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,451
Important people. The poor.
Even politicians.

331
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,012
But can anyone do it?

332
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,283
I mean, if I take the stick,
will I find water?

333
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,756
Huh! Of course not.

334
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:29,129
If it was like that
there'd be no water shortage.

335
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:33,730
First you need faith,
the kerosene of the soul.

336
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:37,738
Then the talent. There are those
who have it and those who don't.

337
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,643
Who has the talent of the word
has thought...

338
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,279
who has the talent of power
has the farm...

339
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,110
and who has the talent of
forked stick, has water.

340
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,452
But is there still water here?

341
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,457
Of course there isn't!

342
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,986
OK. No problem.

343
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,454
It was just to show your art.

344
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,539
<i>Hello, Jonas?
It's you, Jonas...?</i>

345
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,615
Jonas has been like that
ever since university.

346
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,586
Quiet. Introspective.

347
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,093
Shy.

348
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,491
Shy, shy, and bang,
consumed Little Red Riding Hood.

349
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,530
Shy until the first glass, then you
couldn't get a word in sideways.

350
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:43,605
They say a guy that drinks can't
get it up. That's why I prefer weed.

351
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,843
- Did that happen to Jonas?
- Leave it out.

352
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,708
Go on! Could he get it up or not?
Or did it just dangle?

353
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,215
Shut your mouth, Falcão!
You're as big a shithead as Bob.

354
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,182
It's just we're here smoking.

355
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,255
It's all about smoking...
there's something crazy...

356
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:05,191
you see the other talking, you start
to take on the other's personality.

357
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,661
There's a great film about that...
with that actor...

358
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,103
who was married to...
that woman who did...

359
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,541
- that film...
- Stop getting at me!

360
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:27,445
This fucking sun and
you just talking crap. Stop it!

361
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,347
It's more or less like this.

362
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,618
From this point,
the Valley of Rocha...

363
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:41,059
I am developing a theory about
the impact created by water.

364
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,790
The lack of water
within the communities.

365
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:50,664
And in this hinterland universe,
I've identified several nuances.

366
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,108
For example, in Rocha...

367
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,644
I'll find the mythical
and political discourse of water.

368
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,447
How the little water of the region
is distributed...

369
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,948
its political use and where it is.

370
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,982
I'm talking too much.

371
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,787
You must know Rocha better than me.
I've never been there.

372
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,591
No, I don't even remember the place.

373
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:16,390
My memories are so photographic
that I don't know if they are true.

374
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,165
A confusion in my mind.

375
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,203
I think things here
have stood still in time.

376
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,009
Why are you coming back?

377
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,413
My father's funeral.

378
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,692
I'm sorry.

379
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,489
You're here to bury your father
and I'm rattling on.

380
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,498
That's ok.

381
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,870
I'm not sure if I feel anything.

382
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,432
I left a long time ago.
I was around five.

383
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,303
A strange sensation. It's like
losing something I never had.

384
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:08,246
Like being part of a story
in which I never had a role.

385
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:13,156
You know what's funny?
I don't feel strange here.

386
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,235
Ah, look out,
look out, look out!

387
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,769
Calm down.

388
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,023
<i>Habemus pope!</i>

389
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,267
Has this hole been here long?

390
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,665
This place is not a hole, sir!
It's simple but worthy of respect.

391
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,402
No, I'm talking about
the hole in the road.

392
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,236
Ah! Yes.

393
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,211
This road has needed
repair for ages.

394
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,251
It's not like it used to be.

395
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,657
It's the tyres.

396
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,288
Not even this car
can take this road.

397
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,555
This'll take some time.
I'd like to have a better look.

398
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:31,893
I'd like to spend the day looking
at this engine. It's fantastic!

399
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,998
But I'm in a hurry.

400
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,739
How can anyone be in a hurry
in a place like this?

401
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,375
- Where're you going?
- Rocha.

402
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,409
So you've just arrived.

403
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,421
He'll not get far here.

404
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:56,154
That one's from another world.
A nothing.

405
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:01,053
I just hope he hasn't come
to ruin everything!

406
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,993
- He's gonna shit himself.
- I agree.

407
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,469
But when mum gets something into
her head, there's no going back.

408
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,904
You know that.

409
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,808
Your bar is incredible,
Zé Elétrico.

410
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:33,451
- Where did you get it all?
- Ah, all part of the valley.

411
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:37,025
You may not believe it
but I found it all here.

412
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:42,055
- It's surreal, Jonas!
- Going to Lázaro's funeral?

413
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,726
Yes.
How did you know?

414
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,837
There must be some reason
for coming here to Rocha.

415
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,407
- You're his son, aren't you?
- I am.

416
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,941
- My sympathies.
- Thank you.

417
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,954
Calm down!
Has the Recife bus arrived?

418
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,988
Not yet.

419
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,890
- What time does it arrive?
- Depends.

420
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,861
Sometimes at five,
sometimes later.

421
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,866
But never more than six!

422
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,698
Where're you from?

423
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,542
Jamaica.

424
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,510
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

425
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:36,882
- Did you get the plate's number?
- 0624.

426
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:41,154
- The number of the goat!
- The goat always brings bad luck.

427
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,382
Get off!

428
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,819
No fucking way
I'm going to this funeral alone.

429
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,329
Especially with Bob
stinking like a skunk.

430
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,936
We could go to that bar,
with that wonderful native girl!

431
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:58,507
Cheyenne, General Custer.
The one at the door? Cheyenne.

432
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:04,376
So we fill up and have a drink.

433
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:12,286
Barren Mouths,
by Graciliano Ramos.

434
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:18,328
Get it? Barren Lives...
by Graciliano Ramos.

435
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,357
It's the first time
I've met a celebrity.

436
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,329
Wedja, Wedja...

437
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:30,369
Go inside and stay tuned!
All right, Wedja?

438
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,381
Thanks. She will bring the car back
so you can have a closer look.

439
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,680
- I'm really in a hurry.
- But I'd like to have a chat with you.

440
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,355
You know The Old Man, don't you?

441
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,355
The Old Man is one of us.

442
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,619
Who goes to the sky via satellite.

443
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,626
- I know him.
- Let's go? Thanks, Zé!

444
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,893
I'll be back.
The town is near here, isn't it?

445
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,896
Very near.

446
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,604
- Thanks!
- Thanks.

447
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,008
Go with God.

448
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,688
This way.

449
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,518
I knew you'd come.

450
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,224
Everyone was waiting
for you, grandson.

451
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,529
Jonas, pay your respects
to your father.

452
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,304
Sorry, Jonas,
but we have to be quick. Please.

453
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:45,399
Well, there's fresh beans...

454
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:50,638
sun-dried meat, goat's entrails,
roast goat, stewed goat...

455
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,670
chicken and sausages.

456
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,437
- Wow!
- Calm down, fuck it!

457
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,512
- Any vegetables?
- Vegetables?

458
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:02,412
There's tomato,
onion and cassava.

459
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,087
If cassava is a vegetable...

460
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,985
let's say that beer is too
and let's get going.

461
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,155
So bring vegetables,
cassava. Everything!

462
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,557
Thank you!
Thank you.

463
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,479
- Have they buried him?
- Now.

464
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,148
- They were waiting for Jonas.
- The son from the television?

465
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:44,493
Zé, you know he deserved it.

466
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,365
I'm poor,
but I've got pride.

467
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:54,461
That maybe so.
But this is going to stink.

468
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,163
Fucking family.

469
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,303
They'll find a way
of getting me.

470
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,211
Marcio, that son of a bitch!

471
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,453
A real fucking son of a bitch.

472
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:19,094
- The boy seems quiet. Polite.
- I don't want to know.

473
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,854
- And Wedja?
- She's ok.

474
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,735
She can look after herself.

475
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:32,675
Let's face it, it's like
she's always out for a good time.

476
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,106
She's what's left from the family.

477
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,372
No son of a bitch is going
to humiliate my family.

478
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,849
I won't stand for it.

479
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,787
I'd kill them all.

480
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:55,021
You have to wait for things
to cool down before you make a move.

481
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:59,532
The boys from CG are livid.
To and for. To and for.

482
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,201
Bring some smokes next time.

483
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,535
I'll see what time
I can bring your food.

484
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,635
Not even Wedja knows
where you are.

485
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,345
She mustn't know.

486
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,854
Follow your destiny, Lázaro!

487
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,325
Here on earth...

488
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,691
your family will continue
to honour...

489
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,169
your sacred memory.

490
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,190
- Vedja.
- It's "Wedja"!

491
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,225
Ah, sorry! Wedja, my dear...

492
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,862
bring some napkins, please.

493
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,357
And another beer!
Really cold!

494
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,663
For someone who came
to give support!

495
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:12,467
That's true! That is the truth!
Jonas didn't even want us to come.

496
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:17,135
She said he came here
with some woman!

497
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,848
What a bastard!

498
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:23,452
We'll talk later.
You knew this Lázaro?

499
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:28,416
- Of course, Bob.
- Daft question, huh?

500
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:33,930
Good evening.

501
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,964
I'd like to talk to Soledad,
the owner of that car outside.

502
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,169
It's Jonas, isn't it?
Soledad?

503
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,565
- Is she expecting you?
- Yes. At least, I think so.

504
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,266
Room 113.
Are you her boyfriend?

505
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,342
- No!
- I see...

506
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,709
- Why?
- Nothing! You can go up.

507
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,649
But this is
a decent establishment.

508
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,021
Of course! I'm going up.

509
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:07,020
He said nothing about coming
with anyone. Who could it be?

510
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,427
You know what I want?
Cacacha!

511
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,835
Did you get your things
sorted out?

512
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,166
Not really.

513
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:24,575
- I'm going to the bar to talk to Zé.
- Can I go too?

514
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,106
What?

515
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:30,343
Can I go with you?
Get out and clear my mind a little.

516
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,346
Today wasn't easy.

517
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,749
Of course, Jonas.

518
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:42,096
I spoke to some people
about The Old Man.

519
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,334
I had no idea he was so popular.

520
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,545
- Who is this Old Man?
- Didn't I tell you?

521
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,414
He's a religious leader.

522
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,555
His beliefs are founded
on the use of water.

523
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:12,654
I have to register his words.
It's exactly what I'm looking for.

524
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,826
I've never met him,
but I know he's quite a figure.

525
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,093
I've never heard of him.

526
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,631
Ah, but I have.
That's why I'm here.

527
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,205
- Let's go?
- Sure.

528
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,174
Leave your things here,
we'll get you a room later.

529
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,441
You've become my family today.

530
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,873
- Fuck! What happened?
- Zé Elétrico has just arrived.

531
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,510
All we need to do is behave!
He's all right, isn't he?

532
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:15,117
He told me not to sell alcohol.
Tell him you're friends of Jonas.

533
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,945
Wedja, what did I tell you?

534
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,280
Hi, Zé Elétrico.
It wasn't Wedja's fault.

535
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,615
It never is.

536
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:26,285
They're Jonas' friends,
the grandson from the TV...

537
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:30,830
She gave us food, sausages.
Come and sit down.

538
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,930
This girl is such a headache!

539
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,605
You're a little devil, Wedja!

540
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:43,372
This is Falcão.
A good guy! Vera...

541
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:48,847
Sit down.
Come down to earth.

542
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:59,259
Wedja! I wasn't going to,
but as you've permitted it...

543
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,555
bring a beer.

544
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,632
And could we have
the music back, too?

545
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,076
I see the night like the ocean...

546
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,372
that bathes the world
of sun with shadow.

547
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:22,881
I see life like that too.
Ocean of shadows...

548
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,345
- dreams, desires. He's great.
- Too much!

549
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,987
What are you doing here?

550
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,825
- Jonas!
- Jonas. Brother.

551
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,499
- You're here!
- We got lost.

552
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,760
I was teaching your friends...
They said they're your friends.

553
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,098
- Vedja...
- "Wedja"!

554
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,172
Wedja said...

555
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,172
that you left
just before we arrived.

556
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:54,884
So we stayed here talking
to Zé Elétrico.

557
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,381
- He's a real philosopher!
- Lf only.

558
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:01,022
I just see the world
in a different way.

559
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:05,318
I like listening.
I learned to think through my ears.

560
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:12,001
How was it there, Jonas?
We were worried.

561
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,066
Fucking worried!

562
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,230
Hi, I'm Soledad.

563
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,473
Hi. Falcão.

564
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,510
Vera...

565
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,139
- How's things?
- Fine.

566
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,352
We came to give you some support.
Then you disappeared!

567
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:38,451
I didn't know you were
with someone. It was a surprise.

568
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,789
We met on the way.
It was quicker like that.

569
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,367
I needed to get here quickly.

570
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,635
He was beginning to stink.

571
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,033
Fucking hell!

572
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,747
Where did The Old Man come from?

573
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,255
She's a beautiful native.

574
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,192
Wedja?

575
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:15,629
She's a time bomb.
Always ready to explode.

576
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,262
Boom!

577
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,626
She's fantastic!

578
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,974
- What was I saying?
- The Old Man.

579
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,977
He first came as a prospector.

580
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,142
He bought some land.

581
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,985
There was no water.

582
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:40,281
He opened some caves
but found nothing.

583
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,282
They say he got to know
some natives.

584
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:48,360
Then he started having visions
and receiving messages.

585
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:53,267
Mystical things.
That's how it started.

586
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,772
Then he started to build the castle.
Castle?

587
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,406
Yes, the castle...

588
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:03,208
on top of the reservoir,
which are always filled with water.

589
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,275
He blesses the water and it takes
on miraculous powers.

590
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:17,853
They say it's not only his faith
which makes it miraculous.

591
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,822
It's full of uranium.

592
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,122
Uranium?
Wow!

593
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,300
That's where the power
comes from!

594
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,999
You don't want to talk about it?

595
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:35,537
And he's there until today.
At the heart of the valley.

596
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,355
Heavenly Father.

597
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:56,157
I commend this body...

598
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,803
blood and soul of your beloved
son Jesus Christ...

599
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,697
who atones for
all the sins of the world.

600
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:10,777
For his pain and suffering,
have pity on this world.

601
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,378
Until tomorrow, Zé.

602
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,276
Go in the shadow.

603
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,086
- Bye.
- Bye.

604
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,619
Until tomorrow.

605
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,161
Bye, Wedja.

606
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:33,333
For his pain and suffering,
have pity on this world.

607
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:54,082
- That's the best way to dance.
- It's heavy work.

608
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:09,971
But like I was saying, it's mad.
We all know it kills neurones.

609
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,704
But alcohol is much worse,
Than weed, don't you think?

610
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,242
But nobody says anything.
And why? Industry!

611
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,381
Tobacco. Weapons.

612
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,642
Those with the money run the world.
And the victims?

613
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,387
Those who smoke the 'weed'.
Who is right?

614
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:32,027
To be honest, I don't agree.
Not everyone is prepared for it.

615
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:36,622
I think we should produce it
to sell to Holland.

616
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,390
What's that?

617
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:48,004
To smoke, I'll have to go to
the ends of the fucking world.

618
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,415
Your bag's there.

619
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,221
Your digital clouds are safe.

620
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:09,828
What's that noise?

621
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:30,247
For a decent establishment,
the rules are very flimsy.

622
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,487
Have you read The Stranger,
by Camus?

623
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,158
- No. Why?
- Nothing.

624
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,957
Each day
is like a cut-throat razor.

625
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:46,896
I feel a stranger everywhere.
Even in my dreams.

626
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,819
<i>Have pity on this world.</i>

627
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,826
<i>For his pain and suffering...</i>

628
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,895
<i>have pity on this world.</i>

629
01:02:54,871 --> 01:03:00,138
For this pain and suffering,
have pity...

630
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,787
<i>A mass of dry air from the coast
means today will be hot.</i>

631
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,382
<i>It will be sunny throughout the
northeast...</i>

632
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,390
<i>especially in the Rocha Valley.</i>

633
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,494
Jonas!

634
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,199
Jonas.

635
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,231
- What's the time?
- It's early.

636
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,868
I've got to get up.

637
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:36,539
It's a long way
to the Old Man's farm.

638
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,637
I'm not sure where it is.

639
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:43,146
- Are you coming?
- I'd like to, but I can't.

640
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,884
I've got to go to
my grandmother's.

641
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,314
Wake up.

642
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,049
Let's get going for fuck's sake.

643
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,185
- Come on!
- Where to?

644
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,227
Paradise, brother!

645
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,823
Paradise?
Up your fucking arse!

646
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,231
The plantation of dreams.
The selection of the goat's shit.

647
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,962
The plantation that
Wedja talked about. Let's move!

648
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,868
Smoking dope gives me amnesia and
a million things I can't remember.

649
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,513
- Don't you remember either?
- Huh?

650
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,557
I should be back
at the end of the afternoon.

651
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:31,756
- We'll meet at Zé Elétrico's.
- OK. See you then.

652
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,667
Bye, Miss Soledad.

653
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,647
- Good morning, my boy.
- Good morning, Dona Carmo.

654
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,254
Take a seat, Jonas.
Make yourself at home.

655
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,024
Let's have some breakfast?

656
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:21,012
Do you think
she's spoken to him?

657
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:25,810
Must have done. If mum says
she'll do it, she'll do it.

658
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,781
But it won't interfere
with the plans at all.

659
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,622
She sent everybody away
when he arrived.

660
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:45,936
It's OK, Marcio.
Think calmly. Intelligently.

661
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,834
Isn't everything
kind of sorted out?

662
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,742
This won't change anything.

663
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,743
Don't stand on ceremony.
You're at home.

664
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,053
You look at lot like him.

665
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:07,985
Who? Me?

666
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:11,532
Yes. Doesn't he?

667
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,199
The spitting image!

668
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,868
Did he use to talk about me?

669
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,974
My God! Almost every day.

670
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,177
He never forgave
that mad mother yours.

671
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,474
She ran away from here
with you just a kid.

672
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,642
He never forgave her!

673
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,523
I never imagined he'd turn up here.

674
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,752
But be careful. He's famous.

675
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,727
Be smart about this.

676
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,959
I think you're the one that needs
to be a bit smarter!

677
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:49,194
You're shitting yourself!

678
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,637
I'll sort things out my way.

679
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:56,140
You know that
when I want something...

680
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,711
there's nothing
I won't do? Right!

681
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,676
In reality,
I have to do everything.

682
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,911
You stay there looking after
body boxes. All right?

683
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,725
- And the accent?
- Whose accent?

684
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:13,292
The television playboy.

685
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,228
Stupid prat!
Learn to talk like us properly!

686
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,749
Excuse me. You know where
that truck came from?

687
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,516
- The deputy's truck?
- Yes.

688
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,743
From The Dry Stream Farm.

689
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:15,114
That's where I'm headed.
Can you tell me the way?

690
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,586
- To The Old Man's Farm?
- Yes.

691
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,317
Just go the way the truck came.

692
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,493
And keep going.
A couple of leagues and a half.

693
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,462
You'll then come to
the Rock of the Dog.

694
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,862
It's got the face of a dog.

695
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:34,499
You then come across a tree trunk.
Turn. You then pass by...

696
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:39,878
let me see... one... two...
three gates.

697
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,845
- You're there.
- OK.

698
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,853
And the lizard?
A pet?

699
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,989
The teju?
To eat.

700
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,983
- Thanks.
- Any time.

701
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:43,343
My boy.
They want to wipe out our family.

702
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:47,174
I don't say that
only because of your father.

703
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:51,618
There are people who want to see
our family on its knees.

704
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:56,554
But do you know
when that will happen?

705
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,490
Never.

706
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:03,687
This is a brave family.
Courageous blood.

707
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,563
We haven't lost the family name...

708
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,136
just because we lost
the cotton plantations.

709
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:15,944
No. It's forever, Jonas.
Forever!

710
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:41,264
This was your father's.
Now it's yours.

711
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,667
I hope you know what to do with it.

712
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:49,241
Look, Dona Carmo.
I only came because of the family.

713
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,844
Because of you.
This is nothing to do with me.

714
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,274
Your father is dead.

715
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:59,514
Killed like a dog, and you say
it's nothing to do with you?

716
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:07,890
When your grandfather died,
your father said he'd take over.

717
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,125
And he did.

718
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,858
You're no better, Jonas.

719
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:18,869
Because your mother took you away,
you say "Nothing to do with me"?

720
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,974
And the land?

721
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,377
Nothing to do with you?

722
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,448
The house, the farm.
What about them?

723
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,243
This is all yours.

724
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,653
All of this is yours!

725
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:43,298
And it is to do with you!
Whether you want it or not!

726
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:55,503
Jurandir, things smell bad.
The CG boys are looking everywhere.

727
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:02,441
That's why I've got to get away now!
I'm gonna die here like a pig.

728
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,049
That's why you can't leave now.

729
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:10,522
They're up and down, stick your head
out now and you lose it.

730
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,195
Look, I appreciate...

731
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,760
what you're doing for my sister...

732
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,433
as well as your hate for
that fucking family.

733
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,030
But now it's my decision.

734
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,134
Wait just a little.

735
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,443
The time will come.

736
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,609
And what about this Jonas?

737
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,216
Poor devil!

738
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,921
He's got no idea how to hold
a knife, much less how to use it.

739
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:45,457
- Is he a bastard too?
- Don't know.

740
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,393
Doesn't seem like the same family.

741
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,565
I'm off.

742
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,319
Give me a
little longer, all right?

743
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:13,674
I love you, my angel!

744
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:19,647
It's like the Portuguese
discoverers used to er yo plant...

745
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,612
grows!

746
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,232
You asked for it. Take it.

747
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,433
"I will see you when I get there"!!

748
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,764
Good morning. Are you lost?

749
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,004
No.

750
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:19,141
- I'm looking for The Old Man.
- You're in the right place.

751
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,222
Ready for combat, are you?

752
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,060
What?

753
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,723
My godmother spoke to you?

754
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,097
We're gonna find Jurandir.

755
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:43,067
Then you finish it off.
If you need any...

756
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,500
I don't need any help...

757
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:50,768
because I'm not going to do it.
Why don't you do it?

758
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,809
You're a son too, aren't you?

759
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:57,747
My father died a long time ago.
Never knew him.

760
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,387
He died before I was born.

761
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,551
But the CG boys are out looking.

762
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:07,885
He must be in the woods.
He's a native, isn't he?

763
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,065
We find him. You do the job.

764
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,560
Did you know that...

765
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:18,102
every time Lázaro got drunk, he
imitated you on the television.

766
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,638
Everyone enjoyed it.

767
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:26,112
Look, killing is not that bad.

768
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:30,341
But thinking about it is.

769
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:35,214
You won't chicken out of it.
We're watching you!

770
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,083
What is it, Jucão?

771
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,888
They're there? Whose orders?

772
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:45,591
No, no, don't do anything.
Slowly. Let it roll!

773
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:49,703
After we squeeze him a little,
he'll be shitting himself.

774
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:53,466
Jucão, have you lost trust
or respect?

775
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,744
That's all right then.

776
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,717
Old Man!
Old Man.

777
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:41,955
Old Man.

778
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,413
Can I begin recording?

779
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,653
Just a minute.

780
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,942
Can I call you Old Man?

781
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:48,010
When My Father appeared to me
for the first time...

782
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,213
my name was Zé.

783
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:54,718
Then He wanted me
to be called Aquinetom.

784
01:19:55,757 --> 01:20:00,490
- Now I'm The Old Man.
- Who is your father?

785
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:04,992
My Father is the father
of everyone on earth.

786
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:09,435
It's just that I am His
direct son...

787
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,406
as well as His messenger.

788
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,745
I speak directly to Him.

789
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:21,440
He illuminates me...

790
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,477
and I pass it on to those
who follow me.

791
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:36,495
The link of the divine
with the deep.

792
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,020
What did they want?

793
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:13,223
They think I know
where your father's killer is.

794
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,901
- The native?
- Yes. Jurandir.

795
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,571
Wedja, give me a moment alone
with our friend here.

796
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,265
What did they want?

797
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:26,310
Wedja! Disappear for two minutes.
Invisible.

798
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,846
Go to your room, the bathroom,
anywhere!

799
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,549
Hi, Zé.

800
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,625
Speak.

801
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,192
I went to my grandmother's...

802
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:45,291
and Márcio and my grandmother said
I had to kill the native.

803
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:50,195
I left there not really knowing
what's going on. So I came here.

804
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:54,834
I arranged to meet Soledad here.
She went to see The Old Man.

805
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,977
I don't know what's happening.

806
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:02,741
My own grandmother telling
me I had to kill the native.

807
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:07,379
- Márcio is crazy to find Jurandir.
- I'm not going to kill any native.

808
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:09,885
Nor anyone.

809
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,482
She gave me this.

810
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,794
My grandmother gave me this.

811
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:20,762
She said to find the native
and kill him. Márcio said so too.

812
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:25,271
I've never held a gun.

813
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:29,906
But I'm certainly not going
to kill anyone!

814
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,838
Jonas, Jonas.

815
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,540
You've landed yourself
in a right mess.

816
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,912
Don't you know your own family?

817
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:42,919
You think it's easy?
It's not.

818
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,384
There are things we do
because we want.

819
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:48,390
Others we do without wanting to.

820
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:52,292
- I don't really understand.
- I've known it for a long time.

821
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,933
But this is crazy!
This...

822
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:59,072
This is unreal. It's like things
here have stood still in time!

823
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,241
Jonas...

824
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:04,242
Your father died because he thought
he could do anything he wanted.

825
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,406
But the bullet
doesn't respect anyone.

826
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:10,550
And all because of a woman?

827
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,245
- Wedja.
- Wedja?

828
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,116
The woman was Wedja,
and the native is her brother.

829
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,124
That's it.

830
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:25,626
In the beginning,
there was only the Rocha Valley...

831
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,029
and the heavens covering all.

832
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,598
Then I arrived.

833
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,106
I started prospecting.

834
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,134
A lot of rocks.

835
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,337
I dug and dug.

836
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:45,243
And from then, time started.

837
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,745
I mean, the time here.

838
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:50,891
The cyclical time
that marks everything.

839
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:56,295
The natives didn't exist yet.

840
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,125
Come on, Jonas.
There's something you've got to see.

841
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:39,866
Then the natives came.

842
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:43,733
And then the other men.

843
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,881
Then the water appeared.

844
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,582
Where did the water come from?

845
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:55,822
The deep!
It flowed from the walls...

846
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,192
irrigating everything!

847
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:03,260
But what came in abundance
started to run out.

848
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,062
So I started to store water.

849
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:13,035
- The mimosa water.
- Where do you store it?

850
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,871
There's a lot of history here.

851
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,807
The people who lived in
this region...

852
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,711
knew how to use it well.

853
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:28,053
They respected the land.

854
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:31,781
And it respected them.
The true owners of the land.

855
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,454
The people who came after,
who invaded and killed...

856
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,996
called these first inhabitants
"indians".

857
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,900
Indians, Jonas.

858
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:46,005
The natives started to mix.
From owners, to workers.

859
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:48,665
The women became whore.

860
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:51,178
First we lost the land.

861
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,437
Then respect.

862
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,639
Then our teeth.

863
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,417
People appear telling us it was
all ours, all so beautiful.

864
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:01,884
But it wasn't.

865
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:06,049
There was war, dispute plenty and
little. But it was ours.

866
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:10,058
And we ended up with nothing.
We moved away.

867
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,669
I even lived in São Paulo.

868
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:23,168
I went to take marijuana and ended up
working in a brothel in the centre.

869
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:32,083
But I returned. Why?

870
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:40,487
Shit!

871
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,520
Where is...

872
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,995
- Where is the fucking ar?
- Outside that house.

873
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:51,867
You told me to. If we find the
house, we find the fucking car.

874
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:53,836
Where's the fucking house?

875
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:59,212
- My mouth is so fuckin dry.
- Everything looks the fucking same!

876
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:00,938
Calm down! Let's walk.

877
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:02,649
Let's walk.

878
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,421
Look!

879
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,088
Look!

880
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,653
The house! Isn't that the house?
Look.

881
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:19,294
Look there's the car! Thank fuck!

882
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:42,349
We just went for a walk.
Our friend, Wedja, she said...

883
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:46,891
Can you tell us where...
the main road is?

884
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,092
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

885
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,858
We were there...
We're friends of Jonas.

886
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:56,559
- Jonas, from the television.
- Stick the television up your arse!

887
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:03,138
- Stealing marijuana!
- We were just travelling round.

888
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:06,336
Speak, boy. Little shit.

889
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:09,812
Hang on. Calm down.
Calm, brother!

890
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,253
Calm down, my arse!
Stealing weed? Aren't you ashamed?

891
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,915
We had no idea anybody
owned it.

892
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:22,394
Take it easy, man.
Look! How much do you want?

893
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,531
- Calm down.
- I'm not selling anything.

894
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:32,063
I'd like to get all his money and
shove it right up his fucking arse!

895
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:37,707
Look at the girl.
Afraid? Good and wet?

896
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,707
Good and wet?

897
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,472
Calm down!

898
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,451
Let's get out of here.

899
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:50,047
Take it easy!

900
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:56,086
Throw everything down here.

901
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:56,896
Everything.

902
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:57,890
Everything.

903
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:58,497
Everything. Come on.

904
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,667
I don't want to see anything left
in your pockets.

905
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,307
The marijuana.

906
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,875
That's good!

907
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:14,514
Shit!

908
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:19,613
We didn't fucking do anything!

909
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,165
It's beautiful, isn't it Jonas?

910
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:35,067
You know...

911
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:38,699
whoever this land belongs to
has to run away.

912
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,468
Like Jurandir.

913
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:45,407
It happens.

914
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,705
He has to disappear.

915
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:51,585
Made a big mistake.

916
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,048
Either he dies or he runs.

917
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:59,483
Then it'll be Wedja.

918
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:02,424
That's how we disappear.

919
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:08,399
We used to be where the water was,
but now we're at its mercy.

920
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:13,471
We're no longer natives.

921
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:15,972
Only when they want
to speak badly about us.

922
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:20,710
We melted away.

923
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,149
But in exchange...

924
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:31,515
we go on living in your blood.

925
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:09,762
Evil eye, tuberculosis, fever.

926
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:13,259
It cures everything.

927
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:19,063
Even if you don't need it...
it's good to drink it...

928
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,838
it purifies the spirit.

929
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:27,237
It's immediate?
It depends on the belief.

930
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:29,916
As long as you believe
in The Old Man's words...

931
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:32,244
and the power of thought.

932
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:33,943
Otherwise...

933
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:37,352
The Old Man only uses this water
for blessing.

934
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:41,861
He doesn't use it for domestic
purposes, then it's black magic.

935
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,300
I don't know if you understand.

936
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:59,104
It's out there
and we can't see it.

937
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:03,383
Not exactly 'see'.
We can't understand it.

938
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:09,620
This rock. You see?

939
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,691
It's the Dog Rock.

940
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:18,590
You see?
There's a dog lying down.

941
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,032
Head on one side.

942
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:26,105
It's really a dog.

943
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,668
See? It was always there.

944
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,550
Even before the dog, the rock
already exists.

945
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,217
I only saw the dog
a long time after.

946
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:48,851
They used to say,
"There's the Dog Rock!"

947
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,930
And I couldn't see
any fucking dog.

948
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,768
After telling me
it was lying down...

949
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,128
I saw it.

950
01:32:58,005 --> 01:33:00,701
Don't know how I never saw it.

951
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,541
See?

952
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,776
Things are there,
but we don't see them.

953
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:12,316
You know why? Prejudice.

954
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,117
People only see
what they're allowed to.

955
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,788
Laziness and prejudice.

956
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:26,227
That's why I like the great
musician Raul Seixas.

957
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,797
I don't like "formed opinions".

958
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:49,418
Are you better now?
Good.

959
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:54,483
Look. Over there.
Over there is the elephant.

960
01:33:54,795 --> 01:34:01,064
That was fucking difficult to see.
I just couldn't see it.

961
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,634
I looked and looked.

962
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:08,201
"An elephant that has disappeared!",
I used to say.

963
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:15,376
Then one day, after smoking some
of the holy weed...

964
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:20,044
I managed to see the elephant
sinking into water. See?

965
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:24,581
The water up to its middle,
and then the trunk. His ear.

966
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:30,025
A revelation had been made.
I thought to myself...

967
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:33,695
"If that has always been there
and I never saw it...

968
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:39,262
then how many other things exist
under our nose like that?"

969
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:53,051
You must have an open mind
and stay alert.

970
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:58,118
If we don't watch our step,
we can slip into the imagination.

971
01:35:02,129 --> 01:35:04,427
It's beautiful, isn't it?

972
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,894
It's all yours.
Even if you don't want it.

973
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:13,829
My dear...

974
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:19,645
it is and it isn't...

975
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,542
but it is being.

976
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:29,948
Now, there is a rush to Saturn!

977
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,589
Many are going there.

978
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:39,229
And they'll stay there.
I'll lock them there.

979
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:42,392
I have the key...

980
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:45,303
and I'll use it.

981
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,939
And where are you all going?

982
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:50,209
To Jupiter.

983
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:55,178
To drink the mimosa water from lo.

984
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,917
I'll settle...

985
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:02,615
and stay there waiting
for my next mission.

986
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:06,617
And what is that?

987
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:09,594
The return to Chaos...

988
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:12,390
and the recreation of the universe.

989
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,537
There is no life without
the state of liquid...

990
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:21,138
and I have the poetry of water.

991
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:50,226
<i>Jonas.</i>

992
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,899
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

993
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,508
<i>Jonas!
Five minutes to go.</i>

994
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:07,753
<i>There are th¡ngs we
do because we want...</i>

995
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:10,790
<i>Others we do without wanting to.</i>

996
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,795
<i>Anyway you need
to remember that now...</i>

997
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:25,836
The large dry mass hanging over
the region has begun to move on...

998
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,803
but there is no sign of rain.

999
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,239
The day...

1000
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:35,274
The day will remain hot.

1001
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,188
Hello?

1002
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,653
They took the fucking lot.

1003
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:23,292
Shit! Fucking everything!
Money, cards...

1004
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:26,896
Blow the fucking lot into space!

1005
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:30,264
- Sons of bitches!
- And Jonas?

1006
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:33,734
We shouldn't have come.
We shouldn't.

1007
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:36,941
Fuck Jonas.
Let's get the fuck out!

1008
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,358
- Fucking hell!
- Bob, what's this?

1009
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:56,188
Fucking hell!

1010
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:00,257
He didn't get this one.

1011
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:04,267
- Light it! Light it!
- Blow the fucker up!

1012
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:09,007
Oh Fuck!

1013
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:12,368
Hide it, hide it. Give it to me.

1014
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,713
Stop the car.

1015
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:17,383
- Hi! Sorry! It's just that...
- Pull over.

1016
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:20,144
- We're pulling over.
- We're going to Recife.

1017
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,981
We'll park here.

1018
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:25,248
- On the left.
- Why did we have to come here?

1019
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:31,088
Stop.

1020
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:32,990
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

1021
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,794
- Let's get moving now.
- We're getting out.

1022
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:37,436
Out.

1023
01:39:40,941 --> 01:39:42,966
Lean over there.

1024
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:47,170
Open your legs.

1025
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:39,520
The look is the light
that comes from the eye.

1026
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:33,635
They killed Jurandir,
Jonas!

1027
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:43,939
It's over, Jonas.
Lázaro is in peace, now.

1028
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:47,951
Killed him like a dog,
and it's nothing to do with you?

1029
01:43:48,155 --> 01:43:50,851
Are you crazy, Jonas?
I never saw anything like it.

1030
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:54,118
His father dies and the same day
he's sleeping with the slut.

1031
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,853
Didn't even let the body get cold.

1032
01:43:57,064 --> 01:44:00,033
Hail Maria,
crazy as a plague of dogs.

1033
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,566
Even got to be
Zé Elétrico's friend.

1034
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:08,264
You knew he was hiding Jurandir?
It's not good. Not good.

1035
01:44:08,675 --> 01:44:12,338
Is it true, Zé Elétrico?
Did they really kill Jurandir?

1036
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:17,773
I knew you'd hide that
good-for-nothing. Lying bastard!

1037
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:24,353
We have to stay alive.
He's not a problem any more.

1038
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:27,453
It's my fault.
My fault!

1039
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:30,687
I knew Jurandir wouldn't
accept me going with Lázaro.

1040
01:44:30,897 --> 01:44:36,096
It's not your fault.
Things happen.

1041
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:40,069
Some things make sense,
others no. This makes no sense.

1042
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:45,439
Everything makes sense.
This gun was Lázaro's favourite.

1043
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:48,171
Use it well?

1044
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:58,182
Nothing. No.
I don't want to leave.

1045
01:44:58,392 --> 01:45:02,920
Really, Zé Elétrico!
Every time the same.

1046
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:08,329
Always saying you don't know.
I smoke and I know all about it.

1047
01:45:08,535 --> 01:45:10,901
You've got to decide.

1048
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,569
Time to finish with all this.

1049
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:18,870
Jonas?

1050
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:22,438
Jonas?

1051
01:45:22,716 --> 01:45:24,445
What's going on?

1052
01:45:25,185 --> 01:45:27,176
Jonas! Jonas!

1053
01:45:27,387 --> 01:45:29,821
Killed the native
and now he's high!

1054
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:34,658
You know that when he was drunk,
Lázaro imitated you on television?

1055
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:37,660
Let's finish with all this!

1056
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:50,499
Ah! Feliciano.
How I enjoy our meetings.

1057
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:54,605
Everything here
is getting sorted out.

1058
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:57,878
You know how long
these things take.

1059
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:01,450
Slowly, but steadily things
get sorted.

1060
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,517
And they're going well.

1061
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:08,652
The cotton plantations
are enormous.

1062
01:46:09,596 --> 01:46:11,564
Did you know...

1063
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:16,668
that cotton is the most important
image of Jesus Christ on earth?

1064
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:22,373
The drought and the lush.

1065
01:46:23,343 --> 01:46:26,642
The drought
and the vegetable garden.

1066
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:29,446
I did know.

1067
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:32,447
And I am happy that
all is going well.

1068
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:37,684
Well, I'll leave you now.

1069
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:41,222
God be with you.

1070
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:46,963
Feliciano, make this boy a man.

1071
01:46:48,201 --> 01:46:51,102
He has much to learn about life.

1072
01:46:51,471 --> 01:46:53,666
It's good to learn early...

1073
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:59,504
because the longer you leave it
the harder it is.

1074
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:05,344
God bless you, Jonas.

1075
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,815
My grandson.

1076
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:17,597
What are you laughing at, Jucão?
Something funny?

1077
01:47:19,132 --> 01:47:20,599
So...

1078
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:25,270
We haven't kept you too long,
have we?

1079
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:27,440
I've stayed longer than I should.

1080
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:31,873
But Luquinha has agreed
on Salustiano for mayor.

1081
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:34,143
And the land?

1082
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:37,708
That's what really worries me, not
the man sitting at the town hall.

1083
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:41,354
What do you mean?
What are you on about?

1084
01:47:42,422 --> 01:47:45,755
- Of course we're worried about that.
- And the land?

1085
01:47:46,359 --> 01:47:48,452
I've arranged my part.

1086
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:50,391
All is going well.

1087
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:52,994
What worries me
is the fucking native village.

1088
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,828
- Will they stay there?
- Don't worry.

1089
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:58,363
The boys will stay looking
after the marijuana.

1090
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:00,870
They'll get a provisional deed
in exchange for work.

1091
01:48:01,074 --> 01:48:04,305
- After we'll see what to do.
- We always have to combine...

1092
01:48:04,678 --> 01:48:07,442
power and intelligence.

1093
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:10,980
I don't really know
where intelligence comes in.

1094
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,715
It's more about power and luck.

1095
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:16,612
If you get bad luck,
you're fucked.

1096
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:18,688
Take no notice, Feliciano.

1097
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:21,417
He's like that.
Only learns the hard way.

1098
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:23,788
But with the grace of God...

1099
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:28,161
he'll learn what you should do
with power and intelligence.

1100
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:35,364
- Let's get going?
- Yes.

1101
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:37,668
I must get back to Recife today.

1102
01:48:44,918 --> 01:48:47,216
Did you talk to The Old Man?

1103
01:48:47,487 --> 01:48:49,421
Yes. There's no problem.

1104
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:52,725
- Did you send the water truck there?
- No. But this week it'll go.

1105
01:48:53,126 --> 01:48:57,062
Don't worry. He was a bit upset.
He was running out of miracle water.

1106
01:48:57,264 --> 01:48:59,698
Tell him to be calm,
We'll send the water.

1107
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:18,248
Do you know what they did
with the Galileo probe?

1108
01:49:18,451 --> 01:49:19,418
What?

1109
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:21,553
Threw it into the atmosphere
of Jupiter.

1110
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:25,247
At least they had the intelligence
not to pollute lo.

1111
01:49:26,192 --> 01:49:27,682
Intelligence or care?

1112
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:30,454
Care!
Here on earth they never had that.

1113
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:32,095
That's true.

1114
01:49:32,632 --> 01:49:38,070
You know that from penal colony
in the universe...

1115
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:41,672
we'll become a penal colony
in the Milky Way.

1116
01:49:51,484 --> 01:49:52,917
But...

1117
01:49:53,653 --> 01:49:56,247
- what is lo?
- You don't know?

1118
01:49:56,523 --> 01:49:58,548
It's our address tomorrow.

1119
01:50:37,163 --> 01:50:41,657
EXCESS OF INFORMATION,
LACK OF WATER

1120
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:08,360
What's he doing?

1121
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:12,198
I don't know...

1122
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:15,328
but when he finishes,
something is going to happen.

1123
01:51:17,666 --> 01:51:34,333
