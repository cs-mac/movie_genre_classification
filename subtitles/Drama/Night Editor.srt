1
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,354
All right, snob, so I'm a public servant.

2
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,058
It makes you sweat.

3
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,173
-Hi, Johnny.
-Stewart speaking. Begin.

4
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,377
Pull yourself up a block
and get your head chopped off.

5
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,351
Necktie's hotter than a five-alarm waltz.

6
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,856
Yes, madam, this is the editor.
Yes, this is Mr. Stewart.

7
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,459
-Up a dime.
-Necktie's lifting it, eh?

8
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,393
I guess the bookie business
ain't so profitable.

9
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,364
He makes up his losses
what he loses on the horses.

10
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,163
Yes, madam. Thank you.
Good night, madam.

11
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,898
I'll bet madam told him where he could go.
It'll cost you 10 cents.

12
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,705
Greetings and salutations.
How is life on the Subway Circuit?

13
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,271
Madam says she has inside information.

14
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,751
Ronny Melville was trapped in that fire
on East 16th Street a couple of hours ago.

15
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,081
Four unidentified gents burnt to a crisp.

16
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,784
-Melville toast.
-That's good.

17
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,190
What did I tell you?
He stole it with a pair of fours.

18
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,197
Swanson, you better check with the Coroner.
Madam might know what she's talking about.

19
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,698
What's the matter with the prince?

20
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,768
He got a special dispensation
from the publisher?

21
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,837
He can get in any time he likes?

22
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,635
You let Johnny alone. He's a sick man.

23
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,508
Hasn't been home for two weeks,
now he's afraid to go.

24
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,012
-Go on. Jump.
-Jump, he says.

25
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,543
In this heat, I can hardly walk,
and he says jump.

26
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,281
Human beings are strange, complex things.

27
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,052
Yeah, yeah, people are nuts.
Come on, deal the cards.

28
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,151
Three-handed, eights are high.

29
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,523
-Hi, Doc.
-Hello, Doc. Take a hand?

30
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,857
Come on. Sit in.
The deck's loaded with aces.

31
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,935
Not tonight, sweetheart.

32
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,526
I've got a little homework to do
in the morgue, if you don't mind.

33
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,801
What would you cops do
without us newspaper guys?

34
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,166
Great kid.

35
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,577
Hey, Johnny.
Are you quick, or are you dead?

36
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,043
-I ain't quick.
-Wanna take a hand in this game?

37
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,677
No, thanks, and you don't have to shout.

38
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,555
-The guy's digging his own grave.
-Yeah, it happens that way.

39
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,294
A guy will make a mistake,
then he'll get in deeper and deeper,

40
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,461
and the first thing you know,
a mountain falls on him.

41
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,968
-Remember Tony Cochrane?
-Doc'll hear you.

42
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,801
Sure, you remember Tony. You ought to.
You covered the case with me.

43
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,237
Oh, yeah.

44
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:43,273
Yeah, during Prohibition. Sure, I...
How could I forget?

45
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:49,121
Tony Cochrane. There was a guy
that loved his home, his wife and his kid.

46
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,817
How he loved his kid.

47
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,197
That fixed it. I ought to know better
than to use gun cleaner on roller skates.

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,395
You'd better learn better
than to go into my gun case for anything.

49
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,611
-You working late tonight?
-Yep.

50
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,276
-Anything special?
-Yep, special.

51
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,850
You want I should come along
to cover the getaway?

52
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,622
What's the matter, Doc?
Something troubling you?

53
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,093
Gee whiz, I hardly ever see you anymore.

54
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,093
Yeah, I know, kid. It's tough.

55
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,132
-You know what?
-What?

56
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,901
Georgie, my friend from school,
his pop went away.

57
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,970
I told him when you weren't so busy,
you could be his pop, too.

58
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,206
Then he could go fishing with us
like we used to.

59
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,714
Sure, we'll take him along.

60
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,645
-Pa?
-Yeah?

61
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,559
I'm scared maybe you won't come back,
like Georgie's pop.

62
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,525
He gets awful lonesome.

63
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,868
Don't worry, kid.
I'm not going away and leave you, ever.

64
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,297
You just take care of the beefs at your end,

65
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,070
and we'll have this case cleared up
in no time.

66
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,610
I got you.

67
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,943
You're the inside man on this job.
Inside bed.

68
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,317
-Remember what I told you.
-Check.

69
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,820
-Keep your nose clean.
-Check.

70
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,102
Tony.

71
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,378
-Out again tonight?
-Of course. I told you, Martha.

72
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,889
Trying to get rich quick?

73
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,323
No, that's what you get for marrying a cop.

74
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,023
I love a cop.
I'd like a husband, too, for a change.

75
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,337
Well, I gotta be going.

76
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,602
Good night, Tony.

77
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,962
"Keep your nose clean." What a kid.

78
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,377
This will only take a few minutes.

79
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,809
-Tony.
-What?

80
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,471
Kiss me before you go.

81
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,243
-I told you I'd be right back.
-Kiss me.

82
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,678
-What do you want, blood?
-Yes, blood.

83
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:47,219
Don't boil over yet, Jill. It ain't time yet.
We got a little talking to do.

84
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,859
Hiya, slug. What's the bad word?

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,414
-What shift you working?
-Days. Standby Monday and Thursday.

86
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,996
You've put in an average 12, 14 hours
off-time a week for nearly a month,

87
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,492
mostly nights. How come?

88
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,969
I've been working on the Tully case.

89
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,129
We crossed that one off some time ago.

90
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,500
I ran into a new angle.

91
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,871
I'll give you a report on it
in about a week or so.

92
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,511
That's fine, Cochrane. Only don't overdo it.
Try and get a little more sleep.

93
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,476
Thanks, Captain.

94
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,763
If anybody calls, I'm working, Ole.
I'll check with you later.

95
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,028
-Anybody?
-Anybody.

96
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,573
Hiya, slug. What's the bad word?

97
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,108
There goes a very busy man.

98
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,184
-Well, this is it, kid.
-What do you mean?

99
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,352
The end of the line, baby.
This is where I get off.

100
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,322
-Did she find out about us? Is that why?
-Nobody found out anything.

101
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,960
You're just no good for me.
We both add up to zero.

102
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,172
-So, that's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

103
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,634
I'm sick of the whole crazy mess.
Sick of playing games.

104
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,571
The office, my kid.

105
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,382
I shouldn't be playing those games
with my kid.

106
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,510
Afraid your little angel
will find out about it?

107
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,316
She and that sweet little kid of yours?

108
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,824
I would have quit long ago.
You're worse than blood poisoning.

109
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,159
To hear you talk,
you'd think I was crawling after you.

110
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:17,600
I don't need you. I can buy and sell you.
I don't know why I bother seeing you.

111
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,901
You don't know why? I'll tell you.
You're rotten rich, through and through.

112
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,175
Like something they serve at the Ritz,
only it's been laying out in the sun too long.

113
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,839
That's right, Tony. You're not my kind.
You're the clean-cut type.

114
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,718
Little tootsie-wootsie loves
her great, big, stupid peasant.

115
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,845
Yeah, for all your dough,
like a ton of bricks.

116
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,520
How picturesque,
and you were totally unresponsive.

117
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,995
-You're like a sickness. I was sick.
-No, Tony, it was a fever.

118
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,654
It's a nightmare with convulsions.

119
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,064
No more fever. You can go back
to that little rat race of a home of yours.

120
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,430
Never mind what I'm going back to.

121
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,970
Pretty little house, pretty little wife,
pretty little brat.

122
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,266
Shut up!

123
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,315
You'll never get away from me, Tony.
I won't let you.

124
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,852
You're like me. There's a meanness
inside of you that has to hurt or be hurt.

125
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,750
We were meant for each other, Tony.

126
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,076
I guess they didn't see us.

127
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,285
It's a man and a woman.

128
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,117
I guess they came down
to look at the ocean, too.

129
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:01,367
Tony, no. Tony, no. Stop. Tony, stop!

130
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,870
-Stop.
-Tony, please, stop,

131
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,037
or there'll be a scandal.
Your wife, she'll leave you.

132
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,580
You'll lose the kid.

133
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,775
<i>You working late tonight?</i>

134
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,683
<i>Out again tonight? Out again tonight?</i>

135
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,313
<i>Maybe you won't come back,
like Georgie's pop.</i>

136
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,950
<i>-Won't come back... Won't come back...
-Out again tonight?</i>

137
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,296
He killed her.
Beat her brains out with a tire iron.

138
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,733
He got away.

139
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,934
You're not going to say anything, Tony.
Let the cops find out for themselves.

140
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,601
-I let him get away.
-You had to, Tony, for me, and for you, too.

141
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,440
You don't get it. She's just a kid in there.

142
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,073
He killed her. I'm a cop.
I didn't even try to stop him.

143
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,847
Tony, I wanna see her.
I wanna see her, Tony!

144
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,512
-Shut up!
-I wanna look at her, Tony!

145
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,817
-Shut up!
-I wanna look at her!

146
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,479
Did you find a clue to the Tully case
in the funny papers, eh, Tony?

147
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,390
-I was just reading them for laughs.
-I don't know. You weren't laughing.

148
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:05,025
I think maybe you work too hard, eh, Tony?
Every night. What does Martha say?

149
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,829
Don't worry about me, Ole, I'm okay.

150
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,266
Sure, you're okay.
You just need a rest, huh?

151
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,467
I told you, I'm okay.

152
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,807
Homicide. Strom speaking.

153
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,485
Yeah. Wait a minute.
Give me a pencil, Tony.

154
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,916
Yeah. What time?

155
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:40,060
How do you spell it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

156
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,592
Just leave everything alone,
we come right down.

157
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,595
Come on, Tony. We got work to do.

158
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,880
Pardon me, sir,
but do you perceive the faint aroma

159
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,185
-of sudden and violent death?
-I don't know. Stick around.

160
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,055
Your move, if you can find one, wise guy.

161
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:15,095
"...by Highway Patrolman Dickstein,
1328 Mitchell Beach Sub-Station.

162
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,200
"Kids found it about 35 minutes ago.

163
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,200
"Head bashed in. Name on registration slip,

164
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,244
"Elaine B-L-A-N...
Blanchard, 1 164 Falcon Drive."

165
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,980
-What did you say that name was?
-Elaine Blanchard.

166
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,848
Could be LD Blanchard's daughter,
or somebody using her car.

167
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,556
-Was the car smashed?
-No.

168
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,819
-Did you call the Coroner?
-Dickstein called the District Coroner

169
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,328
-out there.
-Any crumbs for the press?

170
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,491
Stay on the phone. Call Faniman.
Tell him to come down here and stand by.

171
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,763
-Come on, Tony.
-Get me Faniman.

172
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,598
You leave them just like that, Max,
and you've got him beat.

173
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,537
Listen, Ole. Ole, what's the dope?

174
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,577
Dead woman, off highway,
near Mitchell Beach.

175
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:04,081
-Maybe murdered, maybe Elaine Blanchard.
-Thanks. Give me that telephone.

176
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,510
-Any other cars been down here, Dickstein?
-No, sir. Not since I got here.

177
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,636
My name's Moppes, Captain. JM Moppes.

178
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,544
I examined the cadaver,
careful not to disturb anything, of course.

179
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,675
She's been dead about, I should say,
from 10 to 14 hours.

180
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,812
Skull crushed like an eggshell
by repeated blows with a blunt instrument.

181
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,617
Terrible, terrible.

182
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,624
Come on, Tony. Time to go to work.

183
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,223
Yeah. Yeah, let's get going.

184
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,347
Ain't that something?
She must have been a pretty little girl.

185
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,318
Plenty of prints on the dash,
maybe on the handle of her purse.

186
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,891
Looks like some rings have been
torn off her fingers. They're bruised.

187
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,861
There's no money or nothing
left in her pocketbook. Not a dime.

188
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,968
Hey, mister.

189
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,972
Me and my friend found her, mister.
We found the body.

190
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,542
Ain't there a reward or something'?

191
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,635
You didn't touch anything, did you?

192
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,648
Oh, no, sir. I know better than that.
I'm a Junior G-Man.

193
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,349
That's fine.

194
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,016
Here comes the meat wagon.

195
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,561
Come over here, Tony.

196
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,975
There's a fresh tire track
that crosses the convertible's.

197
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,848
It looks like a brand-new balloon-tire track.

198
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,623
And look,
there's a crescent-shaped cut in it.

199
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,326
You better get the plaster
and take an impression.

200
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,690
Yes, sir.

201
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,334
-Hi, Ole.
-Howdy, gumfoot.

202
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,306
-You got any leads, Ole?
-Right this way, gentlemen.

203
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,772
Thank you.

204
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,041
Max called me
and we beat them out with an extra.

205
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,511
It's the Blanchard gal, all right.

206
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,778
I called her house,
and she hasn't been home all night.

207
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:57,150
You'll never make a good detective.
You're just a nosy reporter after all.

208
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,589
Yeah? Look, taken about a year ago
at the horse show.

209
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,155
Yeah, could be.

210
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,164
Her pop's on his way out here.
Any angles, any motive?

211
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,795
-I guess the Captain thinks it's a robbery.
-Yeah. Do you?

212
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,372
What do you think, Tony?

213
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,905
Oh, boy.

214
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,687
Some of you seem to think
that robbery as a motive is too easy.

215
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:36,055
Maybe it is, maybe it ain't.
She'd been drinking.

216
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:41,828
She had about $200 in cash and somewhere
around 12 grand in jewelry on her.

217
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,095
She could've been driving by herself
and picked up a hitchhiker.

218
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,694
Someone could easily
have seen that jewelry in a bar

219
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,967
someplace where she stopped,
and followed her.

220
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,044
Sure, Chief!
You're right, she could have... She...

221
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,177
Anyway, there was another car
down there last night.

222
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,810
It had a Regal balloon tire
on one of its rear wheels with a big cut in it.

223
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,784
There probably isn't a chance
in the world of tracing it

224
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,688
unless it belonged to
one of Miss Blanchard's friends.

225
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,261
But take a crack at it anyway, Ole.

226
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,871
Andy, here's the list of the ice.

227
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:27,308
Give copies to the Pawn Shop Detail
and check with some of your fence friends.

228
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:31,906
We've got some swell fingerprints,
and at least two sets that aren't hers.

229
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,584
Some on the dashboard and door handle,
and some on the clasp of her handbag.

230
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,021
We haven't been able to
match any of these in our own bureau,

231
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,524
and we've sent photostats to Washington.

232
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,721
Unfortunately, there was
nothing on the tire iron, not a print.

233
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,230
-Did Ms. Blanchard booze much, Captain?
-Her best friend, a Miss...

234
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:56,203
A Miss Myra Laird, said she'd been
acting up for the past several weeks,

235
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,508
drinking a lot
and half-hysterical most of the time.

236
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,337
Hey, that sounds like maybe some guy...

237
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,074
Miss Laird thinks
maybe she'd been seeing somebody,

238
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:08,175
and since she was so undercover about it,
it'd probably be a married man.

239
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:13,684
Yeah, that would just about add up if maybe
she was putting the pressure on some gent.

240
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,660
Tusco, I want you to check this possibility

241
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,754
with the Blanchard servants
and all her friends.

242
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:24,029
Here's a partial list to begin with.
Give a copy of it to Strom.

243
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,872
The first thing in the morning, Cochrane,
if we haven't heard from Washington,

244
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,672
I want you to go over to her bank
and take a gander at her statement,

245
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,442
canceled checks for the month.
You might pick up something.

246
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,211
-Yes, Captain.
-That'll be all for now. Get to it.

247
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,792
You wouldn't hit a guy on the nose
for trying to be a friend, would you?

248
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,525
-What's eating you?
-Maybe I'm just a dumb cop,

249
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,932
but whatever's bothering you, Tony,
believe me, it ain't worth it.

250
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,311
-Yes, Cochrane.
-l...

251
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,615
I wondered if you wanted me
to go on with the Tully case, or...

252
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,682
Drop it for a few days.
Nothing's as important as this right now.

253
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,457
Yes, sir.

254
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,356
Then robbery is still our best bet?

255
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,196
-Still no love angle?
-Not yet.

256
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,533
You can always write in your own,
just like always.

257
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,472
Sure, use your imagination.
She was a she and the murderer was a he.

258
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,441
Now ain't that romantic?

259
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,480
Say, Willie, you making
enough copies of that so I can have one?

260
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,156
Merrill residence. One moment, please.

261
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,720
-It's for Mrs. Merrill, sir.
-It's probably Mr. Haskins. We're hours late.

262
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,491
Hello?

263
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,532
Hello, Maury. Hello, hello?

264
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,180
We were disconnected. It's probably Maury.

265
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,283
Do you realize, my dear, that we're very late?

266
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,821
I'm sorry, darling.

267
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:23,840
Hello?

268
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,849
Tony, I'm so glad you called.

269
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,155
I read the papers about that poor girl, and
I figured you'd be out on the case all night.

270
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,851
It's been pretty rough on you,
hasn't it, monkey face?

271
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,121
Oh, Tony, I love you so much.

272
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:41,190
I don't mind that you have to work.
It's just that I miss you so.

273
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,063
I know, baby, I know. Where's Doc?

274
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,104
At the movies?

275
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:52,603
Well, look, I thought maybe I'd eat home.
But now it's even better.

276
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,571
Maybe I can take you out,
like I was dating you.

277
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,319
-I guess I must be like a stranger to you.
-Oh, Tony, you big dope.

278
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,451
Well, I'll have to call Mrs. Wallace
and tell her I won't eat there.

279
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,620
I was so sure you wouldn't be coming home.
What?

280
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,728
You know Mrs. Wallace, she wouldn't care.

281
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,633
No, go ahead. I want you to go.
You made the date, didn't you?

282
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,035
But, Tony... But honestly...

283
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,403
-But you just said that I...
-Forget it, will you?

284
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,778
I told you to forget it.

285
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,076
Yeah. Okay.

286
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,387
What time are they picking you up?

287
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,227
What time will you be getting back?

288
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:50,729
Yeah. All right. Have a good time.

289
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,343
In a... In a minute.

290
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,196
So my theory is,

291
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:23,165
this dame, she says to this fella
she's going to call a copper,

292
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,638
and this fella can't stand still for that,
so he conks her, see?

293
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,741
He wants to make it look like a heist, see?

294
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,608
So he gloms her jewels
and scrams fast. See?

295
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,281
You sound just like
a detective story again, Mike.

296
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:43,116
-Evening, Lieutenant. What will it be?
-Buttermilk. Four glasses of buttermilk.

297
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:48,391
-Don't you go home anymore, Tony?
-Sure. I just stopped by for a glass of beer.

298
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,087
Find anything interesting on the list?

299
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,927
What's on your mind, Ole?
If you've got something to say, spill it.

300
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,627
I don't like this pussyfooting around.

301
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,600
We've been friends
for a pretty good long time, Tony.

302
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:05,642
-I just wanted to know how you make out.
-Well, don't be such a good friend to me.

303
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,843
I'm okay.

304
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,589
How are you making out?

305
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:24,127
I wanted to tell you about that.
You know them tire tracks?

306
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,256
I ain't so sure that one was a Regal.
It could just as easy be a Caddy.

307
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,560
Yeah?

308
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,465
Well, I gotta be going.

309
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,732
-How's Doc?
-Fine.

310
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,970
-And Martha?
-Fine, thanks.

311
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,108
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

312
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,014
-Good night, Mike.
-Good night, Mr. Cochrane.

313
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,320
You know, he don't look so good lately.

314
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,460
No, not so good.

315
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,575
Tony?

316
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,017
I thought you weren't coming back till 10:00.

317
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,489
I was tired.
What on earth are you doing in the dark?

318
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,852
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm changing the tire. I had a flat.

319
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,893
I'm sorry, darling.

320
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:49,337
-What's the matter with the light?
-It's busted. Don't touch it!

321
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:57,315
I told you it was busted!
I got a shock from it before.

322
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,764
It was a loose wire. I fixed it.

323
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,700
-Tony.
-Don't touch me!

324
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,607
I'm all dirty.

325
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,313
It's a funny thing
about the capacity guys like Tony have

326
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,412
for hurting the people they love the best.

327
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:09,015
He was a swell guy.
A sweller guy you'd never wanna meet.

328
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,990
But he had to go
and get himself all twisted up.

329
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,860
-Some guys got a talent for it.
-Talent? Say, this guy was a genius.

330
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,504
Come on, Stew, make with the words.

331
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:28,809
Tony came from the wrong side
of the tracks and had to fight his way up.

332
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:35,253
Maybe that's why he was always fighting.
Fighting himself and fighting her.

333
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,829
What are you doing here?

334
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,268
I hope I'm not inconveniencing you,
Mrs. Merrill.

335
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,808
You no doubt heard of
the unfortunate death of Elaine Blanchard.

336
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,844
I have a list of her friends
and your name appeared on it.

337
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,209
-Just a routine checkup.
-What is it, my dear?

338
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,545
This young man is from headquarters.
He's checking on poor Elaine's friends.

339
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,552
Oh, a dreadful thing.
Of course, if we can help...

340
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,146
It's hard to believe, such a nice girl.
Haven't I met you before?

341
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,555
Yes, sir. I investigated a burglary here
about a year ago.

342
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,856
That was before I was assigned
to the Homicide Detail.

343
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:19,952
Of course, of course.

344
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,727
Certainly you remember him, dear.
He's the nice young man I was so taken with.

345
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,893
Indeed, indeed.

346
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,834
Now, what can we do for you, Lieutenant...

347
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,633
-Cochrane.
-Lieutenant Cochrane?

348
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,469
Just a few routine questions.

349
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,941
-Sit down, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

350
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,372
When did you see her last?
Miss Blanchard, I mean.

351
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,075
Oh, not for ages.

352
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,286
It was the Fullerton reception,
wasn't it, dear?

353
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,649
There were hundreds of people there.

354
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,246
-Two weeks ago, Saturday night.
-She seemed so happy.

355
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,791
I'm sorry, but I'd hoped to be
at the office early this morning.

356
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,623
-An appointment, you know.
-Certainly. It was just routine.

357
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,822
That's all right, darling. You run along.

358
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,526
I'm sure I can answer
all of Lieutenant Cochrane's questions.

359
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,399
If we run into any difficulty,
I'll call you at the office.

360
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,770
Why, certainly. Be more than happy.
You can reach me anytime.

361
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,308
Goodbye, dear.

362
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,679
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Anything at all, Lieutenant, just call.

363
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,122
Goodbye, dear, goodbye.

364
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:27,858
-What's the idea of putting on the act?
-Mix me a drink, Tony.

365
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,798
-I'd like to mix you a drink.
-Wouldn't you?

366
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,007
Isn't it a little early for you to be drinking?

367
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:48,018
Oh, no. This is kind of a celebration
by way of a reunion, isn't it, Tony?

368
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,916
-I thought you said we were through.
-I'm here on business.

369
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,717
Of course, darling. Won't you sit beside me?

370
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:05,397
Why not? We're old friends.

371
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,502
Here's to old friends.

372
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:19,449
-I don't get it. Why the sudden switch?
-No switch. I'm just giving up struggling.

373
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,081
-I know when I'm hooked.
-Really?

374
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,814
Yeah, you got my number and I know it.

375
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,885
I like you better the other way, Tony.

376
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:32,053
No. I says to myself,
what's the use of struggling?

377
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,788
You go for her and she goes for you.

378
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,524
-Wait a minute, Tony.
-Tell me, baby,

379
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,732
what was the name of the guy
that bumped off the Blanchard kid?

380
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,830
-What?
-You heard me.

381
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,205
He's one of your fancy friends.

382
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,941
Let go of me.

383
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,106
If you're such a smart detective,
find out for yourself.

384
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,945
-You know him.
-Sure I do.

385
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,348
Now you try and find out who he is.

386
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,750
That's a criminal offense,
what you're doing.

387
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,287
That's right, but it works both ways.

388
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,324
I could sure throw a monkey wrench into
your pretty little domestic merry-go-round.

389
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,325
-Don't be cheap!
-At these prices?

390
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,224
I won't be threatened!

391
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,929
Okay, Jill.

392
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,362
I don't know his name, Tony. Honest.

393
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,169
I must have seen him at a party
or something.

394
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,971
That's all right, Jill.

395
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,443
I just wanted to find out
whose side you were on.

396
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,643
-Your side, Tony. Your side.
-Sure.

397
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,614
-Don't go, Tony.
-I gotta.

398
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,591
You know, the wheels of justice,
they gotta keep turning.

399
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,786
Come back and see me, Tony.

400
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:42,261
I'll come back and see you, baby.
That's one thing you can be sure of.

401
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,292
We're partners, ain't we?

402
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,741
So, if I could see
Miss Blanchard's canceled checks,

403
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,786
-sometimes we get a lead that way.
-Anything at all, Mr. Cochrane.

404
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,756
Mr. Loring, please.
He's our vice president, he'll...

405
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,651
Hello, Douglas?
I'm sending you Lieutenant Cochrane.

406
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:17,132
He'd like to look at the Blanchard account.
Yes, right away. He'll be able to help you.

407
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,601
Just across the bank, third desk.

408
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,304
-Loring?
-Yes.

409
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,702
Thank you.

410
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,250
-Lieutenant Cochrane?
-You're Mr. Loring.

411
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,349
I've sent for the things you want,
Mr. Cochrane. Sit down.

412
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,054
I'll be happy to do
anything else I can to help.

413
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,322
Thanks.

414
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,327
How...
How well did you know Miss Blanchard?

415
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,996
Oh, quite well. Known the family for years.
Same club, all that.

416
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,074
She was, however,
one of my wife's dearest friends,

417
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,972
-and I suggest that you talk to her.
-Is...

418
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,012
Is there anyone you could think of
who might have had some reason

419
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,572
to kill her as brutally
and savagely as they did?

420
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,753
None. She was a sweet girl, and so far as I
know, didn't have an enemy in the world.

421
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,985
Don't the police seem to think that robbery...
Thank you, Mr. Graham.

422
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,161
Here you are, Lieutenant.

423
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,059
Well, I hope we can get something
out of these. Thank you.

424
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,696
You're very welcome, Mr. Cochrane.
Any time at all that we can be of service.

425
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,966
Tell me,

426
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:34,010
do the police have anything definite
upon which to base their theory of robbery?

427
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:39,208
No. Her jewelry was gone,
but, you see, the man who murdered her,

428
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,717
a clever man
with an entirely different motive,

429
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,084
-might easily have taken it to throw us off.
-I see.

430
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,084
When did you see her last?

431
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,653
Well, let me see.
Last weekend, Mrs. Loring and I...

432
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,225
No, no, I saw her for just a moment
day before yesterday.

433
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,736
The day she was... The day of the tragedy.

434
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,672
She was here, in the bank,
just a little while before closing.

435
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,304
Did you talk to her?

436
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,038
Yes. Something about
a dinner party she was planning.

437
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,842
She was quite keyed up about it. She...

438
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,118
Poor Elaine. She was so young
to be brutally struck down like that.

439
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,653
Thanks again.

440
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:29,129

00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,051

Certainly. Yes.

446
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:05,159
-That was a quick one, eh, Tony?
-Yeah, quick.

447
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,569
What do you mean?

448
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:11,505
Thirty-six, no, just 34 hours
since the murder and we got him.

449
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:16,169
-We're pretty smart gents in this department.
-Who is he?

450
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,712
He said his name is Phillips,
a journeyman carpenter.

451
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,718
A radio car picked him up
over in Queens on a wag

452
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,655
and found Miss Blanchard's jewelry on him.

453
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,782
-Has he confessed?
-He don't need to.

454
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:34,163
He's told three completely different stories,
and his prints are all over her purse.

455
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,995
He said he was asleep
in an old shack on the beach

456
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,628
and found her yesterday morning dead
and took her things.

457
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:44,698
It's open and shut.

458
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:48,711
He'll break pretty soon
and tell who was with him. He'll break.

459
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,371
He'll get the chair. Murderer.

460
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,641
-He killed her.
-He'll sing.

461
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,738
Open and shut.

462
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,875
-Lead-pipe cinch.
-Guilty.

463
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,103
Well, Mrs. Merrill.

464
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,169
How nice to see you, Mr. Cochrane.
It is Mr. Cochrane, isn't it?

465
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,912
-Well, did you see him?
-Yes.

466
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,555
-Is that him, or isn't it?
-Of all places, in a bank.

467
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,249
-Sitting there as calm as...
-I had to make sure.

468
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,689
In a bank.

469
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,325
Doesn't look like a murderer.
I think he's rather attractive.

470
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,898
-So is a snake.
-Don't be bitter.

471
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,297
Anyhow, I'm glad it's all over.

472
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,599
How about a date, Tony? Remember?
The day is still young.

473
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,133
-What do you mean?
-Oh, Tony.

474
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,903
Forgive me, Mrs. Merrill, but I'm a busy man.

475
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,743
Well, they got the murderer, didn't they?
Some thieving little tramp.

476
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,941
-I'll meet you by the car.
-No. Just a minute.

477
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,116
-So nice seeing you.
-Thank you. Remember me to your husband.

478
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,816
Where's your car?

479
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,788
No. Not the car.
In the library, behind the stacks.

480
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,512
-Time's a-wasting, Tony.
-Are you crazy?

481
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:39,214
-What are you talking about?
-The murderer. The guy in the bank.

482
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,314
Oh, don't be a fool, Tony.

483
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:45,292
Elaine was a nasty little brat.
She probably had it coming to her.

484
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,227
-What?
-Keep quiet.

485
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,300
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry.

486
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,596
No, indeed, sir. I'm sorry.

487
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,433
You're acting like a fool.
You looking for more trouble?

488
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,143
-The guy they picked up is innocent.
-What's the difference?

489
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,551
The difference is, we gotta go tell them.

490
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,620
Or else it'll be you and me
that'll be pulling the switch

491
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:14,020
on that poor little slob when he kicks out
his last breath for something he didn't do.

492
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:18,026
Tony, honey, he's just a little nobody.
Who's going to miss him?

493
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,894
-Besides, he did rob the body.
-What about our Mr. Loring?

494
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:25,097
He's not the type
that goes around killing people.

495
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,601
But we saw him.

496
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,935
Of course we saw him.
She probably deserved it.

497
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:35,673
-That's twice you said it.
-Tony, dear, you're not the Galahad type.

498
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,879
Do you want to mess up both our lives?
Lose your job, your wife, your child?

499
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,713
What about his wife?

500
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:45,321
If you feel so bighearted, why don't you
think about what it'll do to her?

501
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,448
-How do you know he's married?
-I know. I know.

502
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:55,964
You're rotten. Pure, no-good, first-rate,
high-grade, A-number-one rotten.

503
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:02,395
-Tony, I love you.
-A fine kind of love. A female spider.

504
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:07,208
All right, Tony, have it your way.
But you'd better be clever.

505
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,979
-I'll be clever.
-Tony, no heroics.

506
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,177
I'll tell you when it's time to start worrying.

507
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,856
Tony, how about a date?

508
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:25,352
I ain't got any time for dates, baby.
I'm gonna be busy being clever.

509
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:28,756
Tony.

510
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,247
Pretty, aren't they?
They won't do her any good now.

511
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:55,622
Yeah, very pretty. This is the one I want.

512
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,119
I'll bring it back to you tomorrow.

513
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,198
So long, Tony.

514
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,103
Well, well, Mr. Cochrane.
Back the same day.

515
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,070
-We got him.
-I read the papers.

516
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,505
-Probably a psychopath.
-Yeah...

517
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,908
This is just routine, Mr. Loring.
Identifying the jewelry found on him.

518
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,072
Do you recognize this clip?

519
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,910
She was probably wearing it
that last day, when she was here.

520
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,579
Why, yes, I... It's an unusual piece.

521
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,118
-I remember her having it on.
-Oh, that's fine.

522
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:32,127
Would you just sign this, please?
It's just a routine statement of identification.

523
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:37,356
Sorry. We bank people are trained to read
things pretty carefully before signing them.

524
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,935
Sure, I know.

525
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:45,874
-You've been a big help. Thanks.
-You're very welcome. And congratulations.

526
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,205
-Congratulations?
-Of course.

527
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,244
I think all you men of the police force
deserve the highest praise

528
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,114
for apprehending the murderer so quickly.

529
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,980
Sure. Well, so long.

530
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,834
Stewart speaking.

531
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:25,909
Okay, Swanson, fold up and get back here.
Melville turned up in bed.

532
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,447
<i>Rain, rain, go away
Ronny Melville's here to stay</i>

533
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,851
<i>He'll marry another blonde today</i>

534
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,915
Hey, that cookie's fingerprints
was on the fountain pen.

535
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,755
-What cookie?
-Loring's.

536
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,386
What kind of a detective
was that dope Cochrane?

537
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:44,228
It didn't take him any longer to figure out
the fountain-pen angle, either.

538
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,599
That was his first piece of evidence
against Loring.

539
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,896
So the fingerprints matched.

540
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,804
Cochrane got his man.

541
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:56,274
And he goes back to his little home
in the West with his wife and kid.

542
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,711
So they live happily ever after.

543
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,918
The fingerprints matched, all right,
but he still didn't have enough evidence.

544
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,148
He worked a long time.
Tony was a good detective.

545
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:10,586
Only, when a guy gets himself so balled up,
he don't get away with it so easy.

546
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,889
He had all the dope on Loring.
Enough to put him away

547
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,331
if things worked out
the way Tony thought they would.

548
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,376
I got plenty on him.
More than I need. I told you.

549
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:32,107
Now I'm going down to the Chief's
and get him to come with me to the DA.

550
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,649
Sure I'm sure.

551
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,015
<i>This is the kiss-off, toots.
In more ways than one.</i>

552
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,314
<i>You're a free woman.</i>

553
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,487
Oh, no, baby.
I'm not coming down to see you.

554
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,689
<i>In the flesh, you're bad medicine for me.
I'll stick to the phone.</i>

555
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,367
Well, I don't know
what you're cooking up, baby,

556
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,936
but whatever it is, I ain't buying.

557
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:07,614
Blanchard murderer to pay the full penalty!
Phillips goes to chair tomorrow morning!

558
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:12,587
Get your paper.
Phillips goes to chair tomorrow morning.

559
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,718
Get your paper.

560
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,988
Phillips goes to chair tomorrow morning.

561
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,828
Here you are, get your paper.
Get your paper.

562
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,502
That's a pretty impressive pile of work
you've got here, Cochrane. You did fine.

563
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:39,145
-Do we go to the DA?
-You did fine.

564
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,246
Phillips has only got
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

565
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,980
It's worth a try.

566
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,753
I know this must come
as a surprise to you, Bill,

567
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,799
but that's a pretty good job
Cochrane here did.

568
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,266
And he didn't get all his evidence together
until tonight.

569
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,098
-It's circumstantial.
-That's right.

570
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,071
But it's worth a stay of execution
until we get a hold of Loring.

571
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,404
I don't think that will be necessary.

572
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,948
-Gentlemen, Mr. Loring.
-Mr. Cochrane.

573
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,384
I was just discussing you with Bill.
Our District Attorney, Bill Halloran.

574
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,427
Mr. Loring, these gentlemen want
to ask you a few questions. Do you mind?

575
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,293
-Of course not.
-This is Lieutenant Strom.

576
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,925
This is Captain Lawrence of Homicide.
And I take it you know Lieutenant Cochrane.

577
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,402
Why, yes. I should say
we're almost old friends. Captain.

578
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,065
-Sit down, Mr. Loring.
-Thanks, Bill.

579
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,904
-Now...
-Before we proceed, Captain,

580
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,841
I think it only fair to tell you that Mr. Loring

581
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,413
came here of his own free will
and told me the whole story.

582
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,482
And I think it only fair to tell Mr. Loring

583
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,245
that we checked the second set
of fingerprints in the death car

584
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,786
and find that they're his.

585
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,378
That's what he came up here
to tell me about.

586
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,985
-Well, supposing you explain it to me.
-I'd be very happy to tell it again to you.

587
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:04,226
I knew that this Lieutenant Cochrane
was more than slightly interested in me,

588
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,493
and I felt it my duty to clear up
any confusion that might arise.

589
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,732
-Well, why did you wait until now?
-Wait a minute, Ole.

590
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,105
When you picked up
the murderer of Miss Blanchard,

591
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,647
I saw no use to involve either myself
or my family in an unnecessary scandal.

592
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,945
Had you not picked him up when you did,
I assure you, I would have come forward.

593
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:24,987
-Why would you have come forward?
-It's very simple, Captain Lawrence.

594
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:28,182
I suppose I must have been
the last person outside of the murderer

595
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,384
to see Miss Blanchard alive.

596
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:35,122
What do you mean by that, Loring?
When did you last see Miss Blanchard alive?

597
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,668
-I was in her car with her that afternoon.
-What time that afternoon?

598
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:42,535
It was after banking hours.
From half past four to 6:00, say.

599
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,036
-Where did she pick you up?
-Near the bank.

600
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,306
-Where'd she let you out?
-At the same place, near the bank.

601
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,711
I'll explain everything to you,
if you'll permit me.

602
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,147
That's what we're here for, Mr. Loring.

603
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,342
I admit my relations with Miss Blanchard

604
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,444
were not everything
that they should have been,

605
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:03,356
and I'm more than sorry about that.
She fell in love with me. It was my fault.

606
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,862
That afternoon, I went out in her car
with her to try to make her see.

607
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,558
Well, she wanted me to divorce my wife,

608
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,396
whom I love very dearly
in spite of everything, and marry her.

609
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,302
She was hysterical, said she was going to
tell the whole world. So I thought...

610
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,069
-So you killed her, isn't that right, Loring?
-I killed her?

611
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,711
You killed her,
beat her to death with a tire iron.

612
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,941
I beat that poor girl to death and then
come down here and tell you all this?

613
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:29,041
What do you think I am, a fool? Believe me.

614
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:33,987
I tell you, I had no more to do with
the death of Elaine Blanchard than you did.

615
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,223
What would you say, Loring,
if we told you we could produce witnesses

616
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,565
that weren't 30 feet from you
and saw you kill her?

617
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,365
What would I say?

618
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,769
I'd say, gentlemen, you couldn't possibly
produce such witnesses,

619
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,846
because they don't exist.

620
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,446
Do you want to ask him any questions?

621
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,526
-Yeah, I would like to.
-Go ahead.

622
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,955
Can you tell us
where you were that evening, Mr. Loring?

623
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,131
After Miss Blanchard left you at the bank?

624
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,570
Really, gentlemen, it might appear as though
this were premeditated, but I...

625
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:24,867
Shall I have her come in?

626
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,036
I had hoped to spare her the embarrassment.
It really isn't fair to involve her, but

627
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,082
-I suppose it would be better.
-Yes, I think it would be better.

628
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,013
You see, I went to a picture that night.

629
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,088
My wife was out
and I didn't bother going home to dinner.

630
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,453
I just happened to bump into...

631
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,000
This is Mrs. Merrill, gentlemen.
This is Captain Lawrence.

632
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,502
You've heard of the Merrills, I'm sure.

633
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:58,665
-Lieutenants Strom, Cochrane.
-Don't be alarmed, my dear.

634
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:02,404
How do you do?
You're all on the side of the law, I'm sure.

635
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:07,342
I meant to come here, to see Bill, of course,
directly after cocktails at the Merrills'.

636
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,977
My car broke down and Mrs. Merrill
was kind enough to drive me down.

637
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,851
-lf you don't mind, Mr. Loring...
-Captain Lawrence would like to know

638
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,425
what you did the night
the Blanchard girl was killed.

639
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,394
-What I was doing?
-No, my dear, they're only interested in me.

640
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:21,586
Why you?

641
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,792
You'd help us, Mrs. Merrill,
by simply answering.

642
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,302
This is so silly. I...

643
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,862
Of course.
I went to a late movie with Mr. Loring.

644
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:35,502
-I ran into him quite by chance downtown.
-Does that satisfy you?

645
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,510
It does me.

646
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,748
Tony?

647
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:04,430
Thanks for coming, Loring. Thank you,
Mrs. Merrill. If we need you, we'll call you.

648
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,600
Won't you drop by later, Mr. Halloran?
We're having a party.

649
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,904
Thanks. Maybe I will.

650
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:11,447
-Bill, if there's anything else I can do...
-Forget it.

651
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,003
Well?

652
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:49,349
What kind of a hot brick did you
hand me down at the DA's office?

653
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,353
Did you drag me all the way
down here to tell me that?

654
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,922
I've got to get back to my party.

655
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,960
You're coming back to the DA's office
with me and tell him you lied.

656
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,656
You're gonna tell him you weren't
with that ape but with me that night.

657
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,529
-What are you drinking, lady?
-Nothing for me, thanks.

658
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,000
But you better have a shot ready
for the boyfriend here.

659
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,128
He's going to get a shock.

660
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,300
-Where are you heading in?
-You poor, dumb cop.

661
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:18,041
Why do you think I got him
to the DA's office ahead of you?

662
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,250
So you got yourself a new boyfriend?

663
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:26,820
He's more my type. You can go back
to your Martha now. I'm leaving.

664
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,856
You're coming down
to headquarters with me right now.

665
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:35,129
Listen, you fool, you can get me
there, but who'll believe you?

666
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,830
You can't do a thing about it, Tony.
Your hands are tied. In just about

667
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,099
ten hours, it'll all be over.

668
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,878
Who're you going to tell it to? The Marines?

669
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,551
How about it, bub?

670
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,153
The lady was only half right.
Make it a double.

671
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,904
Okay, Ole. You don't have
to follow me around anymore.

672
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,881
I was worried. You didn't look so good.

673
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,944
-You've been tailing me for weeks.
-You look pretty tired, Tony.

674
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,850
-Come on, I'll take you home.
-Loring's guilty.

675
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,986
Sure, sure.
But we just can't do anything more about it.

676
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,366
-Come on, we'll go home.
-I saw him do it.

677
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:46,697
-Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll talk about it.
-No, wait a minute, will you?

678
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:49,294
-You've got to believe me.
-I believe you, Tony. I believe you.

679
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,738
No, you don't, Ole.
You don't believe me for a minute.

680
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:55,971
Did you see that dame I was talking to
in here a minute ago? She was with me.

681
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:59,445
She saw him do it, too.
You know I've been seeing her?

682
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,243
Yeah, she's a pretty bad one.

683
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,649
You know so much
and you don't know nothing.

684
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:08,656
-What have you been tailing me for?
-I like you, Tony. And I like Martha and Doc.

685
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,292
That's what I'm saying.
What else would I be telling you for?

686
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:15,524
Okay, Tony, you seen it.
But who're you going to tell?

687
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,499
Come on, we'll go home.
Nobody is believing you.

688
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,228
You've got no proof.

689
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,770
-That's what she said.
-What did who say?

690
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,966
That Merrill dame.
She said nobody'd believe me.

691
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,337
No proof.

692
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,273
Proof.

693
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:37,683
-You want proof? Okay, I'll show you proof.
-Wait a minute, Tony.

694
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,687
-Remember the tire?
-What tire?

695
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,848
The one with the cut in it.
The tracks on the beach.

696
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,358
-You were stinking with curiosity then.
-Yeah. Yeah.

697
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,929
It's my tire. It's in my garage.

698
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,266
-Yeah?
-Can't you see? We don't have any time.

699
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,390
-Ma!
-Oh, go to bed, honey. It's all right.

700
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,986
-Is that you, Tony?
-Martha!

701
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,891
Martha, honey. I ain't the guy to say this.

702
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,698
-I don't know how else to tell you. I love you.
-Oh, Tony.

703
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,705
No, wait a minute, I don't have much time.

704
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,139
I don't want to ever hurt you and Doc,
not for anything in the world.

705
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:36,542
Oh, keep still, you big fool.
Do you think I'm blind?

706
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,443
-You know?
-I don't know anything.

707
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,984
All I know is, come home quickly, Tony,
to us, quickly.

708
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,579
-What's the matter, Pa? What's the matter?
-Oh, nothing's the matter, baby.

709
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,749
-Everything's all right.
-Yeah.

710
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,124
Everything's going to be fine
from now on, ain't it?

711
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,854
-Are we going to go fishing?
-Hurry up, Tony.

712
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,489
It's getting later than you think.

713
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,536
Yeah, yeah, we're going fishing,
the three of us. A real vacation.

714
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,869
-Just wait till I come back.
-Soon. Come back soon.

715
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,271
Even if I'm not a detective?

716
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,813
Even if you're the popcorn vendor
at the baseball game.

717
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,791
The police car will be here
in a couple of minutes, Tony.

718
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,225
No. I got to get her myself
while I've still got my badge.

719
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,024
That's what they call poetic justice, isn't it?

720
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:31,567
Yeah, I guess those poet fellows
know what they're talking about.

721
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,398
-I do it alone, see?
-I won't bother you.

722
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,374
-Is Mrs. Merrill in?
-Good evening...

723
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,237
Never mind, we'll find her.

724
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,248
-Good evening, Lieutenant.
-Good evening.

725
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,690
Not going to raid us, are you?

726
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,753
Nothing stronger than 3.2, so help me.
Care to have a drink?

727
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,731
No, thanks, I'd like to speak
to Mrs. Merrill for a moment.

728
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,699
She was here just a minute ago. I saw her.

729
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,067
Oh, yes, she went to the kitchen
for some more drinks. I'll get her.

730
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:12,266
-No, never mind, I'll go.
-Anything serious, Lieutenant?

731
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:16,501
No. This is Lieutenant Strom, Mr. Merrill.
I think maybe he wants a drink.

732
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,108
I'm all wet on the outside, I might just
as well be wet on the inside, too.

733
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:43,903
Hello, Tony.

734
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,803
Tony doesn't know anything about manners.
He's very crude.

735
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,146
-Hello, Cochrane.
-I want to talk to you, Jill.

736
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:55,547
-Oh, don't be silly, silly.
-I'll take these drinks out.

737
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,523
-Well, how do you like that?
-Can you hear me?

738
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,652
Sure, I can hear you.
What do you think I am, deaf?

739
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,129
I found somebody who believed me.

740
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,964
I said, I found somebody who believed me.

741
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,833
I heard you, Tony. Now what happens?

742
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,338
Now we go down to headquarters
and sing a duet.

743
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,503
You're going to tell them
you lied about Loring.

744
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,805
All right, Tony.

745
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:30,146
I shouldn't have tried to change your mind.
I can see that now.

746
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:33,313
I was a coward, Tony,
but you give me strength.

747
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,949
Save your pretty words for the DA.

748
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,495
You meant a lot to me, Tony,
and you mean a lot to me.

749
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:44,096
I'm a funny girl. I don't understand it myself.

750
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:46,792
Why I do things.

751
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:53,668
Well, I suppose we're through.
You can give me one goodbye kiss.

752
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,471
Come on, one farewell kiss.

753
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:05,515
-It won't hurt much.
-You're a screwy dame.

754
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,924
Tony! Tony, I didn't mean it.

755
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:24,332
It's okay, Jill. I guess you had to.

756
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,075
I'll tell them, Tony, honest, I'll tell them.

757
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,341
That's right, Jill.

758
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,550
I'll tell them, Tony, honest.

759
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:23,325
Take Loring and the girl to the first car.
You can take Cochrane in your car.

760
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,054
You know what this means.
You'll lose your job.

761
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,887
Maybe Martha and Doc. You'll go to jail.

762
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:58,029
It took a lot of guts. I'm proud of you, Tony.

763
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,868
Thanks, Ole.

764
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,952
I can guess
why you told that story, Mr. Stewart.

765
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,890
Thanks, but, well, you see,
I knew that story a long time ago.

766
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,086
Even more completely than in your files.

767
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,687
No, you're wrong, son.
I didn't tell that story for you.

768
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,235
Every guy who lets himself
get mixed up should hear it.

769
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,232
It's a funny thing...

770
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,103
Hey, where's Johnny?

771
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,004
-What happened to Johnny?
-He just left.

772
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:00,153
Hey, Tony, give me a package
of cigarettes, will you?

773
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:04,461
Hiya, Johnny. You're lucky.
I just came down here to pick up the kid.

774
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,995
I always take him and the wife
out fishing every Sunday.

775
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,172
-The usual?
-Yeah.

776
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,542
Some kid. The hottest detective in homicide.
Here you are.

777
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:28,621
-Tony!
-What's the matter, you seen a ghost?

778
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:33,590
-You're Tony Cochrane.
-Well, how did you know my last name?

779
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,989
Oh, sure, you must know Doc.

780
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:40,191
Boy, I'm sure pleased to meet you,
Mr. Cochrane. Boy, I sure am.

781
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,538
Yeah, I'm sure glad to have made your
acquaintance. You'll never know how glad.

782
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:47,131
-Well, thanks, Johnny. So long.
-So long, Mr. Cochrane.

783
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:49,872
Oh, hey.

784
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,040
Hey, Johnny. Coffee?

785
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:58,609
-No, thanks. Going home.
-Johnny.

786
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,483
-You forgot your cigarettes.
-Thanks again, Mr. Cochrane.

787
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,493
Mr. Cochrane?

788
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,325
What's the matter with the guy?
He's been calling me Tony for years.

789
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,297
I'll be right down, Pa.
