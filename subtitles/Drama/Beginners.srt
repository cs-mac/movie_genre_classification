1
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,028
Does it work?

2
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,326
To our friend, Hal Fields.

3
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,995
Hal, we love you!

4
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,477
Arthur,

5
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,147
you will come live with me, OK?

6
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,566
That's my car.

7
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,295
The dining room,
where people are sometimes dinner.

8
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,636
The living room.

9
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,851
The bathroom.

10
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,781
We are in 2003.

11
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,242
Looks like the sun,

12
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,534
the stars

13
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,869
nature.

14
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,579
The President.

15
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,792
And here is the sun in 1955,

16
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,502
the stars

17
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,420
nature

18
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,130
cars,

19
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,173
phones,

20
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,050
movies and the President.

21
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,094
Pets.

22
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,179
The fireworks.

23
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,599
Smoking, that was it.

24
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,894
Kissing, that was it.

25
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,147
Be happy.

26
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,067
Be sad.

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,362
My parents were married in 1955.

28
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,616
He ran a museum,
She restored the house.

29
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,619
They had a child
and stayed married 44 years

30
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,790
until she died in their beds,
after 4 months of cancer

31
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,001
to eat only french toast

32
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,336
before the Teletubbies,

33
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,171
by confusing
straws and cigarettes

34
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,425
and mixing times
in his head.

35
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,804
Six months later,
my father told me he was gay.

36
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,806
He had just turned 75.

37
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,266
I'm gay.

38
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,770
I remember him in purple sweater
but in reality he was wearing a bathrobe.

39
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,774
I loved your mother, but ...

40
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,485
Now I want to explore

41
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,404
that side.

42
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,365
I do not want to be gay
in my head.

43
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,578
I want to live.

44
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,833
He changed his wardrobe.

45
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,877
He found a boyfriend, Andy,

46
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,340
a sports coach
who spent his patent for fireworks.

47
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,177
After my coming out,
my father did me more about.

48
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,347
Since I am attracted
by older men.

49
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,851
It took a gay priest
as a spiritual guide.

50
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,895
He saw a psychiatrist for the 1st time.

51
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,939
He adhered to the Prime Timers,
to movie nights,

52
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,608
Pride in Los Angeles.

53
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,279
Four years after coming out,
he died in that room.

54
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,440
It's hard, loneliness ...
You should learn to talk to me.

55
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:47,197
I understand up to 150 words
but I do not know about.

56
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,492
I know.

57
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,977
Breathe calmly.

58
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,275
Oliver!

59
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,110
Remove me the ropes.

60
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,530
Daddy, stop!
You're going to hurt.

61
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,283
Mr. Fields, we will have
You attach the arms.

62
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,663
You two are married?

63
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,956
No, Dad.

64
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,083
Why not? It is great!

65
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,252
It's a great nurse

66
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,087
but does not know well.

67
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,672
T'assomment drugs.

68
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,634
Ah, you always had
good excuses.

69
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,595
Is not it?

70
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,890
No, I just do not become
as a mom and you.

71
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:57,684
Thank you!

72
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,498
Oliver?

73
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,044
Better than that!

74
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,841
That's good!

75
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,270
Throw yourself,
live your life with your fellow!

76
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,689
I will not stir from here.

77
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,694
I am a man, not a dog.

78
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,657
You are a Jack Russell,
a dog breed.

79
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,787
Your character was invented
by John Russell

80
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,957
a passion for hunting in the 19th century.

81
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,003
He raised your ancestors
for their endurance of hunters.

82
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,383
Do you think fox hunting
is your thing,

83
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,637
but you have been instilled
there for ages.

84
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,350
Today, bizarrely
humans find you cute.

85
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,644
They will raise

86
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,273
not for hunting
but to be cute

87
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,442
to show you on TV
in movies ...

88
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:34,281
You run after the ball
because you have more foxes!

89
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,580
MY PERSONALITY
WORK IS ANOTHER

90
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,208
And all he left behind,
IS THIS MORON T-SHIRT

91
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,755
Hi, Liz.

92
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,926
LOTS OF CHESS

93
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,495
I brought one of your books.

94
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,624
Okay.

95
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,501
Pass me the torch.

96
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,503
It's pretty ...

97
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,470
Andy has offered them to you.

98
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,060
It is that this picture?

99
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,812
I do not know.
It's just for decoration.

100
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,069
- And this?
- Photos, period.

101
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,364
What they do
in the exhibition?

102
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,700
These are personal photos,
not artistic.

103
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,164
That's the trick to fire.

104
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,167
- It's beautiful.
- What?

105
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,671
The Japanese garden up there.
It's beautiful.

106
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,339
Hal?

107
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,758
Andy!

108
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,228
I have something for you.

109
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,111
You've made a recording.

110
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,600
Even musicians
who want their portraits!

111
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,312
It pays the rent ...

112
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,816
You do something pretty
and they'll claim the same.

113
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,279
Hi, Liz.

114
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,869
Oliver?

115
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,414
The felt is not your friend.

116
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,040
The paper

117
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,126
is not your friend.

118
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,212
The party is your friend.
We are your friends.

119
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,757
Friends ...
are your friends.

120
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,679
I know how to

121
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,431
He knows how to move

122
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,349
I am moving

123
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,185
You know how it

124
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,439
Arthur, you're not invited to the party.

125
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,775
You're going to keep the house.

126
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,842
You remember Oliver
when he was funny?

127
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,054
When he spoke

128
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,389
in complete sentences?

129
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,936
"Funny" I do not know ...
"Fun" instead.

130
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,439
But if "dismal" is "fun"
it is pissing with laughter.

131
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,276
"Adorable", here!
You are absolutely adorable.

132
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,345
It is too cute!
He knows tricks?

133
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,305
Arthur does not turns.

134
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,725
Arthur sat!

135
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,271
The tab!

136
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,816
It is too cute, I do!

137
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,361
You zentai omnipotent
by giving zordres?

138
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,322
- Za gives you power?
- You are a psycho!

139
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,407
Freud!

140
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,451
Goodbye, Arthur!

141
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,124
I have not asked to be like that!

142
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,003
This color, nose,
the cheeks, chin ...

143
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,672
It's my life.

144
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,884
It is not in a fairy
nor a joke.

145
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,220
It feels good, Doctor.

146
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,973
To say what was on the heart.

147
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,601
Sorry, our session is over

148
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,061
for the week.

149
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,856
Thank you for coming.

150
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,827
I was just going to take a break.

151
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,794
We will kommencer by fotre mother.

152
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,386
I HAVE NOT UES

153
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,013
Fotre and father?

154
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,435
I do not understand, you're dumb?

155
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,481
Broblème pzykologique?
Crazy tread therapy?

156
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,654
I HAVE laryngitis

157
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,406
Z 'is a broblème of Zakynthos.

158
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,042
What are you doing at a party
If you are sad?

159
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,343
I managed to hide it so well ...

160
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,387
How did you guess?

161
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,820
Here I must drink a shot.

162
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,821
And you?

163
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,031
You stay there?

164
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,079
It's not a normal color
for a chicken.

165
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,582
You see what happens to you
when you leave your cage

166
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,669
- And you escape?
- You're more your color.

167
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,507
- Un .. Two ...
- Two glasses.

168
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,801
- What does that mean?
- They are two.

169
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,595
A girl and a guy?
Move!

170
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,351
Hello?

171
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,394
Oliver?

172
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,106
I am not sorry
to wake you up!

173
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,443
I went out to the Bar Act tonight.

174
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,902
Really?

175
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,322
They went to music

176
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,199
fantastically powerful ...

177
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,539
What is this music?

178
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,207
No doubt the house.

179
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,960
As "home." Okay ...

180
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,880
House ...
Music house.

181
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,049
- You made a match?
- Huh?

182
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,888
Young gays
do not want old gays.

183
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,724
For you, it's easy.

184
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,034
Would you like to dance?

185
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,849
Hello!

186
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,939
I can give you my number?

187
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,485
Thank you.

188
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,490
Tell him that the darkness
we swallow

189
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,951
If nothing radical
only comes on the spot.

190
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,954
I'm sorry I took Arthur,

191
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,664
I must go home.

192
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,461
I enjoyed our meeting.

193
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,758
"Goodbye!"

194
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,495
Is that you?

195
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,958
A beep for "yes".

196
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,548
I always wanted to talk
someone who is silent.

197
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,137
You want something done?

198
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,223
Now?

199
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,060
I parked a little higher.

200
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,913
You show leadership,
I drive.

201
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,093
By that?

202
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,119
It's pretty.

203
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,180
My mother?
My mother died there five years.

204
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,725
You have spoken!

205
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,021
It should not be.

206
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,986
My father died there two months.
Almost three.

207
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,575
He was gay.

208
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,747
He was gay throughout their marriage.

209
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,459
He's coming out
after the death of my mother,

210
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,461
at 75.

211
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,341
Forgiveness.

212
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,858
Are we may just sleep?

213
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,487
Of course.

214
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,385
WHO ARE YOU?

215
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,053
Oliver.

216
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,352
CASTING FOR NEW YORK.
RETURN Thursday.

217
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,896
After that, you stay here how long?

218
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,899
A year?

219
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,902
A month?

220
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,282
Okay ... Then what?

221
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,702
You play in a movie here.

222
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,662
What next?

223
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,459
Elsewhere ... Where?

224
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,265
I CAN see you again?

225
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,491
Hello, House!

226
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,326
"Hello, Oliver!"

227
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,790
Dad, you get so much mail!

228
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:54,009
Hal, progress has been remarkable
since you are on life support.

229
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,763
But ... ?

230
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,851
Bronchoscopy revealed a mass

231
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,564
the size of a coin
in the right lung.

232
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,734
The biopsy shows
it is cancerous.

233
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,239
I see.

234
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,908
It spread

235
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,537
to lymph nodes
of the chest and liver.

236
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,540
Given the weakness of the heart and lungs,

237
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,252
surgery
is impossible.

238
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,341
We can start by rays
and see if you support a chemo.

239
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,428
You can go home.

240
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,937
Have a question?

241
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,861
Thank you.

242
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,324
I'm sorry.

243
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,493
No hurry to announce.

244
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,204
With Andy?

245
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,541
No need to panic.

246
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,053
You read me something?

247
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,266
"The Brazilian dancer

248
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,518
"Is a demonstrated ability to partner

249
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,980
"But also a soloist
inspiration multiple

250
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,024
"Which can be interpreted ..."

251
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,237
No hurry
TO ADVERTISE

252
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,449
Do not say anything

253
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,244
FIRST DECAPITATION

254
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,668
FIRST LUNG CANCER

255
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,639
- He sleeps on your bed.
- He eats?

256
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,015
Yes, he eats.

257
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,976
I am so worried ...
There you are!

258
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,772
- What is it?
- A slug.

259
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
Andy, you can not get it ...

260
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,776
If I can. Look!

261
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,486
Fuck you.

262
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,115
This is the time of the inspection.

263
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,616
Hello, Mr. Fields.

264
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,662
I'm Andy, the companion of Hal.

265
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,539
Me is Sophia.

266
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,961
I have as much right to be here
as anyone.

267
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,213
Go for a walk, calm down.

268
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,928
What was that?

269
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,433
It's not easy for Andy either.

270
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,892
Be nice to him.

271
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,689
Forgiveness.

272
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,949
Where did you pick up that?

273
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,083
In our own! Cheers!

274
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,342
Alcohol is prohibited in the rooms.

275
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,181
Really?

276
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,517
Excuse me ...

277
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,936
No, no!

278
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,105
This is an amazing nurse.

279
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,357
The health system!

280
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,071
What have you done to my father?
He was so nice!

281
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,116
I invited him,
but no longer answers me!

282
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,246
Two, four, six, eight.

283
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,290
That's all you talking about?

284
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,834
I'll see her at her hotel, OK?

285
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,628
Are you happy?

286
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,922
Yes, very happy.

287
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,256
And you're happy?

288
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,425
There are eight.

289
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,012
We have not had
of real conversation ...

290
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,600
You think about her all the time.

291
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,271
- You say that because ... ?
- Because you do not speak.

292
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,148
I know you!

293
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,527
It's true.

294
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,532
I am ashamed. At 38,
I fall in love with a girl.

295
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,869
As if I had lost the user manual

296
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,871
or that I had ever had.

297
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,835
Where is Dad?

298
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,045
The museum.

299
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,841
Is there something wrong
you?

300
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,556
- You're the FBI?
- No.

301
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,601
The CIA?

302
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,770
KGB?

303
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,983
SLA?

304
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,359
CIPF?

305
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,361
BMW?

306
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,452
Nothing wrong between Dad and me.

307
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,505
When you are sad,
you go to your room

308
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,341
you scream loudly
one or two minutes

309
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,135
and it goes away.

310
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,304
It's called catharsis.

311
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,236
I do not want to cry.

312
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,115
It will come.

313
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,139
What is this shit?

314
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,934
"L-E-IT" Elliot.

315
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,395
- But this is ridiculous!
- I know.

316
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,564
You are not encouraging.

317
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,693
You copy something that was done
there 30 years in the Bronx.

318
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,947
Yes, I continues a tradition
citizen of insubordination.

319
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,740
I leave my limits.

320
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,661
How does it work?

321
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,913
Must be shaken. Shake!

322
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,052
1985: BUSH discover Jesus

323
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,061
And that's what?

324
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,146
Awareness of history.

325
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,940
I leave my limits.

326
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,193
Is repeated.

327
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,278
OK but when you see her,

328
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,366
do not tell him you're taggueur
Awareness of history.

329
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,716
It is nice.

330
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,677
Your father is missing.

331
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,124
Perhaps it could be ...

332
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,752
talk a little bit.

333
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:08,754
Okay.

334
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,350
My name is Anna.

335
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,940
You're afraid to trust me,
you do not know me.

336
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,444
I understand.

337
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,529
It makes sense to me.

338
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,950
Oliver, stop!

339
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,455
It's old music!

340
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,501
It's black music.

341
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:34,005
This is the deepest:
it is they who have suffered most.

342
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,424
They and the Jews.

343
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,720
In my next life,

344
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,808
marry a Jew very passionate.

345
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,436
Someone emotionally.

346
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,274
I am a Jew, right?

347
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,818
You're the fourth.

348
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,486
Me in half.

349
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,281
Your father at all.

350
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,616
He's the least emotional.

351
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,996
You will be more emotional than he

352
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,165
but I'm the most emotional.

353
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,461
You make the driver
but way down the coast.

354
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,592
You become an excellent driver.

355
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,864
Excuse me, Mrs. Fields ...

356
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,034
What is prohibited
dialogue with the work?

357
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,744
Is that ...

358
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,081
And you love
to the citizen wise?

359
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,208
No.

360
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,884
You pass me my jacket?

361
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,391
No, my jacket.

362
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,400
"Caraco"?

363
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,904
You do not know what it is?

364
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,450
I was raised by animals.

365
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,453
They did not like questions.

366
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,581
They disapproved of it.
I had to just guess.

367
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,252
Ask me any questions
you want.

368
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,130
All?

369
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,723
What is out there?

370
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,642
A tree.

371
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,519
Of cars.

372
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,855
Another building.

373
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,233
With people in it, like us.

374
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,695
Half think
it will never work.

375
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,822
The other half

376
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,032
believes in miracles.

377
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,535
This is war between them.

378
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,375
How do you know people as well?

379
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,423
We must learn

380
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,550
to read their faces.

381
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,097
For example,

382
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,727
here is

383
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,061
anger.

384
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,023
Joy!

385
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,278
Sometimes there is nothing.

386
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,658
There is nothing there.

387
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,412
They know very well show

388
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,289
something

389
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,084
while they are something else.

390
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,798
You do not know me.
I like it.

391
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,051
- No, it's wrong.
- Really?

392
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,345
You have blond hair,
long before.

393
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,057
You smoke where prohibited.
Sometimes you bite ...

394
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,814
You, you drive on the sidewalk.

395
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,108
You were raised by animals.

396
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,738
Sometimes you seem very alone
as if you had just landed.

397
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,407
You see, you do not know me at all.

398
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,460
I have never seen a girl like that.

399
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,214
A spark into your life
and you fall into the trap.

400
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,134
When is the wedding?

401
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,761
It does not work like that.

402
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,097
There are other steps.
It's complicated.

403
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,477
I hope this feeling will last.

404
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,728
So do I.

405
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,022
Why it's over
Michelle?

406
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,110
I do not know ...

407
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,736
She seemed great.

408
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,571
It was great.

409
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,741
You should spend
a classified ad

410
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,618
to explain your situation.

411
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,120
My "situation"?

412
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,082
You want to be a couple

413
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,917
and you are not.

414
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,212
It's your father's advice?
The ads?

415
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,842
Lots of people do that.

416
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,219
Even me.

417
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,637
What?

418
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,641
Andy is not monogamous,
why should I be?

419
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,726
Name of God, Dad!

420
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,812
Name of God yourself!

421
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,903
Hello, House!

422
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:54,117
"Hello, Hal!"

423
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,721
What this time?

424
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,930
A green caterpillar.

425
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,516
- There is no green caterpillar.
- But if!

426
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,477
Damn, it's disgusting!

427
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,984
You go?

428
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,111
Yes. Michael is visiting.

429
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,156
Okay ...

430
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,248
I thought it was your boyfriend.

431
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,918
At least I'm his No. 1 ...

432
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:46,920
Dad!

433
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,547
My stomach ...

434
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,049
Come on.

435
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,887
- Imagine ...
- Arthur, come down!

436
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,182
Imagine that
since you were small,

437
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,977
you have always dreamed

438
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,522
to have a lion.

439
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,191
You wait, you wait ...

440
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,818
And the lion can not.

441
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,615
Then comes a giraffe.

442
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,035
Either you stay alone,

443
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,788
either you keep the giraffe.

444
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,835
Me, I'd wait lion.

445
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,880
That's what worries me.

446
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,145
THE HISTORY OF SADNESS

447
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,480
THE EARTH IS FORMED

448
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,357
(SADNESS not yet invented)

449
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,905
First married couple
For the wrong reasons

450
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,491
INVENTION OF ALCOHOL

451
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,076
(ANCIENT EGYPT)

452
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,497
GAY FIRST DIAGNOSED
MENTAL PATIENTS

453
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,583
PILGRIMS

454
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,335
PAST

455
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,754
THIS

456
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,970
You want me to be
with someone like me.

457
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,806
I love Andy
because it is not like me.

458
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,101
He's funny.

459
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,742
You found what?

460
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,287
Liv Ullmann ...

461
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,581
A professional!

462
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,542
And I dug

463
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,337
This book of crazy!

464
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,256
It's something very American.

465
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,472
Maybe we will find
very American things to do.

466
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,893
Page 75?

467
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,857
, Or from 75

468
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,817
to page 80.

469
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,404
"Louise Brooks, star of silent films,

"And finally as a sales

472
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,745
I love it.

473
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:26,954
"Veronika Lake

"She died of hepatitis

478
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,348
All these stories of players ...

479
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,558
I can tell you.

480
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,352
This is not good.

481
00:44:56,276 --> 00:45:00,113
Well, I want
of real Mexican food.

482

No!

485
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,044
- Yes
- Really?

486
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,504
It's really good.

487
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,388
So what?

488
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,852
It's too good.

489
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,604
I was not sure that you love.

490
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,524
You're an actress,
you live in a fancy hotel ...

491
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,362
I love this place.

492
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,242
Before, I loved the hotels.

493
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,163
Now
I change all the time flat

494
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,540
or hotel, anywhere.

495
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,376
How do you keep your friends

496
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,587
or your little friends?

497
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:05,094
It can quickly fall into loneliness.

498
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,348
Stay away from people.

499
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,232
Even without moving
you can get away from people.

500
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,452
You're like that, you?

501
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,163
That you?

502
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,007
Then

503
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,092
it is the same?

504
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,012
I feel.

505
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,871
I wake you?

506
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,998
Thank you, Maria.

507
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,625
Since you're here,

508
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,170
can you store it there?

509
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,756
I reorganized everything.

510
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,716
The Prednisone makes you crazy.

511
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,803
I did not sleep, that's all.

512
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,268
Dad, you should rest.

513
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,645
As soon as I finish these papers.

514
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,480
Okay, the papers?

515
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,065
"Okay, Hal.

516
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,151
"When you have finished,
you can rest. "

517
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,456
What?

518
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,417
No. You're pretty.

519
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,586
No.

520
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,421
If!

521
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,465
Jewish girls are not pretty.

522
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,177
They are "interesting"
"Cute" but not "pretty".

523
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,888
Are you kidding here?

524
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,223
My mother told me.

525
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,352
This is not true!

526
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,187
No, you're right.

527
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,607
It was a little girl to school.

528
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,151
At home, my mother told me:

529
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,194
"Anna, who told you that?"

530
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:31,574
Anna tells me is how
she is Jewish, in 2003.

531
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,243
How do I tell him
my mother was Jewish.

532
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,537
My father gave
his homosexuality

533
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,164
when my mother gave
his Jewishness.

534
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,875
They married in 1955.

535
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,420
My mother did not learn she was Jewish
than 13 years.

536
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,755
In 1938.

537
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,132
People, that was it.

538
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,051
Lions,

539
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,385
giraffes.

540
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,804
He was "The Man of the Year".

541
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,016
His father did not say
they were Jews.

542
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,270
The team sent the
when they learned she was Jewish.

543
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,773
That was "pretty" in 1938.

544
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,985
My father knew he was gay
at 13.

545
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,779
In 1938.

546
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,156
That was "pretty".

547
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,576
The high school where they met.

548
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,995
The war they made each.

549
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,665
This man was famous
when they found themselves.

550
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,460
This is the only place where my father
made love in the 50s.

551
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,673
He said: "If the vice squad
we took, we lost everything. "

552
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,383
"All", that was it.

553
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,471
My father lay on a couch

554
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,140
to talk about his problems
in 1955.

555
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,894
For the doctor, homosexuality
was a mental illness

556
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,106
we could treat.
Everyone would not heal.

557
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,484
My parents lived here in 1955.

558
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,319
And there, the first gay movement

559
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,238
met in secret.

560
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,991
During their wedding ceremony,

561
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,745
Allen Ginsberg wrote his famous
poem "Howl" a few blocks away.

562
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,831
"... Who is left
take the ass

563
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,126
"Angelic by bikers
screaming for joy

564
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,671
"Who sucked and were sucked
these human seraphim ... "

565
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,431
Just do their portrait.
This is an album cover, right?

566
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,975
That's all they want.

567
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,645
Okay.

568
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,405
Damn!

569
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,157
I know. Go.

570
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,838
It's about the Gay Pride.
Do not touch it.

571
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,298
Okay.

572
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:41,138
And that's the Gay Book Club.
Do not touch it either.

573
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,808
And the chair, she is gay?

574
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,518
The chair is not gay.

575
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,478
Is clear.

576
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,900
The hose is not long enough!

577
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,027
The beard, that thing!

578
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,823
What's that?

579
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,618
Now that you got out of hospital
we must exercise.

580
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,577
Good idea!

581
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,123
- We try. I'll show you.
- Later ...

582
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,999
I make tea.

583
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,836
Well, I'll clean it ...

584
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,010
The vase your mother needs flowers.

585
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,390
It must be said to Andy
you are not going well.

586
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,852
You leave the hospital.
You should take it easy.

587
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,606
Tell him, okay?

588
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,151
Me?

589
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,653
Please.

590
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,095
You know, I tried
to sleep with women.

591
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,310
I wanted you to know
I've tried. It did not work.

592
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,523
I have no problem
with gays.

593
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,650
Have you ever slept with a man?

594
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,657
It is said that a man
who has not slept with another man

595
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:27,661
always afraid of gays.
They represent a threat.

596
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,498
I do not know, Andy ...

597
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,627
I did not want you to feel threatened.

598
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,671
I do not want to sleep with you!

599
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,801
My practical

600
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,305
it's called even
sexuality.

601
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,906
I could not tell him.

602
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,327
It's good.

603
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,914
But no.

604
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,416
You can not hide from him,
he loves you.

605
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,466
You are very lavish
for someone so alone.

606
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,354
Take a look natural.

607
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,315
When he has his back turned,
it breaks.

608
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,460
No, no!

609
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,298
It was my father.

610
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,432
It is so bad?

611
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,275
I am my father
and you make me.

612
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,453
Sweetie?

613
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,130
You can never remember!

614
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,551
I'm busy.
I turn all the time.

615
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,890
You know, I keep thinking ...

616
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,975
You know that.

617
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,894
To do so.

618
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,396
To do what?

619
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,232
Kill myself.

620
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,695
You're the one to whom I can say.

621
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,663
You should talk
Mom, not me.

622
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,667
You are my daughter.

623
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,637
Now I have to kill you.

624
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,142
- Everything was going so well ...
- I know.

625
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,811
Sorry.

626
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,194
Really?

627
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,045
Hi, Anna.

628
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,214
Hi, Oliver.

629
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,466
That would tell you, vandalism?

630
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,763
I do not know.

631
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,307
Maybe so.

632
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,484
Oliver,

633
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,238
no text seriously, okay?
A funny thing.

634
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,157
Girls like fun.

635
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,707
Give me Arthur.

636
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,710
We will stay there
until it is done to stop.

637
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,554
You?

638
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,974
Yes. I will stay here
with my new friend.

639
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,237
Anna?

640
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,083
I try to impress you.

641
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,376
Is that true?

642
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,883
It works.

643
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,894
You make me laugh but it's not FUNNY

644
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,690
Arthur!

645
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:51,985
Sorry.

646
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,862
No problem.

647
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,740
What is it, this card?

648
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,661
I can?

649
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,082
Thank you.

650
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,901
It looked like your father?

651
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,837
At one point, he refused to admit
he was sick.

652
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,351
Oliver,

653
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,937
I want you to Blake.
A wonderful man.

654
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:14,192
I finally have a tattoo!
For that I find if I get lost.

655
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,528
Good for him.

656
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,074
We bought a lot.

657
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,160
Full of books.

658
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,414
Clothing.

659
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,627
He was obsessed by the paper mills.

660
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,795
We bought lots of plants.

661
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,841
Lots of parties.

662
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,181
- Glad you came.
- I was going to prepare us for dinner!

663
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,142
It's movie night, dummy!

664
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,104
Hal, you're beautiful.

665
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,982
I'm trying to turn the corner.

666
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,946
The parties 'political'
writing letters ...

667
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,950
There was a gay member of Congress
he argued.

668
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,830
He hired a secretary.

669
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,124
"One morning in May ..."

670
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,460
He began to announce
it was better.

671
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,380
Why did you tell them
you turn the corner?

672
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,759
You have a cancer in phase 4!

673
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,137
It's not that bad!

674
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,139
Dad,

675
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,184
Phase 5 does not exist.

676
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,729
That's not to say that!

677
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,356
So what does that mean?

678
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,652
That there had been three previous phases.

679
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,289
What do we look?

680
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,917
"The Times of Harvey Milk"
the first gay politician ...

681
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,420
- I know who Harvey Milk.
- Very good!

682
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,554
He wrote a religious test.

683
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,264
"One day

684
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,225
"Jesus became old.

685
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:15,230
"He could not walk long
nor preach his loud voice.

686
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,859
"He told his apostles
that he would leave soon.

687
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,904
"The three disciples prayed,
the washed and fed.

688
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,783
"After several days suffocated,

689
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,994
"One morning at dawn,

690
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,164
"Jesus died."

691
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,043
You have rewritten the death of Jesus?

692
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,504
It was too violent!

693
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,798
We need new stories.

694
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,260
For the 1st time
I saw love.

695
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,388
He was outstanding

696
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,349
but it must have been crazy for you.

697
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,132
I could not sleep

698
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,093
and I wanted to walk.

699
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,598
You have suffered a great loss.

700
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,727
If I was not able to compensate?

701
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,233
If it is too,

702
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,778
we have to stop there.

703
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,622
Wait.

704
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,796
I do not want to stop.

705
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,225
Ready?

706
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,065
Encore!

707
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,150
Yet?

708
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:19,748
Fuck!

709
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,087
Arthur!

710
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,477
You're awake!

711
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,397
Arthur says to get up.

712
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:47,025
He says it's his day off.

713
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,652
He will talk to you too.

714
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,531
- He says "Now!"
- You have trouble understanding English.

715
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,617
He said "10 minutes".

716
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,216
You?

717
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,219
Did you have unraveled.

718
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,179
And it was your first time.

719
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,682
You, you looked
all these people turn ...

720
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:22,519
Sorry, dogs are prohibited.
You have to get out of here.

721
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,646
If I leave him alone, he panics.

722
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,524
Dogs are not allowed
in the facility.

723
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,151
In the car, it's impossible.

724
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,445
Sorry, no.
It must come out.

725
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:36,282
I do not like
the tone it takes.

726
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,119
She said in French
it's a small dog.

727
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,870
You call security?

728
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,623
There's only biting the pads!

729
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,232
Come on, Arthur!

730
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,527
Excuse me.

731
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,078
I can not do it!

732
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,713
He never calls as often.

733
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,131
Sometimes he goes.

734
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,511
It should not do that to you.

735
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,775
Even if you do not answer,
it is still there.

736
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,570
I fly somewhere and ...

737
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,327
You leave the hotel soon.

738
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,374
You should come home,

739
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,502
move in with me.

740
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,730
You would
a strange girl like me?

741
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,566
Yes, many.

742
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,364
You're cooking?

743
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,677
I'd love that.

744
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,307
I must kill you now.

745
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:07,934
Why?

746
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,436
I'm falling in love.

747
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,857
Anna and I are together,
we are in 2003.

748
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,900
Here the sky

749
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,235
and stars.

750
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,696
When we eat.

751
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,657
When we tell
what comes to mind us.

752
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,868
I was born in 1965.

753
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,620
Anna was born in 1971.

754
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,622
The sun, that was it.

755
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,166
His animals.

756
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,250
His parents.

757
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,043
She left home at age 16.

758
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,295
She has lived here

759
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:37,589
and here

760
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,174
and here.

761
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,886
She lived three important relationships.
She left each time.

762
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,305
I lived four important relationships.

763
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,558
I left too.
Or I left them fail.

764
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,852
We have not experienced this war.

765
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,021
We did not hide
to make love.

766
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,859
This gave us a chance
melancholy foreign to our parents

767
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:02,113
and happiness
I've never seen at home.

768
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:05,533
We do not know where does
what comes to mind us.

769
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,577
But when it stops,

770
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,330
I can really see
Anna's eyes in 2003.

771
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,040
His ears.

772
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,791
His feet.

773
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:18,338
There she is when she says "I love you"
in 2003.

774
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,549
There she is when she cries.

775
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,428
When she told me
an empty room still waiting.

776
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,514
Before it was his freedom.

777
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,684
Today is the opposite.

778
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,804
- One more.
- Damn!

779
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:08,930
Go.

780
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,021
That's it.

781
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,318
This is for you.

782
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,820
It symbolizes gay pride.

783
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,239
- Everyone knows that.
- Oh no!

784
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,740
If everyone.

785
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:29,242
Do not be silly.

786
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,787
Everybody knows
the symbol of Gay Pride.

787
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,123
- Do you really think?
- Yes.

788
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,880
You, you know?

789
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,717
For me?

790
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,684
I thought you and Mom
were not in love.

791
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,894
We loved each other!

792
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,604
But you were gay.

793
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:02,483
- I struggled not to be.
- During 44 years?

794
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,612
I knew I was gay.

795
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,116
In the evenings
I watched the husbands, not women.

796
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,371
And sexually?

797
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:18,458
She has never seen
as a great lover.

798
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,128
But we got by.

799
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:25,923
I loved this life.

800
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,093
The museum, our house ...

801
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,179
This is what I wanted.

802
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,973
And mom?
You wanted it too?

803
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,808
Yes! Stop it.

804
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,068
It was she who asked me to marry him.

805
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,489
I replied:

806
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:54,869
"I love you, we're friends
but you know what I am. "

807
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,329
And she said:

808
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,626
"It does not matter.

809
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,212
"I will heal it."

810
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,718
I thought:

811
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,262
"My God ...

812
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,684
"I'm ready to try anything."

813
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,274
Sex.

814
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,776
Of life.

815
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,069
Healing.

816
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:29,404
The sun.

817
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,655
Nature.

818
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:31,697
The magic.

819
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,949
The serenity.

820
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,200
The mind.

821
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:40,206
The first gay flag was designed
by Gilbert Baker in 1978.

822
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,208
Each color meaning.

823
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:43,960
This man was president.

824
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,253
We invented it.

825
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:46,838
Movies, was it.

826
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:48,256
The animals.

827
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:53,761
November 27, 1978
Harvey Milk was assassinated.

828
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:58,599
The following week, my father opened
its Christmas exhibition.

829
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:03,020
He had collected
stuffed animals in the neighborhood.

830
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,984
My dad posted up
a quote from the "Velvet Rabbit".

831
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:12,071
The stuffed bunny asked:
"What is true?"

832
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:15,366
Then the rabbit said:
"It hurts?"

833
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,494
The horse answered:
"Sometimes."

834
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,247
"It happens all of a sudden?"

835
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,458
"It takes a long time.

836
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:27,712
"In general, when you become a true
your hair has been torn,

837
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,673
"You lost your eyes
and you're disconnected.

838
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,384
"It does not matter

839
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,094
"Because you have become true.

840
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:38,931
"You are ugly in the eyes of those
who do not understand. "

841
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,939
Andy moves.

842
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:50,693
This is reasonable?

843
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,448
Act as if you were happy.

844
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,037
THE SADS

845
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:04,415
FIRST COUPLE IN LOVE TOO
To be sad

846
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,012
The idea
The story of sadness.

847
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:20,598
It could make your ...

848
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,895
It will take a big case.

849
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:31,108
"There are 4 billion years
Earth was formed. "

850
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:34,570
The idea is that sadness
does not exist yet, but ...

851
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,073
Sorry.

852
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,659
Sorry too.

853
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,621
It went well.

854
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,416
When is the wedding?

855
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:57,176
Come on, Arthur.

856
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,728
The living room.

857
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,778
The dining room.

858
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,199
There are boxes everywhere.

859
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,576
Here are my parents.

860
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:24,328
My mother ...
Hal, Georgia, this is Anna.

861
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:26,706
Anna, Hal and Georgia.

862
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,628
- Stairs.
- Really?

863
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:34,005
They ride.

864
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,927
I made room for you.

865
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,481
I bring your suitcase.

866
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,179
You?

867
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,651
I was not sleeping,
I did not bother you.

868
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,071
I ...

869
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,033
I was nervous

870
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,495
and all excited.

871
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,874
I thought that perhaps

872
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,044
I'm not as clueless as that.

873
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,759
Why are you crying yesterday?

874
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:34,727
You?

875
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,889
You really seem unhappy.

876
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,394
And you're happy

877
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,688
here?

878
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:28,072
I'm not very good at that.

879
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,327
I do not know what I do.

880
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,414
But I want to be there.

881
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,288
I do not know, Anna.

882
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:21,417
I should not feel that way.

883
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,890
I then returned to New York.

884
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,791
Hal,

885
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:06,128
it is not worth
to come for treatment.

886
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,464
Something wrong?

887
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,050
Better to stay home.

888
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,219
Palliative care is most useful.

889
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,431
New treatments
lead ...

890
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,643
more pain.

891
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,729
I understand.

892
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,316
I wish I could do more.

893
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:31,904
You have been remarkable, Dr. Long.

894
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,158
And thank you

895
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,954
for coming to the party.

896
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,818
You would always hold my hand
when you were little.

897
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:15,614
I could not.
I was afraid it may seem odd.

898
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,994
I wanted to be affectionate.

899
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,746
Certainly my father

900
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:25,165
had never shown any affection.

901
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,461
As long as I was not like that ...

902
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:32,840
I barely remember you.

903
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,593
I was at work.

904
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:45,436
One can feel
the emotion of the artist

905
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:47,229
when it is gifted.

906
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,565
And his every move.

907
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,777
It's like an entity

908
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,487
independent ...

909
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,197
I mean ...

910
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:58,949
We go home.

911
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,952
... in the broadest sense.

912
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:07,374
And your father?
So what would he do without us?

913
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,501
Georgia, you're going?

914
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:11,003
Yes, Mary.

915
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,839
An emergency.
Oliver made a peritonitis.

916
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:16,216
My God!

917
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,845
He is a child not demonstrative.

918
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,060
You show leadership,
I drive.

919
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,026
On the left, or worse!

920
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,615
Then?

921
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:45,537
Left again.
You turn around, I like it.

922
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:32,042
We knew it would not work,
before the meeting.

923
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,092
It's me, leave a message.

924
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,553
Anna?

925
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:46,890
Where are you?

926
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:04,032
Well, that's it.

927
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,660
Arthur ...

928
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,455
You're going to watch Elliot.

929
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:12,416
I return in a few days.

930
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:15,335
Good luck!

931
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:53,749
He remembers me.

932
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:30,554
Hi!

933
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:34,891
Listen,

934
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,269
I am awfully sorry

935
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,604
I stand before your door,
in New York.

936
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,993
I am in Los Angeles.

937
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:00,042
You're in L.A.?

938
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,669
You had to go here!

939
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:06,840
I'm not.

940
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,885
Shit, I'm in your building!

941
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,643
Well, you see the window

942
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:20,896
near the radiator?

943
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:24,107
The key is hidden behind.

944
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:37,829
OK, I'm inside.

945
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,127
It's empty here.

946
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:46,797
No!

947
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:50,425
That's my kitchen.

948
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,803
This is where I eat.

949
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,014
My bathroom.

950
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,558
Very luxurious.

951
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,145
Through the window

952
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,815
we see the roof of the neighbors.

953
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,653
Basically, this is my room.

954
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,865
This is my closet.

955
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:17,411
My clothes.

956
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:19,454
My photos.

957
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,797
Why did you leave everyone?

958
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,592
Why you left me leave?

959
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,309
Perhaps because

960
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:43,854
I do not really
it will work.

961
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,065
So I do all
that it does not work.

962
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,197
Juan's hair is great.

963
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:56,575
Thank you.

964
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,286
I use a foam great.

965
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,372
- It's amazing.
- You want to try?

966
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,666
A little bit?

967
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:08,128
- I think not ...
- Come on, just a little!

968
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:09,921
To laugh.

969
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:13,675
How you doing?

970
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,802
I show you.

971
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,996
- That's it.
- That's it?

972
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:44,873
It suits me?

973
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,333
Super.

974
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:53,924
It suits you very well.

975
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,419
Oliver.

976
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:34,089
He died.

977
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:06,246
Less than one hour
after being called,

978
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:09,749
two men arrive
to place the body in a bag.

979
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:14,212
They charge $ 1,485 for a cremation

980
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,631
and make the ashes in a box

981
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:19,467
the size
a jar of peanut butter.

982
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,053
It will require a death certificate.

983
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:25,807
It will send
to cancel credit cards,

984
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,018
telephone, utilities,

985
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:31,771
subscription to the gym,
all insurance, loans,

986
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,523
and to inform taxes.

987
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,985
You will follow
all mail to your address.

988
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:39,446
You write the obituary.

989
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,741
The newspaper with a photo pass
$ 2 for the word.

990
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:45,535
You'll wonder
if it is just.

991
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,787
You throw a lot.

992
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:50,373
You will keep a lot of things.

993
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,627
The picture that my mother
had in his room.

994
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,881
Kid, I thought it was my arm
offering daisies.

995
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:02,135
Today I imagine
it is she who offers me the

996
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:06,056
saying:
"This is happiness and simplicity.

997
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:08,308
"That's what I wanted to give you."

998
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:18,693
Arthur!

999
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,700
Thank you.

1000
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:33,792
You're welcome.

1001
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,586
Come!

1002
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:40,674
That's because I'm gay.

1003
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:42,676
Is that it?

1004
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:44,761
What?

1005
01:34:45,554 --> 01:34:47,972
You're never happened to me.

1006
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:51,893
No.

1007
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:58,441
This is because my father
love you much.

1008
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:27,053
Arthur!

1009
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:35,311
Are you okay?

1010
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,077
Between.

1011
01:35:56,959 --> 01:35:58,209
The lounge ...

1012
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:01,129
The dining room.

1013
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:13,975
Crazy picture!

1014
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:17,479
I can read?

1015
01:36:20,065 --> 01:36:21,941
"I am looking for a sex plan
