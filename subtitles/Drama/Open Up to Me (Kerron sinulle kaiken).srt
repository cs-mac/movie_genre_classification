1
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,484
Think she'll get over thisaway?

2
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,865
Might.

3
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,034
Best bed them down.

4
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,133
Come on, Tig.

5
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:55,260
There she goes.

6
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:02,393
Looks like we're in for it.

7
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:22,663
You see them?

8
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,337
Can't see them.
Can't hear them.

9
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,839
You ever seen one this bad?

10
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:34,426
Not since Noah and the flood.

11
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:39,222
Well, you should know, Boss,
since you was there.

12
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,350
What did you say?

13
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:45,354
He said, "You should know
since you was there."

14
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:53,820
Well, even that
wasn't this damn wet.

15
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:55,322
One thing's certain.

16
00:03:55,405 --> 00:04:00,410
Noah never shoveled as much bull
from them he had aboard.

17
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,413
Let's rustle up some grub.

18
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,457
Mose?

19
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,042
Hey!

20
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,213
- That hurt?
- Yeah.

21
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,299
Mose, still got them cards?

22
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:15,384
Yeah, I got them.

23
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:18,845
Get them out, and let's have us
a game after breakfast.

24
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:32,819
Button!

25
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,406
Pull them plates under here.

26
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:43,663
You gonna play them cards, Mose,
or stare a hole through them?

27
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,873
Don't rush me.

28
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,504
I'll take four.

29
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,632
Oh, for pity's sakes.
"Take four."

30
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,476
All right, that's it.

31
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:05,811
I'm out.

32
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,856
Me too.

33
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,156
A man's trust
is a valuable thing, Button.

34
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,284
You don't want to lose it
for a handful of cards.

35
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,845
Well, at least it ain't raining.

36
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,017
Get yourself dressed, Button.
Help Mose get things cleaned up.

37
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:29,689
Then you walk out
and look for them horses.

38
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,955
Looks like you could use
a little muscle there, Charley.

39
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:53,254
You just keep on like you are.

40
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:56,507
You'll get your chance
soon enough.

41
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,266
No need to ask
for more chores, Mose.

42
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,475
Every man's got to pull
his weight.

43
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,688
Yeah, but my weight
is half of yours.

44
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,903
You know, it's hard to figure
Charley sometimes.

45
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:19,323
I ain't even sure
if he likes me.

46
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,407
He likes you.

47
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:27,956
You know, Boss had some pause
about hiring me on.

48
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:32,044
Too big to get around on horses
and work them cows.

49
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:34,838
Afraid I'd eat too much.

50
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,798
It was Charley
that talked him into it,

51
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:39,301
and I ain't one to take
a man's confidence lightly.

52
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:40,594
You know I ain't, either.

53
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:43,514
I know you ain't, but it's best
to keep remembering it

54
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,099
if you want respect

55
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,269
when you're riding with men
like Charley and Boss.

56
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,803
Button, pull.

57
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,222
Pull it.

58
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,473
Button!

59
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:26,809
Button!

60
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,478
Quit playing with that dog
and pull the wagon!

61
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,402
Pull it!

62
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,161
- Pull!
- Oh, yeah!

63
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:48,914
Yeah.
That's it.

64
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,468
Hey, hey!
Look at that!

65
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,837
Old Boss sure can cowboy,
can't he?

66
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,423
Yeah.

67
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,801
Broke the mold after him.

68
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:57,026
Main bunch is working
towards water.

69
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,860
We'll go up-country,
find the rest,

70
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,695
and we'll push them there.

71
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:04,951
Look at that.

72
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:09,538
A couple of damn kids.

73
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:10,915
Anyway, once we get them,

74
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:13,960
we can start driving them back
closer to camp.

75
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,504
It'll be a while
before we see another town.

76
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:19,256
Could use supplies,
coffee and such.

77
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:21,509
Mose!

78
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,135
Ow!

79
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:24,637
Mose!

80
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:32,395
You'll have to ride back
to that town we passed.

81
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:34,230
When you want me to go?

82
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,149
Tonight.

83
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:38,193
I'll go.

84
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:39,444
I can go.

85
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,197
How long you figure, Charley?

86
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,534
Without cows slowing things,
maybe one day there, one back.

87
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:47,159
Sounds about right.

88
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:48,452
Come on, Boss.

89
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:49,663
I can do it.

90
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,290
Sure you can, boy.

91
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,915
Just don't know
if that town's ready

92
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,128
to have you
turned loose on it just yet.

93
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,755
English!

94
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,465
Damn! Shit!

95
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,175
Bullshit!

96
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:18,587
By God, if you're gonna pick
your feet like a monkey,

97
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,839
you do it downwind.

98
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,096
Swear to God, old Tig
takes better care of herself.

99
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,765
Starting to think
it was a mistake

100
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:32,059
not getting you on in some town
to learn a trade.

101
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,604
I don't like towns.
Never liked them.

102
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:37,315
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.

103
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,358
Get yourself a trade
and set up in a town.

104
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,318
You'll always have
a roof over your head,

105
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:42,487
a bed up off the ground,

106
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,572
and food no further away
than a café.

107
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:48,368
Ain't that so, Charley?

108
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,706
That was a big help.

109
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,958
Might as well be talking
to this horse.

110
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,753
Put your boot on, Button.
Let's go to work.

111
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:04,467
Course, if you was to live
in a town..

112
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,845
You'd have to clean up some.

113
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,433
Otherwise, no one
could stand the stink.

114
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,987
What you do that for?!

115
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,621
Cheating at cards.

116
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,129
Cheating.

117
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,380
I apologized to you for that!

118
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:46,385
Eh, Boss?
I apologized to him for that.

119
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:49,096
Evidently he ain't over it yet.

120
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:11,160
It's getting dark, Boss.

121
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:14,747
He could have got hurt
between that town and the camp.

122
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,208
Probably just taking his time.

123
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:20,086
Don't suppose he got into
a poker game, do you?

124
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,381
Wouldn't gamble
your money, Boss.

125
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:27,094
What if he's lying out there
waiting for us to come along?

126
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:30,889
We'd never find him tonight.
Now, come on down from there.

127
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,723
He's worried.

128
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,977
- You worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

129
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,773
Been worried since yesterday.
Should have sent me.

130
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:40,941
Mose can look out for himself.

131
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:43,026
Then why ain't he here with us?

132
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,947
Well, you never was
wanting to go to towns.

133
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:48,365
Well, I don't want to go now
neither.

134
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:51,286
But we better find him,
wherever he is.

135
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,999
All right.

136
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:59,294
You and me strike out early.
Button can watch the outfit.

137
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:03,631
Button, come on down from there
and get supper a-working.

138
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:17,061
Most likely be back
before suppertime.

139
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,063
But three sets of eyes,
it's better than two.

140
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:22,191
- You stay with the wagon.
- Come on, Boss.

141
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:23,526
No one is gonna bother it.

142
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,696
We haven't seen a single person
since we set up the camp.

143
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,866
I always feel better
if someone's close around.

144
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,828
You been working hard,
deserve a little loafing time.

145
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,788
Stay right here.

146
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,294
Stay, Tig.

147
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:41,462
Wants to go.

148
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:44,130
She acts like she does,
but she don't.

149
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:47,885
Still got the heart,
not the legs.

150
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,639
You keep that rifle close.

151
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:06,173
Always liked me a sidearm
with some heft.

152
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:10,010
Took this off a man who couldn't
pay all he owed for some cows.

153
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,886
Damn fine weapon.

154
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:16,434
Always noticed you favor
something light, don't you?

155
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:41,709
Set it right down.
Thank you.

156
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,262
Hello!

157
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:41,061
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

158
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:44,106
Like to feed and water them,
curry them down with saddles on.

159
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,277
Okay, that'll be four bits each.

160
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:49,779
- There you go.
- Thank you.

161
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,240
Not planning on staying long?

162
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:54,534
Long as it takes to find
who we're looking for.

163
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,703
Maybe I can help you gents.

164
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:59,122
I been here since Harmonville
was Fort Harmon

165
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,333
and we still had soldiers
to chase off Indians.

166
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:05,044
I know everybody in town
and for miles beyond.

167
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:09,132
Big man needing a haircut,
about 30.

168
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,467
That's his rig right there.

169
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:18,808
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.

170
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:20,518
Very friendly young fella.

171
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:23,480
Looks like he's been living out
of saddlebags most of his life.

172
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,523
Got his horse in the corral.

173
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:27,026
Ride with you, does he?

174
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,861
Know where we can find him?

175
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:30,362
Yeah.

176
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,156
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.

177
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:35,326
He got into it
with some cattlemen

178
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:36,702
over at the general store.

179
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,454
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.

180
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:40,164
Busted them up pretty bad, too,

181
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,124
before Marshal Poole came up

182
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,335
and hit him over the head
with his gun barrel.

183
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:47,838
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.

184
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,923
You might want to keep that
in mind

185
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,051
when you're talking
to Marshal Poole.

186
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,927
Saddle his horse.

187
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:55,304
That cover what he owes?

188
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:56,556
Oh, yeah.

189
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:59,559
Name's Percy if you should need
anything else.

190
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,060
Much obliged.

191
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,686
Hold on.

192
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,950
How long you had him here?

193
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:18,036
I brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.

194
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,538
It wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.

195
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,706
Why is that?

196
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:24,459
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.

197
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:30,590
Evening.
Name's Boss Spearman.

198
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:32,677
This here's Charley Waite.

199
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,387
Evening.

200
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,513
Believe you have
a friend of ours.

201
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:39,766
Name's Mose Harrison.

202
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,810
Yeah, I got him here.

203
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:45,898
He started a fight
in the general store.

204
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:49,819
Mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.

205
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:53,281
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.

206
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:54,782
Maybe you're calling me a liar.

207
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:56,659
You got a charge against him?

208
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,494
I got plenty.

209
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:01,621
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.

210
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:04,501
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.

211
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,460
Hear tell he got hit
over the head.

212
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:10,756
He'll be fine.

213
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,467
Well, I come to get him.

214
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:18,307
Well, you pay the fines,
and you can have him.

215
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:23,312
How does $50 each offense sound?

216
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:25,314
Like robbery.

217
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:29,859
Lot of money.

218
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:32,613
Oh, yes, a lot of money.

219
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,032
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.

220
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:38,785
My name's Denton Baxter.

221
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,704
Be your men Mose tussled with.

222
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,456
That's right.

223
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,167
You know, folks
in Fort Harmon country

224
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,879
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.

225
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:52,049
They hate them more than they
used to hate the Indians.

226
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:56,137
I expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.

227
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,141
I got the biggest spread around.

228
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:02,310
Bigger than any three or four
put together.

229
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,479
Built it up with me own
two hands,

230
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,356
piece by piece,

231
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:08,732
along with this town.

232
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:10,485
And there ain't no
free-graze cattle

233
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,278
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.

234
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:14,989
Free graze is legal.

235
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,283
Times change, Mr. Spearman.

236
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:21,371
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts never do.

237
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,707
You know, a few years back,

238
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,502
a free-graze outfit
came through.

239
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:30,630
One night,
the cattle got stampeded,

240
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:33,925
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys

241
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:36,886
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.

242
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,306
Shot in the back, was he?

243
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,606
Your man's horse and rig
are at the livery barn.

244
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:50,192
You can take him with you
when you leave tonight.

245
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:52,820
And come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon

246
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:54,989
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moving

247
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:58,741
and keep them moving till you're
out of Fort Harmon country!

248
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,663
Now, you let Mr. Spearman
fetch his man

249
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:05,165
so he can be on his way.

250
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:26,562
Charley.

251
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,860
- Mose.

252
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,405
Mose.

253
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:42,370
Looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.

254
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,787
Does it?

255
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,296
Mose, you gotta get up.

256
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:55,634
Charley, I'm glad to see you.

257
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,970
I don't much like this town.

258
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,601
Here you go.

259
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:07,647
Boy, they really lit into him.

260
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:09,147
You got a doctor in this town?

261
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,233
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.

262
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,778
It's the house up behind
the barn by the church.

263
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,529
Look for a picket fence.

264
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:18,115
He's got a sign out front.

265
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,953
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.

266
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,211
Lay him down in there.

267
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,556
I'll fetch the doctor.

268
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,142
Get his legs, Boss.

269
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:47,019
Easy, easy.

270
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,398
Good.

271
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:58,865
I'm Dr. Barlow.

272
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:00,783
Boss Spearman.

273
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:03,120
Charley Waite.

274
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,871
Patient there's Mose Harrison.

275
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:06,498
He works for me.

276
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:08,041
These wounds are old.

277
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,085
Easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.

278
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:13,421
Your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.

279
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:16,174
This is the man who was in the
fight with Dent Baxter's men?

280
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:19,011
He certainly gave
as good as he got.

281
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:21,179
Broke the arm of one.

282
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:24,183
Knowing them,
they had it coming, I expect.

283
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:26,727
Let's see what we got here.

284
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,186
- Aah!
- Easy.

285
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,439
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.

286
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:32,441
Nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.

287
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,527
I'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.

288
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,530
Gonna need to get
this shirt off.

289
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:50,793
Sue, I am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.

290
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,511
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.

291
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:02,972
- That's it.

292
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:08,062
Let's clean up these cuts
on his face.

293
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:11,481
He's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.

294
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:12,816
I'd say to good health,

295
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:14,818
but then I'd probably be out
of business.

296
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:19,614
We'll drink to good health
for them that have it coming.

297
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,162
The two of you
can wait in the parlor.

298
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,094
Be better he didn't travel.

299
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:42,721
Well, he'll have to.

300
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,933
How much I owe you, Doctor?

301
00:26:45,975 --> 00:26:46,976
We're even.

302
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,104
I figured I made enough off the
damage he did to Baxter's men.

303
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:52,648
Wish he'd have made you wealthy.

304
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:55,317
Ma'am.

305
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:26,182
Doc Barlow's got him
a pretty wife.

306
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,184
Notice that, did you?

307
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,978
Well, I ain't dead.

308
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:31,604
Glad to hear it.

309
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:32,815
Sweet, too.

310
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:36,234
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.

311
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,112
A woman like that makes a man

312
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:42,033
think about
setting down roots, eh?

313
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,578
Doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.

314
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,165
Probably working away on making
some little ones, too.

315
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:51,291
Creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?

316
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,501
Yeah.

317
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,170
Heard they're worth
a thousand words.

318
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,903
Hey, Tig.

319
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,666
Now, where do you suppose he is?

320
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,434
Goddamn kid.

321
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:53,605
Button's all right, Boss.

322
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,070
Anyone done him harm, they'd
have gone through the wagon.

323
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:03,073
Reckon you're right.

324
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,954
Here he is.

325
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,916
If you're awake,
you might want to see this.

326
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,001
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.

327
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,087
Out with the herd.

328
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,548
I thought I told you
to stay with the wagon.

329
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,717
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!

330
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,969
Yeah, but what happened?

331
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:26,431
Run into a little trouble
in that town.

332
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:29,392
Looks like more than a little.

333
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,227
Are we moving on?

334
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,897
We always do, don't we,
once we've grazed off a place?

335
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,949
Did I do something wrong?

336
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,036
Just leave him be for a while.

337
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,454
Here.
Have some coffee.

338
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,706
Made fresh, for a change.

339
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,168
There was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.

340
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,461
Where?

341
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,422
Maybe half a mile out.

342
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,341
Just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.

343
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,686
Same ones?

344
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,106
Four this time.

345
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,983
Country's filling up.

346
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,110
Maybe we should push on.

347
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,820
Do no good, Button.

348
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,448
I seen them like Baxter before.

349
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,076
He means to have this herd
or scatter it to the wind.

350
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,994
If he was gonna take the herd,

351
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,038
why not just keep you in town?

352
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,500
Marshal already had Mose.

353
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,378
Wants us all in one place.

354
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,672
Far from there when it happens.

355
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,384
Don't make no sense, him telling
us to move on and all.

356
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,178
Weren't the only thing he said.

357
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,681
Most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions

358
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,643
if you listen,
let yourself hear.

359
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:55,814
A few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.

360
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,692
That weren't no idle story.

361
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,777
Let's find out for certain.

362
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,959
Beautiful country.

363
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,754
A man can get lost out here,

364
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:03,799
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.

365
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:08,347
How long we been
riding together, Charley?

366
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:11,350
Nigh on 10 years.

367
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,559
Mm-hmm.

368
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:17,022
You know what they call that,
call it a decade.

369
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,358
Long time.

370
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,110
Been a lot of change since then.

371
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,947
What's on your mind, Boss?

372
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:29,868
Way I figure it, we can leave
the cattle and run,

373
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,372
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them

374
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:34,790
before they scatter the herd.

375
00:32:38,627 --> 00:32:42,881
You reckon them cows are worth
getting killed over?

376
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:44,341
The cows is one thing.

377
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:45,926
But one man telling another

378
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,680
where he can go in this
country's something else.

379
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:51,682
That rancher sat
in that jailhouse,

380
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:54,142
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law

381
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,688
till he figured
it was time to show us

382
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:59,065
that he gave the orders
around here.

383
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:02,485
Ooh, sticks in my craw.

384
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:09,826
Well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to Mose.

385
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,160
Yeah.

386
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,958
I'll saddle the horses.

387
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,506
You two keep a sharp eye out.

388
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:28,053
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.

389
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:30,431
You'll want to douse that fire.

390
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:31,848
Button, keep to the wagon.

391
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,100
I don't want to see you
out in the open.

392
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,685
Okay?

393
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:43,026
I got some sugar in that town.

394
00:33:44,778 --> 00:33:46,697
It's in the wagon.

395
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,758
I wouldn't want to have him
coming down on me

396
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:07,551
like these cowboys.

397
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:09,596
What the hell's the matter
with you, Gus?

398
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:12,599
You're twitching all damn night.

399
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:17,479
Damn back's so sore from being
flung into that stove.

400
00:34:18,562 --> 00:34:22,400
Feel like I been humped
by a 300-pound whore.

401
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,778
Well, Gus, I'd say
you got off easy.

402
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:27,822
Look at my face.

403
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:33,745
Well, you can bet Butler will
square things with that big man

404
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:36,581
for breaking his arm and all.

405
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,917
Did you hear it snap?

406
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,878
I heard it snap.

407
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:44,255
Lucky for him he shoots
with either hand.

408
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:48,927
One twitch, and you're in hell!

409
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,597
Now, get on your feet,
all of you!

410
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:56,434
Now, throw them guns
on the ground.

411
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:03,067
I ain't a-gonna say it again.

412
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:10,741
And kick them away.

413
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,544
Which one of you's got
a sore back?

414
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,922
Which one?

415
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,966
Him.

416
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:30,053
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.

417
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:32,138
Ought not gang up on a man
three-to-one.

418
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,139
Ohh!

419
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:34,808
Wait a minute, mister.

420
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:37,644
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.

421
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:39,729
Get up, you son of a bitch.

422
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:43,066
- What's your name?
- Vince.

423
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,695
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?

424
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,405
- You fast?
- No.

425
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:49,990
Uh-huh.

426
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:53,201
How many riders does he have?

427
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,204
I said, how many riders?

428
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,123
The rest are on their way
to your wagon.

429
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:04,212
Uhh! Aah!

430
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:06,923
You want to smile now, go ahead.

431
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,052
Be a while before he's of use.

432
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:12,764
Charley, throw me
them saddlebags.

433
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:22,022
Put your spook hats on.

434
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:26,485
The ones in your belt,
put them on.

435
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,700
Now get your britches off.

436
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,955
Not taking my britches off
for nobody.

437
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:41,876
You listen out
of your good ear now.

438
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,419
Now, get them off!

439
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:52,512
Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?

440
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,726
Get belly-down, flat-out!

441
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:00,311
Uhh!

442
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:02,398
Get your peckers in the dirt.

443
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,692
- Hyah! Hah!

444
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:05,942
Hah!

445
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:10,488
If I hear so much
as a twig break..

446
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:13,492
I'll come back
and kill you all.

447
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,998
Charley.

448
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:21,750
Charley!

449
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:57,162
No Tig come to meet us.

450
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:17,474
Ooh.
The bastards.

451
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:21,311
They shot the boy,
but he's alive.

452
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:24,189
Is that Mose?

453
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,655
He's dead.

454
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:34,784
Shot him in the head.

455
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,541
Charley?

456
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:49,215
Charley?

457
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:55,554
Charley, get the lantern
and the whiskey.

458
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:04,021
Yeah.

459
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:06,692
Come on, wake up.

460
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,026
Charley.

461
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:13,531
They shot him here and
cracked him in the head here.

462
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:15,867
We'll have to dig
that bullet out.

463
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,959
You done good, Boss.

464
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:30,507
Him going in and out like that.

465
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,094
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.

466
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:36,888
A whack on the head
can make a man strange

467
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:39,850
for the rest of his days.

468
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:42,811
Well, you done all you can.

469
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:45,480
He needs a doctor now.

470
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:48,735
If Button lives through morning,

471
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:51,111
you take him in the wagon
and move on.

472
00:39:53,238 --> 00:39:56,200
You just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?

473
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:58,077
That's right.

474
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:01,914
And I'm gonna kill
every son of a bitch

475
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:04,291
that comes to take them.

476
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:07,211
For one man on open ground,

477
00:40:07,295 --> 00:40:09,839
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.

478
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:25,981
You know I never
gone against you, Boss.

479
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:29,902
Always let you do
most of the talking.

480
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:32,321
But he needs that doctor
back in that town,

481
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:34,864
and I aim to take him.

482
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:36,949
If you want to come,
we'll go together.

483
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:42,122
Otherwise, you do what you
have to do, I'll do the same.

484
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,209
You think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?

485
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,669
I don't figure into it.

486
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,421
Button deserves every chance
we can give him.

487
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,260
All right.

488
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:02,643
But I aim to kill Baxter
and those that done this.

489
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:05,729
And if that marshal gets in the
way, I'm gonna kill him, too.

490
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:09,483
So you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.

491
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,654
I got no problem
with killing, Boss.

492
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,239
Never have.

493
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:17,677
Looks real nice, Charley.

494
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,141
Yeah, a man ought to have
something to show he was here.

495
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:26,520
Be gone in another big storm.

496
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:29,148
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.

497
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:32,985
He'd like it you put
old Tig with him.

498
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:35,404
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end

499
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:37,448
than he was mine.

500
00:42:39,116 --> 00:42:42,578
Be right to say some words.

501
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:45,248
You want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.

502
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:47,417
I'll stand right here
and listen,

503
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,253
but I ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.

504
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:51,713
And I'll be holding a grudge

505
00:42:51,796 --> 00:42:56,801
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like Mose.

506
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:05,769
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.

507
00:43:07,145 --> 00:43:09,272
Woke with a smile.

508
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:11,942
Seemed like he could keep it
there all day.

509
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:15,821
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,

510
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,823
whether it was or not.

511
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:22,619
To tell you the truth, Lord,
if there was two gentler souls,

512
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:24,454
I never seen them.

513
00:43:25,622 --> 00:43:29,127
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't
even kill birds in the end.

514
00:43:30,837 --> 00:43:33,672
Well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,

515
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:35,341
and I'm inclined to agree
with Boss

516
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:37,844
about holding a grudge
against you for it.

517
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,472
I guess that means "amen."

518
00:44:04,997 --> 00:44:06,914
God.

519
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,916
Charley, you all right?

520
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:16,008
I'm fine.

521
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:19,053
Seems like you was, you know..

522
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:21,013
I said I'm fine.

523
00:44:23,057 --> 00:44:25,934
Just got some old feelings
coming up.

524
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:29,938
You know, we never asked
each other much.

525
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:33,901
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.

526
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:37,112
But you said some things
the last couple of days.

527
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:42,201
Things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.

528
00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:46,455
Hey, Charley?

529
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:48,957
Don't stand behind me, Boss.

530
00:45:12,941 --> 00:45:16,695
When I was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods

531
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:18,738
with our peashooters.

532
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,492
Nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,

533
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:25,578
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.

534
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:30,418
Killed my first man
in them woods.

535
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,006
Held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,

536
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:38,926
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.

537
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:44,014
Weren't much older than Button
when I shot him in the throat.

538
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:49,645
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.

539
00:45:49,729 --> 00:45:52,188
War was on.

540
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:54,774
They was only too happy
to have me.

541
00:45:56,527 --> 00:45:59,613
My first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.

542
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:03,951
We just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.

543
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:09,915
Must have been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.

544
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,626
Went around and shot the rest
who weren't.

545
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:17,341
Those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad

546
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,885
so we could travel light
and on our own

547
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:22,011
into enemy territory.

548
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:27,725
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble wherever we could.

549
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:31,896
With room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men

550
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,316
that weren't even in uniform.

551
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,362
Seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.

552
00:46:39,821 --> 00:46:42,449
After that, I come West.

553
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:47,079
Lot of call for a man
with them skills.

554
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:50,666
And I put them to work
for men just like Baxter.

555
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,758
Every once in a while,
I almost get through a day

556
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,471
without thinking
about who I am, what I'd done.

557
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,274
He drifted off again.

558
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:18,903
No better, but no worse, either.

559
00:47:18,987 --> 00:47:21,990
You're a real honest man,
Charley.

560
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:24,117
Well, I ain't gonna lie
about Button.

561
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,661
Not Button I'm talking about.

562
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:56,025
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?

563
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:57,568
No, he's not here.

564
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,112
We got a boy that's hurt bad.

565
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:03,114
Here, put him
in the examining room.

566
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:20,925
It's not his hearing, ma'am.

567
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:22,968
He hears real well
when he's awake.

568
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,180
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.

569
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:28,766
It could mean a fractured skull.

570
00:48:32,103 --> 00:48:33,937
Are you the boy's father?

571
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:35,315
No, ma'am.

572
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:37,984
His name's Button,
and he works for me.

573
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:41,988
It appears that's
not very healthy.

574
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,950
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.

575
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,619
I'll be a while.

576
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,644
Well, I don't think
it's a fracture.

577
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:16,023
Concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.

578
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:29,412
I have to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.

579
00:49:29,495 --> 00:49:33,040
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.

580
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:34,751
What about the fever?

581
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:38,838
He needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.

582
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:41,465
No offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way

583
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:45,761
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by Dr. Barlow.

584
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:47,097
Now, where's he at?

585
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:48,682
One of Dent Baxter's hands

586
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:50,766
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.

587
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:54,313
Some men there had an accident
night before last.

588
00:49:59,192 --> 00:50:02,362
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.

589
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:05,741
Baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,

590
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:08,660
and I figured me and Charley
to stop them.

591
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:11,955
Surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.

592
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:15,917
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's
putting back together.

593
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:20,255
We got back to camp, others
had shot Mose in the head,

594
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,466
shot Button, left him for dead.

595
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:23,509
Oh.

596
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,930
Shot our dog.

597
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:33,436
I'll be getting money.

598
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:36,104
It's not necessary.

599
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:38,191
We pay our way, ma'am.

600
00:50:43,738 --> 00:50:46,616
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.

601
00:50:50,078 --> 00:50:52,955
Button.
Is that his real name?

602
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,292
Please, sit.

603
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:01,714
Yeah, it's the only one
we've known.

604
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:06,095
He's just a boy.

605
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:08,805
Yeah.

606
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:11,725
Picked him up in a Texas town
a few years back,

607
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:14,269
living off café garbage.

608
00:51:14,311 --> 00:51:16,813
Couldn't speak a word
of English.

609
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:19,649
Thought we was doing him
a favor.

610
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:22,276
What about you?

611
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,112
Hmm?

612
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:26,447
You know that the marshal
works for Baxter.

613
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:29,034
People saw you ride in.

614
00:51:30,995 --> 00:51:32,997
There's payment to be made
by them that done this.

615
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,791
Don't intend to run.

616
00:51:38,669 --> 00:51:41,672
We could wire
for the federal marshal.

617
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:47,386
If he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.

618
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:50,472
With the storm coming,
maybe longer.

619
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:55,854
We're obliged to deal with the
marshal and Baxter ourselves.

620
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,938
What about Button?

621
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:03,069
Well, he's fighting
for his life.

622
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:04,403
We're gonna do the same.

623
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:15,749
Whatever's needed for Button,
you do it.

624
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,543
If he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days

625
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:21,087
so we can watch him.

626
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,590
Whatever's best for him.

627
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,440
Can't stay away from
my little paradise, gents?!

628
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:42,734
Believe Satan says the same at
the gates of hell, old-timer!

629
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,240
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.

630
00:52:48,323 --> 00:52:49,992
I'd like to set
the wagon yonder.

631
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:52,662
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!

632
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:55,330
I seen it like this before!

633
00:52:55,414 --> 00:52:57,458
Big one's coming!

634
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,835
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

635
00:54:03,692 --> 00:54:05,736
Son of a bitch.

636
00:54:13,327 --> 00:54:15,288
Sorry, Charley.

637
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:19,876
Yeah.

638
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:37,770
Jesus Christ.

639
00:54:41,939 --> 00:54:44,817
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

640
00:54:49,114 --> 00:54:52,492
Maybe you should have built it
in another spot.

641
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:55,829
Ah, mercy.

642
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:15,724
Get the dog!

643
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,726
Get the dog!

644
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:20,854
Get the dog!

645
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:25,150
It's a dog there, Charley.

646
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,705
Take this.

647
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:41,126
There he is.
Back here, Charley!

648
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,544
To your left!
To your left!

649
00:55:43,586 --> 00:55:45,213
Get him!
Get him!

650
00:55:52,762 --> 00:55:54,389
You all right, Charley?

651
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:58,310
Yeah, considering
I've just been swimming.

652
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,400
I owe you, mister.

653
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:08,237
That's a sweet pup
you got there.

654
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,282
Remind you of anyone, Charley?

655
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:13,199
Small version.

656
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,076
Too small to be let out
in this weather.

657
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:17,038
Belongs to my daughter.

658
00:56:17,121 --> 00:56:20,708
I tried to grab him, but
the water was too fast for me.

659
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,586
If you're going into the café,

660
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:26,672
I'd be proud to buy you both
a cup of coffee.

661
00:56:30,008 --> 00:56:32,470
Coffee would be good about now.

662
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:40,603
This is like the storm
that washed away Gunnison

663
00:56:40,686 --> 00:56:42,480
10, 12 years back.

664
00:56:42,563 --> 00:56:45,483
The water come down
from the mountains.

665
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:48,236
Nowhere to go
but straight into town.

666
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,446
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.

667
00:56:50,488 --> 00:56:53,157
Town's been here
a long time, Mack.

668
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,868
It'll be here a lot longer.

669
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,453
That's right, Papa.

670
00:56:56,535 --> 00:56:58,997
Every once in a while,
a good storm washes through

671
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,293
and leaves her as clean
as a baby's bottom.

672
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:05,879
Got to look
on the bright side, gents.

673
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,726
Marshal.

674
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,647
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.

675
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:27,317
That should cover our meal.

676
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,823
Worth a man's life to walk
across that road tonight.

677
00:57:31,905 --> 00:57:33,408
Thanks for the coffee.

678
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,909
Well, appreciate what you done.

679
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,789
That'll be two bits.

680
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:42,333
Two bits.

681
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,733
I'll be having words
with you two.

682
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,320
And we'll be having more
than that with you, Marshal.

683
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:25,336
No need to make
the café messy.. with folks.

684
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,712
I've got a warrant sworn out
for your arrest

685
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,506
for assaulting Baxter's men.

686
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,716
We got a warrant sworn
for attempted murder

687
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,260
for them that tried
to kill the boy

688
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,637
who's laying over there
at the doc's.

689
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:36,680
Swore out another one

690
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,975
for them that murdered the big
fellow you had in your cell.

691
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,810
Only ours ain't writ
by no tin star

692
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,646
bought and paid for, Marshal.

693
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:47,399
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.

694
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,151
Is that so?

695
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,446
We got no quarrel
with none of you folks.

696
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,075
Baxter's men bushwhacked
our friend and shot him dead.

697
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,328
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.

698
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,914
And clubbed him so hard..

699
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,958
He might not live.

700
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,796
Tried to take our cattle.

701
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,091
Your marshal here ain't gonna do
nothing about it.

702
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,720
You don't like free grazers
in this town.

703
00:59:15,804 --> 00:59:17,346
We don't much like being here.

704
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,683
But a man's got a right
to protect his property

705
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,267
and his life.

706
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:26,147
And we ain't letting no rancher
or his lawman take either.

707
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,193
We got no intention
of harming bystanders.

708
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:31,903
Anyone who helps or comforts

709
00:59:31,988 --> 00:59:35,073
these goddamn lawbreaking
free grazers

710
00:59:35,157 --> 00:59:37,826
is gonna have to deal with me.

711
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,800
Your call, Marshal.

712
00:59:57,345 --> 01:00:00,975
We don't have to settle this
here and now.

713
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:04,061
You ain't going nowhere
in this weather.

714
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:06,605
But I'll be seeing you gents
real soon.

715
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:08,733
You can count on that.

716
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:24,041
That marshal ain't gonna wait.

717
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:27,377
That son of a bitch is gonna get
some men, come looking for us.

718
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,754
He's gonna need us locked up
tight in that jail

719
01:00:29,837 --> 01:00:32,215
by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,

720
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,716
Baxter's gonna start to think

721
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,345
that maybe Marshal Poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.

722
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,974
You got something on your mind,
just spit it out.

723
01:00:41,057 --> 01:00:43,769
Well, I say we take him
right at the jail.

724
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,688
Lock him up, wait for Baxter
to come riding in.

725
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,524
Hell, Charley, why don't we
just ride out to Baxter's ranch

726
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:52,152
and go straight at him, too?

727
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:55,364
Well, I'll fight
wherever you want, Boss.

728
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,573
You just make the call.

729
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:58,241
God damn it.

730
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,118
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.

731
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:03,039
Well, you asked me.
I told you.

732
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,879
Charley, come on in
out of the rain, would you?

733
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:12,589
Come on.

734
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:18,178
Come on.

735
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:25,102
Just getting testy
in my old age.

736
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:26,812
Sounds like it's not
such a bad idea.

737
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:28,981
Just roll it around
is all I ask.

738
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,775
All right.

739
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:34,737
What'd you think of my speech
in there?

740
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:39,743
Liked it.

741
01:01:39,826 --> 01:01:42,913
Maybe I ought to run
for mayor.

742
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:45,331
Well, I believe officeholders
got to be living, Boss.

743
01:01:54,258 --> 01:01:56,217
Come to see about the boy.

744
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,929
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.

745
01:01:59,972 --> 01:02:02,515
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.

746
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,100
We don't want to mess
your house.

747
01:02:04,184 --> 01:02:05,894
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.

748
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:07,604
Come on in.

749
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,433
Thank you, ma'am.

750
01:02:45,185 --> 01:02:46,977
There you are.

751
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:04,037
I can't get my fingers in.

752
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,252
We can't get our big fat fingers
in these holes.

753
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,672
- Too many broke knuckles.

754
01:03:12,754 --> 01:03:14,464
Oh, let me get you
something bigger.

755
01:03:14,548 --> 01:03:17,843
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.

756
01:03:17,884 --> 01:03:22,681
It's just nice to be sitting
at a table set with fine china.

757
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,517
Those were my mother's.

758
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:26,976
They were the only things
of hers

759
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:29,688
that survived the trip
out here.

760
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,649
I don't know why
I bring them out.

761
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:34,275
I can't hold them, either.

762
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,821
Guess it just makes me
feel good.

763
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:39,448
I say what's
on my mind, good or bad.

764
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:40,866
I admire that.

765
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:43,411
Try living with it.

766
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,705
See that?

767
01:03:45,746 --> 01:03:47,248
No need for a wife or home.

768
01:03:47,331 --> 01:03:50,042
We're just like a..
an old married couple.

769
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,839
So, is it marriage
that scares you two

770
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:56,048
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd have him?

771
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,677
All rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.

772
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,387
How about I hold
your head underwater

773
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:03,639
for just a little while?

774
01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:16,027
I married once.

775
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,905
Never knowed that,
did you, Charley?

776
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,409
Had a wife and child.

777
01:04:22,451 --> 01:04:23,785
Sweet little spread, too.

778
01:04:23,869 --> 01:04:28,290
It was nothing fancy,
but we was young.

779
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:30,917
Loved each other.

780
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:33,254
Never had a cross word.

781
01:04:34,463 --> 01:04:36,006
They caught the typhus
and died.

782
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:40,260
And after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.

783
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,305
Believe I've changed
my mind on that

784
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:45,390
now that I'm getting on
in years.

785
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:55,068
If Button lives
and we survive Baxter,

786
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:58,863
I swear I aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in

787
01:04:58,946 --> 01:05:01,615
instead of the cold prairie.

788
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:11,668
Have yourself a last cup
of tea, Charley.

789
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:13,711
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.

790
01:05:13,795 --> 01:05:14,754
Of course.

791
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:16,381
I know the way.

792
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:21,303
Whew.

793
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:34,233
Been riding with him 10 years.

794
01:05:34,315 --> 01:05:36,609
Never said nothing
about being married.

795
01:05:45,411 --> 01:05:47,662
Where are you and Mr. Spearman
spending the night?

796
01:05:47,746 --> 01:05:48,747
Don't rightly know.

797
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:53,293
It.. depends on circumstances.

798
01:05:53,377 --> 01:05:55,754
You mean Marshal Poole?

799
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:58,299
We have a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.

800
01:05:58,382 --> 01:05:59,383
Couldn't do that, ma'am.

801
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:02,386
We'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and Baxter.

802
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,598
Besides, it's a small town.

803
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:09,352
Wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.

804
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:30,290
I'll take those.

805
01:06:31,248 --> 01:06:33,084
You know where they go?

806
01:06:33,168 --> 01:06:34,252
I saw.

807
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:36,046
Thank you.

808
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:40,967
Been raining like hell
ever since we got here.

809
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:44,554
Water washing right down
Main Street.

810
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:47,223
Charley saved a pup
from being washed away.

811
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:49,559
Looked a little like old Tig.

812
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:57,317
Now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.

813
01:06:58,777 --> 01:07:02,364
'Cause I got something
important to say.

814
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:07,119
I ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.

815
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,664
The world ain't
a perfect place, Button.

816
01:07:09,747 --> 01:07:12,583
But you got
unfinished business here.

817
01:07:13,959 --> 01:07:16,879
So you come back,
you hear me, now?

818
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,757
You come back.

819
01:07:27,057 --> 01:07:28,934
Kind of dumb talking to him
like that.

820
01:07:28,974 --> 01:07:30,017
No.

821
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:32,061
No, it's good.

822
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:35,606
You all right, Mr. Spearman?

823
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:39,026
Believe I'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.

824
01:07:39,111 --> 01:07:42,447
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.

825
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,410
I asked him to reconsider,
and I'm asking you.

826
01:07:46,493 --> 01:07:49,621
By "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?

827
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:52,666
I mean save your life and his.

828
01:07:52,707 --> 01:07:54,960
He'll listen to you.

829
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:57,379
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.

830
01:07:57,462 --> 01:08:00,632
He's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.

831
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:04,636
I'll be paying you now
for whatever else Button needs.

832
01:08:04,678 --> 01:08:06,430
In case it goes bad
for Charley and me,

833
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:10,559
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.

834
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:14,230
I'd like to put pen to paper
if you have them.

835
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,773
Yes. Of course.

836
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:13,581
Mr. Waite?

837
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,583
Look at my face.

838
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:18,962
- Oh! Sorry!

839
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,217
I'm sorry.

840
01:09:24,343 --> 01:09:25,844
It's all right, Charley.

841
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,055
Okay?
It just be us.

842
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:33,227
It's all right, Charley.

843
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,905
It's all right, Charley.

844
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:53,248
It's all right.
I'll get it.

845
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:20,066
Jumpy is all.

846
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,792
She ought not to sneak up
like that.

847
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,836
She weren't sneaking.

848
01:10:39,586 --> 01:10:41,630
I scared that woman
half to death.

849
01:10:41,672 --> 01:10:43,757
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.

850
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:47,553
Well, that's how it is, Boss.

851
01:10:47,635 --> 01:10:50,014
Ain't a pretty picture.

852
01:10:50,097 --> 01:10:52,308
Got your wits about you now?

853
01:10:53,476 --> 01:10:54,518
Yeah.

854
01:10:54,602 --> 01:10:55,519
Yeah.

855
01:10:55,603 --> 01:10:58,064
It weren't as bad as it looked.

856
01:10:58,147 --> 01:10:59,983
I'll bet.

857
01:11:11,078 --> 01:11:13,664
Go! Hyah!

858
01:11:39,147 --> 01:11:41,358
Two whiskeys, barkeep.

859
01:11:48,908 --> 01:11:52,203
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.

860
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:57,542
You see that sign?

861
01:11:57,582 --> 01:12:01,212
Around these parts,
free grazers is the first.

862
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:21,315
Now, he asked you twice.

863
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:23,568
Ain't gonna ask again.

864
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:29,157
Hey, Bill, it's all right.

865
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,242
These are the fellows
that saved my dog.

866
01:12:31,326 --> 01:12:34,579
I couldn't serve them
if they saved Jesus himself.

867
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:36,540
Mr. Baxter would have my job.

868
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:37,582
Baxter the owner?

869
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:39,000
That's right.

870
01:12:39,084 --> 01:12:40,918
Give me a bottle.
I'll serve them myself.

871
01:12:40,961 --> 01:12:42,462
You know I can't do that.

872
01:12:54,141 --> 01:12:56,435
Now we'll have our drinks.

873
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,496
Believe I'll have me another.

874
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,916
Yes.

875
01:13:24,463 --> 01:13:28,384
Well, looks like the rain's
let up a bit.

876
01:13:28,468 --> 01:13:29,302
Well, if it don't,

877
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:31,888
there'll be trout fishing
right on Main Street.

878
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:37,559
I'd like you to meet my boys.

879
01:13:37,644 --> 01:13:39,144
Ray and Cory.

880
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,585
We run a freight outfit
when the weather cooperates.

881
01:13:42,669 --> 01:13:43,712
Boss Spearman.

882
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:47,424
And the marksman here
is Charley Waite.

883
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:51,052
Is all that true,
what you said in the café?

884
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,303
Yeah.

885
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,096
There's a kid at the doc's house

886
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,516
put on death's doorstep
by Baxter.

887
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,809
Doc's wife's caring for him

888
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,811
until he comes back
after the storm.

889
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,020
Doc's wife?

890
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,813
Yeah.
Miss Barlow.

891
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:05,273
You mean Sue?

892
01:14:05,356 --> 01:14:06,734
That's right.

893
01:14:06,816 --> 01:14:09,193
Well, she'd make somebody
a fine wife.

894
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:12,529
But she ain't the doc's.

895
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,406
That's his sister.

896
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:15,824
His sister?

897
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,535
Ain't his wife.

898
01:14:21,455 --> 01:14:23,207
Good evening, Mack.

899
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:24,208
Ralph.

900
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:25,334
Ray, Cory.

901
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,210
Whiskey.

902
01:14:27,252 --> 01:14:29,462
This is Ralph Peterson.
He runs the general store.

903
01:14:29,546 --> 01:14:32,048
That's where I was
when the dog got free.

904
01:14:32,131 --> 01:14:35,093
You fellers the free grazers,
I expect.

905
01:14:42,934 --> 01:14:44,102
No offense.

906
01:14:44,184 --> 01:14:46,270
Personally, I don't stand
with others around here

907
01:14:46,353 --> 01:14:48,230
about free grazers.

908
01:14:48,313 --> 01:14:52,859
There was a fight in your store
about a week or so back.

909
01:14:52,942 --> 01:14:55,278
Some of Baxter's men
jumped our friend.

910
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,321
He was a big feller.

911
01:14:56,403 --> 01:14:58,239
Yeah.
I saw the whole thing.

912
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,659
That big feller drubbed the hell
out of them other three.

913
01:15:00,741 --> 01:15:03,119
Broke one's arm.

914
01:15:03,202 --> 01:15:05,621
Be a gunhand named Butler,
would it?

915
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:07,665
That's what they say.

916
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,836
Felt bad about your friend.
Is he all right?

917
01:15:13,545 --> 01:15:15,213
He's dead.

918
01:15:18,675 --> 01:15:20,009
That's too bad.

919
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:21,594
Seemed like
a nice young feller.

920
01:15:21,677 --> 01:15:24,931
It's a shame what this town
has come to.

921
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:27,516
You could do something
about it.

922
01:15:29,643 --> 01:15:31,727
What?

923
01:15:31,812 --> 01:15:33,063
We're freighters.

924
01:15:33,105 --> 01:15:36,108
Ralph here's a shopkeeper.

925
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:38,735
You're men, ain't you?

926
01:15:38,776 --> 01:15:43,448
I didn't raise my boys
just to see them killed.

927
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:45,949
Well, you may not know this,

928
01:15:46,033 --> 01:15:50,955
but there's things that gnaw
on a man worse than dying.

929
01:16:15,227 --> 01:16:16,270
Hey!

930
01:16:19,314 --> 01:16:20,648
Evening, gents.

931
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,150
Evening.

932
01:16:22,233 --> 01:16:23,526
Better get out of this weather,

933
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:25,820
or your bones are gonna be
even stiffer than mine.

934
01:16:25,904 --> 01:16:28,448
Heading into the saloon
to do just that.

935
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,908
Come looking for you boys.

936
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:32,117
I'd have bought you a drink
if you was earlier.

937
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:34,537
Then turn around
and do it now.

938
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,289
Marshal's got men waiting to
waylay you back at the livery.

939
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:39,749
Another one's in your wagon.

940
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,586
And then there's another
in the shed across from it.

941
01:16:42,669 --> 01:16:43,628
Marshal with them?

942
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,130
No.

943
01:16:45,172 --> 01:16:47,298
He's sitting up there
all by his lonesome

944
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:49,550
in that warm, dry jailhouse
with his feet up

945
01:16:49,635 --> 01:16:51,761
waiting for them
to bring you in.

946
01:16:51,844 --> 01:16:53,678
Or kill you.

947
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:55,306
Well, thanks for the warning.

948
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:59,643
Like I told you, never been
partial to the marshal's ways.

949
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:01,520
Dent Baxter's either.

950
01:17:01,603 --> 01:17:04,147
You're near the only friend
we got in this town.

951
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:06,482
I'll be buying a drink or two.

952
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:09,360
You keep it quiet, all right?

953
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:15,783
Time's come.
How you want to play it?

954
01:17:15,866 --> 01:17:18,702
Well, I work for you, Boss.
I'll play it however you want.

955
01:17:18,786 --> 01:17:21,287
Nobody works for anybody here,
Charley.

956
01:17:22,081 --> 01:17:24,667
Now, the name Butler mean
anything to you?

957
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:27,210
You hear names when you're on
the other side of things.

958
01:17:27,252 --> 01:17:29,712
He as fast as they say?

959
01:17:29,796 --> 01:17:30,922
He's a killer.

960
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:32,674
Know him if you saw him?

961
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:34,050
He ain't hard to recognize

962
01:17:34,091 --> 01:17:36,052
if you know
what you're looking for.

963
01:17:36,093 --> 01:17:37,553
Yeah.

964
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:39,263
Too bad if we get
shot up tonight

965
01:17:39,347 --> 01:17:41,306
before we get a chance
at him and Baxter.

966
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,268
Sure as hell is.

967
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,227
Tell you what,
I'd like to sit someplace dry

968
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:48,312
while the marshal's men
sit out in this rain.

969
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,024
Won't be so steady
come morning.

970
01:17:51,065 --> 01:17:51,859
Small town.

971
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:56,196
It's hard to hide even at night
in this weather.

972
01:17:56,237 --> 01:17:58,657
What do you want to do?

973
01:17:58,740 --> 01:17:59,991
Yep.

974
01:18:00,074 --> 01:18:02,826
Heard me an idea
sounded pretty good.

975
01:18:03,953 --> 01:18:05,912
You did, did you?

976
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:10,667
Well, all right.

977
01:18:25,765 --> 01:18:27,016
He's alone.

978
01:18:28,433 --> 01:18:30,144
Get your hands up.

979
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:32,229
You must be plumb crazy.

980
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:33,813
Shut up.

981
01:18:46,618 --> 01:18:48,702
You're dead men.

982
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:52,998
Didn't he tell you to shut up?

983
01:18:57,294 --> 01:18:58,420
What's that?

984
01:18:58,462 --> 01:19:01,798
Chloroform.
Stole it from the doc's.

985
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:06,636
You gonna arrest me
for that, Marshal?

986
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,851
Jesus.

987
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,890
Well, looky here.

988
01:19:56,975 --> 01:19:58,767
He's asleep.

989
01:19:58,852 --> 01:20:00,561
No.

990
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:03,355
Looky here.

991
01:20:04,398 --> 01:20:06,357
Put 'em down.

992
01:20:10,028 --> 01:20:11,529
This way.

993
01:20:24,082 --> 01:20:26,001
What do you think?
Do you like it?

994
01:20:27,377 --> 01:20:29,296
You like it,
you son of a buck, you?

995
01:20:29,379 --> 01:20:31,213
- Huh?

996
01:20:31,298 --> 01:20:33,966
A little bit more?
A bit more?

997
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:35,259
A bit more.

998
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:42,391
Wasn't no call to leave me
setting out like that.

999
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:45,936
- There wasn't a lot of time.
- I ain't bait, Charley.

1000
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:51,901
I hear you.

1001
01:20:51,941 --> 01:20:53,735
Best you remember it.

1002
01:20:53,778 --> 01:20:57,030
Well, I guess you ain't gonna
let me forget, are you?

1003
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:01,575
Starting to enjoy that part,
aren't you?

1004
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:09,208
Sorry if we woke you.

1005
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:10,709
No, no.
You didn't.

1006
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,754
- Come to see if..
- Go see for yourself.

1007
01:21:17,758 --> 01:21:19,258
Hey.

1008
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:21,969
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey.

1009
01:21:22,053 --> 01:21:23,721
You gave us a fright, pard.

1010
01:21:23,763 --> 01:21:26,349
Thought we was gonna lose you.

1011
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:29,143
Just taking a little nap,
that's all.

1012
01:21:29,227 --> 01:21:31,103
It's good to have you back.

1013
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,563
We owe you, Miss Barlow,
and we thank you.

1014
01:21:33,606 --> 01:21:35,399
You best thank God instead.

1015
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,778
Yes, ma'am.
We'll.. give that a try.

1016
01:21:39,819 --> 01:21:42,030
Well, I expect you men
are hungry.

1017
01:21:42,113 --> 01:21:43,198
Button just ate.

1018
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,866
I thought I'd make myself
some breakfast.

1019
01:21:45,951 --> 01:21:48,786
Two more mouths wouldn't be
any bother.

1020
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:51,622
I'm just gonna change.

1021
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:54,624
You.
You should try to sleep.

1022
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,836
He will.

1023
01:21:56,918 --> 01:21:59,546
Now, you do as she says now.

1024
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:01,297
Yes, Boss.

1025
01:22:01,381 --> 01:22:03,174
Okay.

1026
01:22:04,843 --> 01:22:06,136
Boss?

1027
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:07,428
Yeah?

1028
01:22:08,429 --> 01:22:10,139
Mose?

1029
01:22:10,223 --> 01:22:12,641
I'll be along in a minute,
Charley.

1030
01:22:12,684 --> 01:22:15,269
Be seeing you, Button.

1031
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:42,586
Aah.

1032
01:24:17,841 --> 01:24:20,176
If you don't mind my saying,
ma'am, you look..

1033
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:23,513
Tired.

1034
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:27,224
Oh.
It's been a long night.

1035
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:29,309
Why don't you sit?

1036
01:24:31,604 --> 01:24:34,064
Let an old cowpoke cook up
some breakfast.

1037
01:24:34,148 --> 01:24:36,984
No, I couldn't let you.

1038
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:38,610
Sure, you could.

1039
01:24:41,196 --> 01:24:43,197
Thank you.

1040
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:49,787
I want to apologize
for earlier.

1041
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,372
Oh, no, no.
There's no need.

1042
01:24:51,455 --> 01:24:52,707
You were startled.

1043
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:56,251
No, it was more than that.

1044
01:24:57,961 --> 01:25:00,297
I've been trying to put
some bad times behind me.

1045
01:25:00,338 --> 01:25:03,966
But sometimes
they don't stay put.

1046
01:25:05,469 --> 01:25:07,929
Always makes me feel better
to let things breathe a little.

1047
01:25:08,012 --> 01:25:09,430
Not bury them.

1048
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:12,808
I'm learning that.
Trying, anyway.

1049
01:25:12,892 --> 01:25:15,811
Well, that's all
any of us can do.

1050
01:25:15,894 --> 01:25:18,898
Just glad Button's
getting better.

1051
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:23,276
Don't believe I've ever seen
Boss so worried.

1052
01:25:23,361 --> 01:25:25,320
Well, the doctor will be
on his way home

1053
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:28,405
as soon as the storm's passed.

1054
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:31,493
By the doctor,
you mean your brother?

1055
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:38,665
It's just we've been thinking
that you and the doc was..

1056
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:41,001
husband and wife.

1057
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:42,544
Oh.

1058
01:25:43,503 --> 01:25:45,838
You did?

1059
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:49,175
Didn't find out
till last night.

1060
01:25:49,218 --> 01:25:51,761
Thought you was married, Sue.

1061
01:25:51,844 --> 01:25:54,139
Why, no.
I'm..

1062
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:56,516
I'm not, Charley.

1063
01:25:58,183 --> 01:26:02,021
Well, that's good.
I mean that's good to know.

1064
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:04,815
Otherwise,
we'd been thinking wrong.

1065
01:26:04,856 --> 01:26:06,274
We wouldn't want to do that.

1066
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:09,695
No.
No, of course not.

1067
01:26:30,214 --> 01:26:32,132
Much obliged to you, ma'am.

1068
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:34,884
You're very welcome,
Mr. Spearman.

1069
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:38,888
Thank you, Sue.

1070
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,684
Take care of yourself,
Charley.

1071
01:26:54,153 --> 01:26:57,823
Are you just gonna go off like
that without saying nothing?

1072
01:26:57,905 --> 01:26:59,198
Ain't nothing to say.

1073
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:02,076
I seen how you look at that gal
and the way she looks at you.

1074
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:04,037
It ain't right to walk away
without a word.

1075
01:27:04,078 --> 01:27:07,081
What do you want me
to tell her, Boss?

1076
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,207
We probably ain't gonna make it?

1077
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,419
Be a big fat comfort.

1078
01:27:14,171 --> 01:27:16,423
I don't know what you should
tell her, Charley.

1079
01:27:16,506 --> 01:27:20,301
I wish I'd have said more
to my wife before she passed.

1080
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:23,263
This may be the last time she
sees you in this world, Charley.

1081
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,389
Or you her.

1082
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:25,931
So tell her whatever you can.

1083
01:27:26,016 --> 01:27:28,434
'Cause she's entitled to more
than just your backside

1084
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:31,062
walking away.

1085
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:38,610
Charley.

1086
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:45,200
I'm not sure
what's worth saying or not.

1087
01:27:45,282 --> 01:27:47,118
Well, you don't have to
say anything.

1088
01:27:47,202 --> 01:27:49,370
Yeah, I do.

1089
01:27:49,453 --> 01:27:51,914
Boss is right about that.

1090
01:27:51,998 --> 01:27:54,792
He's right
about a lot of things.

1091
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:56,377
It's just..

1092
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:02,840
I'm not who you think
I am, Sue.

1093
01:28:02,925 --> 01:28:05,718
I've.. been places.
I've done things.

1094
01:28:05,803 --> 01:28:08,138
Most of them, I'm not proud of.

1095
01:28:09,305 --> 01:28:13,767
You know, I always hoped
somebody gentle and caring

1096
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,811
might come along.

1097
01:28:18,314 --> 01:28:21,651
Years pass.
A small town and all.

1098
01:28:21,692 --> 01:28:25,904
And your hopes begin to fade
a little every day

1099
01:28:25,987 --> 01:28:29,573
until you hardly remember
what they were.

1100
01:28:29,658 --> 01:28:31,952
I've seen who you are, Charley.

1101
01:28:31,993 --> 01:28:34,412
The way you looked after
that boy

1102
01:28:34,495 --> 01:28:37,123
and the respect you give Boss.

1103
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:38,374
It might be little bits.

1104
01:28:38,457 --> 01:28:42,544
But they're enough
for a woman who looks.

1105
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:48,341
Men are gonna get killed
here today, Sue.

1106
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,385
And I'm gonna kill them.

1107
01:28:50,468 --> 01:28:52,387
You understand that?

1108
01:28:53,303 --> 01:28:55,015
Yes.

1109
01:28:57,726 --> 01:28:59,810
I want you to have this.

1110
01:28:59,894 --> 01:29:02,229
It's always brought me luck.

1111
01:29:02,312 --> 01:29:06,816
I.. can't take your locket.

1112
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:10,862
It's not your choice
when it's a gift.

1113
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:13,614
It's a good likeness of you.

1114
01:29:14,657 --> 01:29:17,535
It's my mother
when she was young.

1115
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,165
She's beautiful.

1116
01:29:27,085 --> 01:29:31,214
I want you to know that
if I don't ever see you again

1117
01:29:31,298 --> 01:29:34,343
that I meant everything
I said to you

1118
01:29:34,384 --> 01:29:38,513
and I appreciate everything
you said to me.

1119
01:29:38,596 --> 01:29:41,932
Ain't nothing that happened in
this old town been a surprise.

1120
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:44,393
Except you.

1121
01:29:55,946 --> 01:29:58,615
I'll be seeing you,
Charley Waite.

1122
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,838
Happy?

1123
01:30:14,922 --> 01:30:17,383
Yeah.
If you are.

1124
01:30:40,695 --> 01:30:42,948
Morning, boys.

1125
01:30:45,491 --> 01:30:47,076
Brung you breakfast.

1126
01:30:49,454 --> 01:30:51,622
Hey, you kids.
Come away from there.

1127
01:30:51,706 --> 01:30:53,457
Come on.

1128
01:30:53,499 --> 01:30:54,917
You get along.

1129
01:31:06,886 --> 01:31:09,514
What do you suppose
this looks like?

1130
01:31:09,596 --> 01:31:11,725
It don't matter.

1131
01:31:11,808 --> 01:31:14,226
Whole town knows
there's a fight coming.

1132
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,479
They just hope it don't
spill over to them.

1133
01:31:29,157 --> 01:31:31,951
Well, if I'm gonna get killed,

1134
01:31:31,993 --> 01:31:35,955
I got a hankering to soothe
my sweet tooth.

1135
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:42,252
Morning.

1136
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,963
Morning.

1137
01:31:47,507 --> 01:31:49,968
What can I do for you fellers?

1138
01:31:50,009 --> 01:31:52,846
Thinking about some candy.

1139
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:54,848
- Candy?
- Yeah.

1140
01:31:55,514 --> 01:31:57,808
Yes, sir.
Candy.

1141
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,393
Got anything you want.

1142
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:01,854
- Got jawbreakers.
- Yeah.

1143
01:32:01,937 --> 01:32:06,983
Gumdrops, candy canes,
licorice, caramel, honey crisp.

1144
01:32:07,026 --> 01:32:09,694
Jujubes, lollipops,
milk chocolate..

1145
01:32:09,778 --> 01:32:11,363
Looking for something special.

1146
01:32:11,446 --> 01:32:14,491
Now, what's the most expensive
you've got?

1147
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:17,410
Well..

1148
01:32:17,494 --> 01:32:20,204
Ooh.
I got just the thing.

1149
01:32:29,338 --> 01:32:31,465
- This is dark chocolate.
- Yeah.

1150
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:34,467
It comes all the way
from Switzerland, Europe.

1151
01:32:34,551 --> 01:32:36,886
That's near France, see.

1152
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:38,930
They call it bittersweet.

1153
01:32:39,014 --> 01:32:41,015
Melts in your mouth.

1154
01:32:41,057 --> 01:32:43,184
- You tried it?
- No.

1155
01:32:43,226 --> 01:32:45,561
How do you know
it melts in your mouth?

1156
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:52,401
Well, truth is
we can't afford it ourselves.

1157
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:55,445
Mm-hmm.
I'll take two.

1158
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,989
Don't you want to know how much?

1159
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:58,657
Nope.

1160
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,117
Yes, sir.

1161
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:04,037
And three of your finest cigars.

1162
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:08,249
My friend and me got a hankering
for Switzerland chocolate

1163
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:10,376
and a good smoke.

1164
01:33:18,049 --> 01:33:21,636
Now, these come all the way
from Havana, Cuba.

1165
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:23,722
Thank you.

1166
01:33:23,805 --> 01:33:26,266
- Anything else?
- No. That'll do it.

1167
01:33:26,307 --> 01:33:28,392
How much I owe you?

1168
01:33:28,435 --> 01:33:30,811
It's.. $5.

1169
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:36,734
Charley.

1170
01:33:36,817 --> 01:33:39,111
Here you are.

1171
01:33:39,153 --> 01:33:40,946
Believe I'll enjoy
these later, Boss.

1172
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:42,322
Yep.

1173
01:33:44,283 --> 01:33:46,285
You ought to do yourselves
a favor and ride on

1174
01:33:46,326 --> 01:33:48,619
while you still got time.

1175
01:33:48,661 --> 01:33:50,912
Tried minding
our own business.

1176
01:33:53,957 --> 01:33:55,417
This is good.

1177
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,462
Worth every penny.

1178
01:34:01,506 --> 01:34:03,800
You're gonna
get yourselves killed.

1179
01:34:03,842 --> 01:34:05,301
Try that, Ralph.

1180
01:34:05,344 --> 01:34:07,012
Go on.

1181
01:34:09,973 --> 01:34:11,515
Sitting right here
in front of you.

1182
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,477
Never even tried it.

1183
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:19,649
Shame to go forever without
taking a taste of something.

1184
01:34:25,737 --> 01:34:28,699
Charley, let's go.

1185
01:34:32,202 --> 01:34:33,411
Percy!

1186
01:34:33,494 --> 01:34:35,121
Up here!

1187
01:34:35,163 --> 01:34:37,665
Brought you a cigar.
All the way from Havana, Cuba.

1188
01:34:37,749 --> 01:34:38,999
You don't say?

1189
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:41,043
I've heard about them,
but I never had one.

1190
01:34:41,126 --> 01:34:43,337
Much obliged to you.

1191
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:44,672
What do you think?

1192
01:34:44,713 --> 01:34:47,549
Better than them crappers
I usually smoke.

1193
01:34:47,633 --> 01:34:49,385
So, you're gonna make
your stand down here?

1194
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:51,886
Yeah.
But out there around our wagon.

1195
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:55,973
Not much choice without getting
a lot of innocent folks shot up.

1196
01:34:56,015 --> 01:34:57,768
Like to place some guns and ammo

1197
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,602
where we can get to it
on a short run.

1198
01:34:59,686 --> 01:35:01,062
Help yourself.

1199
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:03,147
We'll try to stay
out of your barn.

1200
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:04,816
Might not be able to.

1201
01:35:04,856 --> 01:35:07,192
Best bring in your livestock.

1202
01:35:07,901 --> 01:35:09,319
Be wishing you good luck now.

1203
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:10,862
Thank you.

1204
01:35:30,923 --> 01:35:33,591
It's a pretty day
for making things right.

1205
01:35:33,676 --> 01:35:34,926
Well, enjoy it.

1206
01:35:35,011 --> 01:35:36,553
Because once it starts,

1207
01:35:36,636 --> 01:35:38,972
it's gonna be messy
like nothing you ever seen.

1208
01:35:39,055 --> 01:35:40,390
I ain't survived my years

1209
01:35:40,472 --> 01:35:42,767
without being in
some fights, Charley.

1210
01:35:44,853 --> 01:35:46,812
I ain't doubting
your grit, Boss.

1211
01:35:46,896 --> 01:35:48,523
You got more than any man
I ever known.

1212
01:35:48,605 --> 01:35:50,983
It's just that..

1213
01:35:51,066 --> 01:35:52,401
I don't mean to be hard.

1214
01:35:52,443 --> 01:35:54,069
It's just the other night,
them fellows

1215
01:35:54,153 --> 01:35:55,904
back in them trees we let go.

1216
01:35:55,988 --> 01:35:57,905
It was my call, Charley.

1217
01:35:57,948 --> 01:35:59,907
I can see now
it was probably a mistake.

1218
01:35:59,992 --> 01:36:03,202
It's not what I meant.
I mean, maybe it was.

1219
01:36:03,244 --> 01:36:06,372
But the fact is it's what I
always respected about you.

1220
01:36:06,456 --> 01:36:09,541
What I always appreciated.

1221
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:13,796
How you treated other people
and how you treated me.

1222
01:36:13,879 --> 01:36:16,757
How you never look
for no trouble.

1223
01:36:16,798 --> 01:36:19,843
That kept me from trouble.

1224
01:36:19,926 --> 01:36:21,345
But it's found us here, Boss.

1225
01:36:21,428 --> 01:36:24,389
And if we're to have
any chance, you'll..

1226
01:36:24,431 --> 01:36:27,768
You go on and talk, Charley.
I'll hear you.

1227
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:29,101
I'm almost certain

1228
01:36:29,186 --> 01:36:32,271
they'll be overly confident
in their numbers.

1229
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:35,149
Especially if we're standing
right out here in front of them.

1230
01:36:35,232 --> 01:36:36,817
It's not like we'll have
any advantage.

1231
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:38,860
But if they're out there
with us,

1232
01:36:38,944 --> 01:36:42,156
then they won't have as much
as they might have otherwise.

1233
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:44,366
I don't figure all of them
to be killers.

1234
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:47,410
Only two or three like Butler
will have done much of it.

1235
01:36:47,452 --> 01:36:49,495
I'll be looking to him.

1236
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:53,583
The others will be hired men.
Probably saddle tramps.

1237
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:56,043
Maybe ex-Army.

1238
01:36:56,126 --> 01:36:57,753
The rest will be cowpunchers.

1239
01:36:57,795 --> 01:37:00,631
They won't want to line up
in front of us.

1240
01:37:01,757 --> 01:37:03,591
It'll happen fast
once I start.

1241
01:37:03,634 --> 01:37:06,845
So just keep yourself
moving forward.

1242
01:37:06,928 --> 01:37:10,682
And they'll either move or root.
Maybe even freeze up.

1243
01:37:10,766 --> 01:37:12,850
It don't matter which.

1244
01:37:12,934 --> 01:37:15,687
You just start right in on them
with that scatter-gun.

1245
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:19,439
When you've done both barrels,
drop it, pull your pistol,

1246
01:37:19,482 --> 01:37:22,609
and make a run for that building
where we stashed them others.

1247
01:37:22,652 --> 01:37:24,611
I'll be trying to do the same
if I can.

1248
01:37:24,653 --> 01:37:25,988
Right.

1249
01:37:26,071 --> 01:37:29,491
Sounds like you got it
all worked out.

1250
01:37:29,533 --> 01:37:30,701
Yeah.

1251
01:37:30,784 --> 01:37:33,161
Except the part
where we don't get killed.

1252
01:37:34,412 --> 01:37:38,290
Best smoke these
while we got the chance.

1253
01:37:38,332 --> 01:37:40,334
Yeah.

1254
01:38:05,482 --> 01:38:09,653
I'm thinking about getting out
of the damn cattle business.

1255
01:38:12,573 --> 01:38:14,825
You never said nothing
except nag me and Button

1256
01:38:14,867 --> 01:38:16,951
about getting ourselves out.

1257
01:38:17,036 --> 01:38:19,621
Well, maybe my own words
struck a chord.

1258
01:38:19,704 --> 01:38:22,623
Thought maybe
I'd sell off the cattle

1259
01:38:22,707 --> 01:38:27,002
and have enough to start up
a saloon somewhere.

1260
01:38:27,045 --> 01:38:29,630
Man could stay cool
in the summer

1261
01:38:29,713 --> 01:38:31,632
and dry in the winter.

1262
01:38:34,134 --> 01:38:38,054
Some dancing girls might be
nice, you know?

1263
01:38:38,096 --> 01:38:40,056
Have to get me some.

1264
01:38:42,808 --> 01:38:44,393
Yeah.

1265
01:38:49,315 --> 01:38:54,362
"If I die,
please sell my good horse"

1266
01:38:54,403 --> 01:38:57,614
and my good saddle and my guns

1267
01:38:57,698 --> 01:39:02,827
"to buy a tea set
for Miss Barlow."

1268
01:39:03,578 --> 01:39:05,789
"Charley Waite."

1269
01:39:09,334 --> 01:39:11,252
"Postscript.."

1270
01:39:11,293 --> 01:39:13,754
I like this one.

1271
01:39:13,838 --> 01:39:15,839
"But I don't know."

1272
01:39:16,757 --> 01:39:19,218
"Princess pattern."

1273
01:39:23,263 --> 01:39:24,389
Oh, hell.

1274
01:39:24,473 --> 01:39:26,350
What's the matter?

1275
01:39:28,518 --> 01:39:31,312
Oh.
Looks like you waited too long.

1276
01:39:31,395 --> 01:39:34,564
Kind of like us
and free grazing.

1277
01:39:34,649 --> 01:39:37,567
Well, good is good.

1278
01:39:37,652 --> 01:39:39,444
Melted or not.

1279
01:39:48,953 --> 01:39:52,916
Looks like you're plumb chained,
to your work, Marshal.

1280
01:39:52,957 --> 01:39:54,417
Get up, Poole.

1281
01:39:54,458 --> 01:39:56,794
He ain't worth a damn.

1282
01:39:56,877 --> 01:39:58,796
Get them all up!

1283
01:39:58,879 --> 01:40:00,631
Sobered up!

1284
01:40:01,966 --> 01:40:03,466
Ooh.

1285
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,055
I got a feeling there's gonna be
a new marshal in town.

1286
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:13,435
All right!

1287
01:40:13,476 --> 01:40:17,188
It's time to settle
these free grazers.

1288
01:40:17,271 --> 01:40:19,148
Oh, you leave your horses.

1289
01:40:20,316 --> 01:40:23,110
We're walking down
to their wagon.

1290
01:40:23,152 --> 01:40:25,946
When we get there, you better
empty your guns in them.

1291
01:40:25,988 --> 01:40:28,614
Or I'll damn well
shoot you myself.

1292
01:40:32,453 --> 01:40:34,871
Now, you three skirt
the buildings.

1293
01:40:34,954 --> 01:40:36,623
Get into the alleys
on the side.

1294
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:38,791
- Come on.

1295
01:41:08,151 --> 01:41:11,697
Hayley!
Come away from there.

1296
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:16,035
Finish these later.

1297
01:41:21,373 --> 01:41:23,375
Okay.

1298
01:41:23,415 --> 01:41:26,795
I'm not going to my maker
without knowing your given name.

1299
01:41:26,877 --> 01:41:30,172
Mine ain't Waite.
It's Postelwaite.

1300
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:32,633
Charles Travis Postelwaite.

1301
01:41:32,716 --> 01:41:34,343
What's yours?

1302
01:41:35,176 --> 01:41:37,096
Sure ain't Boss.

1303
01:41:41,432 --> 01:41:44,727
I mean it, Boss.
I'm asking you straight up.

1304
01:41:44,769 --> 01:41:46,771
It's Bluebonnet.

1305
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:49,065
Bluebonnet?

1306
01:41:49,107 --> 01:41:51,275
Bluebonnet, yeah.

1307
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:52,192
No middle name?

1308
01:41:52,235 --> 01:41:56,071
No, just Bluebonnet Spearman.
And don't you tell no one.

1309
01:41:57,322 --> 01:42:00,867
I want to hear you swear
an oath. Now, go on.

1310
01:42:00,951 --> 01:42:02,035
I swear it.

1311
01:42:02,119 --> 01:42:04,913
All right.
Okay.

1312
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:09,376
Just in case.

1313
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:27,976
Said eight.
Count five.

1314
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:37,402
You should have run when you
had the chance, Spearman.

1315
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:40,070
Not much for running
from cowards.

1316
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,532
I see the marshal ain't
with you.

1317
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,451
You won't find it so funny

1318
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:48,329
when you're all shot to hell
and dying.

1319
01:43:01,132 --> 01:43:04,217
- You the one killed our friend?
- That's right.

1320
01:43:04,302 --> 01:43:07,512
I shot the boy, too,
and I enjoyed it.

1321
01:44:39,723 --> 01:44:41,266
Hayley!

1322
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:45,978
Back up!

1323
01:44:50,065 --> 01:44:51,442
Where's the back door?

1324
01:44:51,526 --> 01:44:53,611
- Back door!
- Right this way.

1325
01:45:17,341 --> 01:45:19,384
It's locked.

1326
01:45:38,486 --> 01:45:40,321
You hit?

1327
01:45:40,404 --> 01:45:41,947
I'm good.

1328
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,992
You.

1329
01:45:51,665 --> 01:45:53,707
You get out of this house!

1330
01:45:59,672 --> 01:46:01,507
You pull that trigger, Baxter,

1331
01:46:01,591 --> 01:46:04,468
and you can forget about me
patching you up.

1332
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:10,265
You get your bag.
You're with me.

1333
01:46:10,307 --> 01:46:12,101
Go on.

1334
01:48:08,959 --> 01:48:12,586
Get the hell up, Poole!
On your feet, God damn it!

1335
01:48:16,132 --> 01:48:18,425
Yeah!

1336
01:48:18,468 --> 01:48:21,762
You're.. going out there.

1337
01:48:21,804 --> 01:48:24,555
We ain't ourselves yet!

1338
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:48,036
I see they hobbled you.

1339
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:50,455
It's been a while
since I was in a fight.

1340
01:48:50,497 --> 01:48:53,291
I panicked. Fell back.
Like to have broke my foot.

1341
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,543
Ornery old fool.

1342
01:48:54,625 --> 01:48:57,795
Well, or that damn Cuban cigar
got me riled up.

1343
01:49:01,966 --> 01:49:03,426
Charley.

1344
01:49:03,467 --> 01:49:04,926
You two wait here.

1345
01:49:04,969 --> 01:49:07,137
Hold on, there, Charley.
Hold on.

1346
01:49:07,221 --> 01:49:09,723
I ain't looking over my shoulder
the rest of my days.

1347
01:49:09,807 --> 01:49:11,766
Charley.

1348
01:49:11,809 --> 01:49:14,019
You said we was gonna
kill them all.

1349
01:49:14,102 --> 01:49:15,937
I aim to do just that.

1350
01:49:15,979 --> 01:49:17,730
I meant kill them.
Not murder them.

1351
01:49:17,814 --> 01:49:19,816
Splitting hairs,
ain't you, Boss?

1352
01:49:19,898 --> 01:49:23,445
Mister, I heard what you said.

1353
01:49:24,236 --> 01:49:25,821
I won't come after you.
I promise.

1354
01:49:25,905 --> 01:49:27,990
No, I expect you won't.

1355
01:49:28,073 --> 01:49:30,326
I ain't gonna let you
do it, Charley.

1356
01:49:30,409 --> 01:49:32,578
You do this, you ain't no
different than Poole or Baxter

1357
01:49:32,661 --> 01:49:35,831
or that gunhand of his
that murdered Mose.

1358
01:49:35,915 --> 01:49:37,999
Him killing Mose
is how this started.

1359
01:49:38,082 --> 01:49:40,002
We come for justice,
not vengeance.

1360
01:49:40,084 --> 01:49:41,753
Them is two different things.

1361
01:49:41,836 --> 01:49:43,754
Not today, they ain't.

1362
01:49:45,006 --> 01:49:45,965
Step aside!

1363
01:49:46,007 --> 01:49:47,717
Listen to him, son.

1364
01:49:47,799 --> 01:49:50,844
You done what you had to here
because they give you no choice.

1365
01:49:50,929 --> 01:49:53,764
Don't go making this
into something bad.

1366
01:49:55,223 --> 01:49:57,392
This ain't the way, pard.

1367
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:12,490
Mister, thank you.

1368
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:13,823
Thank you.

1369
01:50:13,866 --> 01:50:15,660
Didn't do it for you, boy.

1370
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:18,371
Just make peace
with your bad deeds.

1371
01:50:21,957 --> 01:50:23,708
Sue!

1372
01:50:23,792 --> 01:50:25,543
Get in here!

1373
01:50:25,627 --> 01:50:27,963
Oh, my God.

1374
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:37,763
Get out of the way.

1375
01:50:40,224 --> 01:50:42,016
Button!

1376
01:51:10,209 --> 01:51:12,670
- Put it down.
- Let the lady be!

1377
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,100
We got your boy, Spearman!

1378
01:52:21,484 --> 01:52:24,820
You better drop them guns
and come walking down the street

1379
01:52:24,862 --> 01:52:27,239
or I shoot him.

1380
01:52:27,323 --> 01:52:29,450
You've got ten seconds!

1381
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,788
We ain't giving up our guns.

1382
01:52:33,870 --> 01:52:35,747
He's gonna kill Button anyway.

1383
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:36,790
One!

1384
01:52:36,832 --> 01:52:40,210
The only chance for him or us
when we walk up is these guns.

1385
01:52:40,293 --> 01:52:42,461
Two!

1386
01:52:44,256 --> 01:52:45,923
Three!

1387
01:52:46,007 --> 01:52:46,966
Sue!

1388
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:48,884
Stop!

1389
01:52:48,968 --> 01:52:52,429
Stop it!
Stop it right now!

1390
01:52:58,184 --> 01:52:59,727
Four!

1391
01:53:01,146 --> 01:53:03,148
Sue.

1392
01:53:03,231 --> 01:53:05,817
You're a disgrace,
Marshal Poole.

1393
01:53:05,858 --> 01:53:09,069
You always have been.

1394
01:53:09,153 --> 01:53:12,365
I know it.
That's just the way it is.

1395
01:53:13,741 --> 01:53:15,368
Five!

1396
01:53:17,452 --> 01:53:19,288
Six!

1397
01:53:42,601 --> 01:53:45,186
Have a nice rest,
did you, Marshal?

1398
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:47,856
You'll be having a long one
yourself in a minute.

1399
01:53:47,898 --> 01:53:49,399
Been enough killing for you?

1400
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:52,359
Be enough when you're
both dead and buried.

1401
01:53:54,905 --> 01:53:57,156
Let the woman and boy go.
They ain't a part of this.

1402
01:53:57,239 --> 01:53:59,700
If you want considerations,

1403
01:53:59,783 --> 01:54:02,118
you drop them guns
on the ground.

1404
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:03,829
Let her take him to the doc's.

1405
01:54:03,913 --> 01:54:06,415
The doc's in jail,
and he ain't leaving

1406
01:54:06,498 --> 01:54:09,167
unless your guns
are in the dirt.

1407
01:54:10,043 --> 01:54:13,421
I'll crush any man
who stands with them!

1408
01:54:13,504 --> 01:54:14,547
When I finish that,

1409
01:54:14,589 --> 01:54:17,884
I'll torch your homes and drive
your wives and children

1410
01:54:17,926 --> 01:54:20,929
out into the cold prairie.

1411
01:54:21,011 --> 01:54:24,348
So you women, you better
take hold of your men.

1412
01:54:24,431 --> 01:54:27,601
If you don't, you'll be raising
orphans by winter.

1413
01:54:28,644 --> 01:54:30,520
Mack Langly!

1414
01:54:31,647 --> 01:54:34,399
It doesn't matter
whether you run or stay!

1415
01:54:34,441 --> 01:54:37,736
You and your boys
are already dead!

1416
01:54:38,612 --> 01:54:41,322
Mack Langly is our friend!

1417
01:54:52,249 --> 01:54:54,376
I didn't come all the way
from Ireland

1418
01:54:54,459 --> 01:54:58,546
to see my land pissed on
by free grazers.

1419
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:03,092
Now, I want them guns
in the dirt.

1420
01:55:04,219 --> 01:55:06,096
Him first.

1421
01:55:06,136 --> 01:55:08,222
The gunhand.

1422
01:55:50,969 --> 01:55:53,555
Looks like you're losing
your army, Marshal.

1423
01:56:11,864 --> 01:56:13,533
Get down!

1424
01:56:52,944 --> 01:56:54,737
It went through?

1425
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,240
Yeah.

1426
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,199
Is he hit, Sue?

1427
01:57:00,034 --> 01:57:01,661
- Sue, is he hit?
- No! No!

1428
01:57:01,744 --> 01:57:03,663
But he's bleeding bad again!

1429
01:57:03,745 --> 01:57:05,831
God damn it.
Can you stop it?

1430
01:57:05,914 --> 01:57:06,915
I'm trying.

1431
01:57:06,999 --> 01:57:08,750
I'm gonna kill you, Baxter!

1432
01:57:08,833 --> 01:57:11,503
Well, come on, if you're coming!

1433
01:57:15,924 --> 01:57:17,258
Can you cover me?

1434
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:20,886
Might be best to wait him out.
Probably bleed to death.

1435
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:24,265
I ain't waiting.

1436
01:57:24,348 --> 01:57:26,267
Button needs that doctor
right now.

1437
01:57:26,350 --> 01:57:27,977
Well, you know,
that door's locked.

1438
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:30,645
Well, it won't be
when the scatter-gun hits it.

1439
01:57:30,729 --> 01:57:33,231
I'm waiting for you, Spearman!

1440
01:57:35,776 --> 01:57:38,778
I'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch.

1441
01:57:41,447 --> 01:57:43,616
Okay, Charley?

1442
01:57:43,699 --> 01:57:44,909
Yeah.

1443
01:57:44,951 --> 01:57:46,828
You ready?

1444
01:57:47,744 --> 01:57:49,246
Yeah.

1445
01:58:45,048 --> 01:58:46,466
I'm dying.

1446
01:58:46,507 --> 01:58:49,469
And for what?
More cows?

1447
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:51,136
Killed a good man.

1448
01:58:51,221 --> 01:58:53,472
And maybe that boy
out there out yonder.

1449
01:58:53,514 --> 01:58:56,016
You get no sympathy
for your death.

1450
01:58:56,058 --> 01:58:58,019
Get!

1451
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:01,146
You're.. nothing.

1452
01:59:01,187 --> 01:59:03,315
Yeah? Maybe so.

1453
01:59:03,398 --> 01:59:06,692
But I'll still be breathing
in another minute.

1454
01:59:06,777 --> 01:59:10,196
Well, kill me, then.

1455
01:59:18,704 --> 01:59:19,871
No.

1456
01:59:21,206 --> 01:59:23,625
I ain't wasting a good bullet
to ease your pain,

1457
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:25,544
you son of a bitch.

1458
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:33,036
Your man's in the saloon.

1459
02:01:34,539 --> 02:01:36,457
Ordered everybody out.

1460
02:01:37,374 --> 02:01:41,169
Asked to see your sister
iffen she's willing.

1461
02:01:48,842 --> 02:01:50,594
He'd like to speak with you,
Miss Barlow,

1462
02:01:50,679 --> 02:01:53,557
iffen you ain't offended
by entering a saloon.

1463
02:02:02,689 --> 02:02:04,232
Sue.

1464
02:02:08,695 --> 02:02:10,154
Doc.

1465
02:02:10,196 --> 02:02:11,656
Bring him on up.

1466
02:02:11,697 --> 02:02:13,908
Put him in there.
We'll make room.

1467
02:02:21,582 --> 02:02:23,083
Baxter got any kin?

1468
02:02:23,166 --> 02:02:25,043
Daughter is all he has left.

1469
02:02:25,127 --> 02:02:28,005
It'd be right if somebody
explained things to her.

1470
02:02:28,046 --> 02:02:31,174
There never was
any love lost between 'em.

1471
02:02:31,216 --> 02:02:33,301
Even so, she's his daughter.

1472
02:02:33,385 --> 02:02:36,179
And kin is funny
about such things.

1473
02:02:49,983 --> 02:02:51,985
Come on.
Come on.

1474
02:03:19,802 --> 02:03:21,887
I didn't mean for you
to have to..

1475
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:24,557
walk into this place
in front of those people.

1476
02:03:24,598 --> 02:03:28,144
I don't care what anyone
out there thinks, Charley.

1477
02:03:28,227 --> 02:03:30,772
You don't have to
stand up for me.

1478
02:03:32,523 --> 02:03:33,565
Well, just the same,

1479
02:03:33,648 --> 02:03:37,945
I wanted to tell you that I'll
be leaving in a day or two.

1480
02:03:44,575 --> 02:03:47,078
I'd like you to stay.

1481
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,288
I think others would, too.

1482
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:53,918
I can't say I haven't
thought about it.

1483
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,586
Truth is, there wouldn't be
a corner here

1484
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:59,380
that don't have
a bad memory for me.

1485
02:04:03,343 --> 02:04:06,637
I've been holding my love
a long time, Charley.

1486
02:04:07,721 --> 02:04:10,766
I know you feel something
for me, too.

1487
02:04:13,352 --> 02:04:14,937
I do.

1488
02:04:17,481 --> 02:04:19,983
But I ain't no more
than those who come to kill us.

1489
02:04:20,025 --> 02:04:22,528
You seen that yourself.

1490
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:24,779
Maybe you've done
some bad things.

1491
02:04:24,863 --> 02:04:26,281
Maybe worse than bad.

1492
02:04:26,322 --> 02:04:29,617
But what happened here today
wasn't one of 'em.

1493
02:04:33,370 --> 02:04:37,541
And those killings,
they don't give you pause?

1494
02:04:38,334 --> 02:04:41,044
I'm not afraid of you, Charley.

1495
02:04:58,059 --> 02:05:00,270
It brought me luck.

1496
02:05:00,353 --> 02:05:02,023
Just like you said.

1497
02:05:03,607 --> 02:05:05,525
It's yours now.

1498
02:05:05,567 --> 02:05:07,152
You keep it.

1499
02:05:13,825 --> 02:05:15,326
I don't have the answers,
Charley.

1500
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:17,871
But I know that people
get confused in this life

1501
02:05:17,912 --> 02:05:22,958
about what they want
and what they've done

1502
02:05:23,042 --> 02:05:26,127
and what they think they
should have because of it.

1503
02:05:26,212 --> 02:05:30,548
Everything they think they are
or did takes hold so hard

1504
02:05:30,632 --> 02:05:34,177
that it won't let them see
what they can be.

1505
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:41,017
I've got a big idea
about us, Charley.

1506
02:05:42,435 --> 02:05:44,728
And I'm not gonna wait forever.

1507
02:05:44,811 --> 02:05:46,730
But I am gonna wait.

1508
02:05:46,813 --> 02:05:51,944
And when you're far away,
I want you to think about that.

1509
02:05:52,903 --> 02:05:57,241
And.. come back to me.

1510
02:08:33,552 --> 02:08:35,679
I'm in love with you, Sue.

1511
02:08:37,471 --> 02:08:40,516
Been that way since
I first laid eyes on you.

1512
02:08:40,558 --> 02:08:45,187
Just took me a while
to see things clear.

1513
02:08:47,064 --> 02:08:48,482
I know I'm not the kind of man

1514
02:08:48,565 --> 02:08:51,025
you expected to walk up
your front walk.

1515
02:08:52,026 --> 02:08:55,905
If I was your brother,
I wouldn't choose me for you.

1516
02:09:01,201 --> 02:09:02,871
Charley..

1517
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:07,708
Do you know how old I am?

1518
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:10,878
Don't care how old you are.

1519
02:09:10,919 --> 02:09:12,962
I'm not a girl anymore.

1520
02:09:14,631 --> 02:09:17,801
You're the handsomest woman
I ever saw.

1521
02:09:17,884 --> 02:09:20,554
I've had my disappointments,
Charley.

1522
02:09:20,636 --> 02:09:22,763
Well, I'm not gonna be
one of them.

1523
02:09:26,058 --> 02:09:28,853
I never thought I'd live
as long as I have, Sue.

1524
02:09:28,935 --> 02:09:33,106
I guess living the way I have,
it never really mattered.

1525
02:09:34,274 --> 02:09:37,944
But thinking I was never gonna
see you again was maybe..

1526
02:09:39,613 --> 02:09:42,824
Was maybe the most awful feeling
I ever had in my life.

1527
02:09:47,411 --> 02:09:51,957
I know I can be
a good husband to you.

1528
02:09:53,083 --> 02:09:54,752
And I know I ain't
asked you proper.

1529
02:09:54,793 --> 02:09:58,672
But I'm asking you now.

1530
02:10:03,176 --> 02:10:05,637
Will you marry me, Sue?

1531
02:10:08,932 --> 02:10:11,017
Charley.

1532
02:10:11,099 --> 02:10:12,935
Yes.

1533
02:10:13,770 --> 02:10:15,687
I'll marry you.

1534
02:10:20,526 --> 02:10:22,568
And can I kiss you?

1535
02:10:44,506 --> 02:10:48,468
I'm gonna give you a thousand
of these before I'm done.

1536
02:11:10,573 --> 02:11:12,740
Hey, Charley!

1537
02:11:12,824 --> 02:11:15,909
Looks like the doc
changed his mind about you.

1538
02:11:22,583 --> 02:11:24,751
Something wrong?

1539
02:11:24,835 --> 02:11:26,503
No.
Everything's fine.

1540
02:11:26,587 --> 02:11:28,797
I forgot to tell you
I'll have word about the saloon

1541
02:11:28,881 --> 02:11:29,840
by the time you get back.

1542
02:11:29,923 --> 02:11:31,716
Sounds good.

1543
02:11:33,427 --> 02:11:35,012
You take care, now.

1544
02:11:36,597 --> 02:11:39,098
Charley.

1545
02:11:39,183 --> 02:11:40,224
Sue.

1546
02:11:40,308 --> 02:11:41,976
I'll be along.

1547
02:11:47,064 --> 02:11:48,899
Saloon?

1548
02:11:48,982 --> 02:11:51,902
Told you I was wanting out
of the cattle business.

1549
02:11:51,986 --> 02:11:55,614
There's a saloon right back
there just had its owner die.

1550
02:11:55,697 --> 02:11:57,615
Hoping you'd be my partner.

1551
02:12:01,494 --> 02:12:04,288
I cant afford something like that.

1552
02:12:04,331 --> 02:12:06,332
Not even half.

1553
02:12:06,373 --> 02:12:09,959
Well let the brains of the outfith
do the thinking.

1554
02:12:10,002 --> 02:12:18,384
Sue!

1555
02:12:18,427 --> 02:12:22,263
You are coming back, aren't you?

1556
02:12:22,305 --> 02:12:27,684
And I will be waiting for you Charles!

1557
02:12:31,396 --> 02:12:36,735
Keep nothing private.

1558
02:12:36,819 --> 02:12:42,073
Have to go back know.

1559
02:12:42,115 --> 02:12:47,995
I don't want to loose
side of the roof tops.

1560
02:12:48,037 --> 02:12:53,167
I mean it Sue.

1561
02:12:53,209 --> 02:12:58,256
Got to go!

1562
02:12:58,296 --> 02:13:13,061
How this gonna work if
you don't do what I say.

1563
02:13:13,102 --> 02:13:15,230
I told you, I gonna get 8000

1564
02:13:15,271 --> 02:13:16,605
Before I die!

1565
02:13:16,647 --> 02:13:18,941
You make sure you do.

1566
02:13:57,435 --> 02:13:59,353
Let go get our cows.

1567
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:20,000
