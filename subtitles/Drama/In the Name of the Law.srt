1
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:11,962
Hurry.

2
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:12,986
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:14,418 --> 00:00:16,018
- There they are.
- Wait a minute.

4
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:18,888
- Grab him!
- What is this?

5
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,043
Run away. Hurry!

6
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:24,113
Run away from here.

7
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:25,743
- Grab him.
- Grab him.

8
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:28,443
- Grab him.
- Wait.

9
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:31,213
- Oh, my.
- No.

10
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:34,052
Why is he like this? Sir.

11
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:36,182
Yeon Kyung, what happened?

12
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:37,752
I performed CPR on a
cardiac arrest patient.

13
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:40,692
CPR? Oh, my. Are you okay?

14
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:42,763
His pulse and respiration are back.

15
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:45,793
Move him to intensive care unit
and reserve some check-ups.

16
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,103
Sir, it's me.

17
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:51,072
I'm Shin Myung Hoon, the
director of Shinhae Hospital.

18
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,503
- Hurry.
- Sir!

19
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,603
- We're moving.
- Oh, my. Sir!

20
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:55,973
It's me.

21
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:57,443
It's Shin Myung Hoon.

22
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:58,873
Open the door.

23
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,713
Be careful.

24
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:29,143
What did I do wrong?

25
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:32,743
- I did not...
- Is that Mr. Heo Im?

26
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:51,693
Follow him and see where he goes.

27
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,493
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,973
I was going to see you.

29
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:02,473
I don't think we're close
enough to come see each other.

30
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,673
You said you would contact
me if I turn in my papers.

31
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:08,142
When should I start?

32
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:12,452
Do you think that turning in a sheet
of paper will let you work here?

33
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:14,859
Did you not say that you hire
people based on their skills?

34
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:16,023
Skills?

35
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,193
Are you that confident?

36
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,593
Please arrange a meeting for me.

37
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:23,593
I will show you myself.

38
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,193
We don't hire people based on their skills.

39
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,803
- Pardon?
- Do you have a license?

40
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,173
- What is that?
- You don't even have a license,

41
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,773
and got in trouble at the other hospital?

42
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,883
Do you know that Yeon Kyung is in a
difficult situation because of you?

43
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,642
What do you mean?

44
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,583
I'm not sure whether you
know the word "bother".

45
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:45,113
- Bother.
- I know what it is.

46
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:50,253
That's good. You're a bother to Yeon Kyung.

47
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:51,623
Do you understand?

48
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,033
Is he safe?

49
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:04,703
Yeon Kyung.

50
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:07,172
I heard you helped that man run away.

51
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:10,643
You're digging your own grave.

52
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:13,642
Male, 58 years old, he had
a sudden cardiac arrest...

53
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,412
due to acute myocardial infarction.

54
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:18,112
According to his angiogram,
here, here, and here,

55
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:20,413
his coronary arteries
are plugged by plaque.

56
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:24,692
I think he needs a coronary
artery bypass graft.

57
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:26,853
Do you know him, by any chance?

58
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:28,923
Professor,

59
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,732
this patient is the presidential
secretary for economic affairs.

60
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,903
What? Who?

61
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,933
What are you doing? Hurry and
reserve an operation room.

62
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,873
The preparation is done. You can just go.

63
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:55,383
How will I perform normally
when I'm so nervous?

64
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,093
This is an interesting sight.

65
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:08,633
Your friend has a very
talented granddaughter.

66
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:12,703
She was very smart since she was young.

67
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,443
Her affiliation is quite clear.

68
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,782
Why are there patients wherever you go?

69
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,553
Your timing is amazing.

70
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:30,953
Look. If we were late, it
would have been serious.

71
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:49,103
Okay.

72
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:50,713
What?

73
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:52,642
Where?

74
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:56,783
To Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic.
The director let him in.

75
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,283
Bong Tak.

76
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:07,563
Hey, Bong Tak.

77
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,432
I told him to not call me that.

78
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,263
Bong Tak.

79
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:21,873
Do you need a license to become a doctor?

80
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,413
What happens if you do not have that?

81
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,213
You will get arrested...

82
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,283
for illegal medical practice.

83
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:29,913
- Get arrested?
- Oh, my.

84
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,553
- Get arrested?
- What is wrong?

85
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:34,652
- Wait.
- What is wrong?

86
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:37,952
How can you get that license?

87
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,622
What do you mean "get"? You
acquire it by passing the exam.

88
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:41,763
Exam?

89
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,163
Exam?

90
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,573
He must be talking about the
medical state examinations.

91
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:51,302
Can anyone take the exam?

92
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:52,572
You have to graduate from
oriental medicine school.

93
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,072
- How do I go to that school?
- Go through college admissions.

94
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,202
How do I take college admissions?

95
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:59,243
You have to study hard, focusing
on Korean, English, and math.

96
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,712
How long should I prepare for that?

97
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:04,813
If you graduate elementary school,
middle school, and high school,

98
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:07,953
it'll take 18 years. It'll be 12
if you take qualification exams.

99
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:14,093
Gosh. Gosh.

100
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,943
Why do you look like that?

101
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:35,013
Didn't it work out yesterday?

102
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,352
Did they refuse to accept
fake doctors like you?

103
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:39,853
I am not a fake doctor.

104
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,483
You just do not know who I am.

105
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,893
You should just sweep the floor.

106
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,153
That's the job for you.

107
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:49,022
I am not a servant.

108
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,363
What else do you have to do?

109
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,263
I am going.

110
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:58,633
He must have learned something.

111
00:06:58,803 --> 00:06:59,873
When he's upset,

112
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,643
he should move around.

113
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:08,682
You surprised me. What is this?

114
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,283
I bought milk and bread.

115
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:11,612
You did not have breakfast, right?

116
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:12,683
I did.

117
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:16,953
He didn't even buy me coffee.
Why would he buy milk?

118
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:21,093
What happened to him this time?

119
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:26,893
I told him only the truth.

120
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,203
Is he sick again?

121
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:43,843
This place...

122
00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:46,653
is not so bad.

123
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:04,903
You're a bother to Yeon Kyung.

124
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,073
She must have tried hard to protect you.

125
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,672
After what she has done for
you, you should disappear.

126
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,643
Why do you keep coming here?

127
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:14,613
If you get her into trouble,

128
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,443
will you take responsibility?

129
00:08:18,713 --> 00:08:20,112
- So I...
- What is this?

130
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,483
Yeon Kyung...

131
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:26,093
No.

132
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,463
She should have told me.

133
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,363
I cannot work at the palace,

134
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,273
nor be a doctor here.

135
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,612
The surgery went well.

136
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,583
He will be ready to leave in a week.

137
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,864
Is this what solving the problem
one has made looks like?

138
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:00,693
We should give her a day off.

139
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:04,362
As a director I can do that, can't I?

140
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,363
Of course.

141
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:08,032
You should get some rest, Dr. Choi.

142
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,033
Thank you.

143
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,133
Professor Hwang,

144
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,773
about that thing I told you...

145
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:17,342
It didn't happen, all right?

146
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,413
Yes, sir.

147
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,213
Choi Yeon Kyung. You're great indeed.

148
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,523
Treat me like an elder.

149
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,353
Yes, ma'am. You are great.

150
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,823
Why?

151
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:37,203
Is it because I saved a patient or
because it was a Head of Department?

152
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,963
Both?

153
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:44,273
Jae Ha.

154
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:48,302
About yesterday...

155
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,943
You weren't at the symposium yesterday.

156
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:52,912
If you're sorry,

157
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:54,983
will you have dinner with me?

158
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,113
How would a doctor leave the
hospital and go somewhere?

159
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:02,723
Have dinner with the woman
you are flirting with.

160
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:04,523
Bye.

161
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,323
I'd like to.

162
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,633
But she always refuses me.

163
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,203
Doctor.

164
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,173
(Emergency Medical Services)

165
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:24,413
It's her.

166
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:26,173
I found her at last.

167
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:27,843
Are you all right?

168
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,443
Pardon?

169
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:37,082
A man ran to you like light...

170
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,623
and it pierced into his back.

171
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:43,493
Is he all right?

172
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,602
You hugged me from behind...

173
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,902
to bring me here.

174
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,132
That is unfair.

175
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,773
You remember me hugging
you, but not my scream?

176
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,343
It hurt a lot. I nearly died.

177
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,053
It must have hurt a lot.

178
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,863
Excuse me.

179
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:21,503
Hello. Come here.

180
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:25,573
Why did you come here?

181
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:27,033
Let me take a look.

182
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:28,973
What are you doing?

183
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,343
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:32,873
You should go and clean up.

185
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:34,183
Yes, sir.

186
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,453
Gosh, let me take a look.

187
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,523
I should go back.

188
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:25,393
I should at least wipe her tears
of blood with your throat.

189
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:26,863
No.

190
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:49,353
Is this Dongi Pharmaceuticals?

191
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:51,823
What are you doing?

192
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:53,963
We've been in contract for a long time.

193
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,123
Gosh.

194
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:58,533
Warm green tea.

195
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,563
Gosh, you surprised me.

196
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,902
What did you say?

197
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,902
You should prepare that...

198
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:06,949
instead of milk.

199
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,602
Do you have pueraria lobata
or the root of an arrowroot?

200
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:10,913
Yes, but why?

201
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:16,413
She has a bad liver.

202
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,053
- What?
- She will get better if she...

203
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:22,183
drinks green tea in the morning
and pueraria in the afternoon.

204
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,303
And your relationship will get better too.

205
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:26,453
Liver?

206
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:28,523
She has a bad liver?

207
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,163
Is she drinking?

208
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,932
How do you know?

209
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,303
Are you two close?

210
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:38,232
How can I speak to you nicely?

211
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:41,342
You told me you'll give us the medicine.
Why are you backing out?

212
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:43,502
Gosh, we only owe you a little.

213
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,573
Are you looking down at the
clinic because it's small?

214
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:49,343
What a nerve she has.

215
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:50,513
I asked you...

216
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,052
if you are close with her.
How do you know that?

217
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:55,322
I know about this...

218
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:56,923
- because...
- Gosh.

219
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,252
Are you trying to make
him believe your lies?

220
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,392
I am not.

221
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:03,593
You should even apply acupuncture on him.

222
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,663
Gosh, what will you do for a living?

223
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:10,002
I need to think about it.

224
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,073
Be quiet. Hold this and follow me.

225
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:13,233
Where?

226
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,203
Gosh.

227
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:16,943
Come here.

228
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:19,573
Are you two close?

229
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:21,643
You are so stupid.

230
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:25,013
(Patient's Chart)

231
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,953
You're taking a day off?
Why would you do that?

232
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,423
- Are you sick?
- Don't make a fuss.

233
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,852
I need to take care of something.

234
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,423
What is it? What is it?

235
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,493
Is it dopamine? Are you going to a club?

236
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,933
What's happening? That patient
has a surgery tomorrow.

237
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:48,773
Why is she leaving? Something
came up and she has to leave.

238
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:51,013
The surgery has been cancelled.

239
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:53,613
Give me her chart.

240
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,059
Gosh, what's the matter again?

241
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,483
She's not your patient.

242
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:00,582
Would you say that to your family?

243
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,723
Even if it were my family,

244
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,552
how would I stop a patient
that really wishes to leave?

245
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,422
She has unstable angina,

246
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,693
narrow left main coronary artery,

247
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:11,093
arrhythmia, and diabetes.

248
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,432
She needs surgery as soon as possible.

249
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:14,762
You're not the only doctor here.

250
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:15,932
I'm a doctor here.

251
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,403
She has personal issues.

252
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,603
What would a cold person like you know?

253
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,212
Only surgeries matter to you.

254
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,772
She thinks she's the only doctor here.
Don't you agree?

255
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:27,813
No, I don't.

256
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:32,613
Jo Mi Young.

257
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:41,763
If you leave like this, the
coronary artery might get blocked,

258
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:44,193
and it could cause myocardial infarction.

259
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,063
It can get really dangerous.

260
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,963
Even if there's a problem,

261
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,772
you should get a surgery
as soon as possible.

262
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:52,533
Thank you for telling me that.

263
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,019
But I can't afford to
be a patient right now.

264
00:15:57,043 --> 00:16:00,573
Is it because of the surgery fees?

265
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:05,153
Doctors seem to regard
patients as a source of money.

266
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,783
No.

267
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:11,223
They regard patients as
a life they must save.

268
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:17,463
And I think one's own life is
the most important reason.

269
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:22,633
Please come back when you
can stay as a patient here.

270
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,409
Meanwhile, don't forget to
take aspirin and angina drug.

271
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,643
If you feel the symptom
that your heart aches,

272
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:31,564
put the medicine under your tongue
immediately and come to emergency.

273
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:33,613
Good bye.

274
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:52,733
- Do you have beggars in this world?
- Come on.

275
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,363
Gosh.

276
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,573
He might be highly qualified,

277
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:07,243
but still, how can such a young
man take charge of the VIP ward?

278
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,983
It's because the hospital
director has his back.

279
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:14,853
That's correct.

280
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:16,853
It's all thanks to my connections.

281
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,823
I'm so young and inexperienced.

282
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:23,463
I hope you can give lots of
instruction from now on.

283
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:27,903
- You're more than welcome.
- You can talk casually to me.

284
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:32,933
He's so polite. He's also tall.

285
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:34,903
He just looks like a model.

286
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:45,013
I also know that I'm here
thanks to my connections.

287
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:50,423
That's why I'm going to start
with a clean slate now.

288
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:58,233
Gosh, my tooth aches so much. It's here.

289
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,632
You should have cleaned it.

290
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:03,503
You little punk. Who are you?

291
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,603
Where's the acupuncture
point for a toothache?

292
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:11,113
- What?
- Where should I apply the needle?

293
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:14,043
Nonghyun and the jaw area.

294
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,383
Did you hear that? Give me your hand.

295
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:23,853
Gosh, you caught a cold
in the middle of summer.

296
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,723
- Hey.
- Hapgok, daechu and gokji.

297
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,093
Pass me the needle.

298
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,133
Come on.

299
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:04,233
Hand out the drugs to them.

300
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,672
Hey, Mr. Heo!

301
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:13,372
You'd better go and get some treatment.

302
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:16,373
You said you had chest pain this morning.

303
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,813
Gosh, how come you're
sleeping so much today?

304
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:29,183
Who's that silly man you brought here?

305
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,793
Are you going to retire after
putting him in charge of here?

306
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:36,693
Is it because of the money?

307
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,892
What's this jerk doing here?

308
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:42,762
Help me, master! Master!

309
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,232
My goodness.

310
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,203
Gosh.

311
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:52,943
They said it's facial nerve palsy.
He got acupuncture for several days.

312
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:56,213
However, he hasn't gotten
better and he can't hear well.

313
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:03,753
He says he hears ringing in the ears.

314
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,792
I don't think it's a
simple facial nerve palsy.

315
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,333
It isn't?

316
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,933
There are many reasons when
a face becomes paralyzed.

317
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,473
We need to take an MRI
scan to know for sure.

318
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:21,142
Do you want to do that?

319
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:24,273
Why does he use an MRI scan
for a facial nerve palsy?

320
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,973
We don't use those machines in
the field of oriental medicine.

321
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:31,983
You once said that oriental medicine
needs to use high technology.

322
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:41,723
We're done.

323
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,063
Sir.

324
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:49,963
I don't have anything, so please take this.

325
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,502
What is it?

326
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:54,342
I got it at the soup kitchen this morning.

327
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,573
You can eat it later. You
don't need to give it to me.

328
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:58,773
- Thank you.
- Yes.

329
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:00,313
I appreciate it.

330
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:07,659
Hey!

331
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,622
- Mr. Heo!
- What's wrong?

332
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:11,992
- Mr. Heo! Wake up!
- Goodness!

333
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:14,623
- Gosh, what's the matter?
- Hey! Wake up!

334
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:16,693
It's just what I thought.

335
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:19,162
It seems to be an acoustic schwannoma.

336
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:21,033
What?

337
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:24,703
Look at this. Here's the auditory nerve.

338
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,919
He got a tumor here. The facial
nerve passes the ear and spreads.

339
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:32,073
He got a facial palsy
because of the tumor here.

340
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,282
He should get surgery to remove the tumor.

341
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:37,213
It's necessary to work on facial
palsy before it gets worse.

342
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:38,913
I can treat it myself.

343
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:41,023
Thank you.

344
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,553
Hey, come on.

345
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:50,563
He was talking about his
chest this morning.

346
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:52,693
What's wrong with him?

347
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,333
It looks like acute indigestion. Let's see.

348
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:42,342
What's going on? Why are
you holding the needle?

349
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:43,542
You punk!

350
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:47,753
Are you going to take him
to the hospital? Come on!

351
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:49,283
Stay still!

352
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,323
You can go on.

353
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:10,143
I don't think it's just acute indigestion.

354
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:12,912
His pulse seems to be different.

355
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,612
Then what's the matter with him?

356
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:16,683
Well,

357
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:19,282
I'm not sure...

358
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:20,722
I knew it.

359
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:21,922
You're a quack, aren't you?

360
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:23,783
Be quiet!

361
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,892
Do you know what he ate?

362
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:30,399
He didn't eat anything. He
drank a lot last night.

363
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:33,433
He must have had lots of
water as he was thirsty.

364
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:58,953
His limbs are swollen and cold,
and his stomach feels chilly.

365
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:02,592
It looks like heoriaemaek.

366
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:04,163
What is that?

367
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,309
It's when you drink too much water.

368
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:13,103
It makes your chest feel stuffed
and makes you feel dizzy.

369
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:22,883
His face is dry and swollen.

370
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:25,453
It is dark just like he got a bruise.

371
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:28,923
He breathes raggedly like
he is going to die soon.

372
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,813
That must be Heo Im's method of
treatment that I've only read about.

373
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:40,353
I'll connect electricity to them to
increase the effect of acupuncture.

374
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:23,633
Thankfully, the pulse feels better.

375
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:26,533
His face color has come back to normal.

376
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:33,543
Gosh, he is alive.

377
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:35,743
- He's good.
- He's good.

378
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:42,522
Are you all right?

379
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:44,953
- He looks better.
- Gosh.

380
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:53,162
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

381
00:26:53,163 --> 00:26:54,933
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

382
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,473
Are you all right?

383
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:05,713
Now that I look at him, he's handsome.

384
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:12,053
What are you doing?

385
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:15,023
You are so handsome.

386
00:27:18,423 --> 00:27:20,552
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

387
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:22,893
Me? I'm...

388
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,563
the King of the poor.

389
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,633
- Run!
- Here.

390
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:33,933
Go.

391
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,172
- Run!
- Run!

392
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:38,573
- Run!
- Run!

393
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:48,515
I heard you showed the staffs how
good you are on your first day.

394
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:51,486
They must have secretly
wanted you to make a mistake.

395
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:53,186
They must be disappointed.

396
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:55,286
I didn't do it to show them.

397
00:27:56,356 --> 00:28:00,295
I don't know how you were born to
a useless man like your father.

398
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:02,063
You must have inherited...

399
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:03,920
my blood through your mother.

400
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,435
Did you choose the staffs
for the VIP wards?

401
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:12,236
Yes, I have a plan.

402
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:25,415
I want to give you something
for saving my father.

403
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,856
But I do not have anything to give you.

404
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:29,932
So please accept this, Dr. Heo.

405
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:31,325
You should eat this when you are hungry...

406
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:32,896
while looking after the patients.

407
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:36,826
He should have just thanked me with words.

408
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,466
That's a meal for them.

409
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:46,336
If you don't want that,
why did you act up there?

410
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:50,046
You were so happy after you saved someone.

411
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:51,576
When did I...

412
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,986
You were born to be a doctor.

413
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:58,156
- What?
- Whether it's a palace or a house,

414
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:01,326
a person who is full or
a person who is hungry,

415
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:05,625
you feel happy when they live.
It's nice to get them fixed.

416
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:07,996
That's what doctors do, isn't it?

417
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,566
I need to drop by somewhere.
You should go inside first.

418
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,635
Don't go anywhere else.

419
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:17,012
Go straight home.

420
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:18,106
- Yes.
- Go.

421
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:24,146
Home?

422
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,946
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

423
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:32,786
(Haeminseo)

424
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,726
Home.

425
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:38,556
Gosh.

426
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:41,166
I did not say I was going to live here.

427
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,126
Gosh.

428
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:47,866
Heo Bong Tak.

429
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,476
Why are you here at this hour?

430
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:57,845
Were you thrown out of the
hospital because of me?

431
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,476
I could have been.

432
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:01,746
But I see that...

433
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:03,586
you didn't go yet.

434
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:11,125
Just give me a few days.

435
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,126
Why?

436
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,616
Are you going to come
to the hospital again?

437
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:17,696
Why did you not tell me beforehand?

438
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,866
If you don't have anywhere to go,

439
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:25,006
you could stay for a while.

440
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,576
What did you say?

441
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:32,946
I mean...

442
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,656
Don't go somewhere strange
and cause more problems.

443
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:41,686
Just stay here instead.

444
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,096
What are these?

445
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:53,566
It's nothing.

446
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,406
It looks like clothing for people.

447
00:30:57,836 --> 00:31:01,076
Why does it look like this?

448
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,345
- Give it to me.
- I am just curious.

449
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:06,575
Just let me see.

450
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:08,645
It's not something you
should be curious about.

451
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:11,715
What is this for? Just
let me see for a moment.

452
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:12,756
Choi Yeon Kyung.

453
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:17,026
Jae Ha, why are you here?

454
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:18,755
I couldn't get in touch with you.

455
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:20,996
When I went to the hospital,
they told me you went home.

456
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:25,266
But I didn't know you would have a guest.

457
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:36,676
Who is he?

458
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,246
Well,

459
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,286
he's Grandfather's guest.

460
00:31:43,746 --> 00:31:45,116
I came from somewhere far away.

461
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:49,855
Is he staying here?

462
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:52,055
Well, for a while?

463
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:55,166
Did you not say that I could
stay here a few minutes ago?

464
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:59,096
Why? Does it bother you?

465
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:03,666
Jae Ha, I'm sorry, but let's
have dinner some other day.

466
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:05,606
All right.

467
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:06,936
Bye.

468
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,016
Excuse me.

469
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:14,286
Go inside.

470
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:23,626
Why would I be bothered?

471
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:27,696
He is Heo Im indeed.

472
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:31,066
I got to see something that
was passed down as a legend.

473
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:33,495
Come to think of it,

474
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:36,506
he's not someone I can dare boss around.

475
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,245
Wait a moment, that's Jae Ha.

476
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:43,406
I thought he was in America.
Did he come to Korea?

477
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:46,946
Why is his facial expression like that?

478
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:53,316
He should say hello to me if he came here.

479
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:54,626
Gosh.

480
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:57,226
That scum.

481
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:00,666
Here.

482
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,196
It is meat.

483
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,865
You are here! Please sit down.

484
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,836
We are having meat for dinner.

485
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:12,306
What did he do to deserve meat?

486
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:17,275
Dinner's ready. Don't you want to join us?

487
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:19,276
I'll eat by myself.

488
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:23,146
Hey.

489
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:49,306
The woman you were with...

490
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:51,346
Did she go somewhere?

491
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:44,236
What are you doing?

492
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:47,136
I was hungry.

493
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:48,465
Even after you ate?

494
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,935
I could not eat a lot.

495
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:51,752
How could you be so awkward
with your grandfather?

496
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,576
I could not eat in such
an awkward situation.

497
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:06,656
Open the lid.

498
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,196
Put the seasoning in.

499
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:16,596
Pour water and wait three minutes.

500
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,065
I mean, count to 200.

501
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,665
Is this really noodles?

502
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:21,666
Go.

503
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:22,836
All right.

504
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:26,976
No.

505
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:29,646
Open the lid and pour water in here.

506
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:33,946
Plug it in...

507
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,046
and push this button.

508
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:38,856
Wait after you push the button.

509
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:56,136
Here. If you do this,

510
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:58,305
it's tuna ramyeon.

511
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,666
You are trying to send me out
after feeding me this, right?

512
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:02,146
Eat up.

513
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,625
You should meet him. You don't know...

514
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,396
if you can get something out of him.

515
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:19,126
Have we...

516
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:23,466
met somewhere before?

517
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:28,606
We haven't seen each other before?

518
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:31,676
Maybe when we were young?

519
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:37,246
Eat up.

520
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:45,616
What am I doing?

521
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:50,566
What am I expecting from someone
who came from 400 years ago?

522
00:37:06,206 --> 00:37:08,446
I feel strangely full.

523
00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:19,192
What is this?

524
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,386
There is a person inside this.

525
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:29,326
This is...

526
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,326
It is funny.

527
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:13,636
You should watch and learn.

528
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:40,606
He went to Seoul Station with the
director to treat the homeless.

529
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,736
He must have been really tired.

530
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:54,246
You should not judge me...

531
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:57,416
based on what you heard and saw that day...

532
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,316
to say what kind of life I led.

533
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:02,726
What is it that I don't know?

534
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:10,536
Who is he?

535
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:21,746
The little girl has grown
up and has become a woman.

536
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:24,546
Time flies.

537
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:33,056
Does she still like this?

538
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,696
So he met Kyung.

539
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:49,106
They must be deeply connected.

540
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:54,506
Bong Tak.

541
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:57,476
Bong Tak!

542
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,516
What?

543
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:03,146
I wanted to get some sleep today.

544
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:06,716
Why is he screaming so loudly?

545
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:10,596
Heo Bong Tak!

546
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:38,416
What are you doing?

547
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,356
Hello.

548
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:44,226
You hair is a little...

549
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,495
But you are the most beautiful
person in the world.

550
00:40:47,496 --> 00:40:48,936
(Most Beautiful Person in the World)

551
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:51,265
Did you have sweet dreams?

552
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,366
(Sweet Dreams)

553
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:55,706
The rain sounds so great today.

554
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:00,805
Is that all he learned?

555
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,875
You should wake up early.

556
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:04,815
In summer, when it is the most lively,

557
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,886
you need to make sure that the sun
connects well to the energy...

558
00:41:07,986 --> 00:41:09,346
He's even scolding me.

559
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:11,015
And after you wake up,

560
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:14,185
you should move your body
to massage its parts...

561
00:41:14,186 --> 00:41:16,156
and wake up your organs.

562
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:18,926
Let us move our bodies together.

563
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:24,535
You don't need to clean up when it rains.

564
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:26,836
Do not say that. You should come out too.

565
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:28,736
Let us do this together.

566
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:31,036
Oh, my.

567
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:32,876
Hey.

568
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,066
Did you forget who you were?

569
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,036
Do you not know that doctors'
hands are like their lives?

570
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:17,916
What do you think happened overnight?

571
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,355
He must like it here.

572
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:23,756
Every corner must shine so that
patients would gain strength...

573
00:42:23,856 --> 00:42:25,556
and make doctors feel good.

574
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:27,965
I did not clean this room.

575
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:29,866
Oh, my. Hey!

576
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:32,536
I will do that part.

577
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:34,405
- I'll do it.
- Gosh.

578
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:36,466
I am just cleaning up.

579
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:44,246
That man...

580
00:42:44,816 --> 00:42:47,316
- Was anything strange about him?
- No.

581
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:52,156
The clinic seems much brighter after
that handsome man has come here.

582
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:55,986
Brighter? It's gloomy as always.

583
00:42:56,226 --> 00:42:58,455
You were going to go grocery shopping.
Aren't you going?

584
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:00,225
- I am.
- The room has to shine.

585
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:02,796
Let me go. Wait.

586
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:10,066
Everyone likes him now.

587
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:11,936
Everyone.

588
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:14,046
Bong Tak.

589
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:19,216
Bong Tak, Mother is here.

590
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:21,546
Mother, you are here.

591
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,316
Bong Sik is here too.

592
00:43:26,886 --> 00:43:28,626
Bong Sik.

593
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:34,696
Bong Tak...

594
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:38,296
dislikes domestic animals like
chickens and pigs the most.

595
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:42,166
But look at him now.

596
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,006
He is so talented.

597
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:48,206
I've never seen her laugh like
that after her son emigrated.

598
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:53,446
At first, I thought he was useless.

599
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,316
But he seems really nice.

600
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,715
The director scolds him frequently,

601
00:43:57,716 --> 00:44:00,186
but he seems to have
something planned for him.

602
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:04,426
And you know that he wouldn't take
just anyone to Seoul Station.

603
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,026
Even if he's healthy, he is old.

604
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:15,906
With Bong Tak by his side, I
feel like I can trust him.

605
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:25,646
Hey, I brought...

606
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:28,615
I brought snacks for you.

607
00:44:28,616 --> 00:44:29,745
Snacks?

608
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:32,656
- Here, Bong Tak.
- Gosh.

609
00:44:33,786 --> 00:44:36,326
- This is...
- Yes?

610
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:38,456
This is cow bezoar.

611
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:43,696
This is precious medicine.
Where did you get it?

612
00:44:43,966 --> 00:44:47,636
You should eat it. I have more at home.

613
00:44:47,736 --> 00:44:50,265
When you were young, Bong Tak,

614
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:53,906
you wanted to have this so much.

615
00:44:58,176 --> 00:45:00,046
How did you...

616
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:08,256
To give this to my mom...

617
00:45:10,226 --> 00:45:13,196
To save my mom... To save her...

618
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:26,806
Please give me medicine.

619
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:30,692
I must save my mom.

620
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:34,015
Please. Please give me medicine.

621
00:45:34,016 --> 00:45:36,045
Did you steal this from someone?

622
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:37,616
I did not steal it.

623
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:39,855
- You little...
- Please give it back.

624
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:41,085
Will you not stop?

625
00:45:41,086 --> 00:45:43,626
I need to save my mom.

626
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,166
Right.

627
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:56,235
I know how you feel.

628
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:57,836
How you feel.

629
00:45:58,236 --> 00:46:01,476
I do know how you feel.

630
00:46:02,246 --> 00:46:03,246
Gosh.

631
00:46:12,986 --> 00:46:14,386
Have this.

632
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:16,125
I am all right.

633
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:19,425
No, you have it.

634
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:22,096
My Bong Tak should have this and cheer up.

635
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:23,666
Have it.

636
00:46:24,136 --> 00:46:25,136
Good boy.

637
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:33,836
- Goodness.
- Have this.

638
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:40,146
It's a bit salty.

639
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:52,426
Goodness. It's good.

640
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:14,446
My brother...

641
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:17,956
must like you.

642
00:47:19,616 --> 00:47:20,726
Bong Sik.

643
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:23,026
Do you like that woman?

644
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,096
He must really like you.

645
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:39,776
Bye.

646
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:43,506
Bye.

647
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:48,186
You go that way. I will go this way.

648
00:47:48,346 --> 00:47:50,086
This is my house.

649
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,155
Why would I go that way?

650
00:47:54,156 --> 00:47:56,725
Were you not on your way to somewhere?

651
00:47:56,726 --> 00:47:57,726
Oh, right.

652
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:02,396
Do you want to go with me?

653
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:05,896
I need someone to carry stuff for me.

654
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:09,106
All right.

655
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:32,872
What does he have in mind?

656
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:36,042
He cleaned up when I
didn't even ask for it.

657
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:40,482
Let's see. Will they have...

658
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:43,282
fresh Korean beef today?

659
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,852
Hey, punk. Where have you been?

660
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:54,792
Long time no see, Chun Sool.

661
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,662
Try this. It's buy 2 get 1 free.

662
00:49:32,832 --> 00:49:34,072
Let us buy this.

663
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:35,932
Just one.

664
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:40,142
Is this all right?

665
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,512
This presses on my acupuncture points.

666
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:49,652
It releases all my fatigue.

667
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:52,181
It feels like paradise.

668
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:53,682
It feels good.

669
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,192
That.

670
00:50:01,062 --> 00:50:03,462
- Do you mean English?
- Yes, the letters.

671
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:16,112
I have been wondering,

672
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:19,088
but was this language
created by the descendants?

673
00:50:19,112 --> 00:50:20,711
That's called English.

674
00:50:20,712 --> 00:50:23,182
It's a universal language.

675
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,582
Universal language.

676
00:50:28,052 --> 00:50:30,392
Come to think of it, you
knew how to read Korean.

677
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,962
Who taught you that?

678
00:50:34,262 --> 00:50:36,531
My father taught me the Chinese
letters when I was young.

679
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,208
Then my mother taught me Korean language.

680
00:50:38,232 --> 00:50:40,001
Thanks to my knowledge in Chinese,
I was able to read medical books.

681
00:50:40,002 --> 00:50:42,272
I wondered why I had to learn Korean.

682
00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:44,502
I did not know I would use it in here.

683
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:48,242
I guess she predicted this to happen.

684
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,712
Don't you think your parents will
be worried about you from there?

685
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,212
They passed away when I was young.

686
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:57,052
My father passed away on
a road when I was 10.

687
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,382
My mother passed away due to
her illness when I was 12.

688
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,322
The doctor said...

689
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,492
that a cow bezoar would treat her illness.

690
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:13,102
It seems like cow bezoars
are common in here.

691
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,802
People will not die in
vain like my mother did.

692
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:22,312
My parents died when I was young too.

693
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:25,542
Still, you have your grandfather.

694
00:51:26,312 --> 00:51:27,912
He may look ill-tempered on the outside,

695
00:51:28,312 --> 00:51:30,852
but he seems to love his
granddaughter dearly.

696
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,392
I see...

697
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:39,022
that you have bad feelings
towards your grandfather.

698
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,731
But you have not left that place.
You must still care for...

699
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,862
You've only seen us for a few days.

700
00:51:46,502 --> 00:51:48,602
You should be good to my grandpa.

701
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:50,332
Don't trouble him.

702
00:51:57,982 --> 00:51:59,042
What?

703
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:02,682
Are you letting me stay in his house?

704
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:04,782
I will be good.

705
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,391
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

706
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:12,191
You wench, why did you have to
bring me to this shabby place?

707
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,821
Do you want to save your money that bad?

708
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:15,662
What will you do with the money you saved?

709
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:17,131
Will you...

710
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:19,731
be so free and spend all
that money after I die?

711
00:52:19,732 --> 00:52:21,931
Stop complaining.

712
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:23,371
They say it's well-known
for its treatments.

713
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:25,102
You wench.

714
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,212
Are you here to visit the oriental clinic?

715
00:52:30,842 --> 00:52:32,941
Oh, my. Well, yes.

716
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,282
Nurse Jung called me.

717
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,452
She heard our circumstances
and recommended this place.

718
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:41,391
She said I'd meet someone I know there.

719
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,152
It was you.

720
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:44,968
She's my mother-in-law.

721
00:52:44,992 --> 00:52:47,438
My husband died in an accident,

722
00:52:47,462 --> 00:52:49,231
so I'm taking care of her alone.

723
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,932
She became paraplegic a few years ago.

724
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:54,372
She can't move an inch without any help.

725
00:53:08,312 --> 00:53:09,981
We've been to hospitals.

726
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:12,882
She got acupuncture in
several oriental clinics.

727
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,192
But she's not getting any better.

728
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,352
She is old and weak.

729
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:44,652
I think it will be better to
stick a needle deeply at once.

730
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:51,362
Do you mind if I try?

731
00:53:56,762 --> 00:53:59,702
Let's wait and see what choice he makes.

732
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:06,602
Hey.

733
00:54:08,242 --> 00:54:09,812
She's an important patient.

734
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:39,272
Sir, you can't let him...

735
00:54:40,102 --> 00:54:41,512
Stay still.

736
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,142
She is important.

737
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:45,342
Please do well.

738
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:21,951
She's sensing the needle.

739
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:26,782
Patients feel a twinge when they
sense the needle accurately.

740
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:29,752
It's like they're electrified.

741
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,932
You did well in enduring the pain.

742
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:39,562
Here.

743
00:55:42,002 --> 00:55:43,702
- What?
- What?

744
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:47,672
Goodness.

745
00:55:49,872 --> 00:55:51,782
Oh my goodness. Mother.

746
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:56,612
Oh my goodness. Thank you.

747
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,291
My goodness.

748
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,722
Mother! Mother! Mother!

749
00:56:03,852 --> 00:56:06,122
Mother!

750
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:13,338
- Oh, no!
- Goodness.

751
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:15,872
I can't live without her.

752
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,341
Please save my daughter-in-law.

753
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:19,872
Calm down.

754
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:26,742
Min Jae.

755
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:29,188
I think Patient Jo is
suffering a blocked artery.

756
00:56:29,212 --> 00:56:31,822
Thankfully, she's breathing.

757
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:33,782
Come here with an ambulance.

758
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:48,202
She told me to get a surgery and
that she could do fine without me.

759
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:50,202
She insisted so much.

760
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:54,042
But she fell down while
I was in the hospital.

761
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:56,112
She hurt her back.

762
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:02,282
You may think the most important
thing is saving people's lives.

763
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:06,252
But if something happens
to me during the surgery,

764
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:08,492
she'll be left alone...

765
00:57:09,322 --> 00:57:11,422
without anyone to rely on.

766
00:57:19,162 --> 00:57:21,102
What? Was there an accident?

767
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:30,441
- I need to go out.
- What?

768
00:57:30,442 --> 00:57:32,682
- Keep an eye on her.
- Okay.

769
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:40,252
No...

770
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:46,992
- My leg...
- Gosh.

771
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,992
My leg.

772
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:02,371
My leg.

773
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:05,712
I think he's really hurt. Are you a doctor?

774
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:07,482
Yes.

775
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,182
My leg.

776
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:15,652
Don't move.

777
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:22,832
My leg.

778
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,162
Are you okay?

779
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:48,852
What is wrong?

780
00:58:50,392 --> 00:58:52,362
Is it happening to you again? Look at me!

781
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:28,162
Someone who appeared in your life recently.

782
00:59:35,402 --> 00:59:37,002
Gosh, you look terrible.

783
00:59:37,502 --> 00:59:39,502
Let us go somewhere so
I can read your pulse.

784
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:42,212
Whether it is acupuncture or moxa,
I will do everything I can.

785
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:44,412
It is because of you.

786
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:49,052
It is all because of you.

787
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,662
After all that I did to get here.

788
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:05,402
I don't want to see you anymore.

789
01:00:10,532 --> 01:00:11,772
Do not be like this.

790
01:00:17,482 --> 01:00:19,242
Get out of my sight.

791
01:00:21,482 --> 01:00:22,612
Please.

792
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:35,162
Gosh, that woman.

793
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:42,432
Get out of my sight.

794
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:36,192
You'll be staying in
this place if you like.

795
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:40,991
Why would you...

796
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:43,191
You mentioned about scouting...

797
01:01:43,192 --> 01:01:46,032
No, recognizing peoples'
talents before, right?

798
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:49,872
To hire competent people, you
need to offer this much.

799
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,271
Then... Are you saying you will...

800
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:54,972
You're such a competent person.

801
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:58,712
You shouldn't be staying in
that shabby oriental clinic.

802
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:03,612
You came all the way here from Joseon.

803
01:02:04,082 --> 01:02:06,922
Then you should achieve your
goal in a bigger world.

804
01:02:07,992 --> 01:02:09,152
Don't you think so?

805
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:20,108
Patient Jo's surgery went well.

806
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:21,602
Okay.

807
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:26,102
Jae Sook took escorted the
old lady to her house.

808
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:27,872
I see.

809
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:33,882
- Well...
- Yes?

810
01:02:34,982 --> 01:02:36,112
What?

811
01:02:39,352 --> 01:02:40,522
Nothing.

812
01:02:52,362 --> 01:02:54,202
I hope he keeps him safe...

813
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:56,472
and sends him back.

814
01:02:58,572 --> 01:03:00,142
I hope he does.

815
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:23,162
Get out of my sight, please.

816
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:33,038
You really don't know?

817
01:04:33,062 --> 01:04:36,132
I don't. He doesn't have a mobile phone.

818
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:38,342
Can I go home after organizing this?

819
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,642
The director didn't say anything...

820
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,582
and we didn't hear from him for a few days.

821
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:46,942
Maybe he didn't like this place.

822
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:49,552
He should have said goodbye
if he was leaving.

823
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:52,352
- I'm sad.
- You're right.

824
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,691
You feel empty...

825
01:04:54,692 --> 01:04:55,992
when someone leaves.

826
01:04:56,822 --> 01:04:58,022
Were you sad?

827
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:00,862
Really?

828
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,591
You'll feel sad when I leave.

829
01:05:03,592 --> 01:05:07,002
- Okay.
- How could you feel sad for him?

830
01:05:07,772 --> 01:05:10,172
You only knew him for a few days.
Wait and see when I leave.

831
01:05:11,902 --> 01:05:12,902
Is he here?

832
01:05:27,892 --> 01:05:31,361
(Shinhae Oriental Medicine Hospital)

833
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:33,792
(The opening ceremony of the VIP ward)

834
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:35,292
Thank you.

835
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,001
We ambitiously prepared...

836
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:42,332
the VIP ward of Shinhae
Oriental Medicine Hospital.

837
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,178
Based on our long history
of medical technology...

838
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:48,518
and excellent personnel,

839
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:52,582
this ward will become the stepping stone...

840
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:56,458
of upgrading the level
of oriental medicine,

841
01:05:56,482 --> 01:05:58,362
and become a worldwide
oriental medical center.

842
01:06:11,932 --> 01:06:13,862
Next, Dr. Yoo.

843
01:06:19,572 --> 01:06:22,342
Hello, I'm Yoo Jae Ha.

844
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:33,851
The players are exceptional here.

845
01:06:33,852 --> 01:06:34,852
Yes.

846
01:06:36,052 --> 01:06:38,761
We still have one more person left.

847
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:40,632
Really?

848
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:42,762
He's coming.

849
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:17,761
I am sorry, I am a little late.

850
01:07:17,762 --> 01:07:19,031
You're just in time.

851
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:20,432
Okay, introduce yourself.

852
01:07:28,642 --> 01:07:29,812
Nice to meet you.

853
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:33,442
I am oriental medicine doctor, Heo...

854
01:07:37,112 --> 01:07:38,322
Bong Tak.

855
01:08:14,152 --> 01:08:17,092
(Live Up To Your Name, Dr.
Heo/Deserving of the Name)

856
01:08:17,592 --> 01:08:20,062
Heo Im, you became a different person.

857
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:22,331
Heo Im came.

858
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,031
What will you do this time?

859
01:08:24,032 --> 01:08:25,501
What does he have to do with you?

860
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,932
I'm getting to know him.

861
01:08:28,632 --> 01:08:31,041
I'm playing games? With whom?

862
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:34,041
I will walk the path that I could
not walk when I was there.

863
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:35,612
This must be stress.

864
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:38,181
Will a strong background win? Or skill?

865
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:41,111
Why did you let him in
here in the beginning?

866
01:08:41,112 --> 01:08:43,628
I will become a doctor who becomes
happy when he saves lives,

867
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,652
and glad when he heals people.
