LEFT BEHIND

2
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,186
Hello.

3
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,229
Hi Mom!

4
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:27,608
Chloe, welcome home.
You're home, right?

5
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:29,475
Yup, safe and sound.

6
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:31,435
Your brother has been bouncing off the walls.

7
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,886
Oh, I can't wait to see him.

8
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:37,411
So, is everything up for
dad's surprise party?

9
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,832
Um, Honey, I'm afraid your dad's not
gonna be here when you get home.

10
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:42,823
What?

11
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,295
Why not? Mom, what happened?

12
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,266
He got called in to work.

13
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:52,688
Did you tell him I was coming?
- Yeah, Honey, I did but...

14
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,575
They called this morning
and, eh...

15
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:55,670
What is his flight?

16
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,373
It's London.
-3:35?

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,056
Honey, don't make it hard...
-Tell Raymie I'll be home before supper.

18
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,097
You must feel like
you've seen it all.

19
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:28,081
You seemed to be in the middle of a new disaster
every time I turned on the news.

20
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:32,169
Oh, what is the old adage?
'It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it'.

21
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,911
Can I ask you a question,
Mr. Williams?

22
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:35,986
Yeah, sure.

23
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,998
Do you read the Bible?
-Well...

24
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,003
I guess not as often
as you do.

25
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:48,990
Well, Matthew 24:7 says there shall be famines,
pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places.

26
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,056
All of these things, the disasters, the wars,
they are all signs.

27
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:56,227
So, God knew all these things
were going to happen?

28
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:58,135
Honey, God knows everything.

29
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,971
So, why didn't He do something?

30
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:05,987
I mean, He is God, right?
Couldn't He stop the flood if He wanted to?
Maybe, sent a little rain for the famine...

31
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:11,118
It's a fallen world. God created it perfect
and we destroyed it on the first set...

32
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,162
Who destroyed it? Me?...

33
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,196
You? Him?

34
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,209
The Lord works...
-... in mysterious ways, I know.

35
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:24,258
But somehow, people keep believing
He loves them. Now, that is mysterious.

36
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,204
Sorry to interrupt.

37
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:28,276
Going my way?

38
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,339
I enjoyed your speech.

39
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,313
Yeah, sorry about that ...
- Now, don't be.

40
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,325
That was really good.

41
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,151
I'm assuming it's not your first time
making it.

42
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,228
Well, the first time aloud.
-Cameron Williams.

43
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,262
'Buck'... my friends.

44
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,385
I'm...eh, Chloe Steele.

45
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,324
'Chloe' to my friends.

46
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,131
So, you're in college.

47
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:29,198
Wow, that investigative journalism.
it really pays off.

48
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:33,192
I just wanted to say thank you
for rescuing me from that nutty lady.

49
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:34,422
Oh, thank my mom.

50
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:36,414
She, as you would,
have been rehearsing for it.

51
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,292
Oh, is she... pretty?

52
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,294
Nutty...

53
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:50,148
Actually, I was looking through the thesaurus I've found
this morning, I've decided to go with 'Wacko'.

54
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,254
Wacko?

55
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:54,246
I like that word, 'Wacko'.

56
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:58,365
Can I buy you a coffee?

57
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,431
No, no, I'm fine.

58
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,235
Come on!

59
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:08,324
What if I throw in one of those fantastic
little boxes with the strawberry jam...

60
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:12,297
Oh, my God...
Wow, well, that is... that's tempting.

61
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,423
Yes? .
- Hmm hmm.

62
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:18,408
But I'm waiting for someone, and he
should be here any minute.

63
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,477
My Dad.

64
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,191
I flew home to surprise him
for his birthday, but...

65
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,193
...something came up.

66
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:44,385
Well, have a safe flight...

67
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,339
Hi, sweet heart!
-Hi!

68
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:56,252
What are you doing here?
-Well, I came home to surprise you
on your birthday.

69
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,349
Honey, I just got called in.
There's no way I can get out of it now.

70
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,415
Yeah, that's what mom said...
-I wished that you would've told me
you would be coming.

71
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,431
Oh wait... you, you're Cameron Williams,
Holy cow...

72
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:10,372
So you two?
-Oh, we just met.

73
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:12,416
Hi, it's a pleasure, Captain.
- Ray.

74
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,298
Well, I'm gonna let you two catch up, yeah.
And eh... it was really nice to meet you, Chloe.

75
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,457
You look great.
- Thank you.

76
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,407
Let's talk somewhere.

77
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:26,504
How was school?
- It's Good.

78
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:28,517
Good, yeah...

79
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:34,523
What?

80
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:39,404
You know the first thing I thought
when mom told me you're not gonna be home?

81
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:40,540
It's that you left.

82
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:48,518
I mean, really left. Just packed up your bags,
slammed the doors, squealed the tyres
and just drove off.

83
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,490
Your mom and I are fine, Chloe.

84
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:55,401
It's okay, I don't blame you.

85
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,466
You don't blame me for what?
- For running away.

86
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,480
But I didn't run away.
You said, you thought I run away.

87
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,516
Who is that girl?
- What girl?

88
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:10,428
That flight attendant,
beautiful, blonde one.

89
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,433
Flight attendant...
I worked with dozens of flight attendants.
.

90
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:17,477
Don't even know her name.

91
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:26,497
If this was a year ago, you know before
mom drank with collate, you'd be home by now.

92
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:30,512
We would be all be home,
like a family or something.

93
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:36,373
Chloe, I... I think you know that your mom and
I got married when we were both very young...

94
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:41,368
...and the changes that a person goes through
between 20 and 50 are enormous.

95
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:47,500
She's just doing what she believes is right
and maybe you should cut her some slack.

96
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:52,495
Me?... How about you?
You're the one on the way to London.

97
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,394
You are a one who has not been home
since Christmas.

98
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,553
I  have school .
- And I have a job.

99
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:02,600
I just feel like she's always trying
to shove it down my throat.

100
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:09,451
I know... Look, I know that this past year,
has been something of an adjustment, but...

101
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:14,436
She is your mother, and I think it'd be good
if you, no, if we both...

102
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,626
...could be a little more supportive.

103
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:21,569
You missed her...
- Yes, I do.

104
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:26,418
But hey, if she's gonna run off with another man,
why not Jesus, huh?

105
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,495
Where is your ring?

106
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:39,609
It's in my car.
I never wear it when I fly.

107
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:47,462
Chloe, your mom means the world to me,
I'm not going to do anything to mess it up.
Okay?

108
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:51,466
And I have to go.
We'll talk when I get back.

109
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:53,614
Not gonna be here
when you get back.

110
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:57,452
Oh, but you'll gonna be back home
again soon, right?

111
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,518
Here...

112
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:05,492
The car is in the usual spot,
and go easy on mom.
She'll come around.

113
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,475
I love you.

114
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,634
Are you okay?

115
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:44,577
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

116
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,556
Investigative journalist, remember?

117
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:57,612
Right.
- Yeah.

118
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,687
So...

119
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,763
I'm just a little disappointed,
that's all.

120
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:16,644
It was a big deal to me.
All of us together, having a good time.

121
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,584
Well, I'm sure you would have stayed
if he could.

122
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,768
The turkey... a vulture

123
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,669
...comes up to the gate and dropped two dead rabbits onto the floor.

124
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:33,714
And the flight attendant says...
"I'm sorry...

125
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,624
...we only allowed one carrier."

126
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:39,596
I'm sorry Captain, that's bad.

127
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,526
That is always funny.

128
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,728
Well, if you have anymore bad jokes,
you can always come and find me.

129
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,762
Hey Marcus, they got that computer problems figured out?

130
00:11:57,762 --> 00:12:02,538
Negative that, Pentagon,
apparently, some of the equipment on the flight deck are outdated.

131
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:07,710
Yeah, you had me flying east, in
6 hours time, I would be 9 hours older.

132
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:12,652
Do that for about 6 years and maybe
you'll catch up to me. Happy Birthday Buddy,
Have a good flight.

133
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,790
Thanks.

134
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,807
Sounds like that's all
your mom talks about.

135
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,810
Seems like it sometimes.

136
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:31,831
Hate someone who sees earthquake
on the news and then tries to
convince everyone it's a good thing.

137
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,698
Does that make sense to you?

138
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:40,841
The day after Tsunami,
there's that one woman, Medina.

139
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:45,867
She lost three of her four children in that wave,
dragged down to the sea while she watched.

140
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:50,800
It was all she could do was to hold on to a tree
with a six-week old baby in her arms.

141
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:58,819
And she was so sure that God
had saved her and the baby
that she went straight to her knees.

142
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:03,605
She thanked Him.

143
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,858
She thanked Him for
killing the others?

144
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:16,714
She's got the chance, that night she refused
to leave the evacuation and
after all God was watching over her.

145
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,821
And....
- Mudslide...

146
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,743
Buried the whole village
under 10-feet of slime.

147
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:27,872
How do people see some things 'like that',
and just...

148
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:32,783
If you look hard enough, you'll see
whatever it is you're looking for.

149
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:37,664
But you might have to ignore
a lot of other things to do it.

150
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,710
One of them...

151
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,900
...might be the truth.

152
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,872
And what about you?

153
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,844
What did you see in that village?

154
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:57,801
I saw a lot of people who'd lost everything
that ever mattered.

155
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,722
Did you ask why?

156
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,838
I know why.

157
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,914
Tsunami.

158
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:07,801
You know what I mean.

159
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,888
No, No, I didn't.

160
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:15,904
If you had to find a reason for something
like that to happen, then...

161
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,909
Well, You might end up behind
a stranger at the airport?

162
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,727
Oh...

163
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:28,929
Love that laugh.
- Oh, no.

164
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:34,946
What?

165
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:38,908
Oh, just thinking about Ray's joke.
That guy cracks me up.

166
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,829
Ray? You mean Captain Steele?

167
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:45,770
Only infront of other people.

168
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:47,835
Really?

169
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,848
So, you two are...?

170
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,751
No, not yet.

171
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:59,733
But, we're planning on spending
some time together
in London.

172
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,965
Really?
Why didn't you tell me?

173
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,800
Hey, wait...
where are you going?

174
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:06,772
Ah, some details, please...

175
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,819
I really needed someone
to talk to today.

176
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,987
Thank you.

177
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,927
I'm going to call you
from London.

178
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,753
Really?
- Really.

179
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:21,747
I'm gonna make sure you
won't forget about me, right?
- Right, right.

180
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,752
I'm sure you've got a girl at every airport.
Do you call all of them?

181
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:26,774
None of them, actually.

182
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:27,994
Chloe.

183
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:29,923
Oh, hi, Jim.

184
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,760
I got these things for your dad.

185
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,969
They're for tomorrow night.

186
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:39,037
U2. Wow.

187
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,008
These can't be easy to get.

188
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,752
You're telling me.
It took me two weeks to find these things.

189
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,797
Two weeks?

190
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,909
Chloe, I'm sorry...

191
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,809
Mr. Williams, please.

192
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,790
I'm coming, sorry.

193
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:02,855
Chloe, I ..

194
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,966
Would you give these to my dad, please?

195
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,771
Of course.

196
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,890
Well, you...

197
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,792
Excuse me...
- Thanks.

198
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:28,039
Mr. Williams, please...
- Sorry.

199
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,963
Excuse me, Captain.

200
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:47,853
Chloe asked me to
give you these.

201
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:53,088
You are the GWN guy, right?

202
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,903
GWN guy...
Yeah, that's me.

203
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,917
Cameron Williams, Chris Smith...
Hi, pleased to meet you.

204
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,075
Pleased to meet you.

205
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:08,984
Welcome aboard
Pancon flight 257 to London.

206
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,956
Flight time today will be
6 hours and 30 minutes.

207
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,146
Thank you and enjoy Your flight.

208
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:17,963
So, did you get her number?

209
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:26,013
Come on... I saw you two at the lounge
about an hour ago and you happened to be
the last person to get on the plane.

210
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:30,153
And to think, I could have spend
the last time with you instead.

211
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:36,191
I do not know why you uncaring guys
always wanted to get the girls.
.

212
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:40,143
Maybe because we do not want to go around
like a dress rehearsal for Glee.

213
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,148
You know what, I'm must say
right on that one.

214
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,954
I will have to thank you though
for flying first class.

215
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,988
No need to thank, man.

216
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:52,198
But, that guy who's sitting tight
back there...

217
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,002
Now, you should.

218
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,150
I know you!

219
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:09,040
Look, George. It's Frank Sinatra!

220
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,136
What's that?
- It is Frank...

221
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:12,241
Oh!

222
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,212
Listen , George.

223
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,986
We're home!

224
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,262
Oh...we're not home.

225
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:26,267
Sometimes he gets a bit confused.

226
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:38,155
Good afternoon, this is your Captain Rayford Steele
on flight Pancon 257, weather conditions
are reported to be good.

227
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:44,204
So, will be a nice smooth flight all the way to London.
Please sit back and enjoy our excellent service.

228
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:50,210
We will be serving complimentary
drinks and snacks shortly.
So, please sit back and relax.

229
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:55,049
No Johnny, you don't have to tell them anything.
Just do what you do best.

230
00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:00,200
Stall 'em! But if you see one thing that
makes you think they smell an acquisition...

231
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,110
Dish it all.

232
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,247
Look!

233
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:11,254
I left the company jet in Houston.
I'll be in London and with the paper signed
before they know that I'm gone.

234
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:14,268
We'll go and get.
Good!

235
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,167
Chloe, Chloe!

236
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,065
Hey! Come here!

237
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:49,098
Oh God, Oh my goodness!

238
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,173
You are so big!

239
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,082
Ok.

240
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,220
Did you get me anything
at the airport?

241
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:58,233
Well, you'll just have to
wait and see.

242
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,092
Alright, check it out in there
and see what you've got.

243
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:05,199
The new baseball gloves that
I've been asking for!

244
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,202
No way! Mom!

245
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:09,371
Chloe is here!

246
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,251
Mom, Chloe is here!

247
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,172
She is here, mom!

248
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:22,135
Hi!
- Hey...

249
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:24,210
My Gosh...

250
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,349
Oh, you look beautiful.

251
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,288
Wow.

252
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,155
So,

253
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,252
Um, can I get you
something to drink?

254
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,098
Yeah... Yeah...
Sure.

255
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,133
Mom... mom... Chloe got me a brand new
baseball gloves. See?

256
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,265
6 hours to London.
Nobody laughing at that too.

257
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:58,154
The Hyperjet...
that'll change everything.

258
00:21:58,154 --> 00:21:59,342
Oh yeah?
Why is that?

259
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:01,376
The Defence Deartment.

260
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:07,289
Did you say the Defence Department?
- Yeah.

261
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:12,148
It seems that they've been
developing a new jet, ok?
It'll carry 300 passengers at Mach 40...

262
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,276
New York to London...6 minutes.

263
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:17,195
6 minutes?
- 6 minutes.

264
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:20,282
That's pretty fast.
- Personally, I think they're lying.

265
00:22:20,324 --> 00:22:22,316
Yeah, I think that's
a good guess.

266
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:25,455
There's no way they can develop themselves.
I'm guessing they...

267
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:28,197
...referred engineering
from something else.

268
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:30,335
Probably something from Area 51.

269
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,182
Yeah.

270
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,361
Scotch, please!

271
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:39,449
So, was your dad surprised?

272
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,401
Yeah. I think he was.

273
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,175
Must have meant
a lot to him.

274
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:48,271
He seemed very upset that
he had to leave.

275
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,316
Yeah, I could tell.

276
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,454
So, how was your flight?

277
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:56,291
Good.
Yeah, it was good.

278
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:58,366
School?

279
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,347
It's fine.

280
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,280
Hey, you'll eh...
you'll never guess who I met
at the airport.

281
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,510
Buck Williams.

282
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,482
Sorry, Cameron Williams.

283
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,422
From the news?
- Yeah!

284
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:13,330
Really?
- Hm-hmm.

285
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:15,364
Did you get a chance
to talk to him?

286
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,345
I did... actually.

287
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,472
Erm, he is...

288
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,485
He is a great guy.

289
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:25,291
Hmm, so just happens
to be gorgeous.

290
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,294
Yes...

291
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:28,389
I told him that you were a fan.

292
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,494
Oh!

293
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:36,345
By the way, you're not the only one who thinks
every earthquake will be the end of the world.

294
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:39,515
Some crazy lady cornered him
at the airport.

295
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:47,378
That's not how
I learnt that .

296
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:51,497
Anyway, Hmm...

297
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:55,283
He is a great guy.

298
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:00,424
Chloe, honey...

299
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,532
I don't mean to push.

300
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,472
I know it must feel that way.

301
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:11,321
I just want you to understand.

302
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:13,459
It's important to me.

303
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,388
So are you.

304
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:17,526
I just want you to be ready.

305
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:19,466
Ready for what?

306
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,572
You know...

307
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:23,439
Never mind.

308
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:27,318
Can we just talk without
you cutting me off?

309
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:29,373
Mom, I just got here.

310
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:32,386
I'm not really up for a
heavy conversation.

311
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,339
Ok, sure...
But just hear me out.

312
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:37,569
Just a little.

313
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:44,316
I've been praying for you to come home
and I believe that's why God
brought you here.

314
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:45,588
What did you say?

315
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,321
God brought me home?

316
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:51,386
God did not bring me home,
I brought me home.

317
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:53,566
I bought the ticket,
I got on on the flight.

318
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:56,402
God had nothing to do with it.

319
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,602
And let me ask you something.

320
00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:00,417
If God brought me home
for dad's birthday...

321
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,607
Then why did He let him
fly off to London?

322
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,695
Maybe it's important
for us to talk.

323
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,769
I don't think so.

324
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:13,400
One thing I do know for sure,
God is the reason dad is not here
right now.

325
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,491
Chloe!

326
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,481
I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

327
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:46,541
Can I give you a hand
with your bag?

328
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,606
Did I ask for a hand?

329
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:51,536
I, I can put it on the top
for you.

330
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:53,497
Yeah?
So could I!

331
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:06,615
What are you looking at?

332
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,525
Want to ask me
a question?

333
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:12,465
Wonder how I drive?

334
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:15,469
Maybe, where I buy
my clothes?

335
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,472
How do I reach the urinal?

336
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:20,537
What is a urinal?

337
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,512
That's my dad.

338
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:28,587
He plays football.

339
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:30,590
That's nice, kid.

340
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:34,605
He's going to be on TV tomorrow
if his arm felt better.

341
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,608
Your dad plays ball on TV?

342
00:26:38,484 --> 00:26:39,537
What team?

343
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,457
Gooo...Jets!

344
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:46,566
Oh. What's wrong with his arm?

345
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:48,630
Cosmo.
He's my dog.

346
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,612
He knocked daddy off
the hammock.

347
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,541
Oh, really?

348
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,722
Daddy was so mad.
He pushed Cosmo onto the floor.

349
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:58,589
What did I tell you about
bothering other passengers?

350
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,653
Sorry...

351
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:11,583
So, you're a bad man.

352
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:13,512
Yup.

353
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:15,723
You're gonna give
the kid a cut?

354
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:21,531
Her dad's PK Carvell.
Doubt she needs the money.

355
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:27,715
Where are you going?

356
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:30,479
Out!
- Can I come?

357
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,688
Raymie, not now!

358
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,701
Please.

359
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:39,562
Alright, get your stuff.
- Awesome!

360
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:03,682
Can we go to the mall?
- Yes, we can.

361
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:08,531
I heard there's 80% off
for Games stuff.

362
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,555
Do you think
mom is crazy?

363
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:21,618
What?

364
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,756
No.

365
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:26,634
No, I was just upset.

366
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:33,705
Dad says pastor Bruce
was washing her brains.

367
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,780
Oh, that's just a joke.

368
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,782
It is?

369
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,858
I don't get it.

370
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,571
Neither do I..

371
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,712
So this is kinda sucked.

372
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:13,603
What is that?
- Got to fly on your birthday?

373
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:15,730
Well, you have gotta
pay the bills, right?

374
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:18,629
So how long is Chloe
going to be in town?

375
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,894
Well, looks like smooth sailing.

376
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:26,847
I wanna stretch my legs and see
how's the crew is doing.

377
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:39,917
Raymie, what are you trying to do?
Scare me to death!

378
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,055
What was that?

379
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:45,068
Come on.
- Can I have it?

380
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,196
No you can't.
- Only a few hundred dollars.

381
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,937
NO!

382
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:04,006
I got 'em.

383
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:16,019
I'm going to find a way
to pay you back.

384
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:21,139
What's wrong?
- No...

385
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:25,206
I just thought the seats should be
a liitle closer to the stage.

386
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,085
Coffee?
- Uhuh..

387
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:53,237
She'll be ok.

388
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,000
Huh?

389
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,981
Mom.

390
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:03,228
She still wears that necklace, you know.
The one you made her.

391
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,158
She never takes it off.

392
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:13,009
They're gonna be alright, right?
Mom and dad?

393
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:15,220
Hmm? Yes, yes of course.

394
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:19,089
Dad's being called in to work,
he's got something to do, ok?

395
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,227
Did dad tell you about
my game?

396
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:23,031
Are you kidding me?

397
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:25,002
You're all we talk about.

398
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:28,234
He said that you were the greatest baseball
player in the whole world.

399
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:30,205
And you know what?
- What?

400
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,114
He is right.

401
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,087
I love you.

402
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,098
I miss you, buddy.

403
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:05,307
No, it is not possible.

404
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,051
Allahu Akbar!

405
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:20,146
Kathy?

406
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:23,285
Do you see my daughter?

407
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,312
Chris! Let me in!

408
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,274
Do you hear me?

409
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,452
Raymie!

410
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,310
Where is he?

411
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,520
Everyone sit.

412
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,489
Everyone sit down!

413
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:28,485
Sit down! Everyone sit down!

414
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,562
Hey, what's going on?

415
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:33,564
What happened?

416
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,383
Let's go!
I want some answers.

417
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:41,354
I want to see the captain!

418
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:43,585
Hey, I want to see your captain.

419
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,599
Hey, I want to see the captain!

420
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:48,372
No!

421
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:54,545
Attention, this is the captain.

422
00:35:54,618 --> 00:36:00,531
This is the captain.
All passengers take your seats
immediately.

423
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:03,555
Hey, back off!
- I want to see the captain!

424
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:05,599
Tell us what just happened?

425
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,498
We are experiencing a
decompression.

426
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:20,470
Please go to your seats,
and put on your oxygen masks.

427
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:31,451
This is so crazy.

428
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:20,682
Come on!

429
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,714
Stop it! Stop it!

430
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,601
Stop!

431
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:02,708
This is Pancon 257.
We have an emergency.

432
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:09,590
This is Pancon 257.
We have an emergency.

433
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:16,629
Mayday! Mayday! This is
Pancon heavy 257. Acknowledge!

434
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,830
Drop the pressure,
it's ok now...

435
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:31,802
Everyone on this plane
is scared to death.

436
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:34,774
I really need you
to step up your hand.

437
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:37,642
Can you do it?
- Yeah

438
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:40,656
I'm going to say something to the passengers,
watch the flight deck.

439
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:06,810
Hello. I'm Captain Steele!

440
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:13,744
I need you to remain in your seats with
your seat belts fastened.
But you can now all remove your oxygen masks.

441
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,694
What's going on?

442
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,594
My kid...
Where is my kid?

443
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:21,659
I know you all want answers,
and believe me, so do I.

444
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:24,642
And I'll do my best to get them.
But, right now...

445
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:26,748
I have to do my job so that
we're all safe.

446
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,646
Safe? Safe from what?

447
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:30,753
Sit down!

448
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,634
Safe from our own panic.

449
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,824
It is the biggest threat on
this plane right now.
.

450
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,714
Now, I'm going to ask the flight attendants
to do a head count.

451
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,686
Whatever happened to those people,
we will find them.

452
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:49,690
I haven't been able to reach anyone yet.
So, I... I don't know if...

453
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:56,635
This event was isolated to our aircraft
or others in the area have been affected,
but I promise...

454
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:57,876
As soon as I have something
to tell you...

455
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:58,805
I will.

456
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:00,713
That's it?

457
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,771
Raymie?

458
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,792
Kimmy...

459
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:49,882
Oh God .. Kimmy...

460
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,762
Kimmy is gone.

461
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,743
Ray, what is happening?
Hattie...

462
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:10,822
Hattie... you've gotta pull yourself together.
- Just hold me... just hold me.

463
00:41:10,863 --> 00:41:12,886
Hattie... look at me,
look at me.

464
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:16,807
We're trained for emergencies.
We're going to do our jobs.

465
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,768
I really need to manage things here?

466
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:21,969
So, I really need you to focus.
Alright?

467
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,961
Ok?
- Ok.

468
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:25,849
Now listen...

469
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,956
I want to go back and do full check
on the manifest.

470
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:30,990
At least, find out who they are.

471
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,941
And how many of them
are missing, right?
-Ok.

472
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:37,883
Ray...

473
00:41:37,924 --> 00:41:39,009
I'm scared.

474
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,783
Aren't you?

475
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:45,798
I will be.
As soon as I have time.

476
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:32,829
Please, please help me, no one knows
where my baby has gone.

477
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:35,957
I'm sorry...

478
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:48,982
This is Cameron Williams,
reporting from flight 257.

479
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:54,040
We are somewhere over the Atlantic,
heading for London.

480
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,751
Abbout 3 hours
from JFK Airport.

481
00:42:56,886 --> 00:43:02,945
Something impossible just took place
on this plane.

482
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:07,951
Ma'am, can you tell me what you saw?

483
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,026
I don't know.

484
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:13,937
My Kids gone... disappeared

485
00:43:13,978 --> 00:43:15,105
Do you know when
it happened?

486
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:16,940
Nothing!

487
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:23,948
I was sitting here, I thought maybe I was
holding it and dropping something but...

488
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,901
Neighbour was sreaming.
I don't know.

489
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:51,040
As unbelievable this may sound,
people from over this plane
simply vanished.

490
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:58,861
Leaving their clothes and
personal possessions
and everything else...

491
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,930
Hey!

492
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:18,007
That's my brother's!

493
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:24,076
No!

494
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,190
Are you okay?

495
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:12,109
Isn't it? It can't be...

496
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,111
This is what?

497
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:17,041
No...

498
00:45:17,093 --> 00:45:19,158
I know what's going on here.

499
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,129
What do you know?

500
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:37,063
Okay.

501
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,038
It's a bad trip.

502
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:45,135
You must move on.

503
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:49,024
It's not going to last forever.

504
00:45:54,238 --> 00:45:58,076
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

505
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:20,246
Hey, hey.

506
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:22,196
It's alright.

507
00:46:23,093 --> 00:46:25,189
Let's go back to
your seat.

508
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,134
Buckle in... alright.

509
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:38,225
You're safe.
But you knew what happened.

510
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:45,211
None of this is happening.

511
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:49,205
That's okay,
we'll going to get through this.

512
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:53,345
Alright...
None of this is happening.

513
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:59,196
Why don't you relax, ok?
Sit back and relax.

514
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:02,261
Try get some sleep.

515
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:08,341
Can you tell me what you saw?

516
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:13,086
It was the same thing you did.
Doesn't look any different from
down here.

517
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,161
Oh, come on...

518
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:21,230
Anything strange before
the people vanished?
Flash or sound... anything.

519
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,088
No.

520
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:26,215
What about there?

521
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:28,196
Who was that?

522
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:31,231
I do not know, some guy!

523
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:34,297
Anything unusual about that guy?

524
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:39,146
Look, pal, there's something
unusual about all of us here.

525
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,160
Get that thing off my face.

526
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:57,239
Hi, this is the Steele's household.
Please leave your name and number.

527
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:59,116
Mom...

528
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:02,286
Mom, please pick up the phone.
I do not know what's going on.

529
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:09,273
Raymie, if you went home and
you can hear me right now.

530
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:11,369
I need you to listen, ok?

531
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:14,351
I know that you are scared
and I'm too scared.

532
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:17,219
But I really need you
to pick up the phone.

533
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:20,160
Need you to let me know
that you're okay.

534
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:22,360
I need to hear your voice.

535
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:29,180
I love you guys.

536
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:51,152
I think, we should all be
doing right now...

537
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,362
Is saying a prayer.

538
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:54,375
A prayer?

539
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:59,266
A prayer to who?

540
00:48:59,412 --> 00:49:01,351
To God.

541
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:03,437
Whose God?

542
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,357
Yours or mine?

543
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,380
Just Allah.

544
00:49:11,237 --> 00:49:13,260
You know what I think?

545
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:15,242
No.

546
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:19,309
Attention passengers...
Since we haven't reached the halfway point
I'm turning back to New York.

547
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:22,416
We'll be over JFK inside of 3 hours.

548
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,263
...

549
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:50,280
Raymie! Raymie
- Back off.

550
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,333
Hi, this is Irene Steele...

551
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:09,385
You okay?

552
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:12,325
Did you do the count?

553
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:15,423
I tried. But many of them are
not in their seats.

554
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:19,239
Maybe they're not there at all.
They're scared, Ray.

555
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:21,241
We're all scared.

556
00:50:21,314 --> 00:50:26,414
Well, Let's hope whatever it was
doesn't happen again.

557
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,426
What is that?

558
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:34,423
Charlie 1581, this is Pancon
257, do you copy?

559
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:40,377
Charlie 1581, we have an emergency situation.
Repeat, we have an...

560
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:06,531
You are approaching our flight path!
Get out there and prep the cabin!

561
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:08,533
Now!

562
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,587
All passengers, take your seats
and put seat belts on immediately!

563
00:51:29,546 --> 00:51:37,471
Charlie 1581, you're in our airspace.
I'm climbing 1,000 feet.
That is one, zero, zero, zero feet.

564
00:52:15,482 --> 00:52:16,671
Damn!

565
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:18,611
Mayday!

566
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:21,478
This is Pancon 257.

567
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,492
We have been involved in a collision.

568
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:27,527
Charlie 1581 is down.

569
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:29,664
Our Coordinates are...

570
00:52:31,646 --> 00:52:38,455
4-7...
This is an emergency situation.

571
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:45,536
We have a plane down,
It's search and rescue...

572
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:49,468
Repeat, this is an emergency.

573
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:54,588
Come on, there has to be
someone out there.

574
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:15,573
What is wrong with you?

575
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:19,755
You really believe a group of terrorists
could develop a bomb like this?

576
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,727
We are not talking about
a car bomb.

577
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:25,667
If this was a weapon,
it is not from this planet.

578
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,607
What exactly are you saying?

579
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:30,631
I'm just saying,
maybe they were abducted.

580
00:54:30,683 --> 00:54:32,675
Aliens?

581
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,719
Come on.

582
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:36,826
Can you believe this guy?

583
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:12,834
Is everything okay?

584
00:55:12,865 --> 00:55:14,628
That other plane,
did it lose people?

585
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:15,837
I don't know.

586
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:23,617
Your camera, I need you to take
a picture of the wing for the captain.

587
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:51,773
Raymie!

588
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:54,682
Raymie!

589
00:57:03,727 --> 00:57:05,719
Be careful.

590
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:12,842
Okay.

591
00:57:12,842 --> 00:57:14,781
Here's what I can get.

592
00:57:14,812 --> 00:57:16,783
Looks like we came about...

593
00:57:16,783 --> 00:57:18,984
6 inches from losing a wing.

594
00:57:18,994 --> 00:57:20,965
And the spoiler is gone.

595
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:22,936
What does that mean?

596
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:26,763
It's just gonna be a lot tougher
to slow down when we get home.

597
00:57:26,774 --> 00:57:30,872
One thing the runway at JFK is long enough.
Good thing we didn't hit the tail.

598
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,814
I guess it's our
lucky day.

599
00:58:18,977 --> 00:58:21,814
They're all gone.

600
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:27,987
Not just the babies.
The older kids too.

601
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,896
Are you sure?

602
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,837
I'm looking for my brother.

603
00:58:33,973 --> 00:58:38,008
I heard some doctors
talking a while ago.

604
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:42,044
This is not just here.

605
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:45,089
It's everywhere.

606
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,072
All over the world.

607
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:54,819
They say no one has seen a single kid
since it happened.

608
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:05,873
We either damaged some
of our computer sensors or...

609
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:13,975
Cameron, I lost the auto-pilot
Can you go to the very back and see there's
anything liquid spilling out from the wing?

610
00:59:13,986 --> 00:59:16,019
Liquid?

611
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:17,928
You mean fuel?

612
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:22,923
I want to take us up to a few thousand feet,
enter a small range, just in case.

613
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,095
Perfect.

614
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,891
We have to go back.
We have to go back.

615
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:56,136
We are going back. We're only just a few...
- No, I mean, back to where they disappeared.
I need to find my baby.

616
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:59,088
We are losing fuel. We have a little left.
We're not gonna have enough to get home.

617
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,854
What? We can't get home?!!
- We have fuel reserves.
We'll gonna be fine.

618
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:13,009
Are we on fire?!!!

619
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:18,025
We have the right to know
if we're going to die, ok?!!

620
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:20,090
No one is going to die!

621
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,926
Hey, everyone, listen up!

622
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:26,920
No one is going to die, you hear me?
- Everyone sit down, Everyone sit!

623
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:28,996
Now, captain's right.

624
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,177
As hard as it may be,
we all need to stay calm.

625
01:01:03,982 --> 01:01:06,214
We're on fire.
- Where?

626
01:01:06,214 --> 01:01:08,946
The wing on this side.
- Is the wing on fire or is the spray on fire?

627
01:01:08,988 --> 01:01:11,084
The spray. It's big.

628
01:01:12,158 --> 01:01:14,191
We'll fly afront of it.
It'll burn off.

629
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:18,978
But?
- It's fuel.

630
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,208
Fuel that we need to hang on.

631
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:24,150
Are you still going to get us back?
- Well, that depends.

632
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:29,031
If the leak is here
or here.

633
01:01:30,272 --> 01:01:32,096
So what do we do?

634
01:01:32,096 --> 01:01:36,017
Let it burn.
See what is left.

635
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:04,153
Fire is out.

636
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:07,031
Levels haven't change.

637
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:10,138
Does it mean we'll empty?
- Means we don't know.

638
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,028
And we've lost the elevators.
- The what?

639
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:21,057
The elevators. Can't climb. Looks like
we begun our decend at New York 2 hours early.

640
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:27,042
Can't believe we can't reach anyone.

641
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:29,076
You have a satellite phone?

642
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:31,078
Investigative journalist.

643
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:34,123
Pilot.

644
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:38,138
Yes, the only other plane was
the one that nearly hit us.

645
01:02:38,169 --> 01:02:41,204
Did you talk to them?
Did they lose any passengers?

646
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:43,269
I don't know about passengers.

647
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:46,084
But I do know this.

648
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,256
There wasn't anyone
flying that plane.

649
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:41,166
Excuse me. I was just thinking...

650
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,264
What if they are still here?

651
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:48,111
What?

652
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:51,114
I mean ..

653
01:03:51,323 --> 01:03:53,252
What if we just cannot see them?

654
01:03:53,283 --> 01:03:57,319
Like, you know,
if they're invisible.

655
01:03:59,175 --> 01:04:00,291
Jeez wheez.

656
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:04,139
Isn't invisible any crazier
than vanished?

657
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:07,240
Hello, this is to restore alarm.
We have detected an alarm at your premise.

658
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:10,306
Due to unusual call volume...

659
01:05:19,431 --> 01:05:22,340
(Pray)

660
01:05:53,468 --> 01:05:55,231
What do you know
about Kimmy?

661
01:05:55,272 --> 01:05:56,399
What?

662
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:58,276
How well did you know her?

663
01:05:58,317 --> 01:06:01,289
Not very. She's just a friend.

664
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:03,312
Go through her stuff.
- What stuff?

665
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:08,360
Anything. Her purse, her jacket, her ID badge.
Just go get her things and bring them in here.

666
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,487
Please
- OK

667
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:06,365
We have another aircraft in our area.

668
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:17,450
Please fasten your seat belts, Charlie 1581 you're in
our airspace. We are climbing 1,000 feet
That is one, zero, zero, zero...

669
01:09:17,475 --> 01:09:22,584
Dump the purse. Dump the purse.
Come on, just...

670
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:26,631
What are you looking for?

671
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:51,481
Either I'm going crazy, or the
world is going insane.

672
01:09:51,512 --> 01:09:54,484
What are you talking about?

673
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:01,690
I think I know where they are.

674
01:10:06,654 --> 01:10:08,771
What if we are now where
we think we are or even went?

675
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:10,481
What do you mean?

676
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:12,619
If we passed through a wormhole.
A wrinkle in the space time fabric.

677
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:17,687
Theoretically, we could be in different dimension with those people who
don't exist...

678
01:10:17,729 --> 01:10:19,501
...or they never exist?

679
01:10:19,543 --> 01:10:20,534
That is insane!

680
01:10:20,544 --> 01:10:23,673
Stop it! That's enough!
all of you!

681
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:25,779
I know what's going on here.

682
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:27,625
You do?

683
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,596
How much did they pay you?

684
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,629
What are you talking about?

685
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,601
I can't believe he
do this, she's her daughter!

686
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:36,697
Ok. Miss, I don't know
what's going on here...

687
01:10:37,813 --> 01:10:39,669
Get up!

688
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:44,779
Where did you get that?

689
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,729
You!
- Yes...

690
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:48,794
How much did they pay you?
- What?

691
01:10:48,836 --> 01:10:52,611
Where did they take her?!!!
Please! What are you talking about?

692
01:10:52,642 --> 01:10:54,801
My husband...
- Miss, please!

693
01:10:54,811 --> 01:10:56,782
Shut, just shut up!

694
01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:00,578
Ma'am, who's your husband?
Just tell us that.

695
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:03,717
Why are you doing this?
- Listen to me...

696
01:11:03,832 --> 01:11:06,731
I promise you, I've never
met your husband.
.

697
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:09,609
What is wrong with this?

698
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:11,840
Ma'am look,
I do not know what this is...

699
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:15,553
But...
- What don't I just shoot you
in the face?

700
01:11:15,595 --> 01:11:16,585
No!

701
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,830
Ray, what happened to you?

702
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,800
Why are you talking like this?

703
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:26,669
You've never spoken
about God before.

704
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,713
Where is this coming from?

705
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,747
From...

706
01:11:32,624 --> 01:11:33,781
My wife.

707
01:11:57,599 --> 01:11:58,694
Miss, please!

708
01:11:58,809 --> 01:12:00,707
Forget about him, ok?

709
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,646
He's an idiot.

710
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,816
He's not a part of anything.
Point that gun at me.

711
01:12:08,768 --> 01:12:09,925
I'm an idiot?

712
01:12:10,697 --> 01:12:11,729
What about her?

713
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:14,806
Miss, please!
Point the gun at me!

714
01:12:16,777 --> 01:12:17,809
Here you go.

715
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:20,750
Good.

716
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:24,723
Now, just tell me what you think
is going on?

717
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:26,694
He is trying to take her from me.

718
01:12:28,665 --> 01:12:30,823
He think he can buy his way
out of anything.

719
01:12:30,938 --> 01:12:33,670
He took my daughter,
and that ring.

720
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:35,839
I fell asleep...

721
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:41,679
Somebody put something in my drink.
I should have known he will find a way.

722
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:45,767
He could not have done this.

723
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:46,893
There's no way.

724
01:12:47,832 --> 01:12:51,805
This plane landed while
I was sleeping.

725
01:12:51,878 --> 01:12:54,756
He took her! He paid all of you
to lie to me.

726
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,801
I can't lose her again.
I can't...

727
01:12:57,822 --> 01:12:59,699
You need to listen to me.

728
01:13:00,773 --> 01:13:02,671
I was awake all the time.

729
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:04,830
This plane never landed.

730
01:13:04,976 --> 01:13:07,802
No one got off this plane.

731
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,846
Then where is she?

732
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:16,697
I can't lose her, I
can't, she's all I have!

733
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:21,838
You're all think I'm crazy,
what am I supposed to say?

734
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:23,882
That she just disappeared?

735
01:13:24,748 --> 01:13:25,947
I know where she is.

736
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:57,909
Pastor Barnes?

737
01:13:58,952 --> 01:13:59,984
Chloe...

738
01:14:00,787 --> 01:14:02,810
Hey....
- Oh, no...

739
01:14:02,925 --> 01:14:04,959
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

740
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:10,006
My mom and Raymie,
when I saw that they had gone,
I was sacred that God had...

741
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:14,949
He did. Chloe, just like He
promised, A blink of an eye.

742
01:14:15,992 --> 01:14:17,743
What?

743
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:18,880
It's true...

744
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,019
Then why are you still here?

745
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,809
It is in the Bible.

746
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:32,781
My parents sent me to
camp on summer, and...

747
01:14:32,823 --> 01:14:34,814
Everyone was talking about this.

748
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:41,760
They say that one day
millions of people will going to
just disappear.

749
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:42,834
Millions?

750
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:44,878
What else did they say?

751
01:14:44,878 --> 01:14:46,776
I do not remember.

752
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,882
It was a long time ago.

753
01:14:48,924 --> 01:14:51,791
Are you saying it was the devil?

754
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,012
No.

755
01:14:53,064 --> 01:14:54,930
It was God.

756
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:58,841
Don't tell me you believe this.

757
01:14:58,872 --> 01:15:00,937
It does not matter what I believe.

758
01:15:00,947 --> 01:15:03,033
Where are they?
Where did they go?

759
01:15:03,043 --> 01:15:04,816
To heaven.

760
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:11,991
PK was right.

761
01:15:12,064 --> 01:15:13,941
What do you mean?

762
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:17,007
Maybe I am really crazy.

763
01:15:17,038 --> 01:15:18,915
No, you're not.

764
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,930
She's better off without me
- Don't say that.

765
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:25,892
No, No!
Please don't!

766
01:15:25,902 --> 01:15:26,945
Please, do not!

767
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,000
Maybe, the world is better off
without me.

768
01:15:30,073 --> 01:15:32,972
You need to listen to me now,
do not do this.

769
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:35,882
You can't just give up
on her.

770
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:40,856
Do you have children,
Mr. Williams?

771
01:15:41,054 --> 01:15:42,827
No, I don't.

772
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:46,028
But I did have a mom.

773
01:15:46,904 --> 01:15:50,867
She was sick. My daddy tried everything...
doctors, pills...

774
01:15:50,971 --> 01:15:52,942
But in the end,
it didn't matter.

775
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,018
I came home from
school one day.

776
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:57,990
And I found her.

777
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:59,929
She was lying there.

778
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:03,996
Still. Don't you do that to Katie.

779
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:11,119
We may not know what happened here today
but it is not Katie's fault...

780
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:12,850
Do you hear me?

781
01:16:12,923 --> 01:16:14,049
Yes.

782
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,125
But she's somewhere out there,
right now...

783
01:16:17,845 --> 01:16:18,971
Watching us.

784
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,856
Yeah, that's good.

785
01:16:27,866 --> 01:16:28,857
Give me that.

786
01:16:41,173 --> 01:16:45,052
Hattie, this isn't about us.

787
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,888
It's about the truth.

788
01:16:48,097 --> 01:16:49,964
You need to focus on the truth.

789
01:16:50,996 --> 01:16:52,133
That truth, Ray?

790
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:55,032
Are you serious?
- Yes.

791
01:16:55,073 --> 01:16:58,045
This isn't about our past,
it's about right now.

792
01:16:58,139 --> 01:17:00,913
What's happening on this plane
right now.

793
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:03,989
This could be happening everywhere,
right now.

794
01:17:04,062 --> 01:17:08,098
So they are all in heaven.
That is your conclusions.

795
01:17:08,109 --> 01:17:11,008
Without speaking to anyone
outside of this plane.

796
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:13,980
You're gonna jump to the first explanation
that pops into your head.

797
01:17:14,011 --> 01:17:15,982
I already knew this
was coming.

798
01:17:16,983 --> 01:17:19,016
In details.

799
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:20,184
How can that be possible?

800
01:17:21,154 --> 01:17:25,107
The way it happened,
the way they disappeared...

801
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,163
Even the way their clothes
were still there.

802
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,051
Perfect details.

803
01:17:32,146 --> 01:17:34,023
How could she know that?

804
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:35,211
Think about it.

805
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:38,163
Why don't you think about this?

806
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:42,094
You lied to me about your wife.

807
01:17:43,012 --> 01:17:45,035
You lied to your wife
about this trip.

808
01:17:45,108 --> 01:17:47,100
You even lied to your
own daughter.

809
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,114
It seems that you're able to lie to
just about everybody in your life.

810
01:17:51,114 --> 01:17:54,034
And now you're asking me
to find God.

811
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,120
Hattie.

812
01:18:07,122 --> 01:18:08,217
I don't understand.

813
01:18:09,155 --> 01:18:11,147
You were here every day.

814
01:18:11,157 --> 01:18:13,191
You worked here,
you preached here.

815
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:15,037
That's not what counted.

816
01:18:15,203 --> 01:18:16,267
What do you mean?

817
01:18:16,278 --> 01:18:21,054
I knew all the words, I could
quote the chapters and the verses,
but that was not enough.

818
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:22,983
You have to believe.

819
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:25,079
Believe?

820
01:18:25,256 --> 01:18:27,123
Believe in what?

821
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:30,230
In a God that killed my father?

822
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:38,114
A God that grabbed my mother and my brother
and raised them out of this world.
A God that crashes planes and destroys cities?

823
01:18:38,145 --> 01:18:40,054
He took them to protect them.

824
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:41,149
From what?

825
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:44,058
From the darkest time in
the history of this world.

826
01:18:44,267 --> 01:18:46,259
Persecution, war...

827
01:18:46,332 --> 01:18:50,044
In 7 years of darkness,
He took them to heaven.

828
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:53,183
And what about the rest of us?

829
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:57,020
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?

830
01:18:57,052 --> 01:19:01,223
It is not about what we do, it's about
asking for forgiveness,
it's about turning our lives over...

831
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:02,255
Stop it!

832
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:08,106
The God that my mother talked about,
would never do something like this.

833
01:19:08,283 --> 01:19:10,223
Chloe, please...

834
01:19:10,316 --> 01:19:12,079
Listen to me.

835
01:19:12,287 --> 01:19:14,081
Listen to you?

836
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,031
Why should I?

837
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:18,263
You didn't even listen to you.

838
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,369
Are you okay Marshal?

839
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:41,236
Yeah.

840
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:44,312
Heard all about you.

841
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:47,253
Peacon 257.
This is dispatch.

842
01:19:48,129 --> 01:19:50,121
This is Pancon 257,
calling dispatch.

843
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:53,197
Pancon 257, This is
Marcus, are you there?

844
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:58,213
Marcus, I'm 20 minutes outside of JFK.
I had to turn around.

845
01:19:58,244 --> 01:20:00,080
How many did you lose?

846
01:20:02,395 --> 01:20:04,386
So, it is everywhere.

847
01:20:04,397 --> 01:20:06,159
The whole planet, buddy.

848
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:11,238
No one knows how many,
but millions.

849
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,177
...

850
01:20:13,177 --> 01:20:14,377
What about my family?

851
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:18,246
I need you to call Irene,
make sure they are safe.

852
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:19,226
How's your fuel?

853
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:21,353
Critical. I would be lucky to reach
the coast without ditching in.

854
01:20:21,364 --> 01:20:27,360
Listen, there are planes down everywhere,
the runway is full of birds,
there's no way you can get into JFK.

855
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:29,143
What about LaGuardia?

856
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:30,342
I'm sorry, Ray.

857
01:20:31,145 --> 01:20:32,209
So, where am I going?

858
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:33,346
You gonna have to go inland.

859
01:20:34,221 --> 01:20:36,245
Marcus, I can't go inland!

860
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:39,352
You need to tell me
when you're ready.

861
01:20:39,363 --> 01:20:43,304
Circuit is impossible, you have to talk to them.
They have to gonna clear things up for us there.

862
01:20:44,441 --> 01:20:46,172
Marcus?

863
01:20:47,184 --> 01:20:48,174
Marcus!

864
01:20:52,189 --> 01:20:59,333
JFK tower, this Pancon 257, I have a low-fuel emergency.
I need a runway. Repeat. I need a runway.

865
01:21:39,523 --> 01:21:41,316
So...

866
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,548
Is there a backup plan?

867
01:21:44,518 --> 01:21:46,489
I'm gonna level with you.

868
01:21:47,532 --> 01:21:51,359
We're not just a low on fuel,
we're low on fumes.

869
01:21:51,463 --> 01:21:55,405
JFK was the closest airport,
and I would love to have
made it that far.

870
01:21:55,572 --> 01:21:57,480
We only have one option.

871
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:00,483
I hope they clear us a runway
and hope that they do it soon.

872
01:22:00,525 --> 01:22:03,455
What about the water?
- Can't raise the nose.

873
01:22:03,455 --> 01:22:06,490
When we hit the water,
this thing is going to disintegrate.

874
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:16,438
Can't. I can't let the people back there
go down without having any chance
to undo some of their mistakes.

875
01:22:17,617 --> 01:22:18,608
Hey...

876
01:22:20,422 --> 01:22:24,426
You are Venice Baxter, aren't you?
Tom's daughter.

877
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:28,504
You probably do not remember me,
we...

878
01:22:28,535 --> 01:22:35,616
...met once at your father's office.
You were sitting right by this little
yellow desk.

879
01:22:36,554 --> 01:22:42,436
I remember thinking, this guy's place,
decorated with the best of everything...

880
01:22:42,634 --> 01:22:44,699
...but he's got this plastic little desk.

881
01:22:45,575 --> 01:22:50,486
Sitting beside him like it's the finest piece
of furniture in the room.

882
01:22:51,581 --> 01:22:54,522
Sometimes that's the only way
I got to see him.

883
01:22:55,732 --> 01:22:57,463
Well...

884
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,477
At least he was trying.

885
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,573
And I have a little girl too.

886
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:07,484
I mean, she was little.
She's married now.

887
01:23:08,454 --> 01:23:10,425
she never had
a desk in my office.

888
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:12,511
The truth is...
I was so busy.

889
01:23:13,762 --> 01:23:15,629
I hardly ever saw her though.

890
01:23:17,537 --> 01:23:23,544
You know, when all these people
disappeared, I never even thought
about her.

891
01:23:24,691 --> 01:23:30,489
I wish I could say I did,
but I was always thinking about money,
about opportunities...

892
01:23:31,605 --> 01:23:33,471
Making my next meal.

893
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:38,706
I'm sorry...

894
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,690
You know what you said
about heaven?

895
01:23:45,526 --> 01:23:46,757
As much as I want
to see her...

896
01:23:48,707 --> 01:23:51,762
When I get home,
I hope she's not there.

897
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,792
I need you try and
call Chloe for me.

898
01:24:19,668 --> 01:24:21,702
I've been trying.

899
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:27,573
The truth is...uh... I've not stopped
thinking about her since I
got on the plane.

900
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,774
I can understand that.

901
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:38,533
JFK tower, do you hear me?

902
01:24:38,637 --> 01:24:41,578
We are headed for the coast.

903
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:43,611
Our fuel is at critical.

904
01:24:43,653 --> 01:24:44,811
I need a clear runway.

905
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:48,752
I repeat, I need
a clear runway.

906
01:24:49,555 --> 01:24:50,682
Listen to me...

907
01:24:50,765 --> 01:24:52,632
I have a plane full of people here.

908
01:24:52,632 --> 01:24:54,686
I have no spoilers, no flaps,
no elevators and...

909
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:56,803
And if I run this thing right,
no reverse thrust...

910
01:24:56,876 --> 01:24:59,817
I need some room!

911
01:25:28,703 --> 01:25:30,642
Oh...

912
01:25:31,675 --> 01:25:33,583
...

913
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:36,722
Were you with her...

914
01:25:36,753 --> 01:25:39,590
When she got the concert tickets?

915
01:25:39,798 --> 01:25:42,822
I was... what can I say...

916
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:44,804
She was hurt.

917
01:25:46,743 --> 01:25:49,674
I should never have
left her today.

918
01:25:49,778 --> 01:25:50,769
You didn't know.

919
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:53,887
All I knew she came home
and see me and I left.

920
01:25:53,918 --> 01:25:56,796
I left her alone.

921
01:25:56,869 --> 01:26:00,738
God only knows what she's
been going through down there.

922
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:04,836
She loves you, Ray?
She will understand.

923
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:14,785
I can't let that be the last thing
we said to each other.

924
01:26:16,933 --> 01:26:20,739
I just...
I can't.

925
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:23,774
I need to tell her the truth.

926
01:26:23,826 --> 01:26:28,727
And I need her to know that
this wasn't her mother's fault.
It's all mine.

927
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:35,839
Every time that Irene mentioned God,
I walked away.

928
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:39,806
Mom...

929
01:27:40,974 --> 01:27:44,780
I don't know if you can hear me...

930
01:27:44,989 --> 01:27:48,753
But I just wanted to say...

931
01:27:49,817 --> 01:27:53,999
This morning, I felt like
our family was falling apart.

932
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,793
And I blamed you.

933
01:27:56,877 --> 01:28:00,944
And I know that I hurt you.

934
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,947
And I'm sorry.

935
01:28:04,927 --> 01:28:07,785
I'm so sorry.

936
01:28:26,003 --> 01:28:27,796
Hello?

937
01:28:27,838 --> 01:28:30,007
Who is this?
- Chloe...

938
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:32,020
This is Buck.
- Buck?

939
01:28:33,813 --> 01:28:36,014
Thank God, you're alive.

940
01:28:36,087 --> 01:28:37,849
Where is my dad?

941
01:28:37,891 --> 01:28:39,882
He is here.

942
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:42,855
Chloe, are you okay?

943
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:44,064
Dad...

944
01:28:44,805 --> 01:28:46,004
I thought you were dead.

945
01:28:46,035 --> 01:28:48,069
Are you okay?

946
01:28:49,987 --> 01:28:53,815
Yeah... I guess so.

947
01:28:53,992 --> 01:28:59,863
But Mom and Raymie,
they are both gone.

948
01:29:05,046 --> 01:29:07,069
Mom told me about this.

949
01:29:07,121 --> 01:29:09,957
I know, she told me too.

950
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:12,856
I love you so much,
sweetheart.

951
01:29:12,961 --> 01:29:15,933
I love you more than anything
in the world.

952
01:29:15,995 --> 01:29:19,030
Me too daddy, me too...

953
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,106
I'm so sorry I lied to you and
I wasn't there with you today.

954
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,850
I really, really need you to know
how much I love you.

955
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:27,049
No matter what happens.

956
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:30,991
Wait, dad... Why
are you talking like this?

957
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,993
What's going on?
Where are you?

958
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:37,967
Well... we still are in the air. We're
on our way home, but there is a problem.

959
01:29:38,009 --> 01:29:41,972
The airports are closed,
the roads are jammed
and there's no way to land...

960
01:29:41,982 --> 01:29:42,963
What?

961
01:29:42,983 --> 01:29:45,966
And I do not have enough fuel.

962
01:29:45,987 --> 01:29:47,958
Chloe...

963
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:50,064
Dad...

964
01:29:51,003 --> 01:29:52,911
Chloe...

965
01:30:48,128 --> 01:30:50,120
Ladies and gentlemen...

966
01:30:50,923 --> 01:30:52,185
We are coming in on New York.

967
01:30:52,226 --> 01:30:54,104
Alright...

968
01:30:56,106 --> 01:30:59,046
However, we still have
challenges ahead.
All the airports are closed.

969
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:02,144
I need you to remain in your seats...

970
01:31:02,175 --> 01:31:07,128
With your seat belts fastened,
and try to remain calm.

971
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,100
But I have to be honest...

972
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:13,938
This is a very serious situation.

973
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:19,037
We're talking to the ground, we'll try
to find an alternate landing sites.

974
01:31:19,089 --> 01:31:22,145
But we are very low on fuel.

975
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:28,026
Please pay very close attention
to our flight crew.

976
01:31:28,162 --> 01:31:31,040
And if you believe in prayer...

977
01:31:33,011 --> 01:31:35,107
Now would be the time.

978
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:40,081
Will you pray with me?

979
01:31:40,133 --> 01:31:43,106
Yes, of course.
Yeah.

980
01:31:59,029 --> 01:31:59,999
Nothing.

981
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:01,094
Still can't get signal.

982
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:02,231
Keep trying.

983
01:32:02,241 --> 01:32:04,139
I will.

984
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:07,142
Well, we'll gonna have to
put it down.

985
01:32:07,247 --> 01:32:09,218
Put it down?

986
01:32:09,249 --> 01:32:11,189
Where?
- Water...

987
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,148
But you said...

988
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:14,025
I know...

989
01:32:14,098 --> 01:32:19,062
I wait on JFK as long as I can, but
I can't fly there without a clear runway.

990
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,273
There's nothing but sitting on
every side of the airport.

991
01:32:22,044 --> 01:32:25,100
By flying in,
there's nowhere to land.

992
01:32:25,152 --> 01:32:29,177
We're flying a 400-tonne
missile right into Queens.

993
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:02,255
JFK tower, this is Pancon 257, we need
emergency clearance immediately.

994
01:33:02,297 --> 01:33:05,123
Get her back!
Keep trying.

995
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:24,155
Ok folks, I need your full attention
as we go through the emergency procedures.

996
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:37,156
Underneath your seats, you will find your life jackets.
You must keep your seat belts tightly fastened
across your waists until the plane come to a complete stop.

997
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:40,162
Then you must follow all
flight crew's instructions.

998
01:33:40,172 --> 01:33:44,302
JFK tower, This is Pancon 257, we need
emergency clearance right now.

999
01:33:44,343 --> 01:33:50,340
JFK tower. JFK tower, This is Pancon 257,
we need clearance now!

1000
01:34:04,188 --> 01:34:06,118
Come on...

1001
01:34:20,216 --> 01:34:22,156
OK.

1002
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:28,288
Buck, can you hear me?

1003
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:29,258
Chloe

1004
01:34:29,299 --> 01:34:31,333
Turn on the speakers.

1005
01:34:33,252 --> 01:34:35,306
I think I found a place for
you guys to land.

1006
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:40,291
The new East-West highway
near the mall. No one's out here. I think
I can clear enough room.

1007
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:43,263
Our guidance system is out. I won't be able
to find it in the dark.

1008
01:34:43,294 --> 01:34:47,330
Hey, Chloe, your phone...
you should open up the compass app.

1009
01:34:47,371 --> 01:34:50,208
Ok, hang on.

1010
01:34:52,189 --> 01:34:53,211
Ok, I've got it.

1011
01:34:53,242 --> 01:34:57,455
Well, you see the bottom,
those little numbers?
I need you to read those to me.

1012
01:34:58,258 --> 01:35:06,226
40.66.34 North 73.78.32 West

1013
01:35:06,278 --> 01:35:07,300
I got it.

1014
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:09,281
Chloe, how much room we've got?

1015
01:35:09,281 --> 01:35:10,449
Uh... about half a mile away.

1016
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,419
And there's more...

1017
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,359
How much more?
I need at least a mile.

1018
01:35:14,359 --> 01:35:16,351
Okay, hang on.

1019
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:46,259
Chloe... Chloe, are you still there?

1020
01:35:50,295 --> 01:35:52,297
Abbout seven-tenth.

1021
01:35:52,339 --> 01:35:54,331
Eight-tenth...

1022
01:35:54,372 --> 01:35:57,407
Buck... Buck, can you hear me?

1023
01:35:58,314 --> 01:36:00,285
Hello?

1024
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:12,538
Come on.

1025
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:19,483
You've got to be kidding me.

1026
01:36:20,495 --> 01:36:22,466
Come on!

1027
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:32,321
We need a visual of some kind,
so we can see where the landing zone begins.

1028
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:48,484
How are you?
you mind if I sit down here for a moment?
- Yes... Yes...

1029
01:36:48,515 --> 01:36:53,365
Just until your husband
comes back from the bathroom.

1030
01:37:06,556 --> 01:37:07,547
We ran out of fuel!

1031
01:37:07,589 --> 01:37:09,487
What?

1032
01:37:09,497 --> 01:37:10,550
No.

1033
01:37:10,602 --> 01:37:13,574
We can still land it.
We can glide it down.

1034
01:37:13,606 --> 01:37:19,341
But we're going to hit the ground fast.
I've no thrust to slow it down,
just the brakes.

1035
01:37:19,372 --> 01:37:22,324
We're going to need
every inch of the gas.

1036
01:37:29,467 --> 01:37:30,395
Dad...

1037
01:37:30,437 --> 01:37:31,427
Chloe...

1038
01:37:31,438 --> 01:37:32,429
Go ahead...

1039
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:37,351
I'm out of road. I'm at nine-tenth of a mile
but there're a bunch of heavy equipment
blocking my way.

1040
01:37:37,413 --> 01:37:39,384
Honey, nine-tenth
is good enough?

1041
01:37:39,415 --> 01:37:44,358
But I need a bright visual point
of referrence so that I can see where
the landing zone is.

1042
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:47,362
Okay.
I'm flashing my lights.
Can you see that?

1043
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:51,397
No, we are too far out for that, I need
a bigger light like a flare.

1044
01:37:51,408 --> 01:37:54,547
But we are running out of time.
I have to come in right now!

1045
01:37:54,588 --> 01:37:56,528
Chloe...

1046
01:38:03,598 --> 01:38:06,581
Where are your
smoke up matches?

1047
01:38:11,618 --> 01:38:13,484
There isn't enough room, is there?

1048
01:38:13,526 --> 01:38:17,353
If there isn't, I don't want her
to think it's her fault.

1049
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:42,673
This is it, we're coming down.

1050
01:38:42,714 --> 01:38:44,654
Can you see anything?

1051
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:49,493
No.
- Keep looking.
We have about three miles.

1052
01:38:58,482 --> 01:39:01,610
We've got one try.
We need to know where to start.

1053
01:39:01,652 --> 01:39:03,529
Nothing yet!

1054
01:39:03,529 --> 01:39:05,583
Come on, honey.

1055
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:13,540
There!

1056
01:39:58,746 --> 01:40:01,708
Try to lock the landing gear!

1057
01:40:23,555 --> 01:40:25,745
Dad, you've got no back wheels!

1058
01:41:18,668 --> 01:41:19,794
Oh...

1059
01:41:19,804 --> 01:41:22,641
We're home!

1060
01:41:24,883 --> 01:41:29,659
Everyone ok? I need everyone
out of the plane now.
Everyone get up!

1061
01:42:00,787 --> 01:42:03,686
One at a time.
Let's go!

1062
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:05,897
Let's go...

1063
01:42:05,928 --> 01:42:09,891
When you get to the bottom,
please get out of the way
for others.

1064
01:42:22,801 --> 01:42:24,793
Hey, hey

1065
01:42:26,733 --> 01:42:27,900
Hey!

1066
01:42:50,686 --> 01:42:52,918
Buck!
- Chloe.

1067
01:42:53,794 --> 01:42:55,858
Thank you.

1068
01:43:01,709 --> 01:43:03,867
You did a great job.

1069
01:43:05,713 --> 01:43:06,912
You too.

1070
01:43:06,912 --> 01:43:08,862
Hattie!

1071
01:43:11,866 --> 01:43:13,857
I'm sorry.

1072
01:43:14,765 --> 01:43:15,964
I know.

1073
01:43:22,982 --> 01:43:24,922
Dad...

1074
01:43:27,852 --> 01:43:29,854
I should be here with you.

1075
01:43:29,927 --> 01:43:33,775
With mom, with Raymie.
I shouldn't have left.

1076
01:43:34,745 --> 01:43:36,904
I'm just glad you're okay.

1077
01:43:40,825 --> 01:43:42,910
I thought you might want this.

1078
01:44:04,903 --> 01:44:07,740
Looks like the end of the world.

1079
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:10,816
No. Not yet.

1080
01:44:11,953 --> 01:44:14,873
I'm afraid this is
just the beginning.
