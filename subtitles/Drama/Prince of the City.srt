1
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,708
What? What is it?

2
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:39,087
The door.

3
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:43,258
There's nobody there, Danny.

4
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,993
Go on back to sleep.

5
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,686
It's okay.

6
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,439
There's nobody there.

7
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,297
Oh, Christ.

8
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:47,907
Across the street. The phone booth.

9
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:28,052
It's going down at 3.

10
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:33,057
- Don't forget me, baby face.
- Could I forget the King?

11
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,409
- Yeah.
- Three o'clock.

12
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,751
Excuse me, Alan.

13
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:02,045
- Is Gus Levy there?
- Yeah, Dom.

14
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,921
<i>Three o 'clock.</i>

15
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:11,950
<i>Three o 'clock.</i>

16
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,994
Goddamn door,
you never get used to it.

17
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:39,226
- Want me to get the door?
- No, no. I'm all right.

18
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:16,243
Hey, Gio, your cigar stand sucks,
you know that?

19
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,328
Here you go, kid.

20
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:22,708
All right, all right. Mother's milk.

21
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,817
The best is none too good.

22
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,466
Sing it to me, baby.

23
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:44,292
- Let me give you a hand.
- Hands off. That's more money...

24
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,003
...than you can spend in a lifetime.
- Touchy, touchy.

25
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:51,174
We're going back to Bogotá.

26
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:52,738
Come on, arriba, arriba.

27
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:55,449
You're starting to stink up the place.

28
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:02,539
Watch your step out there, now.
They just mopped the floor.

29
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:12,028
A star-studded night.

30
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,469
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, Your Honor.

31
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:19,014
Detective Daniel Ciello,
Special Investigating Unit, Narcotics.

32
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:22,977
Detective Gino Mascone, Special
Investigating Unit, Narcotics Division.

33
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:26,731
- You don't mind, do you, sergeant?
- No, Your Honor, not at all.

34
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,712
Counselors.

35
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,883
Ladies, will you excuse us?

36
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:35,907
Either of you gentlemen in a hurry?

37
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,096
Detective Mascone?

38
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:39,765
After you, Detective Ciello.

39
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:41,850
Well, thank you, Detective Mascone.

40
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:45,395
Your Honor... Maria, you wanna
stand up there, please?

41
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,959
Thank you.

42
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,879
Your Honor, this young lady
has nothing on under her fur coat.

43
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:51,964
The court wouldn't want
her to catch cold.

44
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:56,240
Certainly not, Detective Ciello.
It could be grounds for an appeal.

45
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,325
Step forward, please.

46
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:05,520
So I say, "Lieutenant, my team is
photographing the outside of the place.

47
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,501
Plus we got two bugs
inside the place.

48
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,151
Will you for chrissake tell your men
to put back the fucking TV sets...

49
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,132
...from where they stole them?"

50
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,933
All right, all right, you pricks.
Next time we go first.

51
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,791
One of the ho's bit the clerk.
We were there for two fucking hours.

52
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,357
Come in, detective.

53
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:53,276
Sorry I kept you waiting.

54
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,987
I'm new. I never know how long
interviews will take.

55
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,699
- It's okay, I got a light day.
- Good.

56
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:02,557
For the record, I'm District Attorney
Cappalino. Special assistant prosecutor...

57
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,372
...investigating police corruption.
- I know all about it.

58
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,666
- Chase Commission.
- I hope you're impressed.

59
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,543
Sure, I'm a cop.

60
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:14,756
Detective, you personally are under
no suspicion, no investigation here.

61
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:16,633
Why am I here?

62
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:19,866
I have to start somewhere,
so I'm starting at the top.

63
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,326
Why narcotics, counselor?

64
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,392
Willie Sutton said it. "That's where
the money is. " Sit down, detective.

65
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:29,042
Well, you know, I'd like to help.
I just don't know how.

66
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,900
- Sorry, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

67
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:37,384
Sorry, just bear with me, detective...

68
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:43,223
If anybody knows anything,
SIU should.

69
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:46,559
You guys have
city-wide jurisdiction, right?

70
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:50,522
Choose your own targets,
enforce the law or not as you see fit.

71
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,546
What was it Judge Bernstein called you?
"Princes of the City."

72
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,318
Sure, we walk on water.

73
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,612
You work virtually unsupervised.

74
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,906
Well, we're judged on results,
counselor.

75
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,764
Some of which are spectacular. One of
the reasons I'm interviewing you...

76
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,371
...is your own extraordinary career.

77
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,708
You're the leader of your unit.
Yet you...

78
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:13,983
Excuse me. Seven years younger
than the next youngest man.

79
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,780
- You know there's been talk, detective.
- About me, sir?

80
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:21,595
No, about the Special
Investigating Unit, SIU.

81
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,514
Well, Mr. Cappalino,
there's also talk about feds.

82
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,998
I would like to hear about that.

83
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,188
But for now, let's talk about cops.

84
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,733
Oh, sure. You guys spy on cops
all the time.

85
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,236
I mean, you go for cops
because cops are easy.

86
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,885
That's right.

87
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:46,307
And I can't tell you how sorry I am
that cops are easy.

88
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,000
You know, my whole career,
I've never seen anything but good cops.

89
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:53,502
In SIU, I see great cops.
Great detectives.

90
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,630
If a guy took as a cop,
he'll take as a detective.

91
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,863
If a guy took as a DA,
he'll take as a judge.

92
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:03,825
Okay, thanks for coming in, detective.

93
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,328
Oh, I will be in touch.

94
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:11,854
Or if you should want to call me,
office and home.

95
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,129
By the way, if you do
have something, anything...

96
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:18,840
...it wouldn't have to go through
the Chase Commission.

97
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:22,073
There are lots of other
investigative branches.

98
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,348
Looking for something besides cops?
I'd love to hear it.

99
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:32,708
Did you read the report?

100
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:36,045
Ten times as many cops
got themselves bit in 1966...

101
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:38,235
...as got themselves bit in 1964.

102
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,989
Hey, Gino, do they say
where they got themselves bit?

103
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,325
- Who else could live with this?
- Who needs a drink?

104
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,411
Hey, Ernie.

105
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,913
I've got Ronnie upstairs.

106
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:53,354
Watch what your sister
puts in her mouth, hear?

107
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,648
Why ask?
I'm reading the new Vonnegut.

108
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:58,151
- Who?
- Vonnegut, you guys ought to try it.

109
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,028
- Who?
- I wanna get out of here.

110
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:02,426
Your father and Ernie
have got Ronnie upstairs.

111
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,033
I read that report, Gino. Thanks, Bill.

112
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:07,535
One of the worst hazards
of the profession, biters.

113
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:10,142
Yeah, but you got to see
where my horse was bit.

114
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:14,939
I found him in the road.
He wouldn't tell me who done it.

115
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,545
All right, thanks Ernie.
Go back downstairs, Pop.

116
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,048
- His cheek is cut bad.
- I said I'd take care of it.

117
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,446
- He's your brother.
- Sure you'll take care of it.

118
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,740
Like you always take care of it, right?

119
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,304
If you took care of it...

120
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:29,432
...think I'd be coming here
like some fucked-over piece of meat?

121
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,352
What is it, huh?
You got a problem, Ronnie?

122
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:35,897
You got a new problem? Why don't
you tell me about your problem, Ronnie?

123
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:39,860
- I mean, I've done everything I can.
- You don't do nothing. Nothing!

124
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,258
Shit, I come here,
you got this house.

125
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,865
You got a car,
your wife's got a car. You know?

126
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:49,765
- Got a problem? Tell me the problem.
- You're always wearing the best clothes!

127
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:53,415
You smell like I don't know what.
And all your friends down there...

128
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,022
...they're in the same shape!
- Hey, we earn what we got.

129
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,984
I look at those cops. What are you
telling me? You guys are civil servants?

130
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,070
Is that what you're telling me?

131
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:05,511
You guys are doing more shit than me
or any of the people I know would!

132
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:09,786
Listen to this. We earn what we got.
Why don't you search my house, huh?

133
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:13,852
- Search my house. Like the other times.
- Always coming on like you're special...

134
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,668
...because you got a badge
to go with your gun!

135
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:20,839
Know the difference between you and
a guy putting a stocking over his head?

136
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:23,654
You got a badge!
You're the same fucking crook.

137
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:27,512
The same fucking crook.
And your father don't see it, but I see it.

138
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:30,119
And in his heart, your father sees it.

139
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:34,811
If you want to help me,
you can help me!

140
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:40,442
All of you have the right time
on your gold Rolexes?

141
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:57,230
- I'm sorry, Pop, I...
- I know you can't. I know that.

142
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,315
But what he says about everything.

143
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:06,405
Your brother's right, Danny.
He ain't blind.

144
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,117
And neither am I.

145
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,894
I thought you got him
into a methadone program?

146
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:19,335
I got him in two methadone programs.
I swear to God, Joe.

147
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:23,089
The day I give him junk is the day
I take my gun and I shoot us both.

148
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:24,757
Danny, come on.

149
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,805
All right, everybody.
A little vino for the digestion, huh?

150
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,446
I kind of enjoy it when Nancy
takes the kids to her folks.

151
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:52,598
I get to go in the kitchen,
and I do it my way, you know?

152
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:56,143
How...? How do you like your steak?

153
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,020
Do it your way.

154
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,418
You like it rare.

155
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,239
What is it? What do you want?
I didn't do it, whatever it is.

156
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:13,661
Why don't you do something important,
like investigate lawyers?

157
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,372
You were in the
Manhattan DA's office, right?

158
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:19,604
There was never a hint of corruption
in that office.

159
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,316
Maybe you know something I don't.

160
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:29,927
Danny, you called me.
So why you here?

161
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:36,601
If you know anything about lawyers
or DAs, I would love to hear it.

162
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:44,213
Is it common practice to sell
narcotics in the narcotics division?

163
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:47,341
<i>Where is your information from?
Village Voice?</i>

164
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,843
<i>New York Magazine, for chrissake?</i>

165
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:53,180
We don't sell narcotics.
Dope dealers sell narcotics.

166
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,266
We're not dope dealers.
We're policemen.

167
00:14:56,413 --> 00:15:00,375
This steak is raw.
This conversation is bullshit.

168
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:12,887
- Yeah?
- Danny, I'm sick. I can't sleep.

169
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,452
<i>Hang on.</i>

170
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:24,670
What are you talking about?
I left you something when we finished.

171
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,651
Whatever it was, I'm sick, Danny.

172
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:29,362
It's 3:00 in the morning, you fuck.

173
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,344
What's this "you fuck," man?

174
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,638
We work together, right?

175
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:35,723
You know I can't make it
without you, Danny.

176
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:39,060
<i>Look, you really need...
You really have to help me, Danny.</i>

177
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,335
You don't want to leave me
out here throwing rocks.

178
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:48,340
Where are you?

179
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,213
You got something for me?

180
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:09,716
I'm gonna get you something.

181
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:27,442
Hey, Sal. You got something for me?
I got a sick stoolie.

182
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:32,551
You have to replace this for me, Danny.
I got stoolies too, you know?

183
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,524
What is it?

184
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:49,965
I don't know what this is.

185
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:53,510
This ain't shit! Shit, Danny!

186
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:57,368
You gotta get me something! What
are we gonna do? Come on, Danny.

187
00:16:57,577 --> 00:17:00,392
- Danny, you gotta get me something.
- Shut up! Shut up!

188
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,582
You gotta help me, Danny!

189
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,814
- Shit, Danny!
- Shut up! We'll go over to Cy's place.

190
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:34,593
- Oh, I don't believe it.
- What?

191
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,304
I left my money at home.
I haven't got a dime.

192
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:42,935
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Danny.
Oh, God, Danny, what are we gonna do?

193
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:45,646
- Danny, what are we gonna...? Oh, God.
- Shut up.

194
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,149
When that guy comes out of Cy's,
I'm gonna take him.

195
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:49,817
You can have whatever he's got.

196
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,571
- Yeah, Danny, you gotta...
- Get your hands off me and stay down.

197
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,448
Stay out of sight.

198
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,876
Danny!

199
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,825
Danny!

200
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,821
Come on, Danny!

201
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:19,178
Why'd you run, Jose?

202
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,520
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill the motherfucker!

203
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:35,653
You hurt me, baby face.
I think you broke something.

204
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:39,198
You shouldn't have run, Jose.
Where's your junk?

205
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:43,369
Oh, don't take my junk. Please,
baby face, don't take my cure, man.

206
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:47,332
I bought five bags, take half.
Don't take it all. I'm sick.

207
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,521
Don't you see how sick I am?

208
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:55,465
I'm a junkie, not a connection.
Why you wanna bust me?

209
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,304
Oh, Jesus, Jose, I'm sorry.

210
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:07,456
It's okay. It's broke, it don't matter.
Just don't leave me sick, baby face.

211
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,988
Hey, four bags, Jose.

212
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,116
You must have struck it rich.

213
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:30,083
Here's two bags.
Go home and sleep now.

214
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:34,984
You're a bitch, Danny.

215
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,695
That's some fucking left hand
you got.

216
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,989
Dry out. You got a lot of work
to do tomorrow.

217
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:44,160
I'm not gonna forget this, Danny.
I'm not gonna forget this.

218
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:48,644
I can't breathe. I'm gonna to be si...

219
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:59,801
Come on, Jose.
Come on, I'll take you home.

220
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,517
I saved you two bags, Jose.
You'll be okay.

221
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,939
Jeannie, open. I got something.

222
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,153
- What is it?
- From Cy's.

223
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,793
Jeannie, you got any iodine?

224
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,633
Jeannie, save me something. I'm sick.

225
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,116
I'm sick, baby, okay?

226
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,453
Okay, baby?

227
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,998
I'm sick.

228
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,795
Baby.

229
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:01,634
Save me something, baby, yes.

230
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,682
l... I blew my first shot.

231
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,061
You fucking liar!
Where did you put the bag?

232
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,564
I flushed it, man. It was garbage.

233
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:17,171
I told you, I had to take two.
I blew my first shot.

234
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:21,863
You fucking liar! Didn't you even leave
me enough to get through the night!

235
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,929
- Oh, you liar! Liar, liar.
- Oh, babe!

236
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,223
- Liar, liar, liar.
- Hold him, please!

237
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,413
- Liar, liar, liar.
- Please, please!

238
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:36,669
Day I graduated from the academy
was the proudest day in their lives.

239
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:41,675
I hear you've got
the best mob connection in SIU.

240
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:43,760
A cousin. That right?

241
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,533
Yeah, Nick.

242
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,869
My father's sister.
Her Nick's with the Colombos.

243
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:52,623
Listen, those guys don't tell me anything
they don't want me to know.

244
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:56,273
See, to my cousin Nick, being a cop
is a sickness...

245
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,567
...to want to put people in jail.

246
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,320
Every time he introduces me
to somebody, he says:

247
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,344
"Remember, this guy's a cop."

248
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:08,160
I understand.

249
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:13,582
Danny, this is the second time
you've called me. What is it?

250
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,918
I know something is eating you.
I want to help.

251
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:21,611
How come you set up a meeting for me
with this guy, and don't check with me?

252
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,175
Look, I am not setting you up.

253
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:26,929
Brooks Paige is a guy you're gonna
want to know. He can be a friend.

254
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:31,725
A friend that heads the Anti-Corruption
Unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office.

255
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:33,706
Yeah, that's true.

256
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:37,043
Brooks is a good guy.
He's very up front.

257
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,128
Very resourceful.

258
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,631
Very prompt.

259
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,470
That's not true. All cops are like me.
I'm no different.

260
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,973
Well, I think you are.
That's why you're here.

261
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:52,267
You don't know why I'm here.

262
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:54,352
Where did you go to school, Paige?

263
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:58,627
I went to Harvard,
and before Harvard to Andover...

264
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:02,068
...and before Andover to St. Bernard's.
- St. Bernard's.

265
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:05,926
That's in the 23. That's little,
blond boys in blazers, right?

266
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,116
Oh, shit, Cappalino.

267
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,974
My own father can't understand
the pressures on cops.

268
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:14,998
What am I supposed to get
from St. Bernard's?

269
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,335
You people in the Chase Commission,
you tell cops...

270
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:22,193
...you're out to catch them taking meals
or taking Christmas presents.

271
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:28,762
You bastards, it's you guys
who run the whole fucking thing.

272
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,117
You run it!

273
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:31,994
Starting with assistant DAs...

274
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:35,331
...who plea-bargain murder one
down to a misdemeanor!

275
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,772
Or lawyers wearing $400 suits, who
come up to cops in hallways and say:

276
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:42,422
"Hey, pal, this case don't mean shit.
Here's $50.

277
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,488
Here's $ 100, $500, $ 15,000."

278
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:49,825
Fifteen thousand dollars!

279
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:53,892
Fuck, I mean, we know
how you guys become judges.

280
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,124
You pay 50,000,
and... you're wearing robes!

281
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:01,086
You guys, you live in Westport
or here on Central Park West...

282
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:04,423
...while we're up in El Barrio
on 125th Street!

283
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,821
You want us to keep everybody
on the inside...

284
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:08,594
...so you can stay on the outside!

285
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:11,201
- That's not true.
- The fuck it's not true!

286
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:13,599
The fuck it's not true!

287
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:17,144
The first thing a cop learns is
he can't trust anybody but his partners!

288
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:19,021
I'll tell you something right now...

289
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,254
...I sleep with my wife,
but I live with my partners.

290
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:25,799
You people... You people,
you're just out to hurt us.

291
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:29,031
You wanna lay the whole
fucked-up system on us!

292
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,681
But nobody cares about me
but my partner!

293
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:35,600
You understand that? Nobody!

294
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:39,771
You see, I see what kind of man you are.
And you, you know?

295
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,899
And then I look at my partner,
and I see what kind of man he is.

296
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,966
And there's no comparison, see?
It's me and him...

297
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:49,260
...and whatever guy we catch.

298
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:52,492
And we're gonna put him in jail,
we're gonna lock him up...

299
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,621
...and we're gonna take
his fucking money.

300
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,791
Fuck him, fuck them and fuck you!

301
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,190
Fuck you!

302
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,096
You guys are winning in the end,
anyway.

303
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,641
We're out there selling ourselves
and our families.

304
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:21,167
These people we take from own us.

305
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:28,466
I know what you guys think of us.

306
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:32,950
That we're the only thing
between you and the jungle.

307
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,813
You don't understand!

308
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:43,899
We're on the inside!

309
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:49,946
You've got the same kind of dirt
under your fingernails as me.

310
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:53,074
Sure, I give my informants heroin.

311
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:57,037
They got nobody but me,
and they're sick, and they're helpless...

312
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:59,018
...and I feel responsible for them.

313
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:03,919
But under the law, I give them junk,
and that's the same as selling.

314
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,943
That's a felony.
So why don't you arrest me right now?

315
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:11,843
You got the same use for me down
the line as I got with my informants.

316
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,578
But you're United States attorneys.

317
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:21,124
If you have guilty knowledge of a felony,
and you don't move against me...

318
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:24,148
...then you're committing a felony,
so don't give me any shit.

319
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:27,171
I mean, everybody's
using everybody, right?

320
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:29,987
So, what I want is...
And let's get this straight.

321
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:33,845
If I decide to do this thing,
I will not give up my partners.

322
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,954
I want the unit broken up,
so that they can be protected.

323
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,831
They're not doing anything, but...

324
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:44,585
We'll transfer them out of SIU.
It's time for normal rotation, anyway.

325
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:53,344
I gotta think. I gotta have more time.

326
00:27:55,533 --> 00:28:00,539
So who you gonna hurt?
Your partners? Gus? Gino?

327
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:05,544
- You're gonna ruin their lives?
- Don't be crazy.

328
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:08,150
I'm not gonna implicate
anybody close to us.

329
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,279
They're gonna break up the unit
and rotate the partners at SIU.

330
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:14,407
- I'm gonna call the shots.
- You think they're gonna let you choose?

331
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:15,971
You think they're gonna say:

332
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,682
"Okay, Dan, whoever you wanna
tell us about, you decide"?

333
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,246
Is that what you think?

334
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:23,895
I know you feel guilty.

335
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:29,109
Other people are guiltier than you.
Everybody's guilty.

336
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,924
Mary McLenan, you ought to hear her.

337
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:35,470
"My Neddie, he's snow white.
He's an angel."

338
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:40,683
Then we're in the bank together,
and she's got 400 $ 1 bills for deposit.

339
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:42,977
Her angel's been taking
from some old woman...

340
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:46,001
...doing the numbers in a candy store.

341
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,840
I feel lousy, Carla.

342
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:58,305
The other night I was with my junkies,
and I got mean.

343
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:01,642
They break my heart, and I got mean.

344
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:05,709
Remember what it was like
when I was starting out on the roofs?

345
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,273
How good it felt?

346
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:10,401
I wanna feel that way again.

347
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,719
This guy, Cappalino, he's gonna
force you to hurt your friends...

348
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:18,325
...people who've been good to you.

349
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:22,184
Always when I hear you or Gus or Joe,
any of the guys...

350
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:25,416
...you always say nothing's worse
than to be a...

351
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:29,066
A rat.

352
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:33,549
A rat is when they catch you and make
you inform. Nobody caught me.

353
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:38,867
This is my setup. This is my action.
And I'm never gonna hurt my partners.

354
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,559
It'll happen.

355
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,105
How are you gonna live with that?

356
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:51,693
How am I gonna live with you
while you live with that?

357
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:55,134
When I decide what I'll do,
you can decide what you'll do.

358
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:15,154
Okay, but not
with the Chase Commission.

359
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:18,908
And Paige has gotta understand that
I will never, never work against cops...

360
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,306
...who've been my friends
or partners in SIU.

361
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:25,372
I will never wear a wire against
my friends, betray my friends.

362
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:28,188
He's got to understand that.

363
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,236
Dan...

364
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:40,700
...we'll never force you to do something
you can't live with.

365
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,307
I promise you that.

366
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:03,119
Some of my best work, kid.

367
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,726
Look at this.

368
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,314
I think I'm in love.

369
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:16,257
- These wonderful ladies are perpetrators?
- Innocent bystanders, Bill.

370
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:19,281
Those are the famous innocent
bystanders you always hear about.

371
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,367
Now I know I'm in love.

372
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:25,120
They're all yours, Danny baby.
From me to you.

373
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,472
It's my connection
at the phone company.

374
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:47,122
That's a serious present, Danny.

375
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:52,127
Well, Gus, give me the tits.

376
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,279
What's that?

377
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,014
NoDoz? Nine years in Narcotics
and you're taking NoDoz?

378
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,663
Mayo, you asshole.
I'm busting you for possession.

379
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:11,209
Hey, that other shit
screws up my sinuses.

380
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:14,024
I'll screw up your sinuses.

381
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,256
NoDoz. Shit.

382
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,973
All right, all right.
Give me a break, will you?

383
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:28,205
Safe house, right?
Feel like I'm in some kind of spy story.

384
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,646
It's the old post office.
We'll work out of here.

385
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:35,817
- Daniel, we're gonna launder you.
- Squeaky clean.

386
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,007
We want all of it. Everything.

387
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:40,718
Rick, can I talk to you for a second?

388
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:50,936
Just so it's clear, Cappalino,
we're in the same boat, right?

389
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,126
You got a wife and two kids,
so have I.

390
00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:56,775
Anything happens to me,
the same thing's gonna happen to you.

391
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,487
You know me
and you know my friends.

392
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,240
- Are you threatening me?
- Absolutely.

393
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,620
Your family will be completely safe, Dan.
Nobody's going to get hurt.

394
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,392
Good, we can both breathe easier.

395
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,103
It's not the best way
to start a partnership.

396
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:14,189
We're not partners yet.

397
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,180
You ready?

398
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,584
- I did three things at SIU.
- You did three things in 11 years?

399
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:35,356
Yes.

400
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:38,380
Start with the worst.

401
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:44,532
Well, it's been about five years
since I went to confession, but...

402
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:47,556
Another SIU team
had a long investigation going...

403
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:49,224
...on a Mafia drug dealer...

404
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:50,788
...a guy named Simonetta.

405
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,499
But they couldn't get enough
for an indictment.

406
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:56,628
So they decided to contact Simonetta
and offer to drop the case...

407
00:33:56,836 --> 00:33:59,130
Which was gonna be dropped anyway.
- for money.

408
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:02,780
Because I got connections, they
asked me to make the deal, which I did.

409
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:05,491
- How much?
- Ten thousand.

410
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:07,263
Case was dropped, I got commission.

411
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:09,974
Bribe solicitation, probably extortion.

412
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:11,643
What else?

413
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:15,188
Another case
involving some Mafia guys.

414
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:18,421
A police lieutenant came to me
and asked me...

415
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,340
...why the detective in charge
wasn't making any arrests.

416
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:25,198
What was happening was the
detective was shaking the guys down.

417
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:27,075
This detective was a very tough guy...

418
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:30,516
...and he was shaking down
some very tough guys, Delicata brothers.

419
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:32,184
So I set up a meet.

420
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:34,896
Now, the detective,
he goes right at Louis Delicata.

421
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:40,526
He says, "Louis, we ain't got you good,
we got you beautiful.

422
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:44,176
We had a wire on your phone
for a month. A legal wire.

423
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:47,617
And your brother Tiny
is up to his guinea ass in your shit."

424
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:50,641
Delicata jumps a mile.

425
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:54,186
He's all shook up because his brother
Tiny was on life parole for murder.

426
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,646
Sitting duck, right?

427
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,817
The detective wants 75,000 in cash,
or he's gonna roll Tiny up.

428
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:03,362
Delicata gets up from the table
and screams like a woman.

429
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:08,263
He says, "That fucking shield you got
ain't no bulletproof vest!

430
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:12,016
I'd sooner kill you than let my brother
go back to the fucking can for nothing!

431
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:13,893
I'm gonna fucking kill you!"

432
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:16,396
Then this detective,
he just yawns. Yawns.

433
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:20,671
Right in Delicata's face.
Right in the fucking guy's face.

434
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,069
Then he gets me up, goes out,
takes me with him.

435
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:25,780
I thought I was gonna catch a bullet
in my fucking back.

436
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:28,491
We get outside, and I say,
"Listen, man.

437
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,349
Those fucking guys are killers!
What the fuck are you doing, man?"

438
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:34,956
He says to me,
"Kid, they're full of shit.

439
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,146
They think they're tough,
but we're tougher.

440
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,691
So you go back inside there,
and you make a deal."

441
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,777
So I did.

442
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,218
Delicata gave me $ 7500.

443
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:51,953
Just a second. I thought that you said
that the detective wanted 75,000.

444
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:53,412
It was negotiable.

445
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:57,583
What was the detective's name?

446
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,190
You'll never get witnesses
or corroborating evidence...

447
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,650
...against that detective...

448
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:04,257
...so there's no point
in me naming him.

449
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:06,238
What was the third thing, Daniel?

450
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:10,513
I took 1000 bucks for putting together
Rocky Gazzo and Detective Logan...

451
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:12,077
...from the Safe and Loft Squad.

452
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:14,684
I don't know anything about
what they had going.

453
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:19,585
- And that's it? That's the three things?
- That's it.

454
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:23,756
All right, Daniel.

455
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:28,448
Let's say that we do go to work
together, and we make cases...

456
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:31,055
...they'll be big.
You'll be the state's star witness.

457
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,557
This business with the three things...

458
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:37,311
...we'll expose them,
we'll defuse them.

459
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,709
You can't be hurt if we back you up.

460
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:42,837
And we will back you up
if you're telling the truth.

461
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,904
But if you perjure yourself
by so much as one detail...

462
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:49,719
...to protect yourself,
to protect your partners...

463
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:53,994
...if you perjure yourself for any reason
whatsoever, you'll be eaten alive.

464
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:56,184
Now, our cases will be forfeit.

465
00:36:56,393 --> 00:37:00,981
Everything we do from this moment
forward will be destroyed.

466
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,047
Daniel, I represent a legal arm...

467
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,758
...of the government
of the United States of America...

468
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:10,157
...and I cannot allow that to happen.

469
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:14,328
Now, is there anything else?

470
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:17,768
Rick, I did three things.

471
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:19,958
All right.

472
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:24,963
All right. What do we do?
How do we start?

473
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:29,238
Just get me wired and sit back.
It'll happen.

474
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:32,054
Remember, the antenna
has to hang loose.

475
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:35,703
The battery pack, the transmitter,
they're always problems. They're bulky.

476
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:39,249
If you're frisked, they're hard to hide.

477
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:43,315
Oh, Dan, this is Agent Elroy Pendleton
and Bubba Harris.

478
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:44,984
- Dan Ciello.
- Hi, how are you?

479
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:46,443
- Hi there.
- Nice to meet you.

480
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:50,510
We're your backup. We'll be recording
you and be around in case you need us.

481
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:51,970
Good. Where you guys from?

482
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:53,638
- Dallas.
- Atlanta.

483
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:55,202
Hope you know the neighborhood.

484
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,496
I still get confused
down in Greenwich Village.

485
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:58,956
I know what you mean.

486
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,937
- Detective, could you sign here?
- Sure.

487
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,857
This stuff will be ready for you
in two weeks.

488
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:07,089
Okay, you work my precinct.

489
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:10,530
I don't give a fuck on what,
as long as I get my full cut.

490
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,118
Everything goes through Edelman.

491
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:19,185
Edelman, that other thing,
you work it out.

492
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:24,503
What other thing?

493
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:28,569
Captain's got somebody down
in the Southern District DA's office.

494
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:31,697
He's got a progress report
on an indictment he's ready to sell.

495
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:35,034
- Sell to who?
- An old friend of yours, Rocky Gazzo.

496
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:55,576
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey, Nicky.

497
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:57,765
- How you doing?
- Good to see you.

498
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,164
- You're looking good.
- Thanks. Louis, how are you?

499
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,249
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

500
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,107
- How's the family?
- Everybody's good, Nick.

501
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:09,340
- So how's Maria and Aunt Angela?
- Maria's gonna have another baby.

502
00:39:09,444 --> 00:39:11,008
- No kidding.
- And you know Mama...

503
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:13,406
...she thinks she set
the whole thing up herself.

504
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:16,326
I'm glad you're back.
I thought you'd be going to the dogs.

505
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,994
You kidding? I gave up the dogs.

506
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:21,957
They ain't never gonna catch the rabbit,
and I ain't never gonna catch them.

507
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:25,189
- Is Rocky still in Florida?
- Yeah. Sure.

508
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:26,962
Oh, here's the thing.

509
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:32,801
Rocky's got this guy, some assistant DA
from the Southern District, on his ass.

510
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:35,095
But I can buy the progress report.

511
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:37,493
- Good. Who's the DA?
- I don't know.

512
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:39,579
I gotta go through another cop.

513
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:43,332
- Who?
- A sergeant in the 1-4 named Edelman.

514
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:47,607
Guy's a fucking matzo eater.

515
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:51,883
- You gonna vouch for him?
- Yeah, sure. He's got sources.

516
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:53,968
All right.

517
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:56,575
Rocky will be back
at the end of the week.

518
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:58,347
I'll set it up.

519
00:39:58,556 --> 00:40:02,206
Hey, Danny, do the right thing here.
You put some bread on the table.

520
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:05,021
You understand?

521
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:07,106
Hey, let me ask you something.

522
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:09,505
You get your rocks off
putting Italians in jail?

523
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:10,860
You gonna start with me?

524
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:13,988
There ain't enough niggers out there
for you, you son of a bitch?

525
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:15,865
Hey, it's 15 bucks a coif here.

526
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:20,245
Drink your coffee. Go ahead.

527
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,037
- Hey, Rocky.
- So how you been, kid?

528
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:43,393
Good. How are you, Rocky?

529
00:40:43,602 --> 00:40:46,417
What's this shit I hear,
you're transferring out of Narcotics?

530
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,398
No. Where did you hear that? I'm in.

531
00:40:48,607 --> 00:40:50,484
Good. We need you where you're at.

532
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,778
So who's this? You Edelman?

533
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,531
So now we've met.
Let's get out of here.

534
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:01,328
Danny, you like the jacket?

535
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:05,603
- I found a tailor in Florida.
- It fits good. Nice and snug.

536
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:08,523
- Where do you carry your piece?
- I don't carry that no more.

537
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:11,234
You guys know
why I don't carry no gun?

538
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:14,049
Because every nigger I know
has got a gun.

539
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,116
Me, I got a little hatchet,
and I keep it right under the seat.

540
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,514
- You gotta be kidding.
- Telling you.

541
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:37,406
This is Agent Harris, leaving the diner,
trailing the subject.

542
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:39,804
You know...

543
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,079
...this fucking Chase Commission thing
has got everybody crazy.

544
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,582
- I hate this fucking job.
- Bullshit.

545
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:51,066
They're just pulling your prick, Danny.
It doesn't matter what you do.

546
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,255
You open a luncheonette,
you gotta cook.

547
00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:55,654
You gotta work it to earn it.

548
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:58,260
Hey, do you wanna
stop breathing on me?

549
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:01,806
Listen, the cops,
you don't own the world...

550
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,725
...but you get to shake it a little,
right?

551
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:06,498
Yeah.

552
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:28,186
All right, get out.
I gotta see if you are wired.

553
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:33,817
Rocky, it's a fucking insult!
You frisk him, you frisk me!

554
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:39,761
- Danny, I don't know this fucking guy.
- Well, fuck, Rocky, you know me.

555
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:42,785
Okay, what do you got?

556
00:42:47,685 --> 00:42:51,022
- They're around here somewhere.
- I got them.

557
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,966
So long.

558
00:42:57,487 --> 00:43:00,094
Like, get out, you know?

559
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:06,976
I'll catch you later.

560
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,858
- Better count it.
- You should've just given it to Edelman.

561
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:17,924
I don't give 10 big ones to some fucking
kike cop on the first date, all right?

562
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,697
I give you the money, Danny.

563
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:21,991
You're responsible
it gets to where it's going.

564
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,119
It's one for the DA
and one for you guys.

565
00:43:25,223 --> 00:43:29,081
- I just gotta give it to Edelman.
- Okay, but I give it to you.

566
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,688
I do business by the rules, Danny.

567
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:34,608
- You understand?
- Yeah.

568
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,992
I think the batteries leaked.

569
00:43:45,452 --> 00:43:47,746
Don't move, Danny.

570
00:44:11,103 --> 00:44:13,293
Shit!

571
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,636
A Baxter Street bail bondsman,
Danny.

572
00:44:43,844 --> 00:44:48,015
- Bigtime fixer, Dave DeBennedeto.
- No.

573
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:51,873
- This one is a police officer.
- Yeah, that's Carl Alagretti.

574
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:54,689
- I worked with him a couple of times.
- Great.

575
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,983
And Alagretti's your entrée
to DeBennedeto.

576
00:44:57,191 --> 00:44:59,902
Dave's been calling all over town
about you.

577
00:45:00,007 --> 00:45:02,613
Why do you always have to
shoot off your mouth, Ciello?

578
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:06,576
Everybody's talking about how some cop
is squealing to the Chase Commission.

579
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:10,330
Carl, let's not sit so close
to the TV set, okay?

580
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:13,666
- I can't get any kind of recording here.
- Man, that's not funny.

581
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,273
Listen, you ought to think
about coming over, Carl.

582
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:17,837
Lot of cops are doing it.

583
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:20,861
You see that waitress over there,
the one with no tits?

584
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,259
She's been wearing a wire
for six months.

585
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:26,492
She got a transmitter
stuffed right up her pussy.

586
00:45:27,117 --> 00:45:29,828
He said by 11. It's 10 of 12.

587
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:31,914
- Was he wired tonight?
- How would I know?

588
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:34,104
He consults the spirits.

589
00:45:34,312 --> 00:45:37,649
Thinks he's some kind of goddamn
gypsy fortune teller. "Tonight?"

590
00:45:37,857 --> 00:45:42,133
"Oh, no. Tonight much danger.
No. No wire."

591
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:43,592
Also, he won't wear his gun.

592
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:47,972
Know where he keeps his gun now? In
his attaché case in the trunk of his car.

593
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:55,688
I understand you're looking
to do us a favor here.

594
00:45:55,896 --> 00:46:00,067
I want you to know I get nervous
when people try to do me favors.

595
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:04,655
I got something to earn.
It has to be right away.

596
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:06,845
So, what is it, Danny?

597
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:10,077
You remember Martinez?
You bonded him.

598
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:12,267
He says he paid you back.

599
00:46:12,476 --> 00:46:14,561
He's waiting for trial on Rikers.

600
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:17,585
He says he got a tape on you
where you admit he paid you.

601
00:46:17,794 --> 00:46:20,713
Now you're squeezing him.
If you don't stop, he'll play the tape.

602
00:46:20,922 --> 00:46:22,382
That's a felony.

603
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:27,699
Now let me tell you something.
He's a rat fuck and a punk.

604
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:30,723
He ain't got the heart
to wear a wire around me.

605
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:33,122
You know what I do
if I catch him wearing a wire?

606
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,458
I stick it up his fucking ass,
and I pull it out his mouth.

607
00:46:37,084 --> 00:46:41,776
Nobody, nobody wears a wire
around me. I can smell them.

608
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:44,383
It's God's truth, Danny.
I never seen nothing like it.

609
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:49,075
You know what, Dave?
You're an asshole.

610
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:50,952
I don't know how you got
what you got.

611
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:53,142
You think I'm some kind of rat
or something?

612
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,957
We know the same people,
you understand what I'm saying?

613
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:00,441
You ain't half as tough
as you think you are.

614
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:03,882
Martinez made you, you fat fuck.

615
00:47:05,654 --> 00:47:07,427
Hey, fuck.

616
00:47:07,948 --> 00:47:10,660
Nobody talks to me like that...

617
00:47:10,868 --> 00:47:12,224
...not even my friends.

618
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:19,627
I have a theory about that gun, Rick.

619
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:24,736
That he's so ambivalent
about what he's doing...

620
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:29,324
...that if he's caught...

621
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:31,201
...by DeBennedeto or anybody...

622
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:35,268
...and the verdict is that he's a rat
and he deserves to die...

623
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:42,775
...that he's decided in advance
not to defend himself.

624
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:54,558
He showed.
He showed, that fat son of a bitch.

625
00:47:54,662 --> 00:47:57,269
I mean, for a month he's ducking me,
and now he showed.

626
00:47:57,373 --> 00:48:01,127
Give me a beer, will you, Rick? He
wants something, and it's gotta be big.

627
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,900
Him and Alagretti are so hot...

628
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:05,507
...about the Chase Commission
and this mystery cop.

629
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:09,260
- It's got to be a fucking game. I love it.
- What do you mean?

630
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,825
It's not just DeBennedeto.

631
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,640
I heard 10 times this week
how I'm the big witness.

632
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,768
So somebody starts hinting about
the commission, I say, "Sure...

633
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:21,669
...catch me on the tube.
I'm going to be a big star."

634
00:48:21,877 --> 00:48:24,276
You love the danger,
don't you, Danny?

635
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,153
It's a living.

636
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,655
Don't go wired to that next meeting.

637
00:48:30,636 --> 00:48:32,305
I think I will.

638
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:37,727
Dan, how you doing, kid?

639
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,855
You look good.
Look at you healthy, huh?

640
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,192
If you're looking for a wire,
you ought to do it right.

641
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,111
In SIU we wear them
behind our balls. Come on, check it.

642
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,614
Come on, come on. Check it.
Feel my balls. Come on.

643
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,595
I'd rather go to fucking jail!

644
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:54,410
I don't want to hear more of this shit.
I look like a rat?

645
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,079
- Sit down.
- Cut that out, all right?

646
00:48:56,287 --> 00:49:00,667
Sit down. You're too sensitive.
Relax. Relax.

647
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:12,032
So? I'm not here for the company.

648
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:23,189
You ever hear of a guy
named Michael Blomberg?

649
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:25,066
Yeah, he's a fucking creep.

650
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:28,716
Why did you say that? I know he's got
a bad reputation, but he's a good guy.

651
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,261
He's a very smart lawyer,
and he's helped a lot of people.

652
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,223
- Maybe.
- They got him for subornation of perjury.

653
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,039
That means he caused
perjury to be committed.

654
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,811
I'm not your idiot client. I know.

655
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,939
Jesus, Danny,
Dave didn't mean nothing.

656
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,613
What the problem is,
is Blomberg's been indicted.

657
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,158
He's defended some people
very, very big in junk.

658
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:58,850
He'd also like to pay very big for
anybody who could help him in his case.

659
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,500
And you've got this friend
in the DA's office.

660
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,714
So, what's the case
against Blomberg?

661
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,425
Blomberg. My God.

662
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,344
- Tell me about him. Never heard of him.
- He's the biggest.

663
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:16,055
Takes heroin dealers that
the government's got cold...

664
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,913
...and brings in witnesses that say
he was with them in some other place.

665
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:23,667
You're lucky. Last night you said
you were gonna wire to that meeting.

666
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,691
If you had, you'd now
be part of the pasta fazul.

667
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:28,672
What made you back off?

668
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,175
I didn't.

669
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:33,990
I got it all.

670
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:38,369
You said Alagretti gave you a massage.
Where did you wear the wire?

671
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:42,645
Right where I told that fat fuck.
Under my balls.

672
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:46,816
Everybody knows who
everybody is now, right?

673
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:50,152
- Right. Everybody takes Scotch or what?
- Yeah, sure.

674
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,655
Let's get down to business.

675
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:59,224
The most important thing
as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Blomberg...

676
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:03,499
...is that I think for the future
of this guy.

677
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,627
Well, if we ever need him again...
Thank you.

678
00:51:06,836 --> 00:51:10,068
If we ever need him again,
we go right through you, right, Mike?

679
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:13,926
So your friend, can he get us
these grand-jury minutes?

680
00:51:14,343 --> 00:51:16,637
The witness transcripts.

681
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:21,955
You're talking about something the mere
possession of which if he gets pinched...

682
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:25,083
...is five on the spot.
He don't operate out of love.

683
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:29,463
So what's his fucking number,
your friend? What's his number?

684
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:33,217
You tell me, Mr. Blomberg.
How much do you want to spend?

685
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,654
Counselor...

686
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:56,574
...these people, these witnesses...

687
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,597
...they're not around
anymore, you know?

688
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:05,020
Yeah. They say Mike
had them clipped.

689
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:07,209
He didn't. They're around.

690
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:10,025
Yeah, they've just joined
the jet set on the road.

691
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:15,343
So great. They're not around
or whatever.

692
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:17,845
Then what's your problem?

693
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:20,660
You don't need to spend the money.

694
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:23,371
With witnesses on the road,
it's not worth spending.

695
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,083
Just buy me
the fucking transcripts, Ciello.

696
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:32,443
Oskar Werner knocks me out.
Does he knock you out?

697
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,216
- So-so.
- So-so?

698
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,884
- Yeah.
- Don't go for Oskar Werner...

699
00:52:36,093 --> 00:52:37,657
...you don't go for me because...

700
00:52:37,865 --> 00:52:42,662
...I am very much like Oskar Werner.
I mean, in my personality and in my soul.

701
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,539
No.

702
00:52:44,747 --> 00:52:47,667
No? Babe, you just batted out.

703
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,544
I think you're like a young Marlon.

704
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:51,629
No, I'm like Dudley Do-Right now.

705
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:53,923
I'm finally doing it
what I set out to do.

706
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:57,260
I'm putting the biggest crooked lawyer
in New York out of business.

707
00:52:57,364 --> 00:52:58,615
Neat.

708
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:01,639
I've been doing the right thing
all along.

709
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:04,142
- Just painful getting there, you know?
- Sure.

710
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:08,938
I ever tell you about the time I was a kid,
how in school I always carried the flag?

711
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,526
<i>- Chase Commission investigating
police corruption.</i>

712
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:16,342
<i>As rumored for some months,
a prime government witness...</i>

713
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:20,200
<i>... is from the ranks of the police
department. He is ready to talk.</i>

714
00:53:20,304 --> 00:53:22,911
<i>Although no identification
is forthcoming...</i>

715
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,707
<i>... it has been learned that the first
initial of the informant is the letter D.</i>

716
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,689
<i>We'll be back with more in a moment.</i>

717
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,504
Call that fucking D-A-N-N-Y.

718
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:39,386
Yeah, you're okay.

719
00:53:45,955 --> 00:53:47,728
You guys all right? What's the matter?

720
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:51,064
What's the matter? It's bad. Bad.
Everything's bad. Bad.

721
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:54,192
- Bad? What's the matter?
- Everything's wrong. Walk.

722
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,174
- What's wrong?
- Walk, blink your eye...

723
00:53:56,382 --> 00:53:58,155
...and I'll blow your fucking head off.

724
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,179
- He's in trouble.
- Stay with him.

725
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:03,577
I can't. It's a one-way street.

726
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:07,018
- Okay, go down the block and turn left.
- We're gonna lose him.

727
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:09,833
We lost him already!
Go down the block and turn left!

728
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:11,919
Shit!

729
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:14,943
If what I hear is true,
you're a fucking dead man!

730
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,402
Hear? What you hear?

731
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:19,426
That you're testifying before
the Chase Commission tomorrow.

732
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,929
I've been telling that
to everybody in the office.

733
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:25,474
This thing was a big fucking joke.
There's 20 people, I'm telling them...

734
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:27,872
...I'm testifying
to the Chase Commission.

735
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:29,854
<i>Leave me alone.
Wanna leave me alone?</i>

736
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:31,730
Good. Good.

737
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:34,233
What are you looking for?

738
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,944
An empty building?

739
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:39,029
Are you gonna
knock off a cop in daylight?

740
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:42,262
You gotta clip him. You're responsible.
You gotta fucking clip him.

741
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:46,016
You're the cop. You're the one
with the gun. You're gonna clip him.

742
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:48,414
We gotta do something.

743
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,604
- Where's the fucking gun, Danny?
- What?

744
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:53,732
- Where's the fucking gun?
- In my trunk, you wanna go get it?

745
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:59,258
I never wear the thing,
only when I'm working.

746
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:02,386
All kidding aside, Carl, you're
giving me a lot of attitude here.

747
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:05,723
This is no joke, it's bullshit.
You're playing fucking games here.

748
00:55:05,932 --> 00:55:08,226
We're not playing
fucking games here. Come on.

749
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:10,832
Look, look. We're only a block
from Mulberry Street.

750
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:13,544
Walk me over there.
My cousin Nick will vouch for me.

751
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:18,444
This is crazy. If Nick won't vouch for me
1000 percent, pull the trigger then.

752
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:22,094
Don't go down asking for it,
because you're going to find it.

753
00:55:22,615 --> 00:55:24,596
See if he's there.

754
00:56:02,343 --> 00:56:05,575
I says, "We think he's a rat.
We think we should fucking clip him."

755
00:56:05,784 --> 00:56:08,286
He says, "If you think he's a rat,
you should clip him.

756
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,893
But if you do,
you better be sure he's a rat.

757
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:14,230
Because the people that like him,
they're good people."

758
00:56:22,676 --> 00:56:24,970
No hard feelings.

759
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:41,028
You tell Mr. Paige that Danny called,
and I'm going to be at his fucking house!

760
00:56:41,236 --> 00:56:42,696
Just like that!

761
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:46,241
At his fucking house!

762
00:56:46,346 --> 00:56:49,370
I want New York City cops with me
now. I asked you months ago.

763
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:52,081
Those federal clowns didn't understand
what was going on.

764
00:56:52,185 --> 00:56:54,270
They're from fucking out of town!

765
00:56:55,105 --> 00:56:58,128
They worry about blowing
the investigation. Cops worry about me.

766
00:56:58,337 --> 00:57:00,631
- I want cops.
- You'll have them, Danny, I promise.

767
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,968
Hey, you know what that
fucking scumbag said to me?

768
00:57:04,176 --> 00:57:07,930
He said it was lucky I showed up.
They were on the way to my house!

769
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:11,058
My wife's there and kids. Alone.

770
00:57:11,267 --> 00:57:15,229
Call my house! There could be somebody
there. Call my house. Call my house!

771
00:57:16,689 --> 00:57:19,296
There's a cop who lives on
my block, Ernie Fallacci.

772
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,590
He lives on my block.
Four cops on my block.

773
00:57:21,694 --> 00:57:23,571
- They know who belongs there.
- No answer!

774
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:26,178
- Don't tell me there's no answer!
- Danny, it's 3:00.

775
00:57:26,386 --> 00:57:28,889
She's probably taking the kids
home from school.

776
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:31,495
- I gotta get out. I wanna get out.
- I'll get a car.

777
00:57:31,704 --> 00:57:34,415
No, I'll call the precinct.
I want my guys. I want my own.

778
00:57:34,624 --> 00:57:36,813
I think it's over.
We have to end it. That's it.

779
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,837
- I gotta call...
- No! No!

780
00:57:40,046 --> 00:57:43,382
No, it'll die down. The hearings will
be over, I won't have testified...

781
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:45,885
...the fucking thing will be over,
it'll die down.

782
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:48,596
<i>- Hello, Edelman?
- Danny, are you okay? We were worried.</i>

783
00:57:48,805 --> 00:57:52,663
Yeah. Listen, Sam, I had
some problems with some fucking guys.

784
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:54,435
Stay where you are. We'll get you.

785
00:57:54,644 --> 00:57:57,772
It's okay, I'm all right.
I gotta get home. I can't reach Carla.

786
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:00,066
Where are you? We're on our way.

787
00:58:04,654 --> 00:58:08,825
I'm at Fulton Street under the bridge.
Right by the old fire boathouse.

788
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:10,910
<i>Twelve minutes.</i>

789
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:39,898
Edelman cares more about me
than you guys.

790
00:58:42,922 --> 00:58:44,486
And I'm putting him in jail.

791
00:58:44,694 --> 00:58:48,240
I want you to go away.
You and Carla and the kids.

792
00:58:50,221 --> 00:58:52,411
- Where?
- There's a nice place on the island.

793
00:58:52,515 --> 00:58:55,017
I want you to go for 10 days.

794
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:01,274
- What will I do there?
- Rest.

795
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:05,445
Me too. Rick?

796
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:09,094
Yeah, sure. We could all use that.

797
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:14,725
Danny, it's hard on you.

798
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:16,497
On me too.

799
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,626
What's hard on you?

800
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:24,214
The lines don't stay clear.

801
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:26,508
The feds fucked up.

802
00:59:26,716 --> 00:59:30,366
And your life was saved by a
Mafia guy we're trying to lock up.

803
00:59:33,077 --> 00:59:34,954
That's right.

804
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:37,560
So you leave my cousin Nick alone.

805
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,177
What if you catch a whale?

806
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,158
I'll let him go.

807
00:59:53,305 --> 00:59:55,495
What if you catch a shark?

808
00:59:55,704 --> 01:00:00,813
I don't know. I'd hate to let a shark go.
It might swim off and bite somebody.

809
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,420
I don't care. Let it go.

810
01:00:03,628 --> 01:00:05,714
Okay.

811
01:00:09,468 --> 01:00:14,994
Cappalino and Paige, these men
don't know about cops or care.

812
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:17,288
They don't care about you.

813
01:00:17,497 --> 01:00:20,416
Yeah, they do.
They do care about me.

814
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:24,274
You think if you get yourself killed
you're gonna be some kind of hero?

815
01:00:24,483 --> 01:00:28,341
You'll get an inspector's funeral
and everybody that loves you will come.

816
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:32,199
You get your inspector's funeral
and my life is over, Danny.

817
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:36,474
Nobody loves you
but your partners and me.

818
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:55,243
Mr. Santimassino.

819
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:56,911
Cappalino?

820
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,684
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

821
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,248
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

822
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,959
And you're...
You're Detective Ciello.

823
01:01:03,168 --> 01:01:05,045
Oh, welcome to Washington.

824
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:08,798
Well, you three have been working
a very short time with such nice results.

825
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:12,344
Your operation interests me,
and I propose to commit men and funds.

826
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:15,680
I think we may have a chance here
for some international cases.

827
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:20,477
I myself will be spending
a good deal of time in New York.

828
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,501
Let's have a drink and talk.

829
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:26,420
To date, there are
16 indictments being prepared.

830
01:01:26,629 --> 01:01:29,653
They've got six Mafia dealers,
three of whom we consider major.

831
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:32,468
A corrupt captain of police,
four detectives...

832
01:01:32,677 --> 01:01:35,388
...five smaller
organized crime soldiers...

833
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:38,412
...the bondsman, DeBennedeto,
and Mike Blomberg.

834
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,957
And we also have four other
ongoing investigations here.

835
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:46,858
Needless to say, we're very proud of
Detective Ciello's work.

836
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:50,612
I've been studying
Detective Ciello's file very closely.

837
01:01:50,716 --> 01:01:53,010
Interesting career.

838
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:57,911
- Da... May I call you Dan?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Dan's good.

839
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:01,769
Now, let me ask you a question, Dan.

840
01:02:01,977 --> 01:02:05,418
What do you know about a man
who calls himself Marcel Sardino?

841
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:09,068
- He's a major connection.
- Yeah, everybody's heard about Sardino.

842
01:02:09,276 --> 01:02:12,509
I'd like to have Mr. Sardino. Can you
fit him in? I know you got a lot.

843
01:02:12,717 --> 01:02:14,386
No. No, that's no problem.

844
01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:17,097
Easter is coming up,
and things ease off at Easter.

845
01:02:17,305 --> 01:02:20,016
I don't know how it is with the feds.
But with cops...

846
01:02:20,746 --> 01:02:23,457
...we don't like to make
too many arrests over the holidays.

847
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:26,168
Nobody wants to put people
in jail at Easter.

848
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:28,879
It's a little different
on the federal side.

849
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:34,302
Well, we'll be meeting again soon,
Dan.

850
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:37,325
You'll be coming to Washington
quite often.

851
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:43,582
Ask Krimsky to drive
these gentlemen to National.

852
01:03:08,294 --> 01:03:09,754
- Finally.
- Yup.

853
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:13,612
Hey.

854
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,414
- He looks great. He's, what, 14?
- Sixteen.

855
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:27,063
I bought him when the
department retired him.

856
01:03:27,272 --> 01:03:28,836
Gino ever tell you how we met?

857
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,921
No. I know he was a Mountie.
You too?

858
01:03:31,026 --> 01:03:33,320
Oh, no, I'm scared of horses.

859
01:03:33,424 --> 01:03:35,718
But I'm alone, there's 2000
blacks in the street.

860
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:38,429
And I feel like I'm
the only white man in Africa.

861
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:42,704
I'm 23 years old, and these blacks,
they want to burn the precinct down.

862
01:03:42,808 --> 01:03:45,728
So down comes the U.S. Cavalry.
Fast Gino on a lead horse.

863
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:48,335
- And those nightsticks were flying.
- Yeah.

864
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:51,150
This beauty goes right up
the steps of the station house.

865
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,757
I'm telling you, the natives scattered.

866
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:56,259
All of a sudden I got this
horse's ass in my face.

867
01:03:56,468 --> 01:03:58,971
His tail's in my nose,
it's in my mouth.

868
01:03:59,179 --> 01:04:02,620
This one, this big guinea cop, he sits
up on the horse like John Wayne.

869
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:08,146
Lays his nightstick on this guy's head,
it's so loud, it sounds like a pistol shot.

870
01:04:08,355 --> 01:04:10,023
Then he looks down at me.

871
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:12,630
I'm leaning against
the station-house door. He says:

872
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:15,550
"Hey, kid, you want the collar?"

873
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:22,015
What about this new case? Sardino?

874
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,683
What do you know about Sardino?

875
01:04:23,787 --> 01:04:26,394
We were on him too.
Wondering how you got on to him.

876
01:04:26,498 --> 01:04:29,418
- Buddy Meatballs.
- Buddy Meatballs.

877
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:32,129
Nobody from Europe?

878
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:34,527
- You know who his supplier is?
- Yeah, you?

879
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,343
- Yeah.
- Well, are you gonna tell me who it is?

880
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:38,802
I thought you knew.

881
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:43,599
- Show you mine if you show me yours.
- I don't think so.

882
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:47,978
Detective, how are you? Rick.

883
01:04:48,187 --> 01:04:49,542
Good to see you, sir.

884
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:51,732
Sardino got picked up by somebody.

885
01:04:51,941 --> 01:04:53,922
- Who?
- You don't know him. A good detective.

886
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,633
I met with him. He won't
give up anything about Sardino.

887
01:04:56,842 --> 01:04:58,510
Well, what's his name?

888
01:04:58,718 --> 01:05:00,074
- Detective?
- The detective.

889
01:05:00,282 --> 01:05:02,264
Gino Mascone.

890
01:05:02,368 --> 01:05:05,079
I know that good detective.
I want him.

891
01:05:05,288 --> 01:05:07,894
- What? He's a top cop.
- He knows about dope.

892
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:09,876
- I know about dope.
- Not like Mascone.

893
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:11,648
He's dirty, not just on the street.

894
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:14,568
I heard his name
when I was serving in France.

895
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:17,904
This may be a good accident.
I want you to tie into him.

896
01:05:18,113 --> 01:05:19,677
No way, Mr. Santimassino.

897
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,952
He's a buddy. Was my rabbi
when I first came on force.

898
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,663
Rick, I thought the deal
was no partners. Correct?

899
01:05:26,768 --> 01:05:30,313
- You're correct.
- Was Mascone your partner?

900
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:33,232
- No.
- So what's the problem?

901
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:37,403
- He's a friend. And he trusts me.
- He'd sell you and his mother...

902
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:42,200
...in the same lot.
He's federal level. I want him.

903
01:05:49,603 --> 01:05:53,461
If you're right, you'll have to get him
some other way. Not through me.

904
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:58,988
Any other way
of getting a line to Sardino?

905
01:05:59,613 --> 01:06:01,386
- I'm working on it.
- Let me know.

906
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:03,784
I'm here till Monday morning.

907
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:05,557
Who wants a lift?

908
01:06:05,765 --> 01:06:07,851
We're going the other way, thanks.

909
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:09,832
Take it easy.

910
01:06:19,946 --> 01:06:22,240
Well, I guess I owe you one.

911
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:23,804
What do you need?

912
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:27,454
You ever heard of a guy named Marcel
Sardino? Very big, like international.

913
01:06:27,662 --> 01:06:30,374
Yeah. Yeah, I bonded him once.
He skipped.

914
01:06:30,478 --> 01:06:33,710
- I want to know where he's holed up.
- Who doesn't?

915
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:36,213
You really are an asshole,
you know that?

916
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:38,820
What are you gonna do
if you find him, punch him out?

917
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,009
Find out for me. I put a tap on him...

918
01:06:41,218 --> 01:06:43,408
...you get the tapes.
You sell the tapes to him.

919
01:06:43,616 --> 01:06:46,431
You walk away with your bond
and 50 grand. This guy is big.

920
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,621
- For you?
- Ten percent and my other thing...

921
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,707
...which is none of
your fucking business.

922
01:06:50,811 --> 01:06:52,688
None of my fucking business?

923
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,963
Stay here. I'll see what I can do.

924
01:07:05,826 --> 01:07:08,433
- Yeah.
- Gino. Dave.

925
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:12,812
Hey, man, listen.
I still don't trust this little prick Ciello.

926
01:07:13,021 --> 01:07:16,879
He's nothing but needles. Every time
I talk to him, nothing but needles.

927
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:20,841
Well, what do you expect? You leaned
on him. I hope he drives you crazy.

928
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:23,969
Hey, look, you moron, if Ciello's a rat,
then my mother's a rat.

929
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:25,742
Now stop bothering me, will you?

930
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:28,557
My kids are in school,
and I love my wife.

931
01:07:42,843 --> 01:07:45,345
Here. Park Avenue.

932
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:49,308
A lot of doormen.
Go nice. Wear a suit.

933
01:07:51,497 --> 01:07:54,313
How come one phone call gets an
address you wanted so long?

934
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,815
Well, let's say somebody owed me.

935
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,673
Goddamn, I'm nervous
using anything from you.

936
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:03,071
Now you know how I feel.

937
01:08:03,176 --> 01:08:05,365
So long, scumbag.

938
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:10,058
He's on my ass, Rick. Hey, he wants
Sardino, I'm getting Sardino.

939
01:08:10,266 --> 01:08:12,664
It's too fancy.
Why mix up with DeBennedeto again?

940
01:08:12,873 --> 01:08:14,646
We've got him.
We'll do it another way.

941
01:08:14,854 --> 01:08:17,774
I don't know another way.
Is Ernie on backup?

942
01:08:17,982 --> 01:08:21,840
Yes, Ernie is on backup.
Are you going wired to this?

943
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:25,907
- No, not tonight.
- Goddamn it. I knew it. You're nervous.

944
01:08:26,116 --> 01:08:30,391
Rick, you ain't never gonna learn.
I'm always nervous.

945
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:34,770
Sometimes I'm scared shitless.
Tonight I am scared shitless.

946
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,107
Assigned to permanent duty
with this guy?

947
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,297
- Hey, how you doing, kid?
- Okay. you?

948
01:08:40,505 --> 01:08:43,633
Perfect. I told Dave
I met Sardino's lawyer.

949
01:08:43,842 --> 01:08:48,534
It's like you said. If the tapes are real,
50 grand on top of what Dave blew.

950
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:50,411
The tapes are good.

951
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:05,635
Come here.

952
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:07,512
Come here.

953
01:09:10,118 --> 01:09:14,289
From the desk of Cappalino?
The assistant DA?

954
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:17,835
D-E-B. DeBennedeto.
That's got to be you.

955
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:22,110
If this is what I think it is, I'm gonna
jam you up, you cocksucker.

956
01:09:22,214 --> 01:09:24,195
Now come on.

957
01:09:25,968 --> 01:09:29,409
I told you I wasn't wearing a wire.
You're ruining my jacket.

958
01:09:29,617 --> 01:09:32,224
- Drop your shorts.
- Only if you kiss my ass.

959
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:39,419
We're getting out of here.

960
01:09:40,044 --> 01:09:42,756
We're gonna sit down.
I'm gonna pay the check...

961
01:09:42,964 --> 01:09:45,362
...and we're leaving, nice.

962
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:47,344
Now put your pants on.

963
01:09:48,491 --> 01:09:51,410
What's the hell's the point?
He's not even wired.

964
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:55,060
Why don't you relax
and count your overtime?

965
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:12,056
All right! All right, I got
four agents outside! Call 911!

966
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,141
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, I'm a cop!

967
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,061
Come on, up! Up, hands up.

968
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:18,625
Now get up!

969
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:21,649
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

970
01:10:21,858 --> 01:10:23,109
The telephone, is no work!

971
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:26,133
- Come on. Give me a reason.
- No.

972
01:10:26,341 --> 01:10:27,801
- Give me a reason.
- Easy.

973
01:10:28,427 --> 01:10:30,095
Come on, give me a reason.

974
01:10:30,304 --> 01:10:33,953
Give me a reason.
I'll blow your fucking brains out.

975
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:35,830
I'll blow your brains out. Come on.

976
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,228
- Come on, Carl, up!
- Easy.

977
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:40,418
- Come on, let's go. Move!
- Easy.

978
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,608
- Walk! Come on, Carl.
- Easy.

979
01:10:42,816 --> 01:10:44,693
Move, Carl!

980
01:10:44,902 --> 01:10:48,343
- Move, Carl. Come on, move. Let's go.
- Take it easy.

981
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:50,949
I'll blow your fucking brains out,
you fat fuck.

982
01:10:51,054 --> 01:10:54,599
Are we...?
Are we in a lot of trouble, Danny?

983
01:10:54,808 --> 01:10:56,893
- Just walk. Walk.
- Come on.

984
01:10:57,102 --> 01:10:59,083
- Keep walking. Keep walking.
- What do you need?

985
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:00,647
- What do you need?
- Keep walking.

986
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:02,419
- Come on, Carl.
- Not like this.

987
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:06,173
- Move, Carl.
- Not like this, Dan. Really. Come on.

988
01:11:06,382 --> 01:11:09,301
- I'll blow your fucking brains out. Walk.
- Come on.

989
01:11:11,074 --> 01:11:12,742
- Come on. Let's talk.
- Nice and slow.

990
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:14,828
- Come on. All right?
- Nice and slow.

991
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:18,999
Come on. Come on,
now freeze. Now freeze.

992
01:11:20,354 --> 01:11:22,440
Stay the fuck where you are!

993
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:25,776
- Ernie!
- Come on, we can make a deal.

994
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,236
Ernie! Against the doors.

995
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:29,426
- We can make a deal.
- Against the doors.

996
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:30,990
- Come on, Carl.
- Come on.

997
01:11:31,094 --> 01:11:33,597
Spread. Higher, Carl. Come on.

998
01:11:35,682 --> 01:11:39,123
Hey, put the defogger on.
I can't see anything.

999
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,711
Come on, Danny,
what do you need? Anything.

1000
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:46,109
Come on. Can't we make a deal?
Come on, Dan.

1001
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:48,403
He's in trouble.

1002
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,684
- I'm here, Danny.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

1003
01:11:57,788 --> 01:11:59,873
- Carl had a gun. Where's his gun?
- I got him.

1004
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:03,419
- Get the doors.
- All right. Get him... Get him off.

1005
01:12:03,627 --> 01:12:04,983
Easy, easy.

1006
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:06,755
- All right, get off me.
- Easy.

1007
01:12:06,964 --> 01:12:08,111
Easy.

1008
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:10,092
Easy.

1009
01:12:10,718 --> 01:12:12,282
Take care of him.

1010
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:17,182
- You all right, Dan?
- Come on, let me go.

1011
01:12:17,391 --> 01:12:18,955
- Christ.
- You all right?

1012
01:12:19,059 --> 01:12:20,415
- I'm bleeding.
- Let me go.

1013
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:23,335
- I'm gonna move.
- Oh, all right then. Come on.

1014
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,107
Take it easy.

1015
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:28,652
- Come on.
- Danny.

1016
01:12:28,757 --> 01:12:31,155
Can you get me a deal, Danny?

1017
01:12:31,363 --> 01:12:34,596
I'll try.
Hey, Ernie, you want the collar?

1018
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,307
No, I'll take the walrus,
but I won't bring a cop in.

1019
01:12:37,516 --> 01:12:40,331
Let the fucking feds do it.
They enjoy it.

1020
01:12:41,478 --> 01:12:45,336
You take Carl to the hospital,
and book him fast. No newspapers.

1021
01:12:45,544 --> 01:12:48,985
I'll wait here with Ernie
for that piece of shit over there.

1022
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:52,948
And I'll tell you this to your face,
you guys are never backing me up again.

1023
01:12:53,156 --> 01:12:54,825
- I'm bleeding.
- I'll quit first.

1024
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:58,787
- Help, please.
- Thanks, Danny. Thanks.

1025
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:02,749
Take care, baby.

1026
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:04,835
The doorman has your name.
Hi, Bobby.

1027
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:06,816
Here's a key.

1028
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,736
You can crash here
whenever you need it.

1029
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:13,281
There are four bedrooms.
Timmy, how you doing?

1030
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,575
The refrigerator is always full.

1031
01:13:15,783 --> 01:13:17,556
What else can I do for you?

1032
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,954
I'm nervous about Sardino.

1033
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:21,935
Don't be.

1034
01:13:22,144 --> 01:13:23,708
I'm telling you, he's gonna skip.

1035
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:26,628
He's gotta figure DeBennedeto
fingered him.

1036
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:29,547
- He'll skip.
- He won't.

1037
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,614
DeBennedeto is in jail.

1038
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,742
If we pick up Sardino now...

1039
01:13:37,472 --> 01:13:40,704
...it would be clear he was
cooperating.

1040
01:13:40,913 --> 01:13:44,458
Just 48 hours, that's all we need.

1041
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:47,691
I want to take Sardino in.

1042
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,246
Dan, this is dangerous information
I'm about to give you.

1043
01:14:01,455 --> 01:14:03,644
Do not do anything. Anything at all.

1044
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:05,625
You'll screw us up.

1045
01:14:08,754 --> 01:14:10,213
Sardino...

1046
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:13,863
...you turned him.
- That's right, he's ours.

1047
01:14:19,077 --> 01:14:21,683
- Why did you send me after him?
- He's working for us.

1048
01:14:21,892 --> 01:14:24,499
It's important he look legitimate.

1049
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:26,793
- Okay?
- They're gonna use Sardino...

1050
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:28,878
...to take Gino tonight. I can feel it.

1051
01:14:28,982 --> 01:14:31,693
You said Gino was the best cop
on the force, how's he...?

1052
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:34,613
Santimassino set him up.
It will happen, believe me.

1053
01:14:34,822 --> 01:14:36,490
- Where are you going?
- To find Gino.

1054
01:14:36,699 --> 01:14:38,993
Danny, you warn Gino.
You find Gino and you warn...

1055
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:42,746
I know. Santimassino's
gonna prosecute me, I know that!

1056
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:44,832
I know that!

1057
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:03,079
- What am I gonna do, Carla?
- I'll do it.

1058
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:06,625
I'll call Rose and I'll tell her
Gino mustn't see Sardino.

1059
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:09,231
That's all I'll say, then I'll hang up.

1060
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:13,715
Carla, not on this phone.

1061
01:15:16,843 --> 01:15:18,720
The phone is bugged.

1062
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:26,749
Go out and use a public phone
if you have to.

1063
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:30,711
Danny, what did he do?

1064
01:15:32,797 --> 01:15:35,195
Oh, hell, Carla.

1065
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:40,409
He bought a house in Great Neck and
carpeted the whole upstairs just like me.

1066
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:45,518
You know I am a man of honor.

1067
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:47,186
Ask Joe Voscoe.

1068
01:15:47,395 --> 01:15:50,523
Always fair and always on time.

1069
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:53,338
If you give me my passport back...

1070
01:15:53,547 --> 01:15:56,571
...I will give you
the biggest arrest ever.

1071
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:59,073
Bigger than anybody, ever.

1072
01:15:59,282 --> 01:16:01,159
Well, how long do you need,
Mr. Sardino?

1073
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:05,330
Marseilles, two days.
One day Aleppo, two days Iran...

1074
01:16:05,538 --> 01:16:09,813
...Bogotá, maybe four or five days.
But then I be come back in New York...

1075
01:16:10,022 --> 01:16:11,586
...the 22nd for sure.

1076
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:13,254
Then I give you the whole case.

1077
01:16:13,463 --> 01:16:18,051
The route, the couriers,
the arrival time, arrival places.

1078
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,615
It's very big, Gino.

1079
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,577
I'll get the passport.

1080
01:16:24,724 --> 01:16:27,331
I knew, I knew.

1081
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,521
You good man.

1082
01:16:30,772 --> 01:16:33,170
We do a lot of business together.

1083
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:35,569
- Here.
- I can wait.

1084
01:16:35,777 --> 01:16:39,010
Gino, we are both Italians.

1085
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:40,678
You trust me and I trust you.

1086
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,285
Let me do this for you. I want to.

1087
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:04,244
Gino, I'm Agent O'Hara.

1088
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:06,537
You've got a problem here, Gino.

1089
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:08,310
Give me the money.

1090
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:11,230
Gino.

1091
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:18,320
You simply call Detective Alvarez and tell
him to call you back on a public phone.

1092
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:21,657
And when he does, you will say,
"Raf, I just found something out."

1093
01:17:21,865 --> 01:17:23,847
You say, "The feds are on us."

1094
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:31,041
I don't understand. What's wrong
with doing that, it's a little test?

1095
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:36,151
Prove you're not lying to us about
Sardino or your department or anything.

1096
01:17:36,255 --> 01:17:40,217
- I won't do it.
- What did you bring me here for?

1097
01:17:40,426 --> 01:17:42,928
- Front.
- Gino...

1098
01:17:43,346 --> 01:17:46,787
...you have a very enviable reputation
in the department and in the city.

1099
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,749
You're a hero. How's it gonna look if
we take you downtown and book you?

1100
01:17:50,853 --> 01:17:54,294
Gino Mascone's the top cop.
Everyone looks up to Mascone.

1101
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,527
But, Gino, you and I
know you're a whore.

1102
01:17:57,735 --> 01:18:01,697
Just a poor old whore who bellies
up for any crook with two bucks.

1103
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:04,721
A whore and a thief.

1104
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:09,309
As far as I'm concerned,
you have only two options.

1105
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,750
You cooperate with us,
you make the calls...

1106
01:18:12,959 --> 01:18:16,087
...or you go to jail
with the other thieves.

1107
01:18:16,296 --> 01:18:18,798
I don't even wanna think
about the third option.

1108
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:20,779
He just arrived, sir.

1109
01:18:22,969 --> 01:18:26,723
Your friend needs a friend. He's going
down the tubes unless you help me.

1110
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:28,704
He won't cooperate.

1111
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:36,211
- Don't touch a thing.
- Oh, Christ.

1112
01:18:36,316 --> 01:18:39,757
- Just wanna check if there's a heartbeat.
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, Christ.

1113
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,051
There's no heartbeat,
look at the head wound.

1114
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:44,553
How did we get into this, Danny?

1115
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:48,203
I don't know.

1116
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:51,748
You did it.

1117
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:56,232
I gotta call you four times
to make a meeting?

1118
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:57,796
You avoiding me?

1119
01:18:58,421 --> 01:19:00,820
I've been hearing
a lot of things, Danny.

1120
01:19:00,924 --> 01:19:03,218
You doing something
you shouldn't be doing?

1121
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,450
Oh, shit, Rocky.

1122
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,370
You wearing a wire or what?

1123
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,001
There, it's off. All right?

1124
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:18,025
Say what you want. It's shit
because I'm not after you, Rocky.

1125
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:19,901
You're lying, Danny.

1126
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,987
I've been in jail half my life.

1127
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:25,324
You think I'm worried about
going to jail, huh? So don't lie.

1128
01:19:25,532 --> 01:19:29,077
You got me the night I bribed
that fucking Edelman, right, Danny?

1129
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,893
They caught you doing
something, didn't they?

1130
01:19:32,414 --> 01:19:35,751
If they caught you doing something,
and you didn't come to us for help...

1131
01:19:35,959 --> 01:19:37,836
...then you deserved to get killed...

1132
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:41,694
...because you trust them
more than you trust us.

1133
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:43,988
Nobody caught me.

1134
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,761
Everything just came down on me.

1135
01:19:45,969 --> 01:19:48,263
I looked at Carla and the kids...

1136
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,975
...and I remember why
I wanted to be a cop.

1137
01:19:51,183 --> 01:19:54,728
I wanted to do something to show
I was a good guy, not a bad guy.

1138
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:56,710
Who are you gonna be
a good guy to, huh?

1139
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:58,378
What about your cousin?

1140
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:00,672
He's gonna have to explain
to a few people.

1141
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,549
And what about me?

1142
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:04,843
Does anybody get hurt
because of me?

1143
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:07,241
I introduced you to a few people.

1144
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:09,118
I vouched for you.

1145
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:11,203
I swear to God, Rocky...

1146
01:20:11,412 --> 01:20:15,061
...nobody's gonna get hurt because you
introduced me or vouched for me.

1147
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:19,024
Danny, these people have
turned you into a rat.

1148
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:21,631
You're never gonna be able
to live with yourself.

1149
01:20:22,152 --> 01:20:24,342
Me, I'm gonna save your life.

1150
01:20:25,176 --> 01:20:27,991
You listen to me, Danny,
and listen to me good.

1151
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:31,015
Tomorrow you meet me at
Kennedy Airport.

1152
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:33,935
I'm gonna give you $ 75,000.

1153
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:36,854
You go anywhere in the world
out there you wanna go to.

1154
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:39,044
And when you get to
where you want to go...

1155
01:20:39,253 --> 01:20:43,319
...reach me through your cousin Nick.
And I'll send you another 75,000.

1156
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:48,011
You start a new life.
And, Danny, you won't be a rat.

1157
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:54,059
Where am I gonna go?

1158
01:20:55,623 --> 01:20:57,187
You don't wanna?

1159
01:20:57,396 --> 01:21:01,045
You don't wanna, huh?
All right, fuck it.

1160
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,339
Can we get in the fucking car?

1161
01:21:05,321 --> 01:21:08,032
If you kill me, Rocky,
you're fucking dead.

1162
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,951
You know, Danny,
you worry too much.

1163
01:21:11,056 --> 01:21:13,662
That's why
you're in all this trouble for.

1164
01:21:13,871 --> 01:21:17,520
Ever since I've known you, you've been
nothing but a fucking worrier.

1165
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:21,483
Come on, Danny. Come on, kid.

1166
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:23,360
Take me in.

1167
01:21:27,635 --> 01:21:29,303
That poor dumb kid.

1168
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:31,701
He's 6'5" and black...

1169
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:34,830
...he's got a barrel ass
and a head shaped like this.

1170
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:39,626
Put him in a room with 500
black, 20-year-old perpetrators...

1171
01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:41,712
...and you pick Arthur out
in one sweep.

1172
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,735
So I says, "Arthur, you're not cut
out for a life of crime.

1173
01:21:44,944 --> 01:21:47,759
- I'm gonna get you a job, Arthur."
- And?

1174
01:21:47,968 --> 01:21:52,139
So I made them take him on as
a bouncer in a pornographic bookstore.

1175
01:21:54,016 --> 01:21:55,580
Perfect.

1176
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:58,395
What's so funny about that?

1177
01:21:58,499 --> 01:22:00,272
It was a funny story.

1178
01:22:00,376 --> 01:22:03,400
A bookstore needs a bouncer?

1179
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:06,528
Hey, hit me too, will you, Gus?

1180
01:22:07,362 --> 01:22:09,552
Hey, did you hear about Kaminsky?

1181
01:22:12,785 --> 01:22:15,808
He was coming out of a drugstore
and he heard this lady scream...

1182
01:22:16,017 --> 01:22:19,875
...so he looks, he sees this guy
running down the street away from her.

1183
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:25,089
He goes after the guy and he
overtakes him. Now, the guy is 23...

1184
01:22:25,297 --> 01:22:27,695
...Kaminsky is 42.

1185
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,136
Anyway, he caught the guy,
and the guy starts lashing at him...

1186
01:22:31,241 --> 01:22:34,682
...with this big fucking knife, like this.

1187
01:22:36,663 --> 01:22:39,270
Kaminsky disarmed him...

1188
01:22:39,478 --> 01:22:44,170
...he disarmed him and he held him
until two patrolmen ran up.

1189
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:46,673
And then he proceeded
to give them the knife...

1190
01:22:46,882 --> 01:22:52,304
...and the money and the jewelry.
And he gave them the collar.

1191
01:22:53,555 --> 01:22:56,057
- What's so funny about that?
- What's so funny is...

1192
01:22:56,162 --> 01:22:59,394
...Kaminsky's under indictment
for perjury for the bribes he took.

1193
01:22:59,498 --> 01:23:02,210
He didn't have his gun,
he didn't have a shield.

1194
01:23:03,774 --> 01:23:09,092
Once a cop, always a cop.
Don't you think that's funny?

1195
01:23:12,741 --> 01:23:14,618
Danny.

1196
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:17,746
Danny, why don't you go upstairs
and lie down? Wash your face.

1197
01:23:17,955 --> 01:23:19,936
You're exhausted.

1198
01:23:20,144 --> 01:23:23,481
You should take some time off
with Carla and go up to your cabin.

1199
01:23:26,713 --> 01:23:28,486
Hey, Raf...

1200
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:31,927
...hey, you know I didn't have
anything to do with Gino, right?

1201
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:34,638
You were his partner.
You know that, man.

1202
01:23:34,847 --> 01:23:36,307
I know that, sport.

1203
01:23:37,036 --> 01:23:38,913
- You know that.
- Yeah.

1204
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,937
Christ, Danny,
nobody ever thought that.

1205
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:53,824
Sometime in the future, you guys are
gonna hear all kinds of things.

1206
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:56,222
Listen, Danny...

1207
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,976
...I know about all of that stuff.

1208
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:04,147
What do you know?

1209
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:07,797
Danny, that dumb story
has been going around forever.

1210
01:24:08,005 --> 01:24:11,133
You going around cooperating with
prosecutors, going around wired.

1211
01:24:11,342 --> 01:24:12,906
That's shit.

1212
01:24:13,323 --> 01:24:14,574
Look, Danny...

1213
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:17,390
...Gino heard that stuff
and he never believed it...

1214
01:24:17,494 --> 01:24:19,058
...and we don't either.

1215
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,873
We know you'd never
do anything like that.

1216
01:24:27,504 --> 01:24:29,694
I did some things.

1217
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,723
I didn't do nothing to hurt you guys.

1218
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:42,519
I wanted absolution.

1219
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:48,671
How can guys like us take the
sacraments with what we do?

1220
01:24:56,283 --> 01:24:58,264
I wasn't gonna go against cops...

1221
01:25:02,748 --> 01:25:05,981
...but none of you guys are involved,
I swear to God.

1222
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:12,133
But some cops, they caught some.

1223
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,156
I didn't want it to happen,
but it happened.

1224
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:20,162
But not Gino. You gotta
believe me, not Gino.

1225
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:23,602
I believe you, Danny.

1226
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,252
We all believe in you, Danny.

1227
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:31,006
So take it easy, otherwise
you're gonna drive yourself crazy.

1228
01:25:31,944 --> 01:25:35,072
What can we do, Danny?
How can we help?

1229
01:25:35,802 --> 01:25:37,366
Where's your gun, Danny?

1230
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:40,912
I'm not gonna do that.

1231
01:25:42,163 --> 01:25:44,561
We think you ought to give us
your gun, Danny.

1232
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:48,836
- I'm not gonna give you my fucking gun!
- Right.

1233
01:25:49,045 --> 01:25:52,173
You shoot yourself, Danny,
there's no pension for Carla.

1234
01:25:53,007 --> 01:25:56,865
Do you need money, kid?
Do you need help like that?

1235
01:26:00,306 --> 01:26:03,122
The last guy that tried
to help me like that...

1236
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,581
...is going inside.

1237
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:11,880
It's all so fucking funny, Joe.

1238
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,658
We don't know how it leaked. They got
every case outlined. Two years' work.

1239
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:21,473
What the bloody hell do we do now?

1240
01:26:21,578 --> 01:26:24,289
Get me Tug Barnes in the U.S.
Marshal's office...

1241
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:27,626
...and tell him I want Detective
Ciello scooped up immediately...

1242
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:32,631
...and send six armed agents out to
Great Neck to guard his wife and kids.

1243
01:26:33,361 --> 01:26:36,072
Dan, are you taking any of this in?

1244
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:39,930
I don't think I'm making myself clear.

1245
01:26:42,328 --> 01:26:44,205
I didn't understand...

1246
01:26:46,395 --> 01:26:48,480
...how long it would be.

1247
01:26:49,523 --> 01:26:51,400
Two years?

1248
01:26:53,485 --> 01:26:55,570
I'm gonna be testifying for two years?

1249
01:27:02,348 --> 01:27:05,998
What after that?
I mean, what happens then?

1250
01:27:06,832 --> 01:27:09,856
I'm safe... Am I safe then?

1251
01:27:10,064 --> 01:27:12,358
After the trial is over...

1252
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:15,278
...is my family gonna be safe then?

1253
01:27:15,486 --> 01:27:18,406
We'll face that when the time comes.
What we have to do now...

1254
01:27:18,615 --> 01:27:21,221
...is find a safe place for now.

1255
01:27:23,828 --> 01:27:26,018
We got a cabin in the Catskills.

1256
01:27:27,165 --> 01:27:28,520
We could go there.

1257
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:29,980
Anybody else know about it?

1258
01:27:30,814 --> 01:27:32,170
No.

1259
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,654
Tug?

1260
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:39,156
Okay.

1261
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:45,725
For now until it's over, it'll be my job
to take care of you and your family.

1262
01:27:45,934 --> 01:27:47,915
You are my job, you understand?

1263
01:27:48,124 --> 01:27:51,982
Anything worries you,
anything you need, anything at all...

1264
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:54,067
...I take care of.

1265
01:28:00,219 --> 01:28:02,513
This is Ned Chippy.

1266
01:28:02,722 --> 01:28:04,390
This is Pete.

1267
01:28:06,058 --> 01:28:09,499
Anything you need,
we're gonna get it for you.

1268
01:28:45,786 --> 01:28:48,184
<i>- You know the route.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1269
01:28:48,914 --> 01:28:52,459
- You guys are pretty careful.
- Yes, we are.

1270
01:28:55,379 --> 01:28:57,777
Tell that man
his gun makes me nervous.

1271
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:01,531
They're all over the house,
they're out in the yard.

1272
01:29:01,844 --> 01:29:04,451
Can't you see Bobby's scared?

1273
01:29:07,996 --> 01:29:09,456
Hi.

1274
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:14,357
Hey, it's just like the TV shows.
Like a dumb little TV show.

1275
01:29:14,565 --> 01:29:16,963
- No.
- Come on, baby. Yes, it is.

1276
01:29:17,068 --> 01:29:21,343
- Come on, you know Chippy. You do.
- No, I don't.

1277
01:29:21,551 --> 01:29:23,324
Here's Tug.

1278
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,727
Mrs. Ciello, I think
we're about ready to go.

1279
01:29:30,936 --> 01:29:34,690
Now, everything you've marked here
will be up there tonight.

1280
01:29:34,898 --> 01:29:38,131
Well, hello, princess.
How are you, sweetheart?

1281
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:43,344
- Hi.
- Hi.

1282
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,611
How many men will there be with us?

1283
01:30:00,653 --> 01:30:02,843
Three shifts. About 18 men.

1284
01:30:03,052 --> 01:30:06,910
Eighteen men, 18 what?

1285
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:17,545
There are 18 of them.
Where are they gonna sleep?

1286
01:30:17,754 --> 01:30:20,152
They got sleeping bags and tents.

1287
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:23,176
It's the mountains. It's cold.

1288
01:30:27,451 --> 01:30:30,997
If you need any help with anything,
Mrs. Ciello, just give a holler.

1289
01:30:42,675 --> 01:30:44,656
I can't help it.

1290
01:30:48,619 --> 01:30:51,330
If it gets too cold, you can take
turns in the living room.

1291
01:30:51,538 --> 01:30:53,832
- Tell the others.
- Yes, ma'am.

1292
01:30:57,377 --> 01:31:00,714
You can use the TV if you keep
it low and you don't wake the kids.

1293
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:02,487
Thank you, ma'am.

1294
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:28,138
Babe, are you okay?

1295
01:31:29,806 --> 01:31:31,162
Yeah.

1296
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:47,324
They're taking me out tomorrow.

1297
01:31:48,992 --> 01:31:50,765
Oh, God.

1298
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:54,727
Where?

1299
01:31:57,334 --> 01:32:01,088
I'll be staying in a military barracks
on Governors Island during the week.

1300
01:32:02,652 --> 01:32:05,050
I'll be coming back here
on the weekends.

1301
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:11,411
I didn't want to tell you until I had to.

1302
01:32:21,316 --> 01:32:23,610
Danny, something I wanted
to tell you alone.

1303
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:25,174
I'm gonna be leaving soon.

1304
01:32:25,383 --> 01:32:28,720
I've been appointed
commissioner of investigation.

1305
01:32:28,824 --> 01:32:32,369
That's a cabinet-level post.
How about that?

1306
01:32:32,578 --> 01:32:36,957
- That's terrific, Ricky. I'm happy for you.
- Well, you're responsible.

1307
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:38,938
For what you've done.

1308
01:32:40,607 --> 01:32:42,067
What's gonna happen to me?

1309
01:32:42,171 --> 01:32:46,342
You are gonna be with a terrific team of
guys. They're gonna work your ass off.

1310
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:49,366
Thirty or 40 indictments,
it's an embarrassment of riches.

1311
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:51,764
We have too many defendants,
too much evidence.

1312
01:32:51,972 --> 01:32:54,892
You're gonna roll into
Foley Square every morning at 8 a.m.

1313
01:32:55,101 --> 01:32:57,916
Roll back to this prison at 6.
That's the way it'll be.

1314
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,523
Dan, come on. You're gonna
be so pooped every night.

1315
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:03,755
It's looney tunes, Rick.
The people you put under indictment...

1316
01:33:03,859 --> 01:33:07,405
...will make bail in 24 hours.
They're gonna be out living their lives.

1317
01:33:16,685 --> 01:33:19,083
I'm the first to go to prison.

1318
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:34,620
It's important
to have a picture...

1319
01:33:34,828 --> 01:33:37,018
...of when and where
you made this recording.

1320
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:38,895
It's vital to the Blomberg trial.

1321
01:33:39,103 --> 01:33:41,502
I know, I know, Mr. Burano...

1322
01:33:42,127 --> 01:33:45,360
...but it's been 14 months ago.
There's been a lot of recording since.

1323
01:33:45,568 --> 01:33:49,218
Dan, Dan, you're doing great.
Let's listen to the whole thing again.

1324
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:52,137
Is this the one you made
in the Chinese restaurant?

1325
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:56,517
I'm not sure of anything anymore.
There's been so many meals in my life.

1326
01:33:56,725 --> 01:33:59,958
Can I borrow Dan? Just two seconds
and we'll bring him back to you.

1327
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:02,877
- No problem. Danny, do you mind?
- No.

1328
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:08,404
No, bring your sandwich in.
No talking, just listening.

1329
01:34:16,433 --> 01:34:20,499
Okay, Dan, this is Ralph Kubela
from RCA. He's cleaning your tapes up.

1330
01:34:20,604 --> 01:34:22,585
- Ralph, Detective Ciello.
- How are you?

1331
01:34:22,793 --> 01:34:25,922
Nice to meet you. What's the matter?
They talk too dirty for you?

1332
01:34:26,026 --> 01:34:27,381
A little electronic magic.

1333
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:31,552
I'm eliminating the background noise,
adding highs so the words are clearer.

1334
01:34:31,657 --> 01:34:34,680
- Dan Ciello, this is your life.
- Yeah.

1335
01:34:34,889 --> 01:34:38,851
Hey, by the way, if you could give me
five or six hours, I'd sure appreciate it.

1336
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:42,709
Whoever catalogued and indexed these
tapes didn't know what they were doing.

1337
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:46,150
My master log doesn't match
with the identification numbers at all.

1338
01:34:46,255 --> 01:34:49,070
- I think Mr. Burano needs me all day.
- And don't forget me.

1339
01:34:49,278 --> 01:34:50,530
You said two seconds.

1340
01:34:50,738 --> 01:34:53,554
Now, two seconds now.
Later, two hours. Come on.

1341
01:34:53,762 --> 01:34:57,412
With one sentence, Danny,
we can complete this transcript.

1342
01:35:00,331 --> 01:35:02,104
<i>should've just given it to Edelman.</i>

1343
01:35:02,313 --> 01:35:05,649
<i>I don 't give 10 big ones to some
kike cop on the first date, all right?</i>

1344
01:35:05,753 --> 01:35:07,630
Let me hear it again, will you?

1345
01:35:07,839 --> 01:35:09,924
Can I, please?

1346
01:35:12,323 --> 01:35:13,991
Oh, shit, I forgot my sandwich.

1347
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,849
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was talking.
Let me hear it again, will you?

1348
01:35:18,787 --> 01:35:21,186
<i>- Should've just given it to Edelman.
- I don 't give...</i>

1349
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,921
- Date set on the Blomberg trial?
- Not yet, soon.

1350
01:35:27,129 --> 01:35:29,006
Can I be there?

1351
01:35:29,215 --> 01:35:30,570
No.

1352
01:35:30,675 --> 01:35:32,343
Why not?

1353
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:36,201
I'm gonna have to lie
on the stand, Carla.

1354
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:39,225
That's perjury. You can't.

1355
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:43,604
What am I supposed to do, tell the truth
about the unit? About what we all did?

1356
01:35:43,813 --> 01:35:46,732
And spend the rest of my life lying.

1357
01:35:54,866 --> 01:35:57,368
It's just a squirrel!

1358
01:36:07,065 --> 01:36:11,862
I might as well just blurt this out.
I've been made the New York head...

1359
01:36:12,071 --> 01:36:15,407
...of the Justice Department Joint
Strike Force Against Organized Crime.

1360
01:36:16,867 --> 01:36:19,787
I'm unpacking
my desk and moving across the plaza.

1361
01:36:22,185 --> 01:36:24,375
I'm not abandoning you.

1362
01:36:27,294 --> 01:36:31,465
Brooks, you don't know what I'm
wrestling with. I got a lot of worries.

1363
01:36:31,569 --> 01:36:33,759
A lot of problems.

1364
01:36:34,072 --> 01:36:37,930
Christ, I mean, you guys, you say,
"This is your life, and I'll take care of it."

1365
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:40,120
Then you move on.

1366
01:36:43,665 --> 01:36:46,793
I know you're worried about the trial,
but you'll be prepared.

1367
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:49,817
And we'll set up a pretrial meeting
with Blomberg's lawyer.

1368
01:36:50,026 --> 01:36:51,277
With Heinsdorff?

1369
01:36:51,485 --> 01:36:53,571
Why do I have to meet
with him before the trial?

1370
01:36:53,779 --> 01:36:56,178
You don't have to,
but it'd be to your advantage.

1371
01:36:56,386 --> 01:36:59,306
You'd find out exactly
what you'll be up against.

1372
01:37:00,244 --> 01:37:04,832
Look, Brooks, I don't mean I'm not glad
about your new job, you know?

1373
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:07,752
What are you gonna work on first?

1374
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,984
We're gonna make a very serious run
on the Garment District.

1375
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:13,487
Perhaps you can do me
one last favor there.

1376
01:37:13,695 --> 01:37:15,781
I need an undercover man.

1377
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:20,786
- You need Gus Levy.
- That was fast.

1378
01:37:21,724 --> 01:37:24,123
Brooks, I've got to get him
out of Narcotics.

1379
01:37:25,374 --> 01:37:27,876
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

1380
01:37:28,606 --> 01:37:32,464
Listen, I wanna tell you something.
I don't care about what's past.

1381
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:35,175
I don't care if you sold junk
or whatever you did.

1382
01:37:35,384 --> 01:37:38,408
What you were then is not what
you are now. You changed your life.

1383
01:37:39,033 --> 01:37:42,370
Don't throw it away with perjury.
If you take the oath and you lie...

1384
01:37:42,474 --> 01:37:47,271
...to protect Gus Levy or the partners,
anybody, anybody, they'll indict you.

1385
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:51,442
And I might take the stand and testify
against you. Don't do that to me, Danny.

1386
01:37:53,423 --> 01:37:55,821
Jesus Christ, how did I
wind up over here?

1387
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:59,054
You're one of us. And the difference
between us and a Blomberg...

1388
01:37:59,262 --> 01:38:01,973
...is that when we take the oath,
we tell the truth.

1389
01:38:12,922 --> 01:38:14,382
- Hello, Mr. Heinsdorff.
- Hello.

1390
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:15,841
This is Detective Ciello.

1391
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:18,240
I won't make this too uncomfortable,
detective.

1392
01:38:18,448 --> 01:38:21,994
I just wanna chat about
those three little episodes of misconduct.

1393
01:38:23,453 --> 01:38:28,563
Three seems to be a meager number
to spread over 11 years.

1394
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:32,004
I'm sorry I'm not the bigtime criminal
you lawyers expect cops to be.

1395
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:35,653
I mean, you make me ashamed
I didn't show more initiative.

1396
01:38:35,862 --> 01:38:38,990
Detective Ciello
is a very charming fellow.

1397
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:42,222
I believe we are in a lot of trouble.

1398
01:38:42,431 --> 01:38:45,872
Don't be deceived. Mr. Heinsdorff
will not be this kind to you in court.

1399
01:38:46,185 --> 01:38:50,460
Well, we're talking here
about a man's career and his life.

1400
01:38:50,564 --> 01:38:53,275
Michael Blomberg is not
such a bad person.

1401
01:38:53,901 --> 01:38:55,882
That's open to debate.

1402
01:38:57,967 --> 01:39:01,721
I want you to know, I've done a great
deal of work in the narcotics area.

1403
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:04,849
I've defended users
and dealers and policemen.

1404
01:39:05,058 --> 01:39:07,143
Did you know Detective Carey in SIU?

1405
01:39:09,959 --> 01:39:11,627
And Carey knows you.

1406
01:39:12,357 --> 01:39:16,424
I've spoken to a number of addicts who
will come forth and testify at this trial.

1407
01:39:16,632 --> 01:39:19,135
They say they know you.
They say you are guilty...

1408
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:22,159
...of many more acts of misconduct
than you admit to.

1409
01:39:22,367 --> 01:39:24,557
Well, they're lying.

1410
01:39:24,974 --> 01:39:27,059
All right, then. Let's begin.

1411
01:39:27,268 --> 01:39:30,500
You don't mind if there's
a stenographer present?

1412
01:39:35,297 --> 01:39:36,861
Not at all.

1413
01:39:47,809 --> 01:39:50,103
I'm going outside for some air.
It smells in here.

1414
01:39:50,312 --> 01:39:51,668
Yeah, we don't mind.

1415
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:54,379
Ned, let me just have
just a minute alone, all right?

1416
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:56,568
I've got a band
around my head so tight...

1417
01:39:56,673 --> 01:39:58,654
Stay in sight, Danny.

1418
01:40:35,879 --> 01:40:38,486
- Jesus, Nick. What...?
- Danny, they're looking to hurt you.

1419
01:40:38,694 --> 01:40:40,780
They think you should be hit.

1420
01:40:44,221 --> 01:40:46,619
Fuck, who's that crazy?
I'm surrounded day and night.

1421
01:40:46,827 --> 01:40:50,686
Yeah, like right now?
They wanted me to do it.

1422
01:40:50,998 --> 01:40:55,065
I told them no. I said, "Hey, this kid's
my cousin, he's my uncle's son."

1423
01:40:55,169 --> 01:40:56,942
I told them no.

1424
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:06,639
- Who they gonna get?
- Who knows?

1425
01:41:07,682 --> 01:41:11,957
I told them I owed you a warning.
I said I wouldn't interfere.

1426
01:41:13,104 --> 01:41:17,171
I'm telling you now.
You watch yourself.

1427
01:41:19,986 --> 01:41:25,095
If it was me,
I'd watch those fucking guards.

1428
01:41:25,825 --> 01:41:29,162
- Oh, no, Nick.
- Danny.

1429
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:32,811
They gotta look the wrong way
for a second, that's all.

1430
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:36,878
Shit. Anybody can be hit,
you know that.

1431
01:41:41,049 --> 01:41:43,030
You gonna be all right?

1432
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,011
Danny?

1433
01:41:51,893 --> 01:41:55,021
Tug and Ned, this is my cousin Nick.

1434
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,628
How you doing?

1435
01:41:58,984 --> 01:42:02,112
Yeah, how are you?

1436
01:42:06,804 --> 01:42:09,411
So, Nick, are you
gonna be okay or what?

1437
01:42:09,828 --> 01:42:11,496
Who knows?

1438
01:42:12,122 --> 01:42:14,520
I never hid the fact you're a cop.

1439
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:19,421
Black sheep of the family.

1440
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:26,303
- How's my father looking?
- Looking good.

1441
01:42:29,014 --> 01:42:33,915
- How's your father looking?
- Not so good.

1442
01:42:35,687 --> 01:42:37,460
Take it easy, huh?

1443
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:52,371
Don't make it tough on us, Danny.

1444
01:42:52,475 --> 01:42:55,916
You can't afford it, we can't afford it.

1445
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:57,897
I'm sorry.

1446
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:02,694
We'll come back
to those three acts, detective.

1447
01:43:02,903 --> 01:43:04,988
Let me first ask you
a very simple question.

1448
01:43:05,092 --> 01:43:08,012
In addition to those three acts
you're gonna describe for us...

1449
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:11,140
...have you ever engaged
in any other misconduct of any kind?

1450
01:43:11,349 --> 01:43:12,496
- No, sir.
- Never?

1451
01:43:12,704 --> 01:43:15,207
- Never.
- Now, detective, will you tell the jury...

1452
01:43:15,415 --> 01:43:19,586
...exactly what those three acts were
and how they took place?

1453
01:43:20,003 --> 01:43:23,757
First time I did something was when
a meeting was set up between myself...

1454
01:43:25,321 --> 01:43:28,032
I wanna go back to the beginning,
Dan.

1455
01:43:28,241 --> 01:43:32,412
I want to hear again,
but in much finer detail...

1456
01:43:33,767 --> 01:43:35,852
...much finer detail...

1457
01:43:36,061 --> 01:43:39,711
...about those three acts
of misconduct...

1458
01:43:39,919 --> 01:43:42,839
...which you claim
are the only misdeeds you committed...

1459
01:43:42,943 --> 01:43:45,758
...in the 11 years
you were a policeman.

1460
01:43:45,863 --> 01:43:50,972
Now, when you set up contact between
Rocky Gazzo and Detective Don Logan...

1461
01:43:51,076 --> 01:43:53,996
...did you believe yourself to be
committing a crime?

1462
01:43:54,309 --> 01:43:56,394
From the time you contacted
Mr. Simonetta...

1463
01:43:56,603 --> 01:43:58,375
...you knew
you were committing a crime?

1464
01:43:58,584 --> 01:44:01,086
Well, what did you do
with the money you extorted?

1465
01:44:01,295 --> 01:44:04,423
How much did you say? Would you
repeat that amount for the jury?

1466
01:44:04,527 --> 01:44:06,404
The exact amount was how much?

1467
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:09,949
Come now, detective, 11 years a cop,
eight years in Narcotics...

1468
01:44:10,054 --> 01:44:12,348
...and you never once
made an illegal wiretap?

1469
01:44:12,556 --> 01:44:16,206
You never gave drugs to informants,
to poor junkies crying out for help?

1470
01:44:16,414 --> 01:44:18,083
- Never once?
- I never did.

1471
01:44:20,898 --> 01:44:25,069
No, not me, him. He did it.

1472
01:44:34,558 --> 01:44:39,250
Congratulations, Danny. Stay with it,
now. This is just the beginning.

1473
01:44:45,089 --> 01:44:47,175
I'm District Attorney D'Amato,
Louis D'Amato.

1474
01:44:47,383 --> 01:44:48,947
We'll be working on the Kelso case.

1475
01:44:50,616 --> 01:44:52,492
- We're gonna lock up another lawyer.
- Good.

1476
01:44:54,265 --> 01:44:57,185
I'm Federal Attorney Margutta.
I'm handed the Queens DA case.

1477
01:44:57,393 --> 01:44:59,374
- What's his name?
- Eckhart. Good to see you.

1478
01:45:03,337 --> 01:45:04,484
<i>You just been in my...</i>

1479
01:45:04,901 --> 01:45:06,673
Attorney Leary, IRS.

1480
01:45:06,882 --> 01:45:08,759
Assistant DA Silver.

1481
01:45:08,967 --> 01:45:11,887
<i>- Jim Costa. How are you, detective?
- Yeah, nice to see you.</i>

1482
01:45:11,991 --> 01:45:14,181
<i>Special Investigator Goldstein.
How do you do?</i>

1483
01:45:23,566 --> 01:45:27,111
Hey, baby face.
Easy, gentlemen, easy.

1484
01:45:27,319 --> 01:45:29,301
All right, it's cool, guys.

1485
01:45:29,509 --> 01:45:33,367
The King never carries.
The King works with the mind.

1486
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:37,955
- How you doing, King?
- Not the best, baby face.

1487
01:45:38,164 --> 01:45:40,770
The King has fallen on hard times.

1488
01:45:40,979 --> 01:45:44,211
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. The government's cut me out...

1489
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:47,861
...I've blown my car, my boat,
my ponies.

1490
01:45:48,069 --> 01:45:50,155
The mortgage is due, baby face...

1491
01:45:50,259 --> 01:45:54,639
...and I am snowed under
by all manner of problems. You dig?

1492
01:45:55,577 --> 01:45:59,227
- I'm not sure.
- My man, I am flat broke.

1493
01:45:59,331 --> 01:46:02,250
I got five kids and a wife.
Same as you, baby face.

1494
01:46:02,355 --> 01:46:05,900
Same problem.
I want you to understand that.

1495
01:46:08,194 --> 01:46:10,175
I'll see you around.

1496
01:46:12,261 --> 01:46:14,555
It do look likely.

1497
01:46:19,768 --> 01:46:22,896
Looks like we'd better add
that one to the list.

1498
01:46:26,025 --> 01:46:28,736
He's not a doer, he's a talker.

1499
01:46:30,195 --> 01:46:32,177
Which is probably worse.

1500
01:46:32,906 --> 01:46:36,452
He talks, you deny.

1501
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:43,542
"Another 1971 case in which I received
narcotics directly from Ciello...

1502
01:46:43,646 --> 01:46:46,670
...involved the arrest of three people
at a Spanish grocery...

1503
01:46:46,879 --> 01:46:50,946
...on the southeast corner of
122nd street and Lexington Avenue.

1504
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:55,221
A seizure was made at the house of
heroin, paraphernalia and guns.

1505
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:59,913
Ciello handed me three to four ounces of
heroin. " Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1506
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:05,022
Dan, this is George Polito,
chief prosecutor, Eastern District.

1507
01:47:05,231 --> 01:47:07,629
- Mind if I sit in?
- Something here you're working on?

1508
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:11,800
I hope not. How are you Louis?

1509
01:47:11,904 --> 01:47:13,364
George is on special assignment.

1510
01:47:13,573 --> 01:47:16,909
- You took the French Connection case?
- I still don't believe it.

1511
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:21,393
120 pounds of heroin waiting to be
used as evidence just vanishes?

1512
01:47:21,497 --> 01:47:23,896
From a police property office?
It's a farce.

1513
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:28,275
Not to me. I'm gonna nail whoever did it,
even if it means arresting the whole SIU.

1514
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:31,403
Well, George is interested
in the King's deposition.

1515
01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:34,948
Clearly, the King has
a lot of contacts with the SIU.

1516
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:36,930
So he claims.

1517
01:47:37,138 --> 01:47:40,371
But it's a known fact he was on
the federal payroll for four years.

1518
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:43,603
- Let's stop the quibbling.
- Thank you. I'm anxious to hear this.

1519
01:47:43,811 --> 01:47:46,001
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1520
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:50,276
Does the King suggest I was involved
in the French Connection rip-off?

1521
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:52,258
Let's get on with reading.

1522
01:47:52,362 --> 01:47:55,073
"To my personal knowledge,
Ciello supplied heroin...

1523
01:47:55,281 --> 01:47:58,097
...to many other individuals
I was personally involved with.

1524
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:01,433
On at least a dozen occasions,
Ciello and Marinaro notified me...

1525
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:04,040
...they had a package of heroin for me."
- Bullshit.

1526
01:48:04,249 --> 01:48:09,045
"Slim took a whole kilo each time, for
which he paid approximately $32,000.

1527
01:48:09,254 --> 01:48:13,008
For a long period of time, I gave
Ciello approximately $ 100 a week."

1528
01:48:13,216 --> 01:48:16,761
- This is sickening.
- He cites 14 other specific instances...

1529
01:48:16,866 --> 01:48:21,245
...of exchanges of heroin between Ciello
and himself and other perpetrators...

1530
01:48:21,454 --> 01:48:23,539
...and says
he bought you three automobiles.

1531
01:48:23,643 --> 01:48:25,833
- Oh, balls.
- lf this is true, Dan...

1532
01:48:25,937 --> 01:48:29,691
...one goddamn word of it,
then all our cases are down the drain.

1533
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,777
I'm never gonna get through this.

1534
01:48:31,985 --> 01:48:35,218
I mean, it's a fucking nightmare,
and it never stops.

1535
01:48:35,322 --> 01:48:38,242
I mean, I'm being forced to sit here,
listening to this shit...

1536
01:48:38,346 --> 01:48:41,265
...having to defend myself
to the guys I'm working with?

1537
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:44,289
I mean, are we
supposed to be partners...

1538
01:48:44,498 --> 01:48:46,688
...or what?
- Dan. Dan.

1539
01:48:46,896 --> 01:48:49,399
No one but the King, only the King...

1540
01:48:49,503 --> 01:48:51,380
...has accused you of anything.

1541
01:48:51,484 --> 01:48:55,342
What we must do is put the deposition
and its author in the shredder.

1542
01:48:55,551 --> 01:48:58,053
And we must do this
as expeditiously as possible...

1543
01:48:58,262 --> 01:49:01,077
...because Blomberg asked
for a reversal of his conviction...

1544
01:49:01,286 --> 01:49:03,163
...on the basis of this affidavit.

1545
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:05,039
I ask again, is this deposition true?

1546
01:49:05,248 --> 01:49:07,751
Any instance or detail?
Any goddamn word of it?

1547
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:10,670
If it is, I'll be practicing divorce law
in West Virginia.

1548
01:49:10,879 --> 01:49:12,026
None of it is true.

1549
01:49:12,234 --> 01:49:14,945
Gentlemen,
I think you should know this.

1550
01:49:15,154 --> 01:49:18,699
Nobody I've spoken to has ever
not mentioned your name, Ciello.

1551
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:20,785
You know what I hear
from every SIU man?

1552
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:22,766
Quote,
"I'm not saying I did anything...

1553
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:25,164
...but if so,
can I get the same deal as Ciello?"

1554
01:49:25,372 --> 01:49:29,231
- lf I heard it once, I heard it 50 times.
- Yeah, and you'll hear it 16 more, Polito.

1555
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:31,733
Because there are 70 detectives
in SIU...

1556
01:49:31,837 --> 01:49:34,236
...and all but four want my ass.
Give me a drink.

1557
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:38,198
Did you ever hear of a junkie
named Sancho?

1558
01:49:39,449 --> 01:49:41,013
A lot of them. Their names change.

1559
01:49:41,222 --> 01:49:44,559
Mike Blomberg's lawyer has a deposition
from a Frank Sancho...

1560
01:49:44,663 --> 01:49:47,374
...who says you kept him supplied
on a regular basis.

1561
01:49:47,582 --> 01:49:51,753
Also another junkie named Jose,
and his girlfriend, Jeannie.

1562
01:49:51,962 --> 01:49:55,716
Look, Mr. Santimassino, it's no secret
that we use informants that are junkies.

1563
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:57,488
- Did you sell Sancho heroin?
- No.

1564
01:49:57,593 --> 01:50:01,555
- Did you give him heroin?
- Forget Sancho. He's penny ante.

1565
01:50:01,763 --> 01:50:04,787
The King is the one that interests me.
It's a very detailed story.

1566
01:50:04,892 --> 01:50:06,873
No one's penny ante
if you catch him lying.

1567
01:50:07,081 --> 01:50:09,584
- It takes just one...
- Hey. You stop talking about me...

1568
01:50:09,792 --> 01:50:13,129
...like I'm not here. I'm here.
- Let's pick the King up.

1569
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:16,674
- I'm gonna put him on a lie detector.
- Will he consent?

1570
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:20,220
Why don't you just ask me
to take the test?

1571
01:50:20,324 --> 01:50:23,348
Yes, I'd like to know the answer to that.
Why haven't you?

1572
01:50:23,661 --> 01:50:25,120
Would you?

1573
01:50:27,414 --> 01:50:29,291
Fuck you all.

1574
01:50:30,438 --> 01:50:32,211
I'm going home.

1575
01:50:43,785 --> 01:50:47,226
Jeez. Yo, Mo, give me a hand here.

1576
01:50:47,956 --> 01:50:50,876
Killing myself. Jeez.

1577
01:51:19,238 --> 01:51:20,906
Papa.

1578
01:51:23,513 --> 01:51:26,745
Danny. You can't come in, Danny.

1579
01:51:26,954 --> 01:51:29,143
Nick's family, they don't want you.

1580
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:38,632
Danny, it breaks my heart. I know
you been trying to be a good guy.

1581
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:56,254
Come on.

1582
01:52:09,705 --> 01:52:12,312
Yeah, but Nick
wasn't under my protection.

1583
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:15,440
Now, honey, this may be
a totally unnecessary move...

1584
01:52:15,649 --> 01:52:18,881
...but we're making it anyway.
I'll have it all ready for you.

1585
01:52:19,507 --> 01:52:21,592
That's my gift to you.

1586
01:53:04,865 --> 01:53:06,534
Danny.

1587
01:53:49,389 --> 01:53:52,309
Well, what do you think?

1588
01:54:00,546 --> 01:54:05,864
Okay, baby. It's okay. Okay.

1589
01:54:05,969 --> 01:54:10,035
- It's all right.
- Oh, Danny. Oh, my God, Danny.

1590
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:13,685
It's everything I ever wanted.
Just not this way.

1591
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:17,647
I know, baby. I know. It's okay.

1592
01:54:19,107 --> 01:54:21,297
- Is my tie red?
- No.

1593
01:54:22,756 --> 01:54:25,885
- Are the walls white?
- No.

1594
01:54:26,302 --> 01:54:29,847
<i>Did you regularly give money
to Detective Ciello?</i>

1595
01:54:30,055 --> 01:54:31,411
<i>Yes.</i>

1596
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,184
<i>- Are you a German citizen?
- No.</i>

1597
01:54:33,288 --> 01:54:35,165
The traffic was murder.

1598
01:54:37,459 --> 01:54:40,796
Your friend has requested that if
he passes the test, the government...

1599
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:45,383
...should return him to steady
employment and give him $5000.

1600
01:54:45,905 --> 01:54:49,346
And we said we'd be glad
to meet those terms.

1601
01:54:49,554 --> 01:54:51,848
Dan, I don't think you know
Mario Vincente.

1602
01:54:51,953 --> 01:54:55,081
He's going to try the case
against Caprice.

1603
01:54:56,124 --> 01:54:59,460
- Does a cat bark?
- No.

1604
01:54:59,773 --> 01:55:03,527
- Did you give Dan Ciello 3 automobiles?
- Yes.

1605
01:55:03,944 --> 01:55:06,968
<i>- Did the Cadillac...?
- Ciello, if this test is positive...</i>

1606
01:55:07,176 --> 01:55:09,470
...I'll prosecute you myself.

1607
01:55:11,556 --> 01:55:15,727
Thank you very much.
We appreciate your cooperation.

1608
01:55:17,291 --> 01:55:20,627
The man was very relaxed, very easy.

1609
01:55:24,903 --> 01:55:27,926
Every time he answered yes,
the needle went off the edge of page.

1610
01:55:28,031 --> 01:55:30,533
My God, what a relief.
I haven't slept for five days.

1611
01:55:30,742 --> 01:55:34,287
- Okay, it's a one, two, three is positive...
- Mr. Santimassino...

1612
01:55:34,496 --> 01:55:37,102
- What?
- lf you don't mind, I'd like to go home.

1613
01:55:37,207 --> 01:55:39,084
Of course.

1614
01:55:39,605 --> 01:55:42,733
- Question four, five, six is a positive.
- Here?

1615
01:55:42,942 --> 01:55:47,425
Yeah, right here. Six. And this is seven.
And eight.

1616
01:55:51,492 --> 01:55:53,682
You did it again.
You got out of it, didn't you?

1617
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:55,767
Detective Ciello?

1618
01:55:56,914 --> 01:55:59,208
U.S. Attorney's office.

1619
01:56:02,336 --> 01:56:06,716
I wanted to talk to you. I was
gonna invite myself home with you.

1620
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:10,469
It's Friday. I only get to see
my family on the weekends.

1621
01:56:10,678 --> 01:56:13,806
Well, I've got to be down in Washington.
We could share the ride.

1622
01:56:14,015 --> 01:56:15,579
Suit yourself.

1623
01:56:15,787 --> 01:56:20,480
- This is Tug Barnes and Chippy.
- Mario Vincente.

1624
01:56:21,522 --> 01:56:24,025
Boy, you don't travel light, eh?

1625
01:56:29,447 --> 01:56:34,035
I like the King.
He's just trying to earn.

1626
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:41,960
It's the poor fucking junkies
that beat your ass. Sancho, Jose...

1627
01:56:43,315 --> 01:56:44,984
...little Jeannie.

1628
01:56:46,965 --> 01:56:49,572
They break your heart, junkies.

1629
01:56:51,031 --> 01:56:53,951
All you try and do
is get them through the night.

1630
01:56:54,368 --> 01:56:56,453
Ten years later,
some legal eagle takes it...

1631
01:56:56,558 --> 01:57:00,103
...and starts pulling your fingernails
out one by one.

1632
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:08,028
If that polygraph machine
had one wrong line on it...

1633
01:57:08,758 --> 01:57:11,677
...Santimassino
would have crucified me.

1634
01:57:11,886 --> 01:57:17,412
- But it didn't. It vindicated you.
- But it could have gone the other way.

1635
01:57:19,289 --> 01:57:23,251
You know why those tests
are inadmissible in court as well as me.

1636
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:28,256
Some guy is a little schitzy,
believes what he's saying...

1637
01:57:30,029 --> 01:57:33,574
...and if he believes it,
it won't show up on the machine.

1638
01:57:35,034 --> 01:57:37,120
Or somebody like me.

1639
01:57:38,788 --> 01:57:42,125
Ask me a question
and I feel like I'm lying...

1640
01:57:42,437 --> 01:57:44,836
...even though I'm telling the truth.

1641
01:57:48,172 --> 01:57:52,448
It's been so long since I didn't
have to think about my answer.

1642
01:57:54,846 --> 01:57:56,201
Man.

1643
01:57:59,642 --> 01:58:03,083
I was on the streets undercover for...

1644
01:58:09,027 --> 01:58:11,112
...10 years?

1645
01:58:14,658 --> 01:58:17,786
I don't know
what the truth is anymore.

1646
01:58:19,975 --> 01:58:22,791
There's only one thing
I knew for sure today.

1647
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:28,630
Santimassino, Polito...

1648
01:58:29,673 --> 01:58:31,758
...all those guys...

1649
01:58:34,156 --> 01:58:36,659
...they are not my friends.

1650
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:39,683
No, sir.

1651
01:58:41,351 --> 01:58:43,645
They are not my friends.

1652
01:58:46,461 --> 01:58:48,025
So...

1653
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:53,655
...what was it you wanted
to talk to me about, Mr. Vincente?

1654
01:58:53,864 --> 01:58:55,845
Nothing in particular.

1655
01:58:56,366 --> 01:58:59,495
It's just that we're gonna be spending
a lot of time together...

1656
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:02,310
...and I just wanted a chance
to get to know you better.

1657
01:59:03,248 --> 01:59:04,708
My name is Mario.

1658
01:59:07,628 --> 01:59:09,192
You wanna be my friend, Mario?

1659
01:59:39,535 --> 01:59:43,289
I have a clear mandate to the city.
Clean it up.

1660
01:59:43,497 --> 01:59:46,626
Gentlemen, I am gonna
tear this town apart.

1661
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:49,754
And I'm gonna start
with the French Connection rip-off.

1662
01:59:49,962 --> 01:59:52,673
And the reason I'm gonna start
with the French Connection...

1663
01:59:52,882 --> 01:59:54,759
...is because it's a goddamn outrage.

1664
01:59:54,967 --> 01:59:57,574
And I have already promised
it's going to be solved.

1665
01:59:57,783 --> 02:00:01,745
So what you are gonna do, gentlemen,
is you're gonna make my word good.

1666
02:00:01,954 --> 02:00:04,560
The target is cops.
The weapon is indictments.

1667
02:00:04,769 --> 02:00:07,688
And I don't give
one infinitesimal fuck...

1668
02:00:07,897 --> 02:00:10,400
...if they're indictments that will stick
or not.

1669
02:00:10,608 --> 02:00:13,736
Because to a cop, any indictment
means a departmental trial...

1670
02:00:13,945 --> 02:00:15,613
<i>...which is a euphemism for fini!</i>

1671
02:00:15,822 --> 02:00:18,741
End of gun, badge, pension and pals!

1672
02:00:18,846 --> 02:00:21,452
So I want cops' names.
And if I don't get them...

1673
02:00:21,661 --> 02:00:23,955
...I'm gonna drop cops
and start on DAs.

1674
02:00:24,163 --> 02:00:26,040
I want names.

1675
02:00:26,145 --> 02:00:29,377
We'll start alphabetically.
We'll start with A.

1676
02:00:29,586 --> 02:00:30,941
Give me an A.

1677
02:00:31,671 --> 02:00:34,174
Mr. Kanter, I have an A.

1678
02:00:34,591 --> 02:00:38,553
Possibly perjury,
but a very weak case.

1679
02:00:38,762 --> 02:00:40,013
We got an A.

1680
02:00:40,221 --> 02:00:41,473
Give it to me.

1681
02:00:41,681 --> 02:00:43,975
Alvarez, Raf Alvarez.

1682
02:00:44,705 --> 02:00:47,103
I and Detective Lewis Dooley
and Joe Carpo...

1683
02:00:47,312 --> 02:00:50,231
...held back 5 kilos out
of that particular seizure.

1684
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,691
We sold it.

1685
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:54,194
We also sold prisoners their freedom.

1686
02:00:54,402 --> 02:00:58,573
Overall, we must've ripped off a couple
hundred thousand bucks from dealers.

1687
02:00:58,678 --> 02:01:00,137
Maybe more.

1688
02:01:00,346 --> 02:01:02,953
You asked me before about perjury.

1689
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:05,559
About 20 times in court.

1690
02:01:05,664 --> 02:01:08,583
I don't know why you people
don't understand the system?

1691
02:01:08,792 --> 02:01:12,233
You wanna conviction, but you got
these stupid search and seizure laws...

1692
02:01:12,441 --> 02:01:14,214
...and wiretaps.

1693
02:01:14,318 --> 02:01:17,446
Case one never got made
without an illegal wiretap.

1694
02:01:17,551 --> 02:01:21,722
And you're never get a conviction
if a cop don't commit perjury.

1695
02:01:21,826 --> 02:01:23,807
What is it that you want?

1696
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:26,727
You want the big dealer
out of business?

1697
02:01:26,935 --> 02:01:30,481
The only way I know to push him
out of business is to steal his cash.

1698
02:01:30,689 --> 02:01:34,443
Otherwise, somewhere down the line,
he's gonna buy out.

1699
02:01:34,547 --> 02:01:39,135
He'll buy himself a bondsman,
a DA, a judge.

1700
02:01:39,239 --> 02:01:43,306
The scumbag dealer is back on
the streets before the arresting officer.

1701
02:01:43,515 --> 02:01:46,851
The only way I know how to stop him
is to steal his cash.

1702
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:48,832
As far as selling them their freedom...

1703
02:01:49,041 --> 02:01:51,335
...I never once sold
a dealer his freedom...

1704
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:54,880
...unless I didn't have enough evidence
to make the bust legal.

1705
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:57,591
I'll give you all the details you want.

1706
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,075
But what I'll never give you is what
happened to the 120 pounds of heroin.

1707
02:02:02,283 --> 02:02:04,265
I didn't do it.

1708
02:02:04,995 --> 02:02:07,706
Why don't you talk to your friend,
Ciello?

1709
02:02:09,478 --> 02:02:11,355
Didn't you ever think of that?

1710
02:02:11,772 --> 02:02:14,379
Why is it that Ciello
is getting away with all this shit...

1711
02:02:14,588 --> 02:02:16,986
...and you tell me I'm a dead man?

1712
02:02:19,488 --> 02:02:21,782
Because you're a bunch
of fucking hypocrites.

1713
02:02:23,242 --> 02:02:25,536
Can you give us any evidence
against Ciello?

1714
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:27,934
I never worked with him...

1715
02:02:28,039 --> 02:02:29,811
...but I worked with Gus Levy.

1716
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:32,522
I don't give a shit that he's working
for you guys now.

1717
02:02:32,731 --> 02:02:35,546
I know things about Levy.
And Levy worked with Ciello.

1718
02:02:36,068 --> 02:02:38,466
Can you give us any evidence
against Levy?

1719
02:02:40,968 --> 02:02:42,011
Maybe.

1720
02:02:42,428 --> 02:02:45,348
For the very reason you told me.
A polygraph is not admissible in court.

1721
02:02:45,556 --> 02:02:49,102
Blomberg's motion for a new trial is
based entirely on the King's deposition.

1722
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:51,813
- You've gotta deny it.
- What's happening with Alvarez?

1723
02:02:52,021 --> 02:02:54,315
- Is he gonna get a deal?
- He's cooperating fully.

1724
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:57,756
Didn't you recommended Gus Levy
for that job in the Garment Center?

1725
02:02:57,861 --> 02:03:00,884
Is that fuck Alvarez trying
to pin something on Gus?

1726
02:03:01,301 --> 02:03:02,657
Hey!

1727
02:03:08,392 --> 02:03:10,165
- Mr. Dana.
- Yeah.

1728
02:03:10,373 --> 02:03:13,814
My name's Estrada.
I'd like to talk to you.

1729
02:03:14,023 --> 02:03:15,900
Let's take a walk.

1730
02:03:20,905 --> 02:03:22,156
Listen...

1731
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:25,597
...tell that chiseler his overhead goes
down when my overhead goes down.

1732
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:28,516
I ain't paying freight
on his featherbed.

1733
02:03:28,725 --> 02:03:31,019
My office is bugged.

1734
02:03:31,228 --> 02:03:33,730
When we first started,
I unloaded everything myself.

1735
02:03:33,939 --> 02:03:36,963
Only way I could get an honest count
till I figured out controls.

1736
02:03:37,067 --> 02:03:40,612
- Last six months, we've been in profit.
- Congratulations.

1737
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:43,115
Well, the work's congenial.

1738
02:03:46,764 --> 02:03:49,788
I heard you travel with an army
these days. Where's all the guns?

1739
02:03:49,892 --> 02:03:51,352
Gave them the slip.

1740
02:03:51,456 --> 02:03:53,646
Yeah, what's so important?

1741
02:03:54,167 --> 02:03:55,419
They got Alvarez.

1742
02:03:55,627 --> 02:03:59,485
Yeah, I heard. I heard he's
a regular little chatterbox, huh?

1743
02:03:59,694 --> 02:04:01,362
He was your partner, Gus.

1744
02:04:01,466 --> 02:04:02,822
He can't hurt me.

1745
02:04:03,031 --> 02:04:05,116
I never let that spic
put one penny in my hand.

1746
02:04:05,325 --> 02:04:06,889
Let him yap.

1747
02:04:10,538 --> 02:04:13,666
Son of a bitch never takes a full load.

1748
02:04:16,065 --> 02:04:18,567
Paige has set you up
with one hell of a front here.

1749
02:04:18,671 --> 02:04:22,634
Cute, huh? When it's all over,
I'm gonna keep my costume.

1750
02:04:28,264 --> 02:04:30,871
Alvarez doesn't have
to hurt you much, Gus.

1751
02:04:30,975 --> 02:04:32,227
Just a little.

1752
02:04:32,435 --> 02:04:35,876
It's Kanter and a prosecutor
named Polito.

1753
02:04:35,981 --> 02:04:39,422
These guys have got this French
Connection thing like a fly on their nose.

1754
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:41,820
And it's gonna hurt everybody.

1755
02:04:42,028 --> 02:04:44,531
I didn't steal the fucking
120 pounds of horse.

1756
02:04:44,635 --> 02:04:46,095
Did you?

1757
02:04:46,199 --> 02:04:48,597
Jesus Christ, Gus.

1758
02:04:49,327 --> 02:04:53,603
You're losing your sense of humor, kid.
It's the company you've been keeping.

1759
02:04:53,707 --> 02:04:57,878
- These... These are very serious guys.
- Fuck them.

1760
02:04:58,712 --> 02:05:00,380
But I know what you came here for.

1761
02:05:00,589 --> 02:05:04,551
- To say, "I'm okay, you're okay."
- Yeah, I mean...

1762
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:07,888
...they wanna get you so you'll get me.
Then I'll come back at you.

1763
02:05:08,096 --> 02:05:12,059
So, what do we got to worry about?
Nobody can give us up but each other.

1764
02:05:16,751 --> 02:05:19,253
Danny, I'm sorry.
I keep trying to avoid these Fridays.

1765
02:05:20,505 --> 02:05:22,590
But this is important, let me ask you.

1766
02:05:22,799 --> 02:05:26,448
Do you remember a bust you made
when you first came into SIU?

1767
02:05:26,552 --> 02:05:28,221
This may help you.

1768
02:05:51,578 --> 02:05:55,123
How can you let a piece of shit
come in here and spit at me?

1769
02:06:00,337 --> 02:06:02,526
I'm a police officer.

1770
02:06:03,361 --> 02:06:04,925
What are you?

1771
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:09,617
- Do you remember him?
- Yes, I remember him. He's shit.

1772
02:06:11,077 --> 02:06:12,536
Danny, tell me about the case.

1773
02:06:14,101 --> 02:06:17,542
You were working with Gus Levy,
Bill Mayo and Dom Bando, right?

1774
02:06:20,878 --> 02:06:23,589
It was a very sweet bust.

1775
02:06:28,073 --> 02:06:29,533
He's a Lebanese dealer.

1776
02:06:29,637 --> 02:06:31,514
We arrested him.

1777
02:06:31,723 --> 02:06:34,329
He offered us 5000.

1778
02:06:34,955 --> 02:06:37,666
And we added attempted bribery.

1779
02:06:39,126 --> 02:06:42,045
Mr. Halazi out there says someone
took $400 from him, Danny.

1780
02:06:42,254 --> 02:06:43,922
Which one of you took the 400?

1781
02:06:44,339 --> 02:06:46,529
Or did you split it four ways?

1782
02:06:49,032 --> 02:06:50,909
That scumbag offered us 5000.

1783
02:06:51,013 --> 02:06:53,724
And you're saying we split 400?

1784
02:06:53,932 --> 02:06:56,226
I'm not saying it.
Mr. Halazi is saying it.

1785
02:06:56,435 --> 02:06:58,312
I never saw his fucking $400.

1786
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,980
Danny, one of you saw it.

1787
02:07:00,606 --> 02:07:03,526
Oh, Christ, Polito, I'm really
trying not to hate you.

1788
02:07:06,758 --> 02:07:09,156
Look, even if it did happen,
which it didn't...

1789
02:07:10,407 --> 02:07:13,119
...don't you think I might not have
known about him?

1790
02:07:14,266 --> 02:07:17,081
Danny, in my opinion, no.
I don't think it's possible.

1791
02:07:17,602 --> 02:07:19,896
You took whenever
there was anything to take.

1792
02:07:20,001 --> 02:07:24,380
I think you shared in everything.
I think you were in on Halazi's 400.

1793
02:07:24,588 --> 02:07:27,300
And I also think
I can get an indictment.

1794
02:07:29,385 --> 02:07:31,992
You are a fucking lunatic.

1795
02:07:33,035 --> 02:07:36,371
You can't make a nutcase accusation
like that stick, not on me.

1796
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:39,916
If not you, then on Levy,
Marinaro, Mayo.

1797
02:07:40,438 --> 02:07:44,192
Half the SIU will be coming in here,
and they will cooperate.

1798
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,173
They will not cooperate.

1799
02:07:48,571 --> 02:07:51,074
Danny, nearly all of them
will cooperate.

1800
02:07:51,178 --> 02:07:54,932
They're cops. In their hearts
they want to admit their guilt.

1801
02:07:55,036 --> 02:07:57,330
That's the way cops are,
that's how you got here.

1802
02:07:57,538 --> 02:07:58,894
Don't you understand this?

1803
02:08:08,278 --> 02:08:12,137
Danny, Polito's pulling in Gus Levy
next week. He's going to indict him.

1804
02:08:12,345 --> 02:08:15,160
- On what?
- Four-hundred-dollar job.

1805
02:08:15,265 --> 02:08:18,706
It's me he's after, right?
Okay. I mean, he wants me, right?

1806
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:22,355
Whatever you wanna tell me, I won't
give to Polito. Let him make his case.

1807
02:08:23,398 --> 02:08:28,716
Mario, I don't know a fuck
about the missing junk, okay? Nothing.

1808
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:31,010
And I don't think
Gus Levy does either.

1809
02:08:31,218 --> 02:08:34,034
Or the famous $400. Shit.

1810
02:08:34,138 --> 02:08:38,413
So far, every allegation against you,
the King's, Halazi's, it's all unsupported.

1811
02:08:38,622 --> 02:08:42,480
If just one cop comes in and
corroborates anything, you'll go to jail.

1812
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:45,504
Not me, no one can save you.

1813
02:08:46,963 --> 02:08:50,926
Gus Levy is not gonna put me in jail,
Mario.

1814
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:55,097
Carla, call the kids. It's ready.

1815
02:08:55,409 --> 02:08:57,808
- The indictment is bullshit.
- Take a lie-detector test.

1816
02:08:58,016 --> 02:09:01,040
- You didn't do it. So take the test.
- You take the fucking test.

1817
02:09:01,457 --> 02:09:05,315
That guinea prosecutor ain't getting
yes, no or maybe out of me.

1818
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:07,401
I'll never cooperate.

1819
02:09:07,609 --> 02:09:11,676
Don't let one of the three-piece suits get
you in a room and tell you I'm talking.

1820
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:13,553
I ain't talking.

1821
02:09:13,657 --> 02:09:17,411
- Like they say, we hang together, kid...
- Gus, Gus. Gus...

1822
02:09:17,619 --> 02:09:22,207
...they could cut me up in little pieces,
and they'll never get nothing out of me.

1823
02:09:32,635 --> 02:09:34,511
Was he wired?

1824
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,327
Don't trust him.
He's going down the tubes.

1825
02:09:45,356 --> 02:09:49,318
You indict me on the squawk of a dealer
who tried to buy me out of a bust?

1826
02:09:49,735 --> 02:09:53,906
You wanna break up an operation that'll
put away more mob guys in a year...

1827
02:09:54,115 --> 02:09:57,034
...than you'll touch your whole career?
- Detective Levy...

1828
02:09:57,243 --> 02:10:01,726
...you're hardly in a position...
- All right, you fuck!

1829
02:10:02,248 --> 02:10:05,585
I'll tell you what I'm in a position to do,
throw you out the window!

1830
02:10:05,793 --> 02:10:08,817
It's the fifth floor. I'll try to aim
so you land on your head.

1831
02:10:08,921 --> 02:10:12,571
Levy, you can easily avoid trial.
All you have to do is cooperate.

1832
02:10:12,675 --> 02:10:16,429
Fuck it. You got your mind made up
to try me? Go ahead and try me.

1833
02:10:17,054 --> 02:10:18,827
But not for a lousy $400.

1834
02:10:19,036 --> 02:10:21,330
At least get me for assault.

1835
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:32,695
You never even looked
at Bobby's drawings.

1836
02:10:32,904 --> 02:10:35,406
He's been waiting all week
to show them to you.

1837
02:10:35,615 --> 02:10:37,909
His teacher says they were the best.

1838
02:10:38,117 --> 02:10:40,099
Things are getting bad.

1839
02:10:43,227 --> 02:10:45,312
Goddamn it,
my gums are bleeding again.

1840
02:10:48,128 --> 02:10:50,213
What's so bad, Danny?

1841
02:10:53,445 --> 02:10:55,218
I mean, we've gone through it.

1842
02:10:56,469 --> 02:10:58,763
It's over, the bad part.

1843
02:10:58,972 --> 02:11:01,683
I never thought we'd survive it,
but we did.

1844
02:11:04,081 --> 02:11:06,375
It's coming to an end. Everything.

1845
02:11:06,792 --> 02:11:08,565
Everything what?

1846
02:11:10,963 --> 02:11:13,987
Gus thinks what he's doing
for Paige is gonna protect him.

1847
02:11:14,196 --> 02:11:15,655
It's not.

1848
02:11:16,594 --> 02:11:19,409
They'll indict him for bad breath
if that's all they got.

1849
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,789
Gus?

1850
02:11:25,978 --> 02:11:28,064
They're gonna indict Gus?

1851
02:11:37,865 --> 02:11:40,055
You don't need that many.

1852
02:11:46,833 --> 02:11:49,127
Don't tell me what I need.

1853
02:11:52,151 --> 02:11:54,132
Dan, listen.

1854
02:11:54,653 --> 02:11:58,824
Polito is getting an indictment against
you. I'm coming on the next shuttle.

1855
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:08,626
Now, you're telling me to trust Polito
instead of my own people?

1856
02:12:08,834 --> 02:12:11,754
Your people are out to get you worse
than anybody on our side.

1857
02:12:11,858 --> 02:12:14,256
Internal Affairs, DEA, the regulars.

1858
02:12:14,778 --> 02:12:17,802
Nothing you ever say or do
is ever gonna convince them...

1859
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:19,887
...that you're not a rat.

1860
02:12:20,408 --> 02:12:24,684
Danny, Danny, the police,
they hate you.

1861
02:12:26,352 --> 02:12:28,229
You've run out of options.

1862
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:31,148
You've got to tell the truth,
whatever it is.

1863
02:12:33,651 --> 02:12:35,945
I will not give up my partners.

1864
02:12:36,571 --> 02:12:38,239
I will not cross that line, ever.

1865
02:12:38,656 --> 02:12:41,888
Don't you realize that by just
saying that, you've confessed?

1866
02:12:41,993 --> 02:12:45,225
- You've confessed you're all in it.
- My goddamn gums are killing me.

1867
02:12:45,329 --> 02:12:48,666
You've gotta tell us what you guys did.
Stop protecting your partners.

1868
02:12:48,770 --> 02:12:50,126
You'll be the one under oath.

1869
02:12:50,334 --> 02:12:53,150
I'm not so goddamn sure
that if the positions were reversed...

1870
02:12:53,358 --> 02:12:56,486
...your partners wouldn't face reality
better than you're doing.

1871
02:12:56,591 --> 02:12:59,302
- I know about your partners.
- Nothing. You know nothing.

1872
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:01,909
My partners would never give me up.
Never.

1873
02:13:02,013 --> 02:13:05,350
If you go on the stand and you lie,
you're finished. They'll get you.

1874
02:13:05,558 --> 02:13:07,539
- No, they won't.
- They will. They're snipers.

1875
02:13:07,748 --> 02:13:10,042
They'll pick you off one at a time.
I promise you.

1876
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:13,274
Your hope is to tell the truth
and make your partners come in.

1877
02:13:13,379 --> 02:13:16,194
- I won't give up my partners.
- It's the way you'll save them.

1878
02:13:16,402 --> 02:13:19,531
- I will not give up my partners.
- Danny, help me to help you.

1879
02:13:19,635 --> 02:13:21,199
- No.
- You must understand...

1880
02:13:21,303 --> 02:13:24,119
...whether you wanna help your
friends or not and you can't...

1881
02:13:24,327 --> 02:13:29,749
...just about every detective that ever
worked in SIU, Danny, is going to jail.

1882
02:13:36,214 --> 02:13:37,987
Okay.

1883
02:13:54,462 --> 02:13:56,964
I hate it around here on holidays.

1884
02:13:57,903 --> 02:13:59,988
It's like everything died.

1885
02:14:02,699 --> 02:14:05,619
It's radiation, science fiction.

1886
02:14:05,827 --> 02:14:08,538
Yeah, I feel the same way.

1887
02:14:12,292 --> 02:14:15,838
Well, I guess we better start
with the worst, Danny.

1888
02:14:16,672 --> 02:14:21,260
You know, there's a wonderful quote,
man named Thomas De Quincey.

1889
02:14:22,928 --> 02:14:24,492
He wrote:

1890
02:14:26,369 --> 02:14:28,454
"If once a man indulges in murder...

1891
02:14:28,663 --> 02:14:31,791
...very soon he comes
to think little of robbing...

1892
02:14:31,895 --> 02:14:34,607
...and from robbing he comes next
to drinking...

1893
02:14:34,815 --> 02:14:36,379
...and Sabbath-breaking...

1894
02:14:36,588 --> 02:14:41,906
...and from that to incivility
and procrastination."

1895
02:14:45,659 --> 02:14:47,328
Yeah.

1896
02:14:48,370 --> 02:14:52,958
Well, I never indulged
myself in murder.

1897
02:14:54,314 --> 02:14:57,859
And I didn't have anything to do with
the French Connection rip-off either.

1898
02:14:59,319 --> 02:15:01,926
You really thought I did,
didn't you, Mario?

1899
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:05,680
Danny, you... It was possible.

1900
02:15:07,661 --> 02:15:10,893
Did you ever sell narcotics?

1901
02:15:13,083 --> 02:15:14,856
I never sold narcotics. I gave.

1902
02:15:15,168 --> 02:15:17,671
In Narcotics you have
to supply your informants.

1903
02:15:17,879 --> 02:15:19,861
There's no other way. That's it.

1904
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:23,197
Under the law, a gift of narcotics
is the same as a sale.

1905
02:15:23,406 --> 02:15:25,074
- Drop it.
- I know the law.

1906
02:15:25,283 --> 02:15:27,472
The law doesn't know the streets.

1907
02:15:27,785 --> 02:15:30,601
Tell me about the biggest score
you ever made.

1908
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:34,042
It was a beautiful bust.

1909
02:15:35,501 --> 02:15:37,274
A bunch of South Americans.

1910
02:15:37,483 --> 02:15:39,359
Very big dealers.

1911
02:15:40,194 --> 02:15:42,383
We arraigned five of them.

1912
02:15:43,009 --> 02:15:45,199
Woman in a mink coat, right?

1913
02:15:45,512 --> 02:15:48,014
Not a fucking thing on underneath.

1914
02:15:50,099 --> 02:15:51,976
Who made the bust?

1915
02:16:08,556 --> 02:16:09,911
Me...

1916
02:16:10,433 --> 02:16:15,229
...Gus Levy, Joe Marinaro, Bill Mayo.

1917
02:16:15,333 --> 02:16:17,002
My unit.

1918
02:16:18,044 --> 02:16:20,443
Dom Bando was on tail.

1919
02:16:21,068 --> 02:16:23,258
We broke into this joint.

1920
02:16:25,343 --> 02:16:26,595
We got five perpetrators...

1921
02:16:26,803 --> 02:16:32,955
...five kilos of pure heroin,
suitcase full of money, 92,000 bucks.

1922
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:35,771
What did you take?
The junk, the money?

1923
02:16:35,979 --> 02:16:38,273
- Both?
- I told you, it was a great bust.

1924
02:16:38,482 --> 02:16:41,923
Five kilos of pure,
and we all got commendations.

1925
02:16:43,278 --> 02:16:45,051
You took the money.

1926
02:16:47,345 --> 02:16:50,264
We took some. Half the money, okay?

1927
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:53,810
Forty-six thousand.

1928
02:16:55,895 --> 02:16:59,545
We let them have enough for bail
and put them on the next plane out.

1929
02:16:59,753 --> 02:17:02,881
Those South American pricks bought
their way out of everything.

1930
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:06,322
So we did what no court ever did.

1931
02:17:06,844 --> 02:17:09,346
We gave them a heavy fine
and deported them.

1932
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:12,579
So you split $46,000 four ways.

1933
02:17:12,683 --> 02:17:14,143
Five ways.

1934
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:16,020
Dom was on lookout.

1935
02:17:17,271 --> 02:17:19,669
Bando wasn't in.
How would he know about the money?

1936
02:17:20,191 --> 02:17:23,319
We don't cheat. Everybody's in.

1937
02:17:23,527 --> 02:17:25,404
That's the rule.

1938
02:17:37,395 --> 02:17:39,898
Look, Dom is a very soft guy.

1939
02:17:41,149 --> 02:17:44,173
All he wants is to be in a safe place.

1940
02:17:44,903 --> 02:17:47,718
I want your permission
to talk to him, Mario.

1941
02:17:48,448 --> 02:17:49,804
He'll come in.

1942
02:17:50,429 --> 02:17:52,202
Will you help?

1943
02:17:53,558 --> 02:17:54,913
Okay.

1944
02:17:55,747 --> 02:17:58,876
Stay there, you bastard!
You're here to hurt me!

1945
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:00,752
- No.
- You want me to come in?

1946
02:18:00,961 --> 02:18:03,985
And what am I gonna tell them?
I don't know nothing.

1947
02:18:04,089 --> 02:18:05,340
I did tails.

1948
02:18:05,549 --> 02:18:07,426
I never seen the inside of nothing.

1949
02:18:07,634 --> 02:18:10,450
I'd follow a guy for three days,
you'd tell me to go home.

1950
02:18:10,658 --> 02:18:13,578
I go home, you tell me to tail
somebody else.

1951
02:18:13,995 --> 02:18:15,976
All you gotta do is tell them that.

1952
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:17,853
Bullshit!

1953
02:18:18,791 --> 02:18:22,128
You think they'd believe me
after the stink you guys left?

1954
02:18:22,232 --> 02:18:24,422
You know what I did with my cut?

1955
02:18:24,839 --> 02:18:27,550
I gave it to my priest. Yeah.

1956
02:18:27,759 --> 02:18:30,470
You want Internal Affairs
to start questioning my priest?

1957
02:18:30,678 --> 02:18:33,494
- Dom!
- I hope you choke on my name.

1958
02:18:45,485 --> 02:18:49,969
You prosecute Bando, and you're gonna
have another Mascone on your head.

1959
02:18:50,177 --> 02:18:54,244
He gave all his money to the church,
for Christ's sake.

1960
02:18:54,453 --> 02:18:56,642
- He won't come in.
- lf he doesn't come in...

1961
02:18:56,747 --> 02:19:00,083
...it doesn't matter what he did.
He took it. We're gonna nail him.

1962
02:19:00,292 --> 02:19:02,794
Okay, then I'm through.
Not another fucking word.

1963
02:19:03,003 --> 02:19:06,131
- I'm gonna call Marinaro and Mayo.
- No, no, no.

1964
02:19:06,235 --> 02:19:08,634
- And I gotta make them come in.
- No way, Danny.

1965
02:19:08,738 --> 02:19:12,596
- You gotta help them. It's the only way.
- I said I would, Danny.

1966
02:19:13,222 --> 02:19:14,577
Who's the best bet?

1967
02:19:20,521 --> 02:19:22,710
Levy. No.

1968
02:19:23,753 --> 02:19:26,881
Marinaro. He's got a wife and kids.

1969
02:19:28,967 --> 02:19:30,635
Marinaro.

1970
02:19:32,095 --> 02:19:34,493
You can try with Marinaro.

1971
02:19:35,119 --> 02:19:37,413
If you can get Marinaro to come in...

1972
02:19:37,621 --> 02:19:38,872
...you can try with Mayo.

1973
02:19:39,811 --> 02:19:42,731
See, if you can turn
Marinaro and Mayo...

1974
02:19:42,835 --> 02:19:47,006
...then maybe the three of you
can get Levy to come in.

1975
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,134
Marinaro is first.

1976
02:20:04,836 --> 02:20:06,713
Be all right?

1977
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:08,694
Christ, Danny.

1978
02:20:08,903 --> 02:20:11,301
I'm only two months
from my pension, man.

1979
02:20:12,135 --> 02:20:14,429
This ain't ever gonna be all right.

1980
02:20:16,306 --> 02:20:17,870
You told them everything?

1981
02:20:19,121 --> 02:20:21,624
- Yeah.
- What about Gus and Bill?

1982
02:20:21,833 --> 02:20:24,127
<i>I'm gonna call them both.</i>

1983
02:20:24,335 --> 02:20:26,525
What the hell are we supposed to do?

1984
02:20:26,629 --> 02:20:29,132
All four of us walk in hand in hand?

1985
02:20:30,591 --> 02:20:32,677
<i>I'll fly in tonight.</i>

1986
02:20:36,326 --> 02:20:38,099
Okay, now I call Mayo.

1987
02:20:38,308 --> 02:20:40,497
No, no, no, Danny, look,
you've done good work.

1988
02:20:40,706 --> 02:20:44,877
Go home, take a shower,
have a drink.

1989
02:20:45,398 --> 02:20:47,692
Call Mayo from Virginia.

1990
02:20:48,735 --> 02:20:51,133
Yeah, I don't wanna...
I don't wanna call Mayo.

1991
02:20:51,342 --> 02:20:53,636
I wanna talk to him.
I wanna see him.

1992
02:20:54,574 --> 02:20:56,347
Mario, listen.

1993
02:20:57,494 --> 02:20:59,370
Mayo's...

1994
02:21:00,517 --> 02:21:02,916
You know, he lives by himself.

1995
02:21:03,541 --> 02:21:05,940
His mother just died.

1996
02:21:06,044 --> 02:21:08,964
You see, he's got nothing but cops.

1997
02:21:11,779 --> 02:21:15,637
Mario, he drinks too much.

1998
02:21:16,263 --> 02:21:18,974
This is not a tough cop.

1999
02:21:19,078 --> 02:21:21,372
Please let me go see him.

2000
02:21:22,415 --> 02:21:25,438
No, Danny, it's not safe.

2001
02:21:25,647 --> 02:21:27,107
Jesus.

2002
02:21:27,315 --> 02:21:31,591
It's okay. My primary
responsibility is to you.

2003
02:21:31,799 --> 02:21:34,093
And you call him from Virginia.

2004
02:21:34,197 --> 02:21:35,761
Danny.

2005
02:23:00,013 --> 02:23:01,265
Mayo here.

2006
02:23:01,369 --> 02:23:03,246
<i>Bill, it's Danny.</i>

2007
02:23:03,350 --> 02:23:04,914
Hey, Danny, what's up?

2008
02:23:05,957 --> 02:23:08,251
Bill, we gotta talk.

2009
02:23:12,734 --> 02:23:14,924
There's nothing to say, Danny.

2010
02:23:15,133 --> 02:23:17,010
You're gonna name me, right?

2011
02:23:18,261 --> 02:23:19,512
Right.

2012
02:23:19,721 --> 02:23:21,806
Spoke to Joe already.

2013
02:23:23,162 --> 02:23:24,934
<i>What about Gus?</i>

2014
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:29,314
Not yet.

2015
02:23:29,939 --> 02:23:32,442
It took me all night just to call you.

2016
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:35,674
How bad is it gonna be, Danny?

2017
02:23:35,883 --> 02:23:37,343
Can I help myself?

2018
02:23:38,281 --> 02:23:40,679
Oh, yeah, Bill, you can.

2019
02:23:41,826 --> 02:23:43,599
Vincente's a human being.

2020
02:23:43,808 --> 02:23:45,372
You could talk to him.

2021
02:23:46,623 --> 02:23:49,543
<i>- Will you come in?
- I don't know.</i>

2022
02:23:49,751 --> 02:23:51,211
Probably.

2023
02:23:51,732 --> 02:23:53,505
I hate to, but...

2024
02:23:54,026 --> 02:23:56,007
I don't know what else I can do,
do you?

2025
02:23:57,676 --> 02:23:59,136
No.

2026
02:24:01,430 --> 02:24:03,515
<i>When are you gonna talk to Gus?</i>

2027
02:24:04,871 --> 02:24:07,269
When they say I can. Soon.

2028
02:24:09,876 --> 02:24:11,648
He loves you, Danny.

2029
02:24:11,857 --> 02:24:13,525
He'll be mad.

2030
02:24:13,838 --> 02:24:15,298
You want me to call him?

2031
02:24:15,923 --> 02:24:17,800
No, I gotta do it.

2032
02:24:20,511 --> 02:24:22,075
Okay.

2033
02:24:22,284 --> 02:24:24,161
Listen...

2034
02:24:24,786 --> 02:24:27,706
...how much did you tell them?
- Everything.

2035
02:24:31,356 --> 02:24:32,711
Take care.

2036
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:34,797
<i>You too, Bill.</i>

2037
02:24:58,154 --> 02:25:00,135
<i>- Yeah?
- Gus, thank God.</i>

2038
02:25:00,239 --> 02:25:02,116
We gotta talk.

2039
02:25:04,306 --> 02:25:05,765
Ciello?

2040
02:25:06,287 --> 02:25:07,851
Yeah.

2041
02:25:28,288 --> 02:25:30,374
And the four of you were there?

2042
02:25:31,729 --> 02:25:34,336
Subject nods, indicating yes.

2043
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:39,862
On that occasion, we split $ 7000.

2044
02:25:40,071 --> 02:25:44,033
Mr. Vincente,
Detective Mayo just shot himself.

2045
02:26:05,096 --> 02:26:11,457
<i>- We have a possible DO A...
- Hey, what's going on?</i>

2046
02:26:13,021 --> 02:26:15,732
<i>- Okay...
- Okay, back to work. Let's go.</i>

2047
02:26:15,836 --> 02:26:17,817
<i>... 17 on your plans.</i>

2048
02:26:18,547 --> 02:26:20,216
Come on.

2049
02:26:28,662 --> 02:26:30,747
Billy!

2050
02:27:00,882 --> 02:27:02,654
Son of a...

2051
02:27:07,972 --> 02:27:10,162
I'll talk to him.

2052
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:18,504
I've got someone to talk to.

2053
02:27:53,956 --> 02:27:55,833
He's here, Mario.

2054
02:27:56,042 --> 02:27:58,023
<i>- He looks bad.
- Jesus, Brooks...</i>

2055
02:27:58,127 --> 02:28:00,734
...he's got the appeal next week.
Think he can make it?

2056
02:28:00,838 --> 02:28:03,758
<i>- Should we postpone?
- No. Why don 't we hold off.</i>

2057
02:28:03,966 --> 02:28:06,052
I'll call.

2058
02:28:06,990 --> 02:28:08,659
I've gotta go see Joe.

2059
02:28:08,763 --> 02:28:11,683
Danny? Danny.

2060
02:28:13,038 --> 02:28:16,062
- Yeah.
- He's as good as can be expected.

2061
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,773
Nobody joins the force
to be a criminal.

2062
02:28:18,982 --> 02:28:21,067
- You gotta treat us different.
- I'll meet you.

2063
02:28:21,276 --> 02:28:25,551
When's the last time some Mafia guy
got in trouble and blew his brains out?

2064
02:28:25,655 --> 02:28:28,575
I'll tell you when. Fucking never.

2065
02:28:28,783 --> 02:28:30,660
Only cops.

2066
02:28:30,869 --> 02:28:32,745
- Cops.
- Attempt to meet up with us at...

2067
02:28:32,954 --> 02:28:34,205
- Now, hold on.
- Cops.

2068
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:36,812
Danny, what's the address, Dan?

2069
02:28:40,149 --> 02:28:43,381
419 Saint George Avenue.

2070
02:28:43,903 --> 02:28:47,344
- I'll see you there.
- Gotta treat us different.

2071
02:29:07,155 --> 02:29:09,345
Joe, it's Bill.

2072
02:29:09,866 --> 02:29:11,743
He killed himself.

2073
02:30:04,088 --> 02:30:07,946
So help me God,
I'll never get involved with cops again.

2074
02:30:23,795 --> 02:30:25,151
Gus.

2075
02:30:30,052 --> 02:30:31,928
Where are your guards?

2076
02:30:32,450 --> 02:30:33,701
Outside.

2077
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:36,308
What good they gonna do you
out there?

2078
02:30:36,934 --> 02:30:39,019
They knew I was coming to see you.

2079
02:30:40,270 --> 02:30:41,834
They think I wouldn't hurt you?

2080
02:30:44,754 --> 02:30:46,839
I think you wouldn't hurt me.

2081
02:30:46,944 --> 02:30:48,195
You think that?

2082
02:30:48,403 --> 02:30:50,176
Well, think again.

2083
02:30:51,532 --> 02:30:53,304
They're taking you in, Gus.

2084
02:30:54,347 --> 02:30:56,849
I just want you to know
I told them everything.

2085
02:30:56,954 --> 02:30:58,935
Fuck you, Ciello.

2086
02:30:59,143 --> 02:31:01,750
I don't want your confessions
or your guilt about Bill.

2087
02:31:01,855 --> 02:31:05,296
He was a drunk, so fuck him
and fuck you.

2088
02:31:05,504 --> 02:31:07,068
I'm not coming in.

2089
02:31:08,215 --> 02:31:10,926
I ain't pulling a Mayo,
and I ain't pulling a Ciello.

2090
02:31:11,135 --> 02:31:14,471
And until they come after me,
I'm going right on with my work.

2091
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:17,287
I got seven Mafiosos on tape...

2092
02:31:17,495 --> 02:31:22,917
...six truckers, couple of union guys
and maybe 16 assorted hoods.

2093
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:27,297
At least 29 indictments.
And you know what?

2094
02:31:27,505 --> 02:31:29,487
Not a cop among them.

2095
02:31:29,695 --> 02:31:32,198
Tell that to your prick friends.

2096
02:31:40,018 --> 02:31:42,938
It was on around May 25th...

2097
02:31:43,042 --> 02:31:45,545
Get out of that chair,
I'll fucking kill you.

2098
02:31:45,649 --> 02:31:47,943
Don't let those pricks
talk you into anything.

2099
02:31:48,151 --> 02:31:50,237
- You okay?
- There's an interrogation going on.

2100
02:31:50,341 --> 02:31:52,322
We can have you arrested.
Are you nuts?

2101
02:31:52,531 --> 02:31:54,303
- Keep your fucking hands off me.
- Danny.

2102
02:31:54,408 --> 02:31:56,806
- Get him out of here.
- Danny, stop. Danny!

2103
02:31:59,413 --> 02:32:01,185
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

2104
02:32:01,290 --> 02:32:04,001
All of a sudden, I had this feeling,
I got scared for you.

2105
02:32:04,209 --> 02:32:06,607
- You okay?
- Come on, Dan.

2106
02:32:06,712 --> 02:32:08,693
I just wanna get out of here.

2107
02:32:08,797 --> 02:32:12,030
I wanna tell them what they wanna
know, and I'm gonna get out.

2108
02:32:12,238 --> 02:32:15,054
Hey, Gus. Did you hear about Gus?

2109
02:32:15,262 --> 02:32:17,869
He's gonna stay out. He's not afraid.

2110
02:32:17,973 --> 02:32:19,537
He's terrific.

2111
02:32:19,746 --> 02:32:21,414
He's gonna make them prove it, okay?

2112
02:32:21,518 --> 02:32:23,917
Take them to trial.

2113
02:32:24,021 --> 02:32:27,879
Listen to this. If he's convicted,
he'll tell his daughter he was framed.

2114
02:32:28,088 --> 02:32:30,799
- That's one mean Jew.
- I'll tell you something...

2115
02:32:31,007 --> 02:32:32,571
...it's fucking fantastic, man.

2116
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:35,282
Somebody's telling them
to go fuck themselves, you know?

2117
02:32:35,491 --> 02:32:37,993
- One of us.
- We were a hell of a unit.

2118
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:41,226
Go on home, Danny.

2119
02:32:41,330 --> 02:32:43,207
Get some sleep. Eat something.

2120
02:32:43,416 --> 02:32:45,084
- Wanna call my sister?
- No, I'm okay.

2121
02:32:45,292 --> 02:32:46,961
- You can stay at her place.
- I'm okay.

2122
02:32:47,169 --> 02:32:48,942
I'm okay.

2123
02:32:49,046 --> 02:32:50,923
I'm okay.

2124
02:32:58,744 --> 02:33:00,725
Don't hate me, Joe.

2125
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:05,834
I could never hate you, Danny.

2126
02:33:11,465 --> 02:33:14,176
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

2127
02:33:18,555 --> 02:33:20,119
- Is everybody here?
- Yes.

2128
02:33:20,328 --> 02:33:23,456
- Everyone you called for this meeting.
- Good.

2129
02:33:24,499 --> 02:33:26,793
Well, let's get down to it.

2130
02:33:30,025 --> 02:33:32,841
The decision as to whether
the government will or will not...

2131
02:33:33,049 --> 02:33:36,490
...indict and prosecute
Detective Daniel Ciello...

2132
02:33:36,699 --> 02:33:40,765
...is the responsibility of this office.
That decision is mine.

2133
02:33:42,329 --> 02:33:45,353
However, I will be persuaded by
what I hear in the next few days...

2134
02:33:45,562 --> 02:33:47,022
...from you men who know him...

2135
02:33:47,230 --> 02:33:49,420
...who worked with him,
who worked against him.

2136
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:54,321
I trust you're all familiar
with this remarkable document...

2137
02:33:54,529 --> 02:33:56,823
...Detective Ciello's confessions.

2138
02:33:56,927 --> 02:34:00,785
Three little acts of misconduct
have grown into 84 pages.

2139
02:34:02,454 --> 02:34:06,520
A copy of this tome must make things
very easy for Mr. Blomberg's attorney.

2140
02:34:06,729 --> 02:34:09,857
It's all there, detective,
in your own words.

2141
02:34:09,961 --> 02:34:13,402
Clearly admitted details of the perjury
you committed 22 months ago...

2142
02:34:13,507 --> 02:34:16,009
...in this same courtroom
before this same judge.

2143
02:34:16,218 --> 02:34:19,137
Perjury that caused the conviction
of Michael Blomberg.

2144
02:34:20,493 --> 02:34:22,474
We're losing sight
of the real problem...

2145
02:34:22,578 --> 02:34:24,977
...which is the corruption
of a narcotics agent.

2146
02:34:25,081 --> 02:34:27,271
I want you to see this graph.

2147
02:34:27,479 --> 02:34:29,877
It shows
the direct and absolute correlation...

2148
02:34:29,982 --> 02:34:32,276
...of police corruption to drug traffic.

2149
02:34:32,380 --> 02:34:34,152
You cannot have one
without the other.

2150
02:34:34,361 --> 02:34:37,906
No matter how you slice it,
Ciello is a corrupt narcotics agent.

2151
02:34:38,011 --> 02:34:40,826
And what this is all about,
finally, is narcotics.

2152
02:34:44,371 --> 02:34:45,831
Sorry.

2153
02:34:51,045 --> 02:34:53,130
- Did you take Valium this morning?
- Yes.

2154
02:34:53,339 --> 02:34:54,903
- Only one?
- More than one.

2155
02:34:55,111 --> 02:34:56,884
- How many more?
- I took three.

2156
02:34:57,092 --> 02:34:59,595
It takes three Valium to calm you
before you testify?

2157
02:34:59,699 --> 02:35:01,785
- Objection.
- Sustained.

2158
02:35:02,097 --> 02:35:06,790
I cannot believe how eager you all are
to just forget what he has accomplished.

2159
02:35:06,894 --> 02:35:09,814
The risks he took for us.

2160
02:35:10,022 --> 02:35:11,482
And why he did it.

2161
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:13,984
Oh, for God's sake, Rick.

2162
02:35:14,089 --> 02:35:17,738
He's your baby, so, okay, but don't
try to sentimentalize him to me.

2163
02:35:17,947 --> 02:35:20,554
And why he did it is not relevant.

2164
02:35:20,762 --> 02:35:23,369
It's damned relevant to some of us.

2165
02:35:23,577 --> 02:35:27,018
He did it because he was
trying to get back.

2166
02:35:29,729 --> 02:35:32,545
Look, I think, for most cops...

2167
02:35:32,753 --> 02:35:34,839
...corruption creeps up slowly.

2168
02:35:35,047 --> 02:35:37,237
Almost imperceptibly.

2169
02:35:37,654 --> 02:35:40,574
But getting back is something...

2170
02:35:40,678 --> 02:35:44,640
...that can only be done in one great big,
dangerous leap.

2171
02:35:44,849 --> 02:35:46,413
A leap...

2172
02:35:46,622 --> 02:35:48,603
...that risks...

2173
02:35:48,811 --> 02:35:50,375
...everything.

2174
02:35:52,148 --> 02:35:54,651
If we wipe out this man now...

2175
02:35:54,859 --> 02:35:57,570
No cop will ever come forward again.

2176
02:35:58,196 --> 02:36:00,907
If the druggist gives you Valium
without a prescription...

2177
02:36:01,011 --> 02:36:03,409
...does he give you other drugs
without prescription?

2178
02:36:03,618 --> 02:36:05,912
- No.
- What about other drugs.

2179
02:36:06,016 --> 02:36:08,310
Marijuana.
Do you use marijuana, detective?

2180
02:36:08,519 --> 02:36:11,438
- No, I don't use marijuana.
- But you've tried it.

2181
02:36:11,543 --> 02:36:12,794
I've tried it.

2182
02:36:13,002 --> 02:36:14,566
Cocaine?

2183
02:36:15,296 --> 02:36:18,112
I've tried it
in order to recognize the effects.

2184
02:36:18,529 --> 02:36:19,989
- Heroin?
- Never.

2185
02:36:20,093 --> 02:36:23,117
- Uppers?
- I've used them on a long surveillance.

2186
02:36:23,221 --> 02:36:25,202
- Hashish?
- Once.

2187
02:36:25,411 --> 02:36:27,079
To recognize its effects?

2188
02:36:29,165 --> 02:36:31,354
You know, when I became
a prosecuting attorney...

2189
02:36:31,563 --> 02:36:34,482
...I accepted the fact
I was not in a popularity contest.

2190
02:36:34,691 --> 02:36:37,611
Now, I think some of you guys
have it all mixed up.

2191
02:36:37,819 --> 02:36:41,573
You've fallen in love with this
perpetrator. You feel responsible for him.

2192
02:36:41,782 --> 02:36:43,450
You want him to love you.

2193
02:36:43,554 --> 02:36:45,952
But you are prosecutors...

2194
02:36:46,161 --> 02:36:48,872
...sworn to prosecute the guilty.

2195
02:36:49,081 --> 02:36:51,896
Ciello is a law officer
who has admitted...

2196
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:55,441
...to over 40 instances of perjury.

2197
02:36:58,465 --> 02:37:01,802
Gentlemen, my grandfather was
a lawyer, my father was a lawyer...

2198
02:37:02,010 --> 02:37:04,409
...and I became a lawyer...

2199
02:37:05,347 --> 02:37:07,224
...because the law means
everything to me.

2200
02:37:07,432 --> 02:37:10,769
And if any arm of the law is corrupt,
nothing can work. Nothing.

2201
02:37:10,873 --> 02:37:13,167
It's as simple as that.

2202
02:37:18,902 --> 02:37:23,178
Detective, I know you're familiar
with the China Blossom Motel.

2203
02:37:23,386 --> 02:37:25,680
Could you tell us
what kind of motel it is?

2204
02:37:25,784 --> 02:37:28,391
We're prepared to agree that
the China Blossom Motel...

2205
02:37:28,495 --> 02:37:30,685
...for all intents and purposes,
is a brothel.

2206
02:37:30,789 --> 02:37:33,709
- And a drug market.
- And a drug market.

2207
02:37:33,813 --> 02:37:36,524
Now, once again, detective...

2208
02:37:36,733 --> 02:37:39,235
...weren't you frequently at
the China Blossom Motel...

2209
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:41,425
...when you were
supposed to be on duty?

2210
02:37:41,634 --> 02:37:45,700
Counselor, it was up to the
SIU detectives themselves to decide...

2211
02:37:45,909 --> 02:37:47,160
...when they were on duty.

2212
02:37:47,369 --> 02:37:49,767
So sometimes...

2213
02:37:49,871 --> 02:37:51,435
Quite a lot of times, actually.

2214
02:37:51,644 --> 02:37:53,416
- you decided you were not on duty...

2215
02:37:53,521 --> 02:37:55,919
...and went to
the China Blossom Motel.

2216
02:37:56,753 --> 02:37:58,213
Didn't you?

2217
02:38:00,611 --> 02:38:01,967
Sometimes.

2218
02:38:02,175 --> 02:38:04,886
Our police have a code,
and Ciello was trying to honor it...

2219
02:38:05,095 --> 02:38:06,868
...and still work with us.

2220
02:38:07,597 --> 02:38:10,726
Unless you gentlemen want to call in
the National Guard...

2221
02:38:10,934 --> 02:38:15,418
...to patrol this city and this country
for 14 years while we pick kids at 7...

2222
02:38:15,626 --> 02:38:17,816
...and train them to be police at 21...

2223
02:38:18,025 --> 02:38:20,319
...you better understand
and acknowledge that code.

2224
02:38:20,527 --> 02:38:22,821
Paige, cops aren't the only people
who have codes.

2225
02:38:22,925 --> 02:38:25,428
- Lawyers and doctors do.
- Right, lawyers and doctors.

2226
02:38:25,532 --> 02:38:28,452
I've never known a lawyer
to risk his life or his livelihood...

2227
02:38:28,556 --> 02:38:30,537
...to expose the crooks
in his profession.

2228
02:38:30,642 --> 02:38:33,457
And where's the doctor
who ever exposed Medicaid fraud?

2229
02:38:33,561 --> 02:38:36,898
Or unnecessary or botched operations?
Or even dope for that matter.

2230
02:38:37,106 --> 02:38:41,277
What doctor ever came in? Dan Ciello
came in, and I don't care why.

2231
02:38:41,486 --> 02:38:42,946
To me, Danny Ciello's a hero...

2232
02:38:43,050 --> 02:38:45,970
...and we're trying to decide whether
to put him in jail or not.

2233
02:38:46,178 --> 02:38:47,638
Detective, isn't it true...

2234
02:38:47,742 --> 02:38:51,913
...most female prostitutes are junkies?
- Yes.

2235
02:38:52,017 --> 02:38:55,771
- Did you use them as informants?
- Sometimes.

2236
02:38:55,875 --> 02:38:59,421
And you'd supply them with heroin as
long as they gave you what you wanted.

2237
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:03,070
No.

2238
02:39:03,174 --> 02:39:06,303
Did you ever take them
to the China Blossom Motel?

2239
02:39:07,762 --> 02:39:10,578
- Yes.
- For whatever purpose?

2240
02:39:11,516 --> 02:39:12,767
Exchange of information.

2241
02:39:18,502 --> 02:39:19,858
Did you drive them there?

2242
02:39:22,048 --> 02:39:24,342
- Sometimes.
- Would they sit close?

2243
02:39:29,868 --> 02:39:32,788
- I don't remember.
- Do you remember if you touched them?

2244
02:39:35,082 --> 02:39:36,333
No, I don't remember.

2245
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:39,148
Did you ever exchange drugs
for sexual favors?

2246
02:39:39,357 --> 02:39:41,129
I object.

2247
02:39:41,859 --> 02:39:44,153
I never met Danny Ciello...

2248
02:39:44,362 --> 02:39:46,864
...but I sat in the Blomberg trial.

2249
02:39:47,386 --> 02:39:49,680
I watched and I listened.

2250
02:39:50,618 --> 02:39:53,329
In my gut, I knew he was lying.

2251
02:39:54,059 --> 02:39:56,145
I knew he was lying.

2252
02:39:57,292 --> 02:40:01,775
It's simply not possible that I
was the only attorney in the room...

2253
02:40:02,401 --> 02:40:06,885
...who knew that we were sitting there,
allowing our witness to commit perjury.

2254
02:40:08,553 --> 02:40:11,473
I know how eager some of us were.

2255
02:40:11,577 --> 02:40:14,705
I know how hungry we were
for Mike Blomberg.

2256
02:40:15,644 --> 02:40:17,833
Some of us were very young.

2257
02:40:18,459 --> 02:40:22,838
Some of us were
inexperienced trial lawyers.

2258
02:40:23,255 --> 02:40:26,175
Some of us were just careless,
in a hurry.

2259
02:40:26,801 --> 02:40:30,554
I know a lot of us believed that before
he actually took the stand, he'd break.

2260
02:40:30,763 --> 02:40:34,934
He'd crack, he'd tell us everything and
we would fix it. But that didn't happen.

2261
02:40:35,351 --> 02:40:38,583
He got on the stand,
and he perjured himself.

2262
02:40:40,252 --> 02:40:44,110
We never made him understand
how formidable...

2263
02:40:44,527 --> 02:40:48,072
...how inexorable
the forces against him were.

2264
02:40:48,281 --> 02:40:52,764
Mr. Deluth, I honestly believe
that this man was acting...

2265
02:40:53,077 --> 02:40:54,954
...out of fear...

2266
02:40:55,580 --> 02:40:57,040
...and guilt...

2267
02:40:57,457 --> 02:40:59,125
...and remorse.

2268
02:41:00,898 --> 02:41:02,462
He was attempting to carve out...

2269
02:41:02,566 --> 02:41:05,277
...some area of penance
for himself and his life.

2270
02:41:05,694 --> 02:41:07,780
And we used him.

2271
02:41:08,614 --> 02:41:11,116
The deal he's gotten is rotten.

2272
02:41:11,638 --> 02:41:14,140
If Danny Ciello is indicted...

2273
02:41:18,415 --> 02:41:23,108
...I'll have to tender my resignation
for the U.S. Attorney's Office.

2274
02:41:24,984 --> 02:41:26,653
Bullshit.

2275
02:41:27,174 --> 02:41:30,615
You used that motel as a place to take
female junkies and perpetrators...

2276
02:41:30,719 --> 02:41:32,596
...and sleep with them,
isn't that right?

2277
02:41:32,805 --> 02:41:35,412
If there wasn't money to rip off,
and there was a woman...

2278
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:38,018
...you would rip off the women,
isn't that right?

2279
02:41:38,123 --> 02:41:39,583
No, it wasn't like that.

2280
02:41:39,791 --> 02:41:41,981
Oh, detective...

2281
02:41:42,502 --> 02:41:45,839
...I think it was.
- I object, this has no relevance whatever.

2282
02:41:45,943 --> 02:41:48,967
Mr. Heinsdorff may continue
with his questioning.

2283
02:41:49,176 --> 02:41:52,617
Oh, I don't think anything more
needs to be said on that subject.

2284
02:41:52,721 --> 02:41:55,328
- Now, detective...
- I wanna talk about the China Blossom...

2285
02:41:55,536 --> 02:41:58,769
I am no longer interested in that
squalid place of assignation...

2286
02:41:58,977 --> 02:42:03,357
...between corrupt policemen
and their female victims.

2287
02:42:04,191 --> 02:42:06,485
Oh, just one other thing.

2288
02:42:06,693 --> 02:42:07,945
Did your wife know?

2289
02:42:30,676 --> 02:42:33,804
Heinsdorff was really rough on him.
I don't know how he held up.

2290
02:42:34,117 --> 02:42:36,619
Yeah, our decision
comes down tomorrow.

2291
02:42:37,036 --> 02:42:38,601
Yours too?

2292
02:42:38,809 --> 02:42:40,686
Both on the same day.
Do you believe it?

2293
02:42:41,103 --> 02:42:42,771
Jesus.

2294
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:47,881
Gentlemen, I want to thank
each one of you for your testimony.

2295
02:42:47,985 --> 02:42:50,488
I have seldom been party
to a decision...

2296
02:42:50,696 --> 02:42:53,824
...in which prosecutors' passions
have run so high.

2297
02:42:54,241 --> 02:42:57,474
I thank you for those passions
on both sides.

2298
02:43:01,228 --> 02:43:04,043
The government declines
to prosecute Detective Ciello.

2299
02:43:09,569 --> 02:43:12,176
And I find the additional testimony...

2300
02:43:12,385 --> 02:43:15,721
...of Lieutenant Ciello
as to his own misdeeds...

2301
02:43:15,826 --> 02:43:19,684
...collateral apart from
the central issue.

2302
02:43:20,518 --> 02:43:23,855
The conviction
of Michael Blomberg stands.

2303
02:43:29,798 --> 02:43:32,718
I wanna introduce a new instructor
to you here today.

2304
02:43:32,926 --> 02:43:36,159
Now, this officer has 11 years
of detective experience...

2305
02:43:36,263 --> 02:43:39,913
...and he's an expert
on surveillance techniques.

2306
02:43:40,434 --> 02:43:42,311
They're all yours.

2307
02:43:52,008 --> 02:43:53,676
Okay...

2308
02:43:53,781 --> 02:43:56,596
...first thing
I wanna talk about today...

2309
02:43:56,805 --> 02:43:58,994
...is block squaring and leapfrogging.

2310
02:43:59,203 --> 02:44:01,497
Oh, yeah,
my name is Detective Ciello.

2311
02:44:01,705 --> 02:44:05,459
Now, whenever we get a positive make
on a car, and we know it's dirty...

2312
02:44:05,563 --> 02:44:07,753
...we don't want to take any chances.

2313
02:44:07,857 --> 02:44:10,360
Yeah? I'm sorry,
I don't know any names yet.

2314
02:44:10,464 --> 02:44:11,924
I'm Detective Stern.

2315
02:44:12,133 --> 02:44:14,322
- What did you say your name was?
- Ciello.

2316
02:44:14,531 --> 02:44:16,095
Are you the Detective Ciello?

2317
02:44:17,868 --> 02:44:19,953
I'm Detective Ciello.

2318
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:23,498
I don't think I have anything
to learn from you.
