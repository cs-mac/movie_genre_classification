1
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:42,372
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY.

2
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,179
THE MASTER OF LIFE.

3
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:01,695
I remember how it was.

4
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,070
I was lost.

5
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:07,367
Maybe not lost,
but surely drifting.

6
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,811
I think those guys from the movies...

7
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:12,716
Starving on a raft provisional...

8
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,324
Suffering with the waves
and looking for land...

9
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,424
Living hope.

10
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:21,129
Deep down,
I had this crazy idea...

11
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,569
That he was destined for something big.

12
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,576
Not that I wanted to be noticed...

13
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:31,436
It was like I was destined
to leave my mark on the world.

14
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,594
I remember well what
happened that summer.

15
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:40,179
There was a wave of excitement around me
.

16
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:44,076
I was connected to something
that guided me since my birth...

17
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:48,154
Here and now,
when I create...

18
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,607
's When I feel more confident.

19
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,475
Is when I feel I do the right thing...

20
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:54,318
A wave of emotions hit me...

21
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:57,733
Most of them is the best I've ever met.

22
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:03,462
But there is always an idiot
to judge us by what we do.

23
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:05,752
What the hell.

24
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,331
The worst criticisms
usually come from people...

25
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,450
Who have no idea of?? what we do...

26
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,126
Not have special gifts...

27
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,453
And get angry when we are happy...

28
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:16,763
Cheerfully and provoke us.

29
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:20,876
Unless, of course, we are leaving the uglier.

30
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,637
So that kind of person
will hold our hand with pleasure...

31
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,902
And dance with us in the gutter
saying, as they...

32
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:32,570
See how horrible it is
and they love to celebrate.

33
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,366
But learned early...

34
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:40,769
That any idiot can see how things are ugly.

35
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:42,996
No need to gift for it.

36
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:47,500
So, this is a story adult.

37
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:52,672
If you decide to be cynical,
is an unfortunate choice.

38
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:54,624
Cynics usually are right.

39
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:57,444
The Romantics are usually wrong.

40
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:00,120
But a romantic
only need to be right once in a lifetime...

41
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,681
When choosing his true love.

42
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,918
I think this story really about love.

43
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:10,333
Maybe it was better if I just say that.

44
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,383
But then
Nicholi would not know how I knew.

45
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:17,628
And it would be unfair to both of us.

46
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,003
PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK...

47
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,404
Have you seen my son?
- No, Mr. Talia.

48
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:48,056
Should be painted.

49
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,792
What said, Mikey?

50
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,892
Nothing, sir.

51
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,432
John.

52
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,532
John.

53
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:11,936
John.

54
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,145
My goodness.

55
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,245
What are you doing?

56
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,753
John...

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
You like girls?

58
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:30,953
My father was a complete homophobe.

59
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,798
He catch me using brushes
was almost the same as I get...

60
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,618
Oral sex with one of my friends.

61
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,192
Why do I ask these questions?

62
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:44,758
Is full of paintings of men with things out.

63
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:46,301
This is hard to do, you know?

64
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,636
Draw the contours and make the shadows.

65
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:52,586
Do not do it because I like men,
do it to be a good artist.

66
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,566
Only...

67
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,896
Do me a favor, take your friends Wall.

68
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,955
Mother?
- Yes, Johnny.

69
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:01,773
Can you tell me something?

70
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,108
What do you think of this?

71
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,526
Seriously.

72
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:06,626
My goodness.

73
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,922
It's beautiful, Johnny.

74
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,300
Very beautiful.
- Really?

75
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:15,161
You got ink on your hands?
- No.

76
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,620
Are you sure?
- I just wash.

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,830
Take.

78
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,541
I want you to wear this.
Drop it.

79
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,768
Take.
- Dressing?

80
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,261
Do you want me to wear this?

81
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:26,401
No, I just want to hold.

82
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,982
Here?
- Yes, for me to see.

83
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,749
My mother was born in Germany.

84
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,522
She was 16 years old,
when the Allies stormed Berlin.

85
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,024
I had another child to talk...

86
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:41,185
Because I was busy digging
traps since age 11.

87
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,479
She was also a woman
very complicated and troubled.

88
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,315
Though he knew she hated
what the Nazis did to our country...

89
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:51,986
Think she secretly hoped
by the Germans in the war movies.

90
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:54,630
Gonna be beautiful.

91
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:58,402
Knew who inherited his talent from me?

92
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,134
Thank you.

93
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:09,142
Good.

94
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,230
Very good, John.

95
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,384
Johnny?

96
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,949
Try not to use so much black.

97
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,389
Try to find...

98
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,099
Colors...

99
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,642
Streets.

100
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:29,604
And always try to find
the colors in the shadows.

101
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,406
Violet, blue, green.

102
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:34,736
In other words, do not use both black.

103
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,277
Thank you.

104
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:39,405
And always look for the design.
There is design in everything.

105
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,281
Come here.

106
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:43,283
You see the telephone poles?

107
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:46,886
None is righteous,
mostly in a good frame.

108
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:50,081
A is a little left.
Other, slightly to the right.

109
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,333
You see the shadows across the street?

110
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,927
See how
bind to the concrete of the building?

111
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:57,479
Yes
- Think in the abstract.

112
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,131
Okay.

113
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,231
I will frame this.

114
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,667
Yammi,
can not afford the gold leaf.

115
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,043
Who said I was going to charge?

116
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:09,274
No, no.

117
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,892
John, no favors.

118
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,569
No favors.
Pay it.

119
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:13,611
Okay.

120
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:15,711
Got it.

121
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,038
My goodness.

122
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,983
Is a Seroff.

123
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,083
I know, but...

124
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,612
How to get it?

125
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,031
I enquadrei for Joe Caresiro.

126
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,083
As a plumber may have a picture of these?

127
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,593
Not worth as much as before.

128
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,496
Why?

129
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,914
's Representative.

130
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,165
So what?

131
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,392
Is irrelevant.

132
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,501
By whom?

133
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,961
Critics.

134
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,137
Magazines art.

135
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,630
Fuck.
This is gorgeous.

136
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,770
John, look at the mouth.

137
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,217
How much?

138
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:48,259
I do not know.

139
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,261
Seroff exchanged it for plumber services.

140
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,221
Really?
He?? lives near here?

141
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:53,272
Yes, down the street.

142
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,975
Father, hear that?
- Yes, that's wonderful.

143
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,393
Do you know him?

144
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,362
I guess nobody really knows.

145
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,022
I saw him a few times.

146
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,122
Really?

147
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,119
If you are thinking of going there...

148
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:09,344
Visit that old bastard...

149
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,697
I would not advise.

150
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:12,823
Him..

151
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:13,875
Crazy?

152
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,252
No had no use for them.

153
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:17,753
I'm not people.

154
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,204
And I love talking about art.

155
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:22,959
So, Johnny?
Will bothering that old bastard?

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,877
Father, why do you always think
I bother people?

157
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:27,921
Why do you bother.
- I'm just excited.

158
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:30,690
This is Yammi...

159
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,717
Normal?

160
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,051
How so?

161
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:36,695
It is normal or is sensitive?

162
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,710
Sensitive.
- If he's in a good mood?

163
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,016
You know what I'm asking.
Do not pull a smartass.

164
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:42,672
Do not know what to say.

165
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,060
What is to be sensitive?
- Shut up.

166
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,478
I do not know.
- Stop.

167
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:47,578
I do not know.
- John.

168
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:04,176
Who is?

169
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,276
Mr. Seroff?

170
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:11,238
Whatever?

171
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:15,828
I'm so beautiful that must be staring at me?

172
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,913
Is a handyman?

173
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:24,069
Whether gardening,
mowing the lawn, prune the trees?

174
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,838
No, I...
- No, no, no, what?

175
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:31,632
Is Nicholi Seroff?

176
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,035
Damn.

177
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,135
Yes, I am.

178
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,040
his books.

179
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,000
Leu?

180
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,477
I think it's brilliant.

181
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:43,962
I am brilliant?

182
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:45,130
Yes.

183
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,230
The use of color...

184
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,301
What you said about composition...

185
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,412
That trees are like naked
people dancing on the slopes...

186
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,512
.

187
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,847
I say that?

188
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:59,159
Yes, also said that trees are like men.

189
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,153
Do not invade the space of another...

190
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,647
A lesson to be learned with nature.

191
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:06,374
No shortage, only abundance.

192
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,576
Yes, yes.

193
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,676
Damn.

194
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,756
It was nice talking to you.

195
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,080
Nicholi?

196
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,180
Is Yammi.

197
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,279
Yammi.

198
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,684
I'm fine, great.

199
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:33,132
I learned that a friend went
to visit him the other day.

200
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,467
Yes, boy.

201
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,968
His name is John.

202
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:38,363
And I think he is talented.

203
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,522
He would come over there...

204
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:43,427
And talk with you about painting.

205
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,523
Yes.

206
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:47,994
Okay.

207
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,496
Good night.

208
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,210
He is not interested.

209
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,697
Not...

210
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,574
What did he say?

211
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,844
That was no time.

212
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:05,870
He was not interested?

213
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,497
Listen...

214
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:09,424
John, I forget if I were you.

215
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:12,752
To my knowledge, he had many problems
...

216
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,504
And it was a pain in his better days...

217
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,815
So imagine how it is now.

218
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,430
This is...

219
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,523
Very good.

220
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,623
Very good indeed.

221
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,184
Thank you.

222
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:32,536
Say, why us?
Why here?

223
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:34,480
Mean...

224
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,459
Why not
Pratt or Parsons School of Design?

225
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,293
Father?

226
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:44,322
What?

227
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:48,757
Asked his son if he thought
about Pratt or Parsons.

228
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,173
Okay.

229
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:56,398
Okay, he will study here.

230
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:01,713
A Moment.

231
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:02,890
Mr. Seroff?

232
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,259
I would appreciate if you could talk to you.

233
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,359
Wait, wait.

234
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:13,849
The boy.

235
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:16,244
You again.
What do you want?

236
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:21,156
First, do not want to bother you.
It was not my intention. Sorry.

237
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:24,109
Good thing it was not his intention.

238
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:27,045
Just wanted to know...

239
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:29,030
If you give class.

240
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,281
No.

241
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:31,824
Do not I teach.

242
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:33,576
And do not paint.

243
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:36,906
You know I'm a friend of Yammi, right?

244
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,889
He ended up with you?

245
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:44,448
Now he wants you to be my problem?

246
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,545
Okay?

247
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:49,942
Do not trust anyone who does not drink.

248
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,218
How so?

249
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:56,828
If you do not drink, it means he
wants to continue in the shadows...

250
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,640
.

251
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,545
I think we understand, is not it?

252
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:06,054
Now that is intimate can make jokes?

253
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,816
Sorry.

254
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,002
Not looking his muse.

255
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,112
Means that will teach me?

256
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,238
No.

257
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:15,573
Go to college.

258
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:17,541
Not teach painting actually there.

259
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:19,284
Of course not.

260
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,579
May God not allow
teach something with form and substance.

261
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,706
Or something that makes
people feel something...

262
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:25,957
Feel...

263
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:27,584
Is the enemy leadership.

264
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:31,084
Not may be smarter than them or crucify.

265
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,216
In my opinion, the painting died
and never coming back.

266
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:38,527
The common man was unable to create.

267
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,847
Why?
The common man's common sense.

268
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:43,723
Do not accept crap.

269
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:47,952
And the common man sees junk
miles away.

270
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:52,023
Therefore, there is no place for it in
art today.

271
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:55,401
There is a conspiracy against art today.

272
00:15:55,501 --> 00:16:00,172
Do not these idiots untalented
do not mind...

273
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,216
With the end of humanity. No.

274
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,550
But believe...

275
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:08,805
Still is a conspiracy.

276
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
A shared journey...

277
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:16,042
Is an experience more exciting...

278
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,439
What a journey made alone.

279
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,633
Humans...

280
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,010
Need validation.
That's how we learn.

281
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,179
We fear what we do not understand.

282
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,023
Writers pass by something.

283
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:30,123
We need help.

284
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:31,559
The Art...

285
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,144
Shared...

286
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,729
Is part of the validation of feeling.

287
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,815
When there is no context...

288
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,915
No statement.

289
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,110
When there is no statement, no exchange.

290
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,488
When there is no exchange, no beauty.

291
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:48,132
When there is beauty, there is no art.

292
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,328
If you see beauty
everywhere, in everything...

293
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,838
His soul is released.

294
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,938
No one can steal it.

295
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,308
I know that is true.

296
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,626
How do you know?

297
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,726
I just know.

298
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,880
Okay.

299
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Believe in God?

300
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,258
I think so.

301
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,594
Does your prayers at night?
- Yes...

302
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,904
...believed what is heard?

303
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:13,639
Yes.

304
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:14,857
In my opinion...

305
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:18,660
Atheists never be great painters.

306
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,864
To create an art major...

307
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:25,109
Man must make peace with mortality...

308
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,429
And revere the greatest reverenciador.

309
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:33,491
The duty of the artist is
to elevate the human soul.

310
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,135
Ignorance leads us to this.

311
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,787
Men are crazy,
are bitches...

312
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:41,582
They should hang at the Guggenheim...

313
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:44,267
Frame with childish fears.

314
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,378
It would make more sense.

315
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:48,463
You have to teach me that.

316
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:50,089
You must teach me how to paint.

317
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,758
No.

318
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,593
God mad...

319
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,520
And you would be miserable.

320
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,915
Do not do it for the money.

321
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,405
Good to know.

322
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:04,069
And if I bring my screens...

323
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:05,763
You look at them and
tell me what you think?

324
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:06,863
Real quick?

325
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,963
No, I...

326
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,333
'm Going to Pennsylvania.

327
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,453
Pennsylvania?
- Yes...

328
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,496
Why?
- I have a house there.

329
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,739
paint?

330
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,117
No, I have a girlfriend.
A tall blonde with big breasts.

331
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,217
Really?
- No.

332
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:26,543
And if I bring some screens
before traveling?

333
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,642
'll Stop bothering me after?

334
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,294
Absolutely.

335
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,394
Absolutely.

336
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:35,673
Good.

337
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,049
Tomorrow.

338
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,464
Go before I change my mind.
- Thank you.

339
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,243
Did all this alone?

340
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,383
No help from anyone without class?

341
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,246
No class.

342
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:58,160
Good, because
hate to think that someone paid...

343
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,296
To paint pictures so horrible.

344
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:04,216
There has not talent...

345
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,549
But...

346
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:08,995
...seeing things through
the eyes of other men.

347
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,135
This one has good trees.

348
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:15,424
But I have seen these trees
in multiple frames.

349
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:21,806
Branch This is beautiful.
You stole Robert Wood.

350
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:24,732
Okay?

351
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:26,845
What is this?

352
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:30,823
Should be clouds or flying rocks?

353
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,810
Clouds are not so white.

354
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,910
Come, let us look.

355
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:41,841
These clouds look white to you?

356
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:48,114
Yes.

357
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:50,033
Fuck.

358
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,784
This is white.

359
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,327
See.

360
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,745
Is white.

361
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,431
Still look white to you?

362
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:04,521
My goodness.

363
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,607
That's it. Are hotter...

364
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:11,503
The summit is yellow, violet.
- Great.

365
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,194
Now take.

366
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,100
So...

367
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,435
Yes...

368
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,787
Get your things and go.

369
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,332
Wish IHE luck.
I wish IHE luck.

370
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,613
I thought we had an agreement.

371
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,260
Just wanted to thank you.

372
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Thank you.

373
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:01,404
Joking. Come in.

374
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Between.

375
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,438
Like that.

376
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:10,538
It makes me laugh.

377
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:13,250
My parents also like.

378
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,571
Mr. Seroff?

379
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:20,115
Stop calling me that, my name is Nicholi.

380
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:21,658
Okay.

381
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,758
Sorry. Nicholi?

382
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,040
Just want to know if I can see his studio.

383
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,625
Why?

384
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,725
I would like to see it.

385
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,563
The studio is not for boys.

386
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,049
Can I go alone, no problem.
Just show the direction.

387
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:40,217
What?

388
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:41,789
Can I go alone.
Do not need...

389
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:45,405
I do not want you going up there alone.

390
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,474
Damn.

391
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:50,101
Now I do not know what happened.

392
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,201
Sorry. Sorry.

393
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,370
Come on, you worthless.

394
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:56,469
Come.

395
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,044
My drink worthless.

396
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Take a look.

397
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:29,012
Wow.

398
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:30,513
I could live here.

399
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:32,613
Yes, you and the rats.

400
00:22:37,745 --> 00:22:40,272
What will you do on this screen?

401
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:42,220
Can take it,
I do not use for anything.

402
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,784
I can not take it.

403
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,884
One day...

404
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,211
Guess ten years ago...

405
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,379
A fool says...

406
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:54,035
Representational art that was sentimental...

407
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,619
Past.

408
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:59,969
I said to myself: 'I'll give him a lesson, idiot.'

409
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,309
I'd pick my paintings...

410
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,894
And burn that magazine.

411
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:09,649
You say something nice, especially...

412
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,860
But then...

413
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,322
I said...

414
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,025
'Fuck. Who cares?'.

415
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,111
You cares what the critics think?

416
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:24,829
Are you kidding me,
worthless?

417
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:28,533
No, you do not strike me as the kind of man
...

418
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,651
Who cares what people think.

419
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:33,811
This is all pretty much worthless...

420
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:35,364
But you're young.

421
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:38,200
And life will still be hard for you.

422
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,368
Really?

423
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,787
Why do you think I have an easy life?

424
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,887
Yet seen the worst.

425
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
What people are able...

426
00:23:46,277 --> 00:23:48,434
Inflicting each other.

427
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:56,091
When I painted this, I always
thought the big men...

428
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:59,511
Who stood in front of a screen before me.

429
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:03,266
Da Vinci,
and his technique 'chiaroscuro'...

430
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:05,892
I'm sure that does not know what is.

431
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:08,019
Light and space.
The natural recession of an object...

432
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,646
When is affected by light.

433
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,272
Great. Great.

434
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:14,492
Monet, Manet, Pizarro.

435
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,776
Renoir.

436
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:18,128
They made me see colors...

437
00:24:18,253 --> 00:24:20,881
Mostly secondary colors.

438
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:25,201
Certainly not know what I speak.
- I know.

439
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:26,328
Do you know?

440
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:28,004
Violet, green, orange.

441
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:30,090
Fechin know who that was?
- Yes...

442
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,125
Who was that?
- A Russian artist. Painted in towels.

443
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:36,030
Fechin was obsessed by the edges.

444
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:39,773
The two- objects in space.

445
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:42,175
Lines are human concepts.

446
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:44,010
There are no lines in nature.

447
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,720
I disagree.

448
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,308
John Carlson says in his book that all
edge must be hard.

449
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:51,809
Okay.

450
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,994
Okay. Alright.

451
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,480
Teach me something useless.

452
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,650
Van Gogh and Redfield
outlining everything.

453
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,750
True.

454
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,838
Making things less natural.

455
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,021
And, in my opinion,
more expressive.

456
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:11,719
Life is too short to do simple paintings.

457
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,263
I need to show I was here.

458
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,256
Fuck.

459
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:16,332
I've been here.

460
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,050
Here. This planet.

461
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,769
Here.
- Calm down, can hear it.

462
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,672
What is the first thing that looks?
- The local color.

463
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,848
What is it?

464
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:28,176
Is the essence of the object
before being affected by the fence.

465
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,552
Bravo.

466
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,652
Very Good.

467
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,390
Honestly, Nicholi,
I can recite it.

468
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,933
I've read, I already know.

469
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,142
But...

470
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:40,604
Know what it means?
I can apply to my work? No.

471
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,704
It is not surprising.

472
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,283
If I knew the answer,
would be meaningless.

473
00:25:45,383 --> 00:25:49,445
But these things can only be achieved with
practice.

474
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:50,738
E...

475
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:52,573
This is very important...

476
00:25:52,673 --> 00:25:55,478
You are allowed to make mistakes.

477
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,886
There is no secret.

478
00:25:58,095 --> 00:25:59,830
Only work.

479
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,164
That.

480
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:02,999
That's right.

481
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:04,092
I want to work.

482
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:06,711
Can you talk about the progress
art and not help me...

483
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:09,380
As someone surely helped in the past.

484
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,548
Is that fair?

485
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:12,648
Okay. Alright.

486
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,218
Great.

487
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:17,803
You can go to Pennsylvania with me
summer.

488
00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:20,015
Even if you have to kill him...

489
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:21,808
'll Teach him to paint.

490
00:26:21,908 --> 00:26:23,908
If embrace me...

491
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:25,937
I kill him now.

492
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:28,037
Okay.

493
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:42,077
Are you saying you want to go
to the interior with an old man?

494
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:43,328
Yes...

495
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:45,872
...is a great opportunity for me.

496
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,041
How?
- He is a Russian master.

497
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,876
Great. It is Russian, no less.

498
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:52,295
Going back a communist
and who knows what else.

499
00:26:52,395 --> 00:26:54,130
Father, you have to let me do this.

500
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,057
No, will not do that, forget it.

501
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,877
Will work with me in the summer.

502
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:04,306
Bullshit.

503
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:05,932
Caution.

504
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:07,767
You can not arrest me well.

505
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,867
Johnny, no.

506
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,104
Do not do this to your father.

507
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:14,607
Sorry, mom, but
knows he can not arrest me well.

508
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,710
You will not inward...
- Why not?

509
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:19,278
With an old.
- Why not?

510
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:20,988
How so 'why not'?

511
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:22,823
Do not be silly.
Do you know why.

512
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:24,449
Wake up.

513
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:26,759
You know what he wants.

514
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:31,985
There is something wrong with you.

515
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:42,958
I hope this better touch than paints.

516
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:47,220
I'm going there in search of tranquility,
not need noise.

517
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,638
Seeking quiet.

518
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:50,390
Okay.
- Put in there.

519
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,490
I play bass.

520
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,019
Tell...

521
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,205
Parents agreed to it?

522
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:01,191
Yes.

523
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,651
Are you sure?

524
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:04,751
Yes.

525
00:28:04,878 --> 00:28:06,878
They support me.

526
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:09,716
Okay then, let's go.

527
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:14,345
You can wash the car.

528
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,845
Want me to drive?

529
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:20,392
I drive for 47 summers.

530
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,428
Are you sure?

531
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:23,920
Absolute.

532
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,889
Get in the car, useless.

533
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:27,989
Come on.
- Sorry. Sorry.

534
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:04,374
In the city where the man
fully controls its environment...

535
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:07,959
I find it easy to believe that he is all.

536
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:10,296
But here, where accept the things...

537
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,390
As nature intended and not as we want...

538
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,490
Is liberating.

539
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:16,602
In a way, the pressure decreased...

540
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:19,471
Because I discovered that
it was not so important.

541
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:22,149
accept the idea that a higher power...

542
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:25,577
Had a plan for me made me resign.

543
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:33,317
Everywhere I looked,
through paintings.

544
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:36,052
Masterpieces passed in my mind.

545
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,489
I was saddened by Nicholi.

546
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:41,658
For his life's work
not be considered important.

547
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:43,794
Did not understand how
the supposed experts...

548
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:46,496
Could say something so ignorant.

549
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:50,124
About Them gave this power?
Or, more importantly, that right?

550
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:52,543
Like beauty could be irrelevant?

551
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:54,545
A landscape that disappeared
before our eyes...

552
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:57,214
With increasing approach of man...

553
00:29:57,314 --> 00:30:00,714
Was the most irrelevant possible for me.

554
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,798
Is a pause.
Need to pee.

555
00:30:49,696 --> 00:30:51,948
Put?? things in my bed.

556
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Upstairs.

557
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,019
Okay.
Where do I put my stuff?

558
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,689
barn. Joke.
In the first room on the right.

559
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Comfortable, no?

560
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:41,826
Yes, it is.

561
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:45,161
Is not it beautiful?

562
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,330
This place...

563
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:49,552
Reminds me a little Rome.

564
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,411
Really?
- Yes.

565
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:53,511
And Russia is so?

566
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,130
St. Petersburg...

567
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:59,466
Baltic Sea...

568
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:02,120
My boy...

569
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,389
Are beautiful.

570
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:05,957
I grew up...

571
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,519
And studied English, German, Russian.

572
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,564
Lindo.

573
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,661
This place.

574
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,193
Yes, beautiful.

575
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,657
After the German attack...

576
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:27,243
There was little reason to stay.

577
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:31,272
I was stopped at the border
by a young German soldier...

578
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:33,149
Should have their age.

579
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:35,799
He asked me where I was going.

580
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:40,797
I said I was leaving my country...

581
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:43,175
He had invaded.

582
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,719
And I wanted to be free.

583
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:49,956
And that if he did not,
could shoot me.

584
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:52,333
But I would not stop walking.

585
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:53,584
Continued walking...

586
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:55,031
Walking...

587
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,438
Walk and walk.

588
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:01,565
And he did not shoot.

589
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:04,177
Was brave.

590
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:05,845
No, no.

591
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:07,945
I was not brave.

592
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:11,159
I was just too tired to care.

593
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:14,854
I'm half German.

594
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:16,954
Not going to shoot me?

595
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,483
Play.

596
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:23,128
Perhaps the soldiers have rabies.

597
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,675
Feels homesick?

598
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,680
I do not think much of it.

599
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,097
Can not go back.

600
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,500
If you could, again?

601
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,751
No.

602
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,670
I'm an American now.

603
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,148
I love my adopted country.

604
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,716
Really?

605
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,052
Of course it does.
Do not you?

606
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,219
I think so.

607
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,396
Your worthless.

608
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,639
You have no idea what's in here.

609
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:55,141
In any other country...

610
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,810
Would be in the gutter,
that is your place.

611
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,537
Calm. Did not mean it.

612
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,746
I am very happy.

613
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,335
I'm happy to be American.

614
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:11,019
I am very happy to be with you Why.

615
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,314
I am very happy for being American.

616
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:17,340
I am very happy to be with you Why.

617
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:25,643
Why am I a bastard
a Russian Impressionist painter...

618
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:29,731
'll be a bastard of a painter.

619
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:32,525
American impressionist Russian.

620
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:42,451
You're hopeless.

621
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:46,496
Way no.

622
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:13,852
Beautiful, no?

623
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:18,067
Without any noise.

624
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:56,356
One thing that did not diminish
in my life was the fear.

625
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,221
I began to realize that
was in the middle of nowhere with this guy.

626
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:01,531
Maybe my father was right?

627
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:04,602
Maybe this old wanted to attack me.

628
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:49,209
I came to see if you are comfortable.

629
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:51,817
Yes.

630
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:55,571
Yes.

631
00:36:56,824 --> 00:36:58,350
Good night.

632
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,450
Okay.

633
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:16,842
I've never seen a human eat as much as
Seroff.

634
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:23,415
He?? began eating half a
dozen eggs in the morning.

635
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:26,251
A pound of bacon and at
least six slices of toast...

636
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:30,601
With butter and marmalade
and four cups of coffee.

637
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:38,178
This followed by tablets
to pressure, heart...

638
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:40,597
And something that decreased blood sugar.

639
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:43,283
And last but not least...

640
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,902
He?? took a large dose of vodka...

641
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:49,147
What he did also the rest of the day.

642
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:05,969
Today you will paint.

643
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:41,670
Where is he?

644
00:38:59,978 --> 00:39:01,505
What is this?

645
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,173
I liked.

646
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:05,273
Smells mother.

647
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,122
I liked.

648
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,222
How are you, my friend?

649
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:14,114
Curtis am Sunday.

650
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,590
It's good to see you.
Very good.

651
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,237
You are great.
- Is that for me?

652
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:21,289
Yes To remember the old days.

653
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:24,422
Something to show me?
- Yes...

654
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,959
Come on.
- Yes.

655
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:49,590
The exhibition was not as I expected.

656
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,690
I do not know...

657
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:55,279
Feel there is a great boredom.

658
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:57,348
People want to be shocked.

659
00:39:57,448 --> 00:40:01,868
They want to panic,
want to be caught in discomfort.

660
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,329
're Talking about art?

661
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
Is a moron.

662
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:09,692
Well..

663
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:13,404
I was invited to join the
committee of art next month.

664
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:16,558
I'm also on the organizing
committee and would like...

665
00:40:16,658 --> 00:40:17,658
...juror.

666
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:18,826
Are you interested?

667
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:21,078
There will be painting or crap?

668
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:24,180
Progressive Art.
- So, it's crap.

669
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,389
Nicholi,

670
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,960
with its classic style and
his eye for what is true...

671
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
Do me a favor.

672
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:33,506
Sure, sure.

673
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,733
I will, if you can laugh.

674
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,317
Good.

675
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:46,324
So...

676
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,852
Knew the exhibition at the Tate?

677
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:49,354
No.

678
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:52,999
My God.
Are junk hanging on the walls.

679
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,191
Mean...

680
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:56,710
Trash framed.

681
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,153
They did it on purpose?

682
00:40:58,253 --> 00:40:59,780
I'm intrigued and you?

683
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,699
I am intrigued to know who paid to see.

684
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,799
And our young friend?

685
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,286
Is my guest.

686
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:08,426
He is interested in art?

687
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:11,098
Yes, wants to be a painter.

688
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:14,502
In old-fashioned or progressive?

689
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:18,147
Progressive or Classic?

690
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:19,682
It needs a label?

691
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:22,309
Yes, we tag,
to facilitate discussion.

692
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,686
Do not mean to be rude...

693
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:27,421
But do not know if I can label.

694
00:41:27,505 --> 00:41:29,907
Please. Try.

695
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,726
Do you hear the rain?

696
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,311
She hits the roof...

697
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,770
Window...

698
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,870
There is thunder...

699
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,782
I think about it.

700
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,882
Is a moment...

701
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,251
Only exists now.

702
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:45,843
Once it exists,
is the memory.

703
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:50,887
Encounter peace about it.
I like to catch these things.

704
00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:52,670
Do not like to paint a picture...

705
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,745
Which is painted only by the image.

706
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,375
Sorry...

707
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,710
This make sense?

708
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,836
Yes.

709
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,680
Sharing experiences makes sense.

710
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,691
But it is representative, right?

711
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,969
I think so.

712
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,069
I'm curious.

713
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,824
What prevents to break it?

714
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,033
Is fear?

715
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:19,394
Fear of what?

716
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:21,355
From deepen?

717
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,024
Sorry,
I do not know what you mean.

718
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,151
The representative is safe.

719
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:28,251
Safe?
How did this?

720
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:29,704
Uses symbols.

721
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:33,119
Whenever we use a brush,
create symbols.

722
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:36,368
Well, it's true.

723
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:40,455
Without saying that art representative
is seriously undervalued now.

724
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:43,190
Is far from safe,
not you think?

725
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:52,316
My God, you do not exist.

726
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:11,624
What do you think?

727
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:17,448
Need to arrange the wallpaper of the room.

728
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:21,426
Express something important. So here is.

729
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:24,802
Come on.

730
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
Think we're done.

731
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,117
Do not get up, okay.

732
00:43:52,038 --> 00:43:54,038
My goodness.

733
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:56,748
What is?
I'm not ugly.

734
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:00,170
No, it was not what I meant.

735
00:44:00,629 --> 00:44:02,672
I understood.

736
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:04,964
Nicholi is?

737
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:12,848
I'll leave it here.

738
00:44:13,224 --> 00:44:16,510
If you want, I can wake him.

739
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,711
No.

740
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,811
Do not need to do this.

741
00:44:21,732 --> 00:44:24,859
I'll make coffee.
- Okay.

742
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,445
So...

743
00:44:29,614 --> 00:44:31,614
Is the handyman?

744
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:33,643
No.

745
00:44:33,743 --> 00:44:35,743
Not?

746
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:38,704
So, who are you?

747
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:42,332
I am an artist.

748
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,709
Is an artist?
- Yes...

749
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:50,298
...not seem so sure.

750
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:52,374
Yes, I am.

751
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:54,551
Must be talented.

752
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:57,122
Nicholi does not accept students of art.

753
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:58,749
Well..

754
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:01,435
Now I'm just tidying up.

755
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,810
So, is the handyman.

756
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:07,590
No.

757
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,690
I heard voices.

758
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,696
Nicholi.
- Hello.

759
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,474
Good to see it.

760
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:19,910
Place the bed in place.

761
00:45:23,205 --> 00:45:25,205
Let me see it.

762
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:27,373
Wonderful.

763
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:28,902
Linda.

764
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:30,653
I'm old.

765
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:32,880
Thanks for that.
- Sure.

766
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:35,005
Apple.

767
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:38,085
'Put the bed in place.

768
00:45:38,185 --> 00:45:40,225
I am Russian.
Look at me.

769
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:44,026
Mando in young people.
I'm great.'

770
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:50,897
Then reduce this.

771
00:45:52,523 --> 00:45:54,008
This?

772
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,759
Show me another.

773
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,859
I like this.

774
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:01,239
But I'm a girl, Nicholi.
- I know.

775
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,533
You know?
- Yes.

776
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:06,519
What?

777
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:09,580
Nothing.
- Need something now?

778
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:15,236
Show...
- But if you do...

779
00:46:15,336 --> 00:46:18,072
Think your house will look very feminine.

780
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:19,915
Do not you think?
- I do not know.

781
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:22,015
I dirty.

782
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:24,634
And this?

783
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:32,099
Thank you.

784
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:34,795
The apple pie was delicious.

785
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,895
More next week.

786
00:46:37,773 --> 00:46:39,773
Thank you.

787
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,235
Pleasure to meet you, John.
- Thank you and goodbye.

788
00:46:49,575 --> 00:46:51,575
It is quite a woman.

789
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:56,002
She is beautiful and amazing.

790
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:59,988
Women are wonderful
creatures, are not they?

791
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:04,881
To be honest,
not have much experience with them.

792
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,325
You...

793
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,844
Do not be mad, we...

794
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,263
Only we understand.

795
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:17,801
Share an experience.
- I guess you can say that.

796
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,188
She lost a son.

797
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,773
A drunken idiot...

798
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:26,024
Trod.

799
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:29,737
She reminds me of my Anya.

800
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,613
My Anya.

801
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:37,286
She was beautiful and intelligent.

802
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:42,553
Not so clever, because married me.

803
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:47,298
She was a teacher at the same
university where I taught...

804
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,113
...painting.

805
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:51,213
What happened?

806
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,678
She died.

807
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,385
It is quite simple, chose a woman
because we think she's perfect.

808
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:05,485
And they choose us...

809
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:08,714
Because they want to make us perfect.

810
00:48:12,735 --> 00:48:14,735
At twenty-somethings...

811
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:18,240
'll Remember what I said...

812
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,992
Nod and think: 'That crazy.'

813
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,487
At thirty-somethings...

814
00:48:23,587 --> 00:48:26,789
Will remember a few words.

815
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,793
At 50...

816
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:35,047
Will say: 'That bastard Russian...

817
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,383
...was right about a lot.'

818
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:42,927
Keep laughing, idiot.

819
00:49:00,028 --> 00:49:01,814
Enough of that.
We'll see.

820
00:49:01,914 --> 00:49:04,316
Sunday nights were important to Seroff.

821
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:07,785
He began to cook dinner morning.

822
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,220
There termites here.

823
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:33,142
The dinner seemed to last for hours.

824
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:36,554
Nicholi and Curtis sat, drank...

825
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:39,631
And spoke about the same thing
arguing for years.

826
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:42,776
There is a place for...

827
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,270
A representative art.

828
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:49,949
there is a place for old school...

829
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:53,632
Whatever teaching methods
conventional learning...

830
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:55,238
For the new school.

831
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:56,489
But only...

832
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:59,700
For reasons of documentation,
historical reasons...

833
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,202
To show how the art was...

834
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:04,613
As opposed to what it will be.

835
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:05,872
That sucks.

836
00:50:05,972 --> 00:50:07,907
Sorry, Sandra.
- Do not worry, Nicholi.

837
00:50:08,007 --> 00:50:10,159
After so many years already
gotten used to you two.

838
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:12,887
And you? What do you think?

839
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:15,706
Well..

840
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:18,834
He understands the modern movement
more than me.

841
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:19,822
Well..

842
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:23,088
She likes,
in an intrinsic level, but...

843
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:25,382
Let's be honest,
she graduated in Psychology...

844
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:27,392
And not in Art History.
You know that, Nicholi.

845
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:28,968
I think is crazy.

846
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,228
What, my friend?

847
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:33,983
What needs to be trained to appreciate art.

848
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:37,393
I mean, it's like
need a degree to enjoy music.

849
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:41,396
The art is no longer what it was
a means of communication to the masses...

850
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:45,500
For what is now a medium to select.

851
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,318
And what does this have to do?

852
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:51,155
Are you a member of the masses, as it
and the farmer down the street.

853
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,532
The farmer down the street...

854
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:55,993
Have very different interests from ours.

855
00:50:56,093 --> 00:50:58,813
But art is a common denominator.

856
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,681
When you, Sandra,
John, I...

857
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:03,708
And the farmer down the street...

858
00:51:03,808 --> 00:51:06,052
We pause for a moment...

859
00:51:06,152 --> 00:51:09,839
And appreciate something
that connects us all...

860
00:51:09,939 --> 00:51:13,234
The beauty of being alive...

861
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:15,401
This art.

862
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:18,155
The art divide us, not art.

863
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:20,849
You are very sentimental, Nicholi.

864
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:24,349
Speaks of sentimentality like a disease.

865
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:26,363
I say something funny.

866
00:51:26,463 --> 00:51:28,982
What's the problem sentimentality?

867
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:30,733
No place in art.

868
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:33,794
Who said?
- Please Nicholi.

869
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:38,249
Sentimentality is a way
to express yourself...

870
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:40,033
Mediocre, mellow...

871
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:42,768
Indicating a lack of intellect.

872
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:43,733
Bullshit.

873
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,014
You're so intellectual...

874
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:48,599
Who became stupid, Curtis.

875
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:52,269
Feeling is condescending...

876
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:54,097
Is a human being...

877
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:55,431
Is knowing that life...

878
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:56,870
Is short.

879
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,268
A lot of short.

880
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,894
I know at my age.

881
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:02,994
If it is feeling.

882
00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:05,822
I'm proud of that.

883
00:52:05,908 --> 00:52:08,493
It's what you did...

884
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:11,412
I find very disturbing.

885
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,689
Cry...

886
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:15,789
Hurt, imagine...

887
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,026
Laugh...

888
00:52:17,126 --> 00:52:19,795
Laugh even something...

889
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:24,341
Is a building block of our humanity.

890
00:52:24,466 --> 00:52:26,551
Is what builds bridges.

891
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,004
Great Rembrandt, Van Gogh...

892
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:32,104
Monet, Renoir.

893
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:37,011
You talk of unrest, disorder...

894
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:40,439
Chaos, bloody chaos.

895
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:43,049
Sorry.
- Alright.

896
00:52:43,149 --> 00:52:45,773
I'm talking about a sector
completely different...

897
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:47,053
...of the human condition.

898
00:52:47,153 --> 00:52:49,618
But that has no place in art.

899
00:52:49,822 --> 00:52:52,275
And the man from the ghetto, Nicholi.

900
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,520
Where is the beauty of its existence?

901
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,688
You know the ghetto...

902
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:01,249
Far as i know construct a rocket.

903
00:53:02,876 --> 00:53:05,851
There must be beauty in the ghetto.

904
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,339
Many geniuses...

905
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,159
Born in the ghetto.

906
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:13,594
Need seek beauty there...

907
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:15,913
With people who come from there.

908
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:17,013
Not a...

909
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,708
...rich asshole who does not know
anything about the ghetto...

910
00:53:19,808 --> 00:53:22,310
That says 'wretched ghetto.

911
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:24,846
I feel your pain, I know everything.

912
00:53:24,946 --> 00:53:27,523
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.'

913
00:53:28,149 --> 00:53:29,801
Do you know what this is?

914
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:31,344
Is bullshit.

915
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:33,446
Is fucking bullshit.

916
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:39,852
Sorry.

917
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:41,952
Okay.

918
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:47,150
Thanks, Nicholi, for one more night
wonderful and stimulating.

919
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,318
Alright, Curtis.

920
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:51,120
We will solve the problems
of the world next time.

921
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,352
Combined, friend.
- Right.

922
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,908
Good night, beautiful Sandra.
- Thank you.

923
00:53:56,008 --> 00:53:58,008
Good night.

924
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,136
Good night.

925
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:14,648
Damn idiot.

926
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:20,656
COUNTY ART FAIR...

927
00:54:20,781 --> 00:54:24,309
...knew it would not do so hot.
Heat in August?

928
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:26,686
I hope that does not affect attendance.
- Yes.

929
00:54:26,786 --> 00:54:29,939
Here is the man of the moment,
Nicholi Seroff.

930
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,817
Please know our friend and hostess...

931
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:34,494
Miss. Sally Huntington-Quail.

932
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:37,613
It is an honor to have him as a juror
in our exhibition, Mr. Seroff.

933
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:40,340
My pleasure.
Nicholi, please.

934
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:43,910
Hello, lovely Sandra.
- Hello, Nicholi.

935
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:44,920
Can I?

936
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,910
Yes, you are just waiting,
Nicholi.

937
00:55:03,862 --> 00:55:05,862
What is this?

938
00:55:06,197 --> 00:55:08,237
It Nicholi Seroff?
- Yes.

939
00:55:08,314 --> 00:55:09,559
Is it yours?

940
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:11,659
Yes.

941
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:15,080
What is the purpose?

942
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:24,671
Wheels mechanized.

943
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,800
Managed to more or less.

944
00:55:34,056 --> 00:55:36,642
Lord accepts wine?

945
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,810
Under the table.

946
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,481
Here. Ready.

947
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,009
You can keep the bottle.
- Thank you.

948
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,109
Welcome.

949
00:56:06,169 --> 00:56:07,529
Is the artist?

950
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:09,629
Yes.

951
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:11,240
What do you mean?

952
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,160
I explore the two-dimensionality of the site.

953
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,260
Mean, your plan.

954
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:17,192
Yes.

955
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:19,706
It is flat, there is to explore?

956
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:22,526
The goal is to explore the plan.

957
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:24,893
I'm lost.

958
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:27,046
You know...

959
00:56:27,146 --> 00:56:28,807
Is a trip that I made.

960
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:29,933
A journey?

961
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:33,819
Yes exploration of what it already is.

962
00:56:33,944 --> 00:56:35,062
The plan?

963
00:56:35,162 --> 00:56:37,056
Yes.

964
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:38,849
So...

965
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:40,267
Goes where?

966
00:56:40,367 --> 00:56:41,810
I explore it.

967
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,728
What is now?

968
00:56:43,828 --> 00:56:45,828
Yes.

969
00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:47,774
Got it?

970
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:49,874
No.

971
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,881
PEACE.

972
00:56:57,508 --> 00:56:58,534
My God.

973
00:56:58,634 --> 00:57:03,663
See Nicholi this room was like seeing
Marilyn Monroe in a freak show.

974
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:07,673
How was outnumbered,
she had become a stranger.

975
00:57:09,769 --> 00:57:11,769
Do you want anything?

976
00:57:11,855 --> 00:57:14,660
A gallon of gasoline and matches.

977
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,940
Nicholi, having fun?

978
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,192
Amusing me?

979
00:57:19,861 --> 00:57:21,397
Amusing me?

980
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:24,199
Yes, I'm having fun.

981
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:28,728
You know...

982
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:32,498
If I live another ten years...

983
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:35,709
I see a bucket full of urine...

984
00:57:35,876 --> 00:57:38,183
The modern art museum.
Please help me.

985
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:40,080
Yes, let's go home. Let.

986
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,865
Nicholi.

987
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:44,384
These people are crazy.

988
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:46,676
Crazy.

989
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:48,746
E...

990
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:51,724
This crap too.

991
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,709
It's all crap.

992
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,809
People.

993
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:57,885
You see crap.

994
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,223
It's all crap.
- Come on.

995
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:01,608
Crap. Crap.

996
00:58:01,817 --> 00:58:05,771
Is an exhibition of madness and insanity.

997
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:09,157
And the madness is winning.

998
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:11,601
Madness is winning.
- Come on.

999
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:14,676
This is the only thing...
- Come on.

1000
00:58:14,769 --> 00:58:18,916
The only thing that makes sense here.

1001
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,751
Ready.

1002
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,421
Congratulations.

1003
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:48,760
What is this?

1004
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,927
I do not know anymore.

1005
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,597
I tried to paint the house.
I do not want the tree...

1006
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,107
Change the perspective.

1007
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:56,108
What was your first thought?

1008
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:57,935
I do not know.

1009
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,095
If you do not know, how will I know?

1010
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,565
What do you say?

1011
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,192
I had a good idea, but the lost.

1012
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,402
No.

1013
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,320
not had a good idea.

1014
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,006
A good idea is not lost.

1015
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:17,794
Monet paint this house
with a bucket of manure.

1016
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:21,071
He stood beside a wagon and painted.

1017
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:24,863
I want you to pay close attention.

1018
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:28,229
Never forget what I tell her.

1019
00:59:28,563 --> 00:59:30,563
Okay.
- Never Forget.

1020
00:59:35,736 --> 00:59:38,806
Not understand anything.
Only is making noise.

1021
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:41,241
How not speak clearly...

1022
00:59:41,783 --> 00:59:43,783
Not say anything.

1023
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,859
E is the same...

1024
00:59:45,898 --> 00:59:48,278
With the crap that produces.

1025
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:51,457
Only...

1026
00:59:51,543 --> 00:59:53,543
Have an idea.

1027
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,796
My companion arrived.

1028
00:59:58,674 --> 01:00:00,674
Can you do a favor?

1029
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:03,912
Do not yell at me in front of her?

1030
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:06,152
Sure, you can leave.

1031
01:00:06,252 --> 01:00:07,111
Hello.

1032
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:08,499
Carla.

1033
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:10,599
Brownies.

1034
01:00:12,311 --> 01:00:14,311
What are you doing?

1035
01:00:14,563 --> 01:00:16,773
Learning to speak clearly.

1036
01:00:22,237 --> 01:00:24,237
Is interesting.

1037
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,284
I was not speaking clearly.

1038
01:00:28,326 --> 01:00:30,326
Okay...

1039
01:00:30,578 --> 01:00:32,980
I have to learn.
- How are you?

1040
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,205
Idiot.
What are you doing?

1041
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,570
Nicholi
taught art therapy at a local school...

1042
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,670
For special children.

1043
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,451
It was nice to see that side of him.

1044
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:48,846
The gentle man he could be.

1045
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:52,139
And he seemed like a lot.

1046
01:00:52,556 --> 01:00:53,556
The...

1047
01:00:53,656 --> 01:00:56,460
...school teachers said that
Seroff was the favorite guest.

1048
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,560
Put more water.
- Okay.

1049
01:00:58,638 --> 01:00:59,880
More water.

1050
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,840
Yes, anyway.

1051
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,940
Try.

1052
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:07,913
Put?? more strength in the face.

1053
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:10,071
And here in birds.

1054
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:38,832
My goodness.

1055
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:42,417
These children make
more sense to me than.

1056
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:43,597
Curtis Sunday.

1057
01:01:43,697 --> 01:01:45,697
You know...

1058
01:01:45,814 --> 01:01:47,814
Guess...

1059
01:01:47,982 --> 01:01:50,234
Is ready to paint.

1060
01:02:37,945 --> 01:02:39,945
It's beautiful.

1061
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:42,155
Thank you.

1062
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:44,142
Take.

1063
01:02:44,242 --> 01:02:46,242
If you get thirsty.

1064
01:02:47,203 --> 01:02:49,288
Thank you.
Thanks again.

1065
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:41,320
Hi, I want to thank and return your glass.

1066
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,410
Thank you.

1067
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:47,381
Are you okay?

1068
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:53,472
Was not convincing.

1069
01:03:54,265 --> 01:03:56,265
Are you sure?

1070
01:03:59,686 --> 01:04:01,980
I'm just having a bad day.

1071
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:04,266
Well..

1072
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:06,693
I want the anime a bit?

1073
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:10,388
When I'm having a bad day,
like hot chocolate...

1074
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:12,490
And chat with a friend.

1075
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:15,326
Want some hot chocolate?

1076
01:04:16,535 --> 01:04:18,529
I have time,
can not paint now.

1077
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:20,629
The clouds are moving.

1078
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:27,713
I'm making her feel better?

1079
01:04:32,008 --> 01:04:34,008
Yes...

1080
01:04:35,427 --> 01:04:37,427
...is.

1081
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,349
If you...

1082
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:44,878
Want to talk about something...

1083
01:04:44,978 --> 01:04:46,978
Can talk.

1084
01:04:47,939 --> 01:04:49,939
No.

1085
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,233
It's nothing.

1086
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:56,069
I'll talk a bit.

1087
01:04:57,072 --> 01:04:59,741
Seroff Why is so boring?

1088
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:03,119
Is always in a bad mood,
drinking.

1089
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:05,872
I think he hates me.

1090
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,041
If he hated...

1091
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:12,418
You know.

1092
01:05:12,586 --> 01:05:15,986
're Telling me is the coolest he can be?

1093
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,329
He told him about his wife?

1094
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:23,955
Well..

1095
01:05:24,055 --> 01:05:26,055
A bit.

1096
01:05:26,391 --> 01:05:29,519
He told how she died?

1097
01:05:30,478 --> 01:05:32,478
No.

1098
01:05:33,981 --> 01:05:35,799
She was killed...

1099
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:37,760
In Russia...

1100
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:42,097
During the occupation of Stalin
in something they call...

1101
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:44,197
Of the Great Purge.

1102
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:48,036
He was the only family escape.

1103
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:52,329
This kind of guilt...

1104
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:54,998
Never leaves him.

1105
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:02,582
But if you think about it,
he did nothing wrong.

1106
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,660
Of course we did.

1107
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:08,136
He survived.

1108
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:25,011
Take.

1109
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:27,905
Help me cut vegetables.

1110
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:30,865
Why up so early?

1111
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:34,787
Today will be busy.

1112
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,606
Happy?

1113
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:39,066
Demonstrates is how?

1114
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,585
Cut smaller pieces.

1115
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,710
Okay.

1116
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:48,950
You are happy, are not you?
- Yes, why not?

1117
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,050
A man can not be happy?

1118
01:06:59,268 --> 01:07:02,979
Young Johnny is doing very well in school.

1119
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,815
What wonder, Nicholi and John.

1120
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:09,569
But and the work that was promised?

1121
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:10,970
Is anxious, is not it?

1122
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,239
Yeah.
- Well..

1123
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:15,531
I'll get.

1124
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,569
I'll get.
- How about dinner?

1125
01:07:18,669 --> 01:07:20,669
Like this?
- Yes.

1126
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,980
Here.

1127
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,541
's Progressive art.

1128
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,480
Not my specialty, so I want to hear...

1129
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,836
What you have to say.

1130
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,200
This one.

1131
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,418
My goodness.

1132
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,994
Do not like...

1133
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,094
Shut up.

1134
01:07:39,191 --> 01:07:40,831
You know...

1135
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,132
Think so.

1136
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,232
Yes, it is.

1137
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:47,101
So, what do you think?

1138
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:59,324
What do you think, darling?

1139
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,409
Not my specialty, dear.

1140
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:05,174
We know this, but can say what you think.

1141
01:08:05,274 --> 01:08:06,884
I think I will continue as a psychologist.

1142
01:08:06,984 --> 01:08:09,040
Please take a position.

1143
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:11,248
Depth E?

1144
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,964
Right, has depth.

1145
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:19,032
Depth?

1146
01:08:19,132 --> 01:08:21,132
Is super deep.

1147
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:23,595
Yes, it is super deep.

1148
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:26,471
My God.

1149
01:08:27,473 --> 01:08:29,473
Let me see the next.

1150
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:34,004
Yes.

1151
01:08:34,104 --> 01:08:36,104
My God.

1152
01:08:36,398 --> 01:08:39,693
My God, there's so much pain.

1153
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:42,792
Pain?
- The angularity...

1154
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:44,892
Yes
- Das lines.

1155
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:48,618
E despair.
A great sense of despair.

1156
01:08:48,785 --> 01:08:49,852
Yes.

1157
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:51,687
E craving.

1158
01:08:51,787 --> 01:08:53,147
A lot of eagerness.

1159
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:55,916
Lust, yes.
- And a sadness.

1160
01:08:58,418 --> 01:09:00,754
Sadness and anger.

1161
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:05,533
Is a yin and yang emotional.
Do not you think, dear?

1162
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:08,536
Absolutely.
- Must see this, Nicholi.

1163
01:09:08,636 --> 01:09:10,805
You see the sadness.

1164
01:09:11,055 --> 01:09:14,558
Yes, I think it's very sad.

1165
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,227
I was impressed.

1166
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:19,838
I need to know this artist.
This is...

1167
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:22,573
More, I want to see more.
- Yes.

1168
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,402
This. Like this.

1169
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,306
It is as if there were different styles
work here.

1170
01:09:30,406 --> 01:09:35,126
If you do not know, I would say
that there is more of a hand...

1171
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:36,312
...working, but...

1172
01:09:36,412 --> 01:09:39,414
But there is a predominant theme.

1173
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:42,123
Is...

1174
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:44,661
Is a passive impression...

1175
01:09:44,761 --> 01:09:46,761
I would say...

1176
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:50,825
Aimlessness.

1177
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:52,159
Yes.

1178
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:53,244
Lack of goal.

1179
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:56,213
The artist expresses himself...

1180
01:09:56,313 --> 01:09:58,932
By minimalist.

1181
01:09:59,725 --> 01:10:01,793
created by the essential simplicity.

1182
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:05,505
This has weight, focal
point, secondary ideas...

1183
01:10:05,605 --> 01:10:08,665
Is totally coherent.
E is purposeful.

1184
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:11,027
And see it all...

1185
01:10:11,527 --> 01:10:14,405
On two blue squares...

1186
01:10:14,738 --> 01:10:16,932
And a coconut?
- It is impossible not to see.

1187
01:10:17,032 --> 01:10:19,032
It's so obvious.

1188
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:22,479
Yes.

1189
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:24,072
It's so obvious.

1190
01:10:24,172 --> 01:10:26,892
'll Tell you what is so obvious.

1191
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:29,902
Is that you only talk nonsense.

1192
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:31,737
Please Nicholi.

1193
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:34,073
As you said it is not their specialty.

1194
01:10:34,173 --> 01:10:37,376
This art is great and I think you're jealous.

1195
01:10:37,476 --> 01:10:38,619
These frames...

1196
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,098
Special children are at
school in which I teach.

1197
01:10:48,102 --> 01:10:49,712
What?

1198
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,473
Genius, simplicity, longing.

1199
01:10:52,573 --> 01:10:54,573
All this is bullshit.

1200
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:56,668
Bullshit.

1201
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,345
Nicholi, this is not funny.

1202
01:10:58,445 --> 01:11:00,731
I think it's hilarious.

1203
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:02,557
You know what, I will not be for coffee.

1204
01:11:02,657 --> 01:11:04,351
No, please stay...

1205
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:07,812
And see the wonderful picture of a red car
. Have anxiety.

1206
01:11:07,912 --> 01:11:09,647
Grab your stuff.
Come on, honey.

1207
01:11:09,747 --> 01:11:12,483
Curtis, I have a wonderful picture of a dog.

1208
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:15,528
What do you think? Is not it beautiful.
- Enough.

1209
01:11:15,628 --> 01:11:17,288
Is a beautiful picture.

1210
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:22,050
Is a work of art two mice oranges.

1211
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:25,470
You know, Nicholi,
you really mad.

1212
01:11:25,678 --> 01:11:28,673
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.

1213
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,583
What's so funny?

1214
01:11:30,683 --> 01:11:32,683
I'm crazy.

1215
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:36,188
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.

1216
01:11:36,313 --> 01:11:40,317
You can stop laughing?
- I freaked.

1217
01:11:40,484 --> 01:11:43,937
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.

1218
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:46,037
I'm crazy.

1219
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,943
Yes, yes.

1220
01:12:00,043 --> 01:12:01,903
Good day.

1221
01:12:02,003 --> 01:12:04,003
Yes.

1222
01:12:05,507 --> 01:12:07,634
What?
What?

1223
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:11,913
I came to see if you
could teach me to paint.

1224
01:12:12,013 --> 01:12:13,664
What?

1225
01:12:13,764 --> 01:12:15,764
Paint?

1226
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,501
Yes.

1227
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:19,686
Paint what you want.

1228
01:12:45,877 --> 01:12:48,463
Wasps found in the attic.

1229
01:12:48,588 --> 01:12:49,614
Good.

1230
01:12:49,714 --> 01:12:51,407
Why not go for a ride?

1231
01:12:51,507 --> 01:12:53,993
I'm here for two hours and finally
'm getting something.

1232
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:56,845
The sun moved in two hours.

1233
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:58,747
I know said.

1234
01:12:58,847 --> 01:13:00,758
But I want to finish painting.

1235
01:13:00,858 --> 01:13:02,459
Go take care of wasps.

1236
01:13:02,559 --> 01:13:03,969
Why do not you do it?

1237
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:07,463
Do not think I'm too old to climb the ladder
?

1238
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:10,633
Do not climb the ladder
and say how good it is.

1239
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:13,636
What did you say, useless?
- You heard me.

1240
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:16,263
Agreed that I would come and
you would teach me to paint...

1241
01:13:16,363 --> 01:13:17,690
I did not come to fix your home.

1242
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:21,101
And the story that his
father did not understand?

1243
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:23,019
What do you know about my father?

1244
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:26,815
What I know about it?
He?? thinks I'm a gay old man.

1245
01:13:26,915 --> 01:13:28,408
You should know.

1246
01:13:28,508 --> 01:13:31,369
He just wants chicken...

1247
01:13:31,469 --> 01:13:33,879
Chicken, chicken.

1248
01:13:34,004 --> 01:13:36,240
Just know you've been drinking.

1249
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,467
Want a lesson today?

1250
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:40,717
I will show Him.

1251
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,913
The sky is off.

1252
01:13:43,013 --> 01:13:45,974
Everything reflects the sky.

1253
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:47,917
Here, look.

1254
01:13:48,017 --> 01:13:49,544
I'll put here.
- What?

1255
01:13:49,644 --> 01:13:51,929
At all.
- What is it?

1256
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:54,029
Okay.

1257
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:56,565
Thank you.

1258
01:13:56,942 --> 01:13:58,302
Must be improved.

1259
01:13:58,402 --> 01:13:59,511
Fuck.

1260
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:00,646
What I damned?

1261
01:14:00,746 --> 01:14:04,307
Yes, damn it, Nicholi.
- What would you like to eat for dinner?

1262
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:06,407
What about fish?

1263
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,703
I'm tired of meat.

1264
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,500
Wasps are waiting.

1265
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:19,669
Must be joking.

1266
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:34,433
Come on, wake up.

1267
01:14:35,102 --> 01:14:37,102
Wake up, come on.

1268
01:14:39,356 --> 01:14:41,356
Come on, I'm hungry.

1269
01:14:52,493 --> 01:14:54,493
Come on.

1270
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:56,703
Open.

1271
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,571
My goodness.

1272
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,197
The sky is falling.
- Really?

1273
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,907
Yes, it is...
- I can tell.

1274
01:15:08,007 --> 01:15:11,160
Started when I was in
the middle of the field.

1275
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,703
Want a towel?

1276
01:15:12,803 --> 01:15:15,523
Would be nice.
- You can take it.

1277
01:15:16,056 --> 01:15:19,643
Yes, sorry.
I'm wetting everything.

1278
01:15:27,358 --> 01:15:28,885
Paint...

1279
01:15:28,985 --> 01:15:32,446
Is what you want to do?
Want to live it?

1280
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:39,228
I do not know.
Never thought about it...

1281
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:42,218
As a way to earn money,
understand?

1282
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:45,817
I know I love doing this,
I feel passion...

1283
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:48,807
Only talking about it get excited.

1284
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:54,366
There is a place in New York called
Grand Central Art Galleries.

1285
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:58,126
I go up there and spend
hours looking at those...

1286
01:15:58,226 --> 01:15:59,746
...beautiful.

1287
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,846
I see...

1288
01:16:01,922 --> 01:16:05,894
And literally feel my heart beat faster.

1289
01:16:08,187 --> 01:16:10,737
I do not know how they manage.

1290
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:15,903
If we 5cm Frame see only strokes...

1291
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,070
Ink and color.

1292
01:16:19,823 --> 01:16:21,641
E...

1293
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:23,310
...30 away...

1294
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,703
We see a gorgeous frame.

1295
01:16:26,955 --> 01:16:31,526
It is as if we felt the wind
blowing through the trees...

1296
01:16:31,626 --> 01:16:33,626
A sea breeze...

1297
01:16:35,462 --> 01:16:37,462
Wow.

1298
01:16:38,382 --> 01:16:40,382
Is...

1299
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:44,035
I do not know how they manage to do this.

1300
01:16:46,014 --> 01:16:49,414
I know something inside me, somewhere...

1301
01:16:49,767 --> 01:16:52,144
Struggle to leave.

1302
01:16:56,023 --> 01:16:57,758
You'll get.

1303
01:16:57,858 --> 01:16:59,858
I do not know.

1304
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:02,195
I like a lot.

1305
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:04,919
There are other things I like to do.

1306
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:08,568
Storytelling,
make people laugh...

1307
01:17:08,668 --> 01:17:10,269
Love music.

1308
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:12,369
Do you play anything?

1309
01:17:12,705 --> 01:17:14,705
Yes, guitar and sax.

1310
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:20,212
Then is a true Renaissance man.

1311
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:24,299
I do not know, maybe.

1312
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:29,226
Looks like you're apologizing.

1313
01:17:31,305 --> 01:17:34,365
Things are tough at home, is not it?

1314
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,495
The whatever is going on there...

1315
01:17:45,276 --> 01:17:47,276
Not worry...

1316
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:51,447
You'll be fine.

1317
01:17:55,536 --> 01:17:57,536
Thank you.

1318
01:18:05,086 --> 01:18:08,571
Nicholi told me what happened to her son.

1319
01:18:09,215 --> 01:18:11,215
I wonder...

1320
01:18:11,717 --> 01:18:13,953
If someone took care of him.

1321
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:16,053
Nicholi?

1322
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:21,850
Something.

1323
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:26,062
And her husband?

1324
01:18:26,856 --> 01:18:29,317
I've never been married.

1325
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:32,026
Only got pregnant.

1326
01:18:33,362 --> 01:18:35,362
The father around?

1327
01:18:40,577 --> 01:18:42,577
Listen...

1328
01:18:44,372 --> 01:18:46,497
I know you feel guilty...

1329
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:48,443
But should not.

1330
01:18:48,543 --> 01:18:51,295
Not done anything wrong.

1331
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:02,305
You are very kind, John.

1332
01:19:05,683 --> 01:19:09,428
Do not let anyone make you
give up what you want to do...

1333
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:11,339
...

1334
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:13,439
Who want to be.

1335
01:19:19,112 --> 01:19:21,112
Follow your heart.

1336
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:51,724
Thank you.

1337
01:20:06,531 --> 01:20:08,531
You are beautiful.

1338
01:20:10,826 --> 01:20:12,826
Thank you.

1339
01:20:36,141 --> 01:20:38,436
I tried to wake him, was...

1340
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:41,478
Overturned.

1341
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:52,863
I better...

1342
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:55,741
Take it home.

1343
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,208
Good night, Nicholi.

1344
01:21:05,543 --> 01:21:07,362
Good night...

1345
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,462
Carla.

1346
01:21:21,099 --> 01:21:23,099
So...

1347
01:21:24,936 --> 01:21:26,936
I...

1348
01:21:27,063 --> 01:21:29,063
Enter or...

1349
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:31,565
Go?

1350
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:34,651
I love...

1351
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,030
But...
- Go away.

1352
01:21:39,825 --> 01:21:41,825
I understand.

1353
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
Thank you.

1354
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:43,965
Well..

1355
01:22:44,134 --> 01:22:46,134
You...

1356
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:49,762
She is my friend.

1357
01:22:50,181 --> 01:22:51,916
My friend.

1358
01:22:52,016 --> 01:22:54,016
Not yours.

1359
01:22:56,353 --> 01:22:57,713
I'm sorry.

1360
01:22:57,813 --> 01:22:59,298
I bet you do.

1361
01:22:59,398 --> 01:23:01,523
You are right, not sorry.

1362
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,609
I want you to go away.

1363
01:23:03,694 --> 01:23:05,053
Okay.

1364
01:23:05,153 --> 01:23:07,153
Come into my life...

1365
01:23:07,447 --> 01:23:10,408
And turned upside down...

1366
01:23:10,658 --> 01:23:12,658
As if it was nothing.

1367
01:23:12,952 --> 01:23:13,978
How dare you?

1368
01:23:14,078 --> 01:23:16,078
You lied to me.

1369
01:23:16,154 --> 01:23:18,154
Do not lie.

1370
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,374
I was helping...

1371
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,585
But is too young...

1372
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:25,795
Too stupid...

1373
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:30,259
To see the gifts that I gave you.

1374
01:23:31,302 --> 01:23:33,302
Everyone present.

1375
01:23:37,015 --> 01:23:40,102
I want to go away tonight.

1376
01:23:40,894 --> 01:23:43,630
I will,
and you go back to your bottle.

1377
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:45,423
Feel sorry for yourself.

1378
01:23:45,523 --> 01:23:47,342
You do not understand.

1379
01:23:47,442 --> 01:23:49,442
Not understand.

1380
01:23:49,986 --> 01:23:52,655
I'm at the end of life...

1381
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,699
And only see...

1382
01:23:55,908 --> 01:23:58,076
A bad life...

1383
01:23:58,243 --> 01:24:00,020
Front of me.

1384
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,606
I'm early in my life and I see the same thing.

1385
01:24:02,706 --> 01:24:05,341
You had the world in his hands.

1386
01:24:05,435 --> 01:24:07,435
For five minutes.

1387
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:10,196
Do not know if I'm good, I know nothing.

1388
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:11,864
I do not know to go home.

1389
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,964
I do not care.

1390
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,176
No one cares.

1391
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:21,389
Is what I was trying to tell her...

1392
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,640
All the time.

1393
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,940
The world is very ugly.

1394
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,943
E killed...

1395
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:48,164
The most beautiful thing...

1396
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:50,833
I've ever seen...

1397
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,334
My Anya.

1398
01:24:58,131 --> 01:25:00,131
My goodness.

1399
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:05,472
She was so happy.

1400
01:25:11,519 --> 01:25:13,729
I remember her laughter.

1401
01:25:17,524 --> 01:25:19,524
Because...

1402
01:25:20,068 --> 01:25:24,406
She would never part of his ugliness...

1403
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,990
Took her from me.

1404
01:25:43,006 --> 01:25:45,131
Knew you had something...

1405
01:25:46,176 --> 01:25:49,151
Even before seeing his paintings...

1406
01:25:51,889 --> 01:25:56,060
Before appearing at my door, remember?

1407
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:00,213
But you...

1408
01:26:00,313 --> 01:26:03,968
Would be crazy to become a painter
nowadays.

1409
01:26:04,442 --> 01:26:06,261
No heroes.

1410
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,906
No Van Gogh,
Rembrandt, Monet...

1411
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:12,742
Renoir no, nothing.

1412
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,912
Expected it to be my hero.

1413
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:25,293
I'm tired.

1414
01:26:25,462 --> 01:26:27,462
I am very...

1415
01:26:27,559 --> 01:26:29,559
Tired.

1416
01:27:10,002 --> 01:27:12,002
Nicholi?

1417
01:27:12,463 --> 01:27:15,758
Come, let us take breakfast.

1418
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:23,304
Nicholi?

1419
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:31,145
My goodness.

1420
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:35,190
Gotcha.

1421
01:27:36,735 --> 01:27:38,735
You idiot.

1422
01:27:42,115 --> 01:27:44,576
Today we paint.

1423
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:49,287
Not funny.

1424
01:27:54,877 --> 01:27:57,404
We went to the field that morning...

1425
01:27:57,504 --> 01:27:59,281
And it seemed another person.

1426
01:27:59,381 --> 01:28:01,381
His palette...

1427
01:28:01,591 --> 01:28:03,927
Should always be the same.

1428
01:28:05,011 --> 01:28:08,081
Your colors are like the keys of a piano.

1429
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:11,500
Musicians need to be always
in the same place...

1430
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,169
To express themselves.

1431
01:28:13,269 --> 01:28:15,713
The great painters do the same thing.

1432
01:28:15,813 --> 01:28:17,640
He showed me a lot.

1433
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,858
He flooded me knowledge.

1434
01:28:19,983 --> 01:28:22,986
A life of secrets ran like a river.

1435
01:28:23,153 --> 01:28:25,055
The sun is like a woman...

1436
01:28:25,155 --> 01:28:27,790
When he kisses her warm lips...

1437
01:28:29,659 --> 01:28:32,353
It leaves a little color everywhere.

1438
01:28:32,453 --> 01:28:36,368
I began to see yellows,
ochres, oranges and reds...

1439
01:28:36,468 --> 01:28:37,434
...everywhere.

1440
01:28:37,534 --> 01:28:42,087
And the forest is hot but calm.
The opposite of war.

1441
01:28:42,337 --> 01:28:44,823
Not only about the color temperature...

1442
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:48,217
But it is the opposite on the color.

1443
01:28:50,386 --> 01:28:53,264
The forest has yellow and purple.

1444
01:28:53,472 --> 01:28:56,141
The grass is green everywhere.

1445
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:58,752
Where the light passes, is pink.

1446
01:28:58,852 --> 01:29:00,852
Got it?

1447
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,341
It was amazing what he could do.

1448
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:06,885
In a few seconds he turned
something simple...

1449
01:29:06,985 --> 01:29:08,985
On something alive.

1450
01:29:09,195 --> 01:29:11,195
Must fight...

1451
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:15,075
Must make way to give life to things.

1452
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:18,412
You must feel the joy.

1453
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:22,234
He?? showed me how to
make the sky vibrate.

1454
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,651
Bravo, John.

1455
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:26,152
Bravo.

1456
01:29:26,252 --> 01:29:28,252
This is life.

1457
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,490
I feel the shadows.

1458
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:33,968
I feel the sun approaching.

1459
01:29:34,552 --> 01:29:37,137
The joy of it all.

1460
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:41,139
Bravo, John.

1461
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:46,880
I have to thank you...

1462
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,190
The time he spent with me.

1463
01:29:50,233 --> 01:29:52,233
I is that I thank him.

1464
01:29:52,443 --> 01:29:55,446
No, you showed me something...

1465
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:58,240
I thought I would not see.

1466
01:29:59,741 --> 01:30:01,560
Thanks, Nicholi.

1467
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,660
Thank you.

1468
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,659
Better...

1469
01:30:18,759 --> 01:30:20,702
Say goodbye to his girlfriend.

1470
01:30:20,802 --> 01:30:22,621
Do not you think?

1471
01:30:22,721 --> 01:30:25,123
She's not my girlfriend, Nicholi.

1472
01:30:25,223 --> 01:30:29,048
Leave a note,
a beautiful letter or something.

1473
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,003
Great, great.

1474
01:30:31,103 --> 01:30:33,103
I'll wait here.

1475
01:31:02,507 --> 01:31:04,284
Dear Carla...

1476
01:31:04,384 --> 01:31:05,994
You were right...

1477
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:08,094
I was lost.

1478
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:12,708
But finding my way was
very sweet and rewarding.

1479
01:31:12,808 --> 01:31:15,358
His words always accompany me.

1480
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,088
Find your dreams too.

1481
01:31:18,188 --> 01:31:19,715
With Love...

1482
01:31:19,815 --> 01:31:21,815
John.

1483
01:32:05,106 --> 01:32:07,008
've Put your bags upstairs.

1484
01:32:07,108 --> 01:32:09,108
Thank you.

1485
01:32:09,861 --> 01:32:11,861
Whither?

1486
01:32:14,073 --> 01:32:15,432
I do not know.

1487
01:32:15,532 --> 01:32:17,532
I have to solve.

1488
01:32:19,578 --> 01:32:21,578
Good luck.

1489
01:32:59,906 --> 01:33:02,476
I went to the park and drew for hours...

1490
01:33:02,576 --> 01:33:05,721
Rehearsing what to say to my parents.

1491
01:33:05,912 --> 01:33:10,077
Finally, I thought
would be better to face them...

1492
01:33:10,175 --> 01:33:13,150
And let fate take care of the rest.

1493
01:33:37,566 --> 01:33:38,454
Health.

1494
01:33:38,554 --> 01:33:40,552
'Dastrovia'.
- 'Dastrovia'.

1495
01:33:40,652 --> 01:33:42,387
I enjoyed myself.

1496
01:33:42,487 --> 01:33:44,597
Good,
I'm glad to hear that.

1497
01:33:44,697 --> 01:33:46,907
We were talking about you.

1498
01:33:47,408 --> 01:33:49,519
Your friend Nicholi is a good man.

1499
01:33:49,619 --> 01:33:50,728
It is.

1500
01:33:50,828 --> 01:33:54,568
He?? was telling me how
to have a good time.

1501
01:33:57,334 --> 01:33:59,799
Glad you're back.
- Thank you.

1502
01:34:03,423 --> 01:34:05,423
Heard you met a girl.

1503
01:34:05,925 --> 01:34:06,951
Yes - Is it true?

1504
01:34:07,051 --> 01:34:09,051
Yes...

1505
01:34:09,762 --> 01:34:11,622
Want a drink?
- Please.

1506
01:34:11,722 --> 01:34:12,748
Come on.
- Yes.

1507
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:14,848
Come.

1508
01:34:14,975 --> 01:34:16,335
It's good to see you.

1509
01:34:16,435 --> 01:34:18,128
Honey?

1510
01:34:18,228 --> 01:34:19,546
Good...

1511
01:34:19,646 --> 01:34:21,690
Your teacher...

1512
01:34:22,107 --> 01:34:24,109
Came to see his father.

1513
01:34:26,736 --> 01:34:28,780
Learned something?

1514
01:34:29,614 --> 01:34:31,224
Yes, mother.

1515
01:34:31,324 --> 01:34:33,324
A lot.

1516
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:35,728
Good.

1517
01:34:35,828 --> 01:34:37,828
It is very good.

1518
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:44,235
I still do not know what
Nicholi said to fix things.

1519
01:34:44,335 --> 01:34:46,335
But no matter.

1520
01:34:46,432 --> 01:34:51,532
My father and I never
talked about what happened that summer.

1521
01:34:58,557 --> 01:35:00,557
Never went to college.

1522
01:35:00,934 --> 01:35:03,399
Chose to study in the museum.

1523
01:35:05,021 --> 01:35:07,021
Especially art.

1524
01:35:08,024 --> 01:35:10,999
But there are other things in life.

1525
01:35:17,658 --> 01:35:20,038
Not helping.
- I can not fix.

1526
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,880
I'm terrible at this.
- A little.

1527
01:35:23,079 --> 01:35:25,940
I understand a bit,
but can not get it from here.

1528
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:26,983
So.

1529
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:30,228
It is the artist.
He?? should do this.

1530
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:33,748
Where are you going?
- I'll take this one for Nicholi.

1531
01:35:33,848 --> 01:35:35,699
You said you'd help me to clear the entry.

1532
01:35:35,799 --> 01:35:38,604
And I will.
I do it when I return.

1533
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:43,832
Okay.

1534
01:35:43,932 --> 01:35:45,041
Take care.

1535
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:48,711
There is a lot of ice on the road.
Drive carefully.

1536
01:35:48,811 --> 01:35:50,811
Okay.

1537
01:35:51,188 --> 01:35:52,757
Okay.

1538
01:35:52,857 --> 01:35:54,550
See his mother.

1539
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,650
See how she looks.

1540
01:35:57,027 --> 01:35:58,387
Look at you.

1541
01:35:58,487 --> 01:36:00,487
You are beautiful.

1542
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:02,989
Dear.

1543
01:36:18,255 --> 01:36:20,255
Nicholi?

1544
01:36:21,883 --> 01:36:23,883
Nicholi?

1545
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,239
Nicholi?

1546
01:36:49,951 --> 01:36:52,311
's How I like to remember it.

1547
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:55,189
Your brush dancing on the screen...

1548
01:36:55,289 --> 01:36:58,179
Like a ballerina dancing on stage.

1549
01:37:02,254 --> 01:37:06,249
I would say that Nicholi
lived many more years.

1550
01:37:06,507 --> 01:37:11,204
That I had given him a gift
or a reminder of what he had been.

1551
01:37:11,304 --> 01:37:14,284
But I think it would be
very presumptuous of me...

1552
01:37:14,384 --> 01:37:16,041
.

1553
01:37:16,141 --> 01:37:18,518
And perhaps a lie.

1554
01:37:29,403 --> 01:37:31,614
Nicholi died that spring.

1555
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:38,787
A part of me died with him.

1556
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:43,929
I stopped painting for many years.

1557
01:37:51,632 --> 01:37:55,135
FOR JOHN.

1558
01:37:57,012 --> 01:37:59,306
FOR JOHN.

1559
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,490
Heard he left the house for Carla.

1560
01:38:04,573 --> 01:38:06,033
She had designed most of it...

1561
01:38:06,133 --> 01:38:09,788
And I think we both knew it would end like.

1562
01:38:17,322 --> 01:38:21,402
Other interests have led
me to the west coast...

1563
01:38:23,745 --> 01:38:25,745
But as he grew older...

1564
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:29,439
More ideas Nicholi returned to guide me.

1565
01:38:29,792 --> 01:38:32,257
And all the gifts he gave me.

1566
01:38:35,506 --> 01:38:38,008
Still see men as trees.

1567
01:38:42,053 --> 01:38:45,538
How naked people dancing on the hillside.

1568
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:51,671
Clouds are everywhere
in where angels soar.

1569
01:38:54,064 --> 01:38:57,509
It took me years to realize
that Nicholi had died...

1570
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:01,179
But the whole time he was here,
living inside me.

1571
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:04,764
Waiting patiently me to share my journey.

1572
01:39:05,992 --> 01:39:08,102
But most important for me...

1573
01:39:08,202 --> 01:39:11,455
Kept his promise long...

1574
01:39:13,165 --> 01:39:16,794
's Heart Nicholi would be my home...

1575
01:39:17,169 --> 01:39:19,379
Everyday of my life.

1576
01:39:32,516 --> 01:39:34,698
IN 1991 JOHN TALIA MADE
HIS FIRST EXPOSURE.

1577
01:39:34,798 --> 01:39:37,337
THE GRAND CENTRAL ART
GALLERIES IN NEW YORK.

1578
01:39:37,437 --> 01:39:41,483
SAME GALLERY representing
Nicholi Seroff.

1579
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:47,022
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO THE
REMEMBRANCE OF GEORGE Cherepov.

1580

AURIELLO YAMMERINO ARTHUR J. Ornitz.

1581
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:53,955
THREE MEN WHOSE LOVE AND PATIENCE
CHANGED MY LIFE.

1582
01:42:48,946 --> 01:42:54,660
MASTER OF LIFE.
