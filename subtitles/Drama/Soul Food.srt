1
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,342
And everything you've given me.

2
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,519
I always keep it inside.

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,774
You're the driving force in my life.

4
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,167
There isn't anything
or anyone that I could be.

5
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,987
And it just wouldn't feel right.

6
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:19,175
If I didn't have you by my side.

7
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,678
Ooh, you were there for me.

8
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:23,429
To love and care for me.

9
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:26,370
When skies were gray.

10
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,195
Whenever I was down.

11
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,051
You were always there.

12
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:32,866
To comfort me.

13
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,514
No one else can be.

14
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:36,203
What you have been to me.

15
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:38,768
You will always be.

16
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:43,314
You will always be the girl in my life.

17
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:46,109
For all times.

18
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,195
Mama.

19
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:53,616
Mama, you know I love you.

20
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:56,578
You know I love you.

21
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:58,955
You know I love you.

22
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:02,062
Mama.

23
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:05,753
Mama,
you're the queen of my heart.

24
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,569
You are.

25
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,984
Your love is like tears from the stars.

26
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:15,075
Your love is like tears from the stars.

27
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:18,224
Mama, I just want you to know.

28
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:21,519
Mama, I just want you to know.

29
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:24,772
Lovin' you is like food to my soul.

30
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:31,006
Lovin' you is like food to my soul.

31
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:43,185
You are the food to my soul.

32
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:53,500
My grandma always said...

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,669
'Family pullin' together in
times of need makes you strong.'

34
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,840
This here's the story about
my family, about our family...

35
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,176
...about the things that pulled us together...

36
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,567
...and things that tried to pull us apart.

37
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,098
Let's see.
Where should I begin?

38
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:12,289
Give it up for the last
Joseph sister to get married--.

39
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,520
Bird and Lem.

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,314
Aunt Bird's wedding
is as good a place as any.

41
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:19,108
Everyone who was anyone was there.

42
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,402
Just the party people to the dance floor.

43
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,948
If you got more than $5.00,
let me see you shake it.

44
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,534
We got food. We got music.

45
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:30,184
We got a party happening here.

46
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:31,653
There you go, Big Mama.

47
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,134
That's my mom and dad dancing.

48
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:37,992
They got two and a half kids--
me, my sister Kelly...

49
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,067
...and whoever that is in the oven.

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,456
That's Aunt Teri and Uncle Miles--.

51
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,749
Iike Miles Davis.

52
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,252
They're both lawyers
and got big-time dough.

53
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,072
I'm talkin' dollar bills, y'all.

54
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:54,884
The bride is Big Mama's
youngest, Aunt Robin.

55
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,809
We call her Bird
'cause she used to be skinny.

56
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,641
The groom is my new uncle, Lem.

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,436
Folks are always doggin' him
'cause he's done time in jail.

58
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,606
Go on, baby.
Go pin it on her.

59
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,681
That's Big Mama there.
Big Mama Joe.

60
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:15,363
People always said she never
made one enemy in her life...

61
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,990
'cause if she did...

62
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,785
...she'd feed 'em her green beans,
sweet potato pie...

63
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,370
...and Southern fried chicken...

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,040
...and they'd be down with her after that.

65
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:30,697
That's my baby.

66
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,124
Reverend Williams--...

67
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:39,419
...ain't even kin, but he's always
got something to say or eat.

68
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,296
Mama Joe, how you doin'?

69
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,839
You lookin' so good.

70
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,841
Them daughters are looking good, too.

71
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:46,176
Especially that Lady Bird.

72
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:49,596
I was teasin' her. I said,
'Would you marry the Reverend?'.

73
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:52,536
She said, 'If I marry,
I need sex every night.'

74
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,872
I said,
'Put me down for Tuesday.'

75
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:57,562
Got to change it up.

76
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:58,938
Something new.

77
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,232
Something new from the underground.

78
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,817
You just take my man.
I'll see how you do.

79
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,071
And this is Simuel.

80
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,887
For Bird, he was one of
the skeletons in the closet...

81
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,112
Big Mama said we all had.

82
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,233
All right.

83
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,250
Look who's here.

84
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,377
What's he doing?

85
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,477
I don't know.

86
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,464
Get out of my way.

87
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:36,604
Heh heh.
Congratulations.

88
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,053
Would you look at this fool?

89
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,472
Lem wasn't doing any better...

90
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,745
...in the 'skeletons in the closet' category.

91
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm going to get her.
Come on, Teri.

92
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:55,305
That was him with his ex,
bumpin' and grindin'.

93
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,833
Honey? -.

94
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,960
Who's Big Mama's favorite grandbaby?

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,044
I am.

96
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:15,088
What would my sweet pea do
for Big Mama?

97
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:16,256
Anything.

98
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:19,300
Then go tell Aunt Bird
to get her butt in here...

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,780
...with her new husband now.

100
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,432
Being Big Mama's favorite wasn't easy...

101
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:27,788
...especially when it came
to keeping the peace.

102
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,561
But I always did what she asked...

103
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,479
...even if it meant
charging into a bathroom...

104
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,554
...full of fine,
half-dressed women.

105
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:36,654
Ahmad, what you want?

106
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,455
Yo, Bird.
- What?

107
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,290
Big Mama said get your black ass out here.

108
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,626
Big Mama ain't told nobody to get nowhere.

109
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:45,616
Stay out of grown folks' business.

110
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:47,986
Can't believe what I saw.
- Me either.

111
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,904
Who invited Simuel?

112
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,114
I didn't.

113
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:54,784
Doesn't matter. Why were
you letting him feel you up?

114
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:57,954
Now your man's dancing
with some Miss Hootchie Mama...

115
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,373
Iike there weren't no wedding
10 minutes ago.

116
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:02,250
Whose man?
- Your man, girl.

117
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,418
Hell, no.

118
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:06,817
Nobody's disrespecting me
on my wedding day.

119
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,006
That's what I mean.

120
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:09,257
Excuse me.

121
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:11,342
Did you see that dress Miss Thing had on?

122
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:14,095
Did you see her behind?
- All up her butt.

123
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,346
That's what she get--...

124
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,474
...draggin' somebody in
who ain't got nothin'...

125
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,476
...and puttin' him off on family.

126
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:22,353
Family? Puttin' him off on me.
I paid for this wedding.

127
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:25,106
Teri, why do you always say
how you pay for everything?

128
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:27,206
'Cause I do.

129
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,948
Who is that hootchie-cootchie mama...

130
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:37,066
...with her fat ass all over my husband?

131
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,443
I told you.

132
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:42,363
This is my wedding day.
I'm supposed to be happy.

133
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,990
Shoot. We happy.

134
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,451
It's supposed to be
the happiest day of your life.

135
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,912
Everybody's happy.
- We're happy.

136
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:53,007
But we'd be more happy
if we beat that ho' down.

137
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,170
Yeah. Come on.

138
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,339
Let's go get her ass.

139
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,038
She's workin' it on him.
Do it. Do it.

140
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,383
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

141
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:13,436
Excuse me.

142
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,802
Whoo.
Shake it. Shake it. Shake it.

143
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,139
Go on, Big Mama.

144
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,369
You see, right there--
that was just like Big Mama.

145
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:32,622
Always knowin' how to set things right.

146
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:35,583
I used to think we had
a special connection...

147
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,285
Iike we shared an inside joke
no one else was in on.

148
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:43,415
Then I found out she had the
same connection with all of us.

149
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:46,084
She was the rock of the Joseph family...

150
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:48,223
...the one that held us all together.

151
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:50,672
Reverend, that sure was
a good sermon today.

152
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,674
One reason we were so tight...

153
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:55,760
...is 'cause we always had
Sunday dinners at Big Mama's.

154
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,242
That were a tradition
started down in Mississippi...

155
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:01,391
...when old folks met
at church to talk smack...

156
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:03,810
...and chow down
on some good old soul food.

157
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,395
Big Mama kept the tradition...

158
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:09,150
...when she and Granddaddy
moved to Chicago.

159
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,818
Holidays, of course,
were bigger.

160
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,779
More folks, more eats,
more souls...

161
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,879
...more soul food.

162
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,244
People would be rolling in from all over.

163
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:26,529
Like Uncle Remus, always hittin'
folks up 'cause he was broke.

164
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:29,794
Before Granddaddy died,
he owned a barber shop...

165
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:32,297
...corner store, and a Laundromat.

166
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,799
Not bad for a black man in those days.

167
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,591
Rumor has it Mama Joe's got
a big stash of loot hidden away.

168
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,731
Mama says that's a myth.

169
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:46,259
We used to always have eating contests...

170
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,012
...which the Reverend would always win.

171
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,849
He'd split after he busted slops
with my mom and aunties.

172
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:55,351
I can still see my dad...

173
00:09:55,451 --> 00:10:00,126
Iookin' like he wanted to break
Reverend Williams' neck.

174
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:05,445
Last but not least,
there's Big Mama's brother...

175
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:06,946
...old Uncle Pete...

176
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:10,701
...who ain't left his room in 10 years now.

177
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,230
Go.
- Go.

178
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:16,664
Just sits up there,
watching TV.

179
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:20,251
It's kind of a 'lights on,
nobody's home' thing.

180
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,587
Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

181
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:27,133
Those were the good days,
back before things took a turn.

182
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,614
Mama, Mama.

183
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:31,179
Uncle Pete's messing with us.

184
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:36,611
I'm tryin' to do my thing. Can I do my thing?

185
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:37,821
Hit me.

186
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,921
Take that.

187
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:47,988
Ooh. No, baby. That's too much.

188
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:51,825
Just put about four pinches in.

189
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:56,454
How you know how much to put in
without using a measuring cup?

190
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,311
And why we got to eat ham hocks anyway?

191
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,126
Well.

192
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:04,379
I guess you.

193
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:07,716
Ham hocks,
pig feet, chitlins...

194
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:12,345
We learn how to make things
taste good by trying things out.

195
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:15,932
Soul food cookin' is about
cooking from the heart.

196
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:18,032
That's right.

197
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:35,827
What's up, mama?

198
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,079
Newlyweds.

199
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:42,250
If she spent more time
with her shop instead of Lem...

200
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,200
...maybe she'd pay me back that loan.

201
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,203
You aren't hurtin' 'cause you
gave Bird money for that shop.

202
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:48,913
I loaned her money, Max.

203
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,916
As far as you're concerned,
I'm an ATM...

204
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,835
Automatically Teri's Money.

205
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:57,005
You two hush up.
You do this every Sunday.

206
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:58,256
Mama, she started it.

207
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,675
Maxine,
you finish those biscuits.

208
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,469
Teri, stop runnin' down your family.

209
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:04,054
Focus on your own man.

210
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:07,299
You're already on husband number two.

211
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:11,171
Shit, baby.

212
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:17,567
OK. Baby, wait.

213
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:21,100
So good. Shit.

214
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,994
That fried chicken smell good.

215
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:30,729
Can't wait to get some of that.

216
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:34,084
Don't ever put anything
like this on the stove.

217
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,418
You could burn the house down.

218
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:36,544
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,047
Remember when Bird almost did that?

220
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:41,904
Big Mama, your arm.
- Mama.

221
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,885
Give me some butter, baby.

222
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:45,210
You need ice.

223
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,285
You ain't been takin' your insulin?

224
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:52,050
I bet you ain't been to a doctor, either.

225
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,177
I don't need no doctor.

226
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:56,471
There's nothing salve,
turpentine...

227
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:58,723
...and my herbs won't cure.

228
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,518
Except your diabetes.

229
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:04,270
I didn't know
what diabetes was back then...

230
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,430
...but I was sure about to find out.

231
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:12,904
As we bow our heads on this special day...

232
00:13:13,004 --> 00:13:16,157
...we ask a special prayer for this table...

233
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,535
...a special prayer for Mother Joe...

234
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:21,871
...who has provided for the rovin'
eye of the Reverend...

235
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,039
...beautiful breasts...

236
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,251
...and delicious legs under--
I mean, on the table.

237
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,504
Lord, all I'm askin' is,
bless this bread...

238
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,298
...bless this meal...

239
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:34,280
...and bless my stomach,
'cause I's gonna eat.

240
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,380
Amen.

241
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:45,927
Take your time, son.

242
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,429
There you go.

243
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:50,140
Don't take too much.
Just what you need.

244
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,975
Remember, son--...

245
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:55,475
...this is for the needy,
not the greedy.

246
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:57,924
Chicken?
- Thank you.

247
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:07,303
I can't wait till Sunday finally comes.

248
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:08,992
Thank you.

249
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:12,483
I dreamt of fishes last night.

250
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,624
Somebody's been deep-sea fishin'.

251
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:16,958
Don't look over here.

252
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,376
Don't point over here.

253
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:20,337
Why? You never know.

254
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:22,005
What's she talking about,
fishes?

255
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:27,385
It means either somebody's
coming or somebody's pregnant.

256
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:29,485
Or gonna get pregnant.

257
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,264
What you looking at me for?

258
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:34,976
She doesn't mean me 'cause
this is the last fish dream.

259
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:37,604
Don't sweep the dust straight out the door.

260
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,731
If you do, you sweep out the good fortune.

261
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:41,831
Whatever that means.

262
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,173
Didn't Daddy say that?

263
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:47,228
Daddy was the most
superstitious man I ever met.

264
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,481
I got one.

265
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:53,831
If you step on a crack,
you break your mama's back.

266
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:01,242
Did you try my fish cakes?

267
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:04,371
I made them this year,
and I'm very proud.

268
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,997
My plate's full.

269
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,333
My plate's full, too.

270
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,834
Y'all ain't right.

271
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,170
Y'all ain't right,
but that's all right.

272
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,215
My boo likes 'em.
That's all that matters.

273
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,842
You ain't got to worry about cooking...

274
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,511
'cause you can do hair.

275
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,680
Miss Teri can't cook nothing.

276
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,517
Right, Ma? That's why you
always had me cookin', huh?

277
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:29,854
I wasn't in the kitchen 'cause
Mama and Daddy had me study.

278
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,440
That's why I'm a successful lawyer.

279
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,860
Moms and Aunt Teri don't get along.

280
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,905
Never have, maybe never will.

281
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,950
Big Mama said she should have
named them Vinegar and Oil...

282
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,785
'cause they don't mix.

283
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:48,305
It started in the early
eighties, before I was born.

284
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:51,658
The rule was if one of
the Joseph girls had a date...

285
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:55,870
...a sister had to come along,
like a chaperone.

286
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,789
When Teri and my pops were going out...

287
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,127
Big Mama had Moms tag along,
in case Pops tried anything.

288
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,713
Hey, all right.

289
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:08,203
Check it out, y'all.

290
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,911
That's how you got to work it,
how you got to skate.

291
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,306
That's how you gotta do it.

292
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:25,054
You all right?

293
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:34,576
I can't say for sure Mom started it...

294
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:37,203
...but Dad couldn't resist...

295
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:40,290
...whatever it was she was throwing down.

296
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,110
Look at 'em.
See what I'm saying?

297
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,210
Look out, y'all.

298
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,075
I told you.

299
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,768
Kenny...

300
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,938
Mom stole Dad
from under Aunt Teri's nose...

301
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,941
...and the two haven't gotten along since.

302
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,776
Get out.

303
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,444
Get outta the car now.

304
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:21,924
Get outta the car right now.

305
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:25,102
Shit.

306
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,959
Get off her, Teri. Come on, now.

307
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,127
Hey, Teri. Come on, now.

308
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,463
Just cut out all that hoo-shaw jawing.

309
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:40,090
Y'all do this every Sunday.

310
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,884
I've been cooking longer
than you've been alive.

311
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,052
Cornbread.

312
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,471
Cornbread is my specialty.

313
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:51,046
Um, Lem...why'd you
get thrown in the joint?

314
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,385
Kenny, don't--.

315
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,485
What?

316
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,496
I ain't gonna lie to y'all.

317
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,477
I made a stupid mistake.

318
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:05,438
Came here from New York
to help my cousin out and...

319
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:08,316
I guess I got caught.

320
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,944
Doing?
- Kenny, dang.

321
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:12,362
It's all right.

322
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:14,406
I got caught sellin' somethin'.

323
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,199
He paid his debt to society.

324
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,785
It's no different
from Daddy and his gambling.

325
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:22,581
In life,
we all make bad choices.

326
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:26,506
My husband was gamblin',
and he was bad at it.

327
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,795
Fact, we almost lost this house.

328
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:32,799
But I worked...
on my hands and knees...

329
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:36,845
...cleanin' up after white folks,
takin' in laundry.

330
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:40,015
You do what you have to do
to stay strong...

331
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:43,018
...to save the family...

332
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:44,894
...even if you stumble tryin'.

333
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:46,688
I'm gonna tell you something.

334
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:50,692
One finger pointing the blame
don't make no impact.

335
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,810
But you ball up all them fingers into a fist...

336
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,397
...and you can strike a mighty blow.

337
00:18:57,497 --> 00:19:01,972
This family got to be that fist.

338
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:08,888
My Lord...

339
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,988
Faith.

340
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:15,943
Come here, baby.

341
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,172
Cousin Faith-- Lord have mercy.

342
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:25,383
The niece Big Mama took in
after her sister died.

343
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:30,055
In case you missed the news,
Faith is trouble, big-time trouble.

344
00:19:30,155 --> 00:19:31,473
What's she doing here?

345
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,726
Last we heard, she was
strippin' in a Californian club.

346
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:37,229
Then some guy supposedly
discovered her...

347
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:39,397
...and got her dancing in rap videos.

348
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:42,275
I ain't never seen her in none of them.

349
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,902
Teri, you can take her.

350
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:46,321
She ain't staying with me,
Kenny, and the kids.

351
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:47,864
Ahmad, kiss your cousin.

352
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,449
Here she comes.

353
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,431
My God, you've grown so much.

354
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:55,224
Hi.

355
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:01,188
Rev, this is my sister's baby.

356
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,607
Mama Joe, Mama Joe.

357
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,819
This is a pleasure.

358
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:15,090
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Welcome home.

359
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,424
It's time.

360
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:18,343
The baby.

361
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:20,738
What's the doctor's number?

362
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:26,280
What's the name of the doctor?

363
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
I don't know.

364
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,646
I'll get this right now.

365
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,566
OK. All right. I got it.

366
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,963
Just get the door.

367
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,063
Yeah. OK.

368
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:38,713
Let's go. All right. Let's go.

369
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:24,857
The birth of my baby sister, Faith arriving--.

370
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:29,048
Who could have guessed things
wouldn't keep getting better?

371
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:31,613
This is where the problem is.

372
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:37,724
Mama, it's gonna be all right.

373
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,934
Put your sweater on.

374
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:43,049
I'm not getting my leg cut off.

375
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,263
Mama, you have to.

376
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:53,124
There's no blood circulating to that leg.

377
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,224
You're diabetic.

378
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:58,960
You haven't been watching what you eat.

379
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:06,444
Nobody's cutting off my leg...

380
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:08,544
...and that's that.

381
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:17,170
Last thing you need is a G-string.

382
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,839
I should give him some, right?

383
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,340
Give it to him.
Sock it to him.

384
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,009
Give it to him good.

385
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,594
What y'all talking about?

386
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,694
The nasty, darling.

387
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,516
Come on, we got clients.

388
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,019
Y'all better slow down.

389
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,271
I finished dumping the garbage.

390
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:37,690
Thank you.
Help me sweep up this hair...

391
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,465
...then call your mama to see
when she's picking you up.

392
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,146
What's up, shorty?

393
00:22:53,193 --> 00:22:54,957
Nice.

394
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,057
Very nice.

395
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:04,040
I see Teri finally gave you
the money to open your shop.

396
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,502
Teri didn't give me anything.
It was an investment.

397
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:11,506
If you had come to me,
I would have given it to you.

398
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:12,965
At what cost?

399
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:15,176
How much you willing to sacrifice?

400
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,276
Nothin'.

401
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:23,351
Girl, you are gettin' thick.

402
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,645
That'll do it.

403
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:29,485
They'll help you up front.
See you next week.

404
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,821
Let me tell you something, OK?

405
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:36,614
I am married now.

406
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:40,772
Whatever we had going on before
is over with.

407
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:44,901
And besides,
my husband's name...

408
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:49,698
...is written all over my kitty cat.

409
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:55,243
Ahem.

410
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:58,665
A wedding gift.

411
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,631
I know you like the finer things in life...

412
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:07,051
...and I know your man can't afford
to buy you shit like that...

413
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:09,786
...him just gettin' outta jail.

414
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:15,380
When you need me...call me.

415
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,510
Later, shorty.

416
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,097
My God.

417
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:34,480
Bring my shorty up right.

418
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:40,710
Hey, baby.

419
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,628
You're gonna love this.

420
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,798
What you done brought?
- An Apple Performa.

421
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,008
A computer?

422
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:48,384
It's for the baby.

423
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:50,219
For the baby?

424
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,742
It's got everything.

425
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:56,392
It's got a color monitor...
CD-ROM...lnternet...

426
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,895
...fax...E-mail...

427
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,104
It's got everything.

428
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:03,056
You don't think she's too young
for a computer?

429
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:05,156
Nah.

430
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
What?

431
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,981
You just look beautiful.

432
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,107
You're silly.

433
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:16,223
Hold it one second.
One second.

434
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,769
See what your daddy got you?

435
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,787
See what your daddy got?

436
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,887
Yeah, girl.

437
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,367
What you doin', Kenny?

438
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,471
You are so silly.

439
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:44,847
What you doing?

440
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:47,600
Hey...come here, now.

441
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,812
Mmm, with your fine self.

442
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:53,093
My other baby, huh?

443
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,318
Smellin' all good...

444
00:25:57,418 --> 00:26:00,113
...uh.
You gonna get in trouble.

445
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:01,447
What you talkin' 'bout?

446
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,439
The doctor said we gotta wait six weeks.

447
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,525
It's been six weeks.
- No, it ain't.

448
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,099
You know that you're wrong.

449
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,700
Did you hear that?

450
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,119
It's the door.
- It wasn't no door.

451
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:17,870
Yes.

452
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,435
Someone's at the door.
Go see.

453
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,195
See who's there.

454
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:31,634
Hey. What's up, man?

455
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,553
What's up, man?

456
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:38,016
I was just...l mean,
I don't even know why I'm here.

457
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:40,268
If you're busy,
I'll come back later.

458
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:42,408
No, no. Come on in, man.

459
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,814
Who's there, Kenny?

460
00:26:44,914 --> 00:26:46,914
It's Lem.

461
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:51,556
After you, brother.

462
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:54,394
How you doin', Lem?
- Hey.

463
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:02,207
I need to talk to you for a minute.

464
00:27:04,363 --> 00:27:06,363
It's kind of personal.

465
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:20,311
That's how we got this one.
You better quit.

466
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:23,330
So, uh, what's up, Lem?

467
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:35,355
I was, um...

468
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:38,005
I was fired from my job today.

469
00:27:38,512 --> 00:27:40,637
I lied on my application.

470
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:44,822
They ask if you ever been convicted, and...

471
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:46,922
I checked no.

472
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,036
You and Miles, man...

473
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,372
...y'all got yourselves together on the job.

474
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:55,583
I was just hopin' if--if you knew anybody...

475
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,211
...or...of any job openings.

476
00:27:58,311 --> 00:28:00,505
Man, I'll do anything.

477
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:03,383
Yo, man, we'll find you something, all right?

478
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,872
Cool, man. Thanks, man.

479
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:12,548
Now I just gotta find a way
to explain this to Bird.

480
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:15,385
She's high-maintenance.

481
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,054
She walks around the house
in Chanel sandals...

482
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,576
...and shit like that.

483
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:22,350
I don't want her to think I'm livin' off her.

484
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,510
No, you don't want to tell her, man.

485
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,314
Why not?
- 'Cause you ain't got a job.

486
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:31,150
You don't wanna tell a woman--
- A black woman.

487
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,654
...especially a black woman,
that you ain't got a j-o-b.

488
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,095
It's all right for them
to lie around, but let a man--...

489
00:28:38,195 --> 00:28:39,596
A brother.
- Especially a brother.

490
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:43,413
You could be fixin' the kitchen seats...

491
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,956
Or waterin' plants.

492
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,374
Washin' the dishes.

493
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,667
Takin' the garbage out.

494
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,742
Let me give you a little somethin'.

495
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:54,173
No matter what you do around the house...

496
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,050
...they still will consider you..

497
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,150
A trifling nigger.

498
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,375
Don't tell her.

499
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:03,599
That was good.

500
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:07,557
Ha ha. Got you with your own trick, right?

501
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:08,886
Hey.
- Hey.

502
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:10,054
Hey, Aunt Teri.

503
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:12,056
Hey, sweetie.
You staying with us?

504
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:13,391
Yeah.

505
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:16,894
Yeah. Kenny and Max need a little time.

506
00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:19,134
Kelly's with Bird.

507
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,067
I got your favorite tonight.

508
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:26,141
I spent many hours slaving.

509
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,785
I'm looking forward to it.

510
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:34,885
Aunt Teri?

511
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:38,249
Is Big Mama gonna get her leg cut off?

512
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,644
You're worried, aren't you?

513
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,990
Yeah.

514
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,868
I don't know.

515
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:52,639
Looks like that case is kicking your butt.

516
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:56,100
Yeah. I don't know how long
the jury's gonna be out.

517
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,195
And the firm is really
pushing me to be partner.

518
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:05,151
That's what you want, right...
to make partner?

519
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:09,800
Any attorney worth their salt
wants to make partner.

520
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:15,193
I bet that's Cousin Faith.

521
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,293
I got it.

522
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:28,428
There's some money missing
from our savings.

523
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:29,874
Last week, there was--.

524
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:31,834
I took 5,000 out.

525
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:35,964
I used it as down payment for studio time.

526
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:39,550
The fellas and I are gonna record a CD.

527
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,177
A CD?

528
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:42,470
Yeah.

529
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,075
I thought you playing
with this band was just a hobby.

530
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:50,186
Why would you say something like that?

531
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,521
Because you're an attorney.

532
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:54,524
You work for a great firm
with a great reputation.

533
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:57,026
We could make twice
the amount of money...

534
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:59,362
...if you spent more time on your job...

535
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:01,030
...and quit this music crap.

536
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,076
If I wanna take $5,000
of my money out of the bank...

537
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:06,327
I'll do it.

538
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:09,359
Only 31,132 are yours.

539
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:14,920
Tomorrow,
we're getting separate accounts.

540
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:23,042
just for the book's sake...

541
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:27,647
...next time you take money out,
inform me, all right?

542
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,619
Fine.

543
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,387
Hi.

544
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,487
Faith, how you doing?

545
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:38,725
Teri...Hey.

546
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:42,395
Just wanna say thanks again
for letting me crash here.

547
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:44,564
Your place is really fantastic.

548
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:47,054
Where do I put my stuff?

549
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:53,598
Hard as it was...

550
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:56,976
Big Mama was finally
convinced to have surgery.

551
00:31:57,076 --> 00:32:01,460
You know your daddy always said
you was the strongest.

552
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,960
The family gonna need your strength now.

553
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Where's that baby?

554
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:10,725
Ahmad.

555
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:23,813
Sweet pea,
I'm gonna be just fine.

556
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:27,142
Just need you to be strong.

557
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:30,445
That's why I'm doing this-- for you.

558
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:34,950
We gonna be strong together, OK?

559
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:38,243
OK?

560
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,061
After they wheeled
Big Mama down the hall...

561
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,772
...we kind of sat around on our hands...

562
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:55,220
...saying nothing.

563
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:06,828
I'm gonna use the rest room, OK?

564
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:08,928
Stay with Daddy.

565
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:18,032
I'm sorry. There was a problem.

566
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:07,879
Ahmad...

567
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,923
Ahmad, baby, I don't think
you should be in here.

568
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:13,551
Wait. Come on, baby.
Where's Kenny?

569
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,239
Ahmad. Come on. Ahmad.

570
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,677
The doctor said Big Mama
had a stroke during surgery...

571
00:34:24,777 --> 00:34:26,679
...and fell into a coma.

572
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:30,349
We all knew things
would never be the same...

573
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,849
...and all any of us could feel was bad.

574
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:23,211
We'll call you.

575
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:28,481
There's a sign on your door
that says you'll train.

576
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:32,318
I got experience on the presses,
and I'm a quick learner.

577
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:34,724
I can do the work.

578
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:44,612
Like I said, we'll call you.

579
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:09,174
Yo.

580
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:11,315
I'll check you later.

581
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:13,513
All right. See you, man.

582
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,844
What's up?
I'll take you home.

583
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:24,318
Why you all G'd up today, Lem?

584
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,320
If I tell you something...

585
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,198
...you gotta promise me
you won't tell your mama...

586
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:30,950
...or your nosy-ass aunties.

587
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,050
Cool.

588
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,830
I was fired from my job last week.

589
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,990
I been trying to find another one...

590
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,856
...except things ain't going so good.

591
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:43,671
Don't sweat it.
You'll find a gig soon.

592
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:47,312
You got a lot of confidence
for a little shorty.

593
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,594
I get it from Big Mama,
they say.

594
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:51,833
Big Mama, heh.

595
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:55,644
Throw these in the glove box for me.

596
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,111
You know I spent time in prison.

597
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:14,452
I wouldn't have been locked up...

598
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:18,462
...if I'd have been smart,
like you seem to be.

599
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:25,182
Big Mama's always saying
you gotta love yourself.

600
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,609
Maybe you should try that.

601
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:31,694
My man.

602
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:41,552
It's getting late.

603
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:45,027
I still have to shop for dinner tomorrow.

604
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,724
OK.

605
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:50,728
Max, surely, you don't expect
to have Sunday dinner tomorrow.

606
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:52,605
Why not?

607
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:55,255
Jesus, Max, Mama is in a coma.

608
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:56,400
Maybe--.

609
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,571
No. I'm not gonna let her ruin
a 40-year family tradition.

610
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:02,966
Tradition?
- Yes, tradition.

611
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:04,742
Don't tell me about tradition.

612
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:07,245
I am the oldest,
most responsible one here.

613
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:09,288
I graduated from law school.

614
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:12,083
You dropped out when you were 19.

615
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:14,293
This is about your jealousy,
Max.

616
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,393
Will you guys stop?

617
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:19,924
Let's just take a vote.

618
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:22,250
Good idea. Let's take a vote.

619
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,753
All right, cool. Let's vote.

620
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:27,296
Hands in the air...

621
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:32,156
...for those who don't wanna have
Sunday dinner tomorrow.

622
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:39,392
Hands in the air for all those...

623
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:42,186
...who want chitlins,
black-eyed peas...

624
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,982
...greens, some fried chicken...

625
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:49,057
...macaroni and cheese,
and egg pie.

626
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:55,879
I won't let you disrespect
my mama like she's already dead.

627
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:57,577
Your mama?
- Mm-hmm.

628
00:38:57,677 --> 00:39:00,246
You get on my fuckin' nerves with--.

629
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:01,581
Lower your voice.

630
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:05,084
So you graduated.
That don't make you better.

631
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:06,294
Keep it down.

632
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:07,462
Stop it.

633
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,548
I'm sorry.
All of you have to leave.

634
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,884
Mrs. Joseph needs quiet.

635
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,428
I'm outta here.
Come on, Kenny.

636
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:17,764
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:20,099
Whatever.
I'm outta here.

638
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,425
Let's go. We outta here.

639
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,260
Max, that wasn't necessary.

640
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,263
I'm tired of her.
She always says something.

641
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:28,765
Where's my coat?

642
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:31,934
Maybe we should think about this.

643
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:34,771
Grandma's illness was
taking its toll on the family.

644
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:39,801
Nobody knew where to throw
the blame, except at each other.

645
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:45,281
Aunt Teri and Moms especially.

646
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:49,716
Because of them, hardly no one
was speaking anymore.

647
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:03,591
Poor Aunt Bird.

648
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:07,804
She tried her best to pull off
Sunday's dinner by herself.

649
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:11,474
Because of Teri and Mom's fight,
no one showed up.

650
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:16,929
For the first time in 40 years,
our Sunday tradition was broken.

651
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:19,384
Let's just eat.

652
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:24,222
Here you go.

653
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,234
Uncle Pete?

654
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,571
Dinner.

655
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:43,842
I know you think I been avoiding you.

656
00:41:43,942 --> 00:41:45,802
But every time I come to visit...

657
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:50,492
...people are doing stuff to you
or arguing around you.

658
00:41:51,587 --> 00:41:53,101
Anyway...

659
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:57,026
I know you're wondering
how everyone is doing.

660
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:01,428
Not good.

661
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:05,238
We didn't have a Sunday dinner yesterday.

662
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:08,058
Aunt Bird said nobody showed up.

663
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:12,871
After church, Mom didn't
feel like cooking at home...

664
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:15,498
...so Daddy brought
home some Mickey D's.

665
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,658
We were all on the toilet all night.

666
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:25,077
We need you, Big Mama.

667
00:42:51,428 --> 00:42:53,360
I was thinking that, too.

668
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,362
Maybe when you get out of here...

669
00:42:55,462 --> 00:42:57,864
I could help you turn the ground over.

670
00:42:57,964 --> 00:43:01,117
As you called it,
put some fertilizer down.

671
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:03,217
Yeah, I'll help you.

672
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:14,866
Come dance with me.

673
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:17,467
What?
- Come dance with me.

674
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,567
Miles...
- Come on.

675
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:20,804
Dance?
- Dance.

676
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,904
I don't wanna dance.

677
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:24,140
Miles...

678
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,310
Mama is not doing well at all.

679
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,304
I know. Dance with me.
Get your mind off it.

680
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:33,404
Um, I also...

681
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:36,819
...can't go to see you perform tonight.

682
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:42,065
That's what you said last week
and the week before.

683
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:43,650
I'd really like you to come--.

684
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,750
I'm swamped with work.

685
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,224
OK.

686
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,018
Well, just so you know...

687
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:57,641
I'm thinking about pursuing
my music full time.

688
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,334
Miles...

689
00:44:01,434 --> 00:44:03,434
...it's a mistake.

690
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:07,328
It's what I wanna do.

691
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,001
You find a job yet?

692
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:18,503
Nope.

693
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
But I have an audition.

694
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:25,942
I'm not into the straight job thing.

695
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,111
'Straight job thing'?

696
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:31,021
I didn't plan on staying here.

697
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:33,773
I thought I was gonna be at Mama Joe's.

698
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:36,297
If you want me to leave,
I'll leave.

699
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:38,522
Why'd you come back here?

700
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:42,779
What are you gonna do this time?

701
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:46,745
Run up Mama's credit?

702
00:44:46,845 --> 00:44:51,145
Or, um, make her co-sign on a car...

703
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:53,877
...and then you leave her with the note.

704
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:57,464
Or better yet, why don't you
get arrested again...

705
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:01,814
...and let Mama put up the house
to post your bail?

706
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:04,638
I've changed.

707
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:06,738
You've changed?

708
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:11,312
Don't you start any shit this time.

709
00:45:12,216 --> 00:45:14,216
You hear me?

710
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:27,285
Girl, I care about you.

711
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:30,184
I'm there for you.

712
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:34,532
So why don't you care for me.

713
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,869
Like I care about you?

714
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:42,666
Girl, I care about you.

715
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:45,961
I'm there for you.

716
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:50,048
So why don't you care for me.

717
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:53,969
Like I care about you?

718
00:45:54,069 --> 00:46:00,371
I spend, like,
all of my days, baby.

719
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:07,065
Tryin' to sus out just
how things got this way.

720
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:12,696
I thought that we were in love.

721
00:46:12,796 --> 00:46:19,077
But I swear right now,
I don't know what you want.

722
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:25,417
I make sure that I give you quality time.

723
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:31,673
But lately I feel you're not home by design.

724
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:34,249
But still I'm gonna try.

725
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:38,169
To give you the love of my life.

726
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:40,755
In hopes that you.

727
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:44,759
That you will open up your eyes, baby.

728
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:49,264
Girl, I care about you.

729
00:46:49,364 --> 00:46:52,100
I'm there for you.

730
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,771
So why don't you care for me.

731
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:59,024
Like I care about you?

732
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:00,442
Sometimes.

733
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:02,360
Sometimes I'm not.

734
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,612
I'm not sure that.

735
00:47:03,712 --> 00:47:04,613
I'm all you got.

736
00:47:04,713 --> 00:47:06,406
That I'm all you got.

737
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:08,241
Sometimes.

738
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:13,580
Sometimes I'm not sure
you love me or not, baby.

739
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,416
There's one thing that I'm certain of.

740
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:19,085
Girl, I care for you.

741
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:22,923
And the one thing that I want is that you.

742
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:25,926
Care for me, too.

743
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:30,096
Girl, I care about you.

744
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:31,932
I'm there for you.

745
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:37,469
So why don't you care for me.

746
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:41,627
Like I care about you?

747
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:59,561
I care for you, baby.

748
00:48:15,953 --> 00:48:18,051
That was the bomb.

749
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:21,554
I'm serious, cousin.
You was jammin'.

750
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:24,778
Man, I didn't know you could play like that.

751
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:26,351
You're good.

752
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:28,561
Thanks,
but it's not just about me.

753
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,230
We're a group.

754
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,232
Besides,
the way those guys sing...

755
00:48:32,332 --> 00:48:34,276
...they make my stuff come alive.

756
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:35,809
But you're the mastermind.

757
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,978
You put this together.
This is your shit.

758
00:48:38,078 --> 00:48:41,733
The group's called 'Milestone,' not 'Them.'

759
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,984
We were thinking about that name.

760
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:48,809
You really wanna pursue
your music full time, huh?

761
00:48:51,103 --> 00:48:53,568
I heard you and Teri talking.

762
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:57,247
Your man's looking over here.

763
00:48:57,347 --> 00:48:59,553
He's looking a little jealous.

764
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,863
Ha ha. Family comes first.

765
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:04,170
Besides, I gotta get my career together...

766
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,631
...before I can think about a man.

767
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:08,300
I got goals, OK?

768
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,509
OK.
- OK.

769
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:11,609
OK.
- OK.

770
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,208
OK. Promise not to laugh.

771
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:17,017
Jesus. See? Right there.

772
00:49:17,117 --> 00:49:18,351
I promise. I promise.

773
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:19,728
OK. Fine.

774
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:21,828
I wanna dance.

775
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,566
No. I mean really dance.

776
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:29,696
You know, do Broadway musicals,
choreograph the Oscars.

777
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:32,219
I've spent the last few years...

778
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,284
...trying to figure out
what makes me happy.

779
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:38,361
I learned that the only thing
that keeps me sane is dancing.

780
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:42,198
I'm gonna put all my energy
into it, so help me, Jesus.

781
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:43,721
Praise the Lord.

782
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:45,821
And plus...

783
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:48,330
...it just...

784
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,374
...it just feels so damn good.

785
00:49:51,474 --> 00:49:53,919
You know what I mean?

786
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:57,685
It's like that with you and your music, right?

787
00:49:57,785 --> 00:50:00,079
You want another drink?

788
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:04,804
Sly, send another one over here, all right?

789
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:06,904
All right.

790
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:09,461
Ooh...listen.

791
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:15,419
That's my jam.

792
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,692
Come and dance with me.

793
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:18,860
I'm on my break.

794
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Come on.

795
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:25,978
What the hell.

796
00:50:27,131 --> 00:50:29,396
It ain't about being stupid, honey.

797
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:31,377
She really thought her hair was something.

798
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:34,109
It was tova-- towed back and over. Hello.

799
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:36,945
You cooked all this food
and none of your people showed?

800
00:50:37,045 --> 00:50:38,874
You know I wasn't having it.

801
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:40,522
You wanted to bash somebody.

802
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,690
We'll help you eat it.

803
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,194
Now I know why nobody showed up.
Miss Thing can't cook.

804
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,335
You can't cook, darling.
What is this?

805
00:50:49,435 --> 00:50:51,435
What was that?

806
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:58,406
Why you gotta push me, honey?

807
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:08,842
Wait. Wait.

808
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:10,009
Stop. Stop. Stop.

809
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,678
What you hit me for?

810
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:12,846
Stop.
- What?

811
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:15,461
What the hell y'all doing?

812
00:51:23,427 --> 00:51:25,427
Get in the bathroom.

813
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:31,482
My God.
Did you see that thing?

814
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:35,067
What are you doing home in the afternoon?

815
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:37,871
I got fired from my job.

816
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:41,781
Fired? You can't work a 9-to-5?
You got in trouble again?

817
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:45,285
No. I got fired 'cause
I lied on my application...

818
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:46,786
...about being convicted.

819
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:49,456
You felt like you couldn't tell me that?

820
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:50,790
I wanted to...

821
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,753
...but Kenny thought it'd be best
if you didn't know.

822
00:51:54,853 --> 00:51:57,130
You gonna listen to Kenny?

823
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,611
What about us?
- It's not about us.

824
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:01,551
It's about this bullshit system.

825
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,554
They lock you up and expect you
to better your life.

826
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,264
But when you're out,
there ain't nothing...

827
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:07,766
'cause the crackers that got everything...

828
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:09,100
...don't give a second chance.

829
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,102
That white man shit is old.

830
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:14,606
I'm sick of niggers
using that shit as an excuse.

831
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:16,900
I'm the one who's been on six interviews.

832
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,945
Six. They won't hire me.

833
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:23,114
What you know about being a black man?

834
00:52:23,214 --> 00:52:27,889
You're right. I don't know shit
about being a black man.

835
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,616
I'm sorry.

836
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:41,341
The shop is doing well right now.

837
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:43,124
I'll pay for our bills.

838
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:45,835
A lot of people come through there.

839
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:48,817
I'll see if anybody can
hook you up with a job.

840
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:52,759
Bird...l don't need your help.

841
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:55,595
I can find my own damn job.

842
00:52:55,695 --> 00:52:57,695
OK.

843
00:53:00,379 --> 00:53:02,419
Stop looking at my dick.

844
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,658
We had a deal.
We had a contract.

845
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:19,661
Pay in full. All right? Full.

846
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,871
Pay in full. Money up front.

847
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:24,499
Not right before I go in.

848
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,084
This is so wrong. Hey, Miles.

849
00:53:26,184 --> 00:53:27,252
You all right?

850
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:30,046
I'm having the most important
audition in my life...

851
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:32,340
...and this fool is trying to screw me over.

852
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,675
It's about principles.

853
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:35,775
Business is business.

854
00:53:37,082 --> 00:53:38,179
You know something?

855
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:40,999
I'm gonna fuck you up,
Dread Man.

856
00:53:45,414 --> 00:53:47,414
Miles, you can help me.

857
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:50,181
They got a piano up in the audition room.

858
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:51,349
Faith, I don't--.

859
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:53,518
Play anything.
I'll dance to it.

860
00:53:53,618 --> 00:53:55,311
Come on, cuz, please?

861
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:57,856
This is really important to me.

862
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:59,956
I'll owe you.

863
00:54:15,154 --> 00:54:17,165
Ready when you are.

864
00:55:33,552 --> 00:55:37,812
We have you down at 10:00
with Sterphan. Thanks. Bye.

865
00:55:37,912 --> 00:55:39,176
I knew you'd call.

866
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:42,210
Simuel. Let me take your briefcase, baby.

867
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,662
Come on over here.
- Here we go.

868
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:46,164
I'm glad you made it.

869
00:55:46,264 --> 00:55:48,344
There's something I wanna talk about.

870
00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:50,691
Is that right?
- Yeah. Have a seat.

871
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,996
Why don't you let me hook up your fade?

872
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:54,372
Fade?
- Yeah.

873
00:55:54,472 --> 00:55:57,553
Edge you up,
clean you up a little bit.

874
00:55:57,653 --> 00:56:00,567
You're looking good,
but I can make it better.

875
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,678
Dig that.

876
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:10,650
What's this all about...hmm?

877
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:13,328
What do you mean?

878
00:56:13,664 --> 00:56:16,369
You acting like I'm Big Willie or something.

879
00:56:16,469 --> 00:56:19,964
You treating me all good.
What's going on?

880
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:23,063
Actually, l, um...

881
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,174
I need a favor.

882
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:36,702
Can you do me a favor?

883
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:42,426
When I first saw Simuel,
I knew he was up to no good.

884
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:43,672
He wanted Bird bad...

885
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:46,811
...and there wasn't nothing he
wouldn't do or say to get her.

886
00:56:46,911 --> 00:56:49,022
Something bad was about to happen.

887
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:53,394
It was as plain to see
as those phat suits he wore.

888
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,190
What do you think?

889
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,146
You got much game, Bird.

890
00:57:05,246 --> 00:57:07,660
I learned from you.
Heh heh heh.

891
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,981
But what's in this for me?

892
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:15,936
Bird.

893
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:19,727
Bird, where you at, baby?

894
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:21,838
I got some great news.

895
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:25,156
Bird.

896
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:37,475
I found a gig.

897
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:47,030
Yeah, Kenny called me yesterday,
and told me about a job...

898
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,617
...at the biggest in-house
printing company in town.

899
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,464
I went in cold...

900
00:57:51,564 --> 00:57:56,601
...and they didn't even know
who the hell Kenny Simmons was.

901
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,422
I knew I had to kick some game.
- Right.

902
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:04,740
So I told the man
next to the goddamn man...

903
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,420
I was the best man for the job,
you know?

904
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,766
Yes.

905
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:11,517
So, finally, he looks at me...

906
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:15,503
...stands there, says...

907
00:58:15,603 --> 00:58:16,807
...you're hired.

908
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:18,642
Right there on the spot.

909
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:22,126
Like he knew that I knew
that he knew that I knew...

910
00:58:22,226 --> 00:58:27,099
...that l...was...the man. Yeah.

911
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:31,877
You are the man.
You're my man.

912
00:58:31,977 --> 00:58:34,735
With enough hours,
you know what that means?

913
00:58:34,835 --> 00:58:35,903
What?

914
00:58:36,003 --> 00:58:38,946
Gonna get us our own place,
baby.

915
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:11,002
James Dawson,
phone call, line two.

916
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:14,323
James Dawson,
pick up line two.

917
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:16,423
You have a phone call.

918
00:59:21,886 --> 00:59:26,180
Hey, Lem, I can't believe
you finished that Johnson job.

919
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,091
I didn't expect you to finish till tomorrow.

920
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,260
Good job.

921
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,360
Thanks a lot, man.

922
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:37,469
Can you run a 4 1/2 X 9 Carver?

923
00:59:40,805 --> 00:59:42,166
I can work the Carver.

924
00:59:42,266 --> 00:59:44,266
You sure?
- Sure.

925
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:47,504
Good man.

926
01:00:02,452 --> 01:00:03,688
Lem Harris?

927
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:05,801
Simuel St. James...

928
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:08,095
Chief Executive of Sales and Marketing.

929
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:09,235
What's happening?

930
01:00:09,335 --> 01:00:10,541
How you doing?

931
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,612
I've been hearing good things about you.

932
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:16,081
Especially the way you've been
handling those machines.

933
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:18,034
I'm no stranger to hard work.

934
01:00:18,134 --> 01:00:20,429
That's good to know. Cigar?

935
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:21,787
Nah. I don't like cigars.

936
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,437
Sorry. You don't mind, do you?

937
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:28,334
Like I was saying,
it's always good to, you know...

938
01:00:28,434 --> 01:00:32,892
...have enthusiastic, hard-working
employees like yourself.

939
01:00:32,992 --> 01:00:36,146
Especially down there in printing.

940
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:41,026
I'm no stranger to hard work myself.

941
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,250
I'm like you.

942
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,585
I'm from the hood, too.

943
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:49,310
But I make $80,000 a year...

944
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:52,618
...because I was always
willing to sacrifice...

945
01:00:52,718 --> 01:00:56,288
...whatever I had to to get what I wanted.

946
01:00:56,835 --> 01:00:59,864
That's why brothers got to stick together--...

947
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:02,839
...pull one another up in a time of need.

948
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,286
Ahem.

949
01:01:05,386 --> 01:01:07,857
The white man ain't gonna do it.

950
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:11,610
Sooner than you think, you'll
be helping another brother...

951
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,044
...just like I helped you.

952
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:19,147
What are you talking about?

953
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:23,593
I pulled some strings to get you hired.

954
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:25,086
What, you didn't know?

955
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:27,531
Kenny Simmons referred me.

956
01:01:27,631 --> 01:01:29,631
Who?

957
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:33,886
No. I know your wife...

958
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:35,658
Bird.

959
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,522
She told me about
your little felony situation...

960
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:43,332
...and asked me to hook you up
in the printin' department.

961
01:01:43,432 --> 01:01:48,295
Man, me and old Cola,
we, uh, we go way back.

962
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:50,504
Who the fuck is Cola?

963
01:01:50,604 --> 01:01:52,235
No. Ha ha.

964
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:58,021
That's just something I used
to call her back in the day.

965
01:01:58,121 --> 01:02:02,864
Since she got that body shaped
like a Coca-Cola bottle, huh?

966
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:07,690
She used to just make
a brother want to scream.

967
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,832
Motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.

968
01:02:12,932 --> 01:02:15,030
I'll beat your ass.

969
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:18,671
Don't fuck with me.

970
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:22,426
You can forget about your job,
motherfucker.

971
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:35,838
I want to talk to you.

972
01:02:35,938 --> 01:02:37,631
What is wrong with you?

973
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:41,386
Why are you fuckin' coming
in here tripping?

974
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:43,872
Think I'm not man enough
to find my own job?

975
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:44,845
I'm sorry.

976
01:02:44,945 --> 01:02:46,434
You fucking that nigger?
- No.

977
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:48,557
What do you have to do for him?

978
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:52,114
Ain't no man gonna give you
a motherfucking thing free.

979
01:02:52,214 --> 01:02:54,103
I didn't do nothing with him.

980
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,554
I just said I'd have dinner
with him. That's it. I'm sorry.

981
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:00,084
What the fuck is this, huh?
- It's nothing.

982
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:02,870
It ain't shit but a fuckin' bracelet.

983
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,340
This don't mean nothing.

984
01:03:06,146 --> 01:03:07,299
Baby, I'm sorry.

985
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:08,974
Don't fucking touch me.

986
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:11,081
Don't fucking touch me.

987
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:18,101
Lem, I love you.
I just did this for us.

988
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,910
You stay the fuck away from me.

989
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,370
Motherfucker.

990
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,803
Lem. Lem.

991
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:42,161
Bird. Honey, it's OK.

992
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:44,205
Sweetie, you can talk to us.

993
01:03:44,305 --> 01:03:47,054
Bird, your sister is
getting ready to call somebody.

994
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:49,449
I don't want no drama here.

995
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:51,975
Open up, Bird.

996
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:55,297
So Aunt Teri was calling in Cousin Blimp...

997
01:03:55,397 --> 01:03:56,681
...to whup Uncle Lem's ass...

998
01:03:56,781 --> 01:03:59,117
'cause she thought Lem had beat up Bird.

999
01:03:59,217 --> 01:04:00,869
Big misunderstanding.

1000
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:05,310
You knew things were gonna get
worse before they got better.

1001
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:08,006
That's how it was when my aunts
fixed each other's messes.

1002
01:04:08,106 --> 01:04:10,231
Hey, no guns.
You hear me?

1003
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,860
Give me a shot.

1004
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,413
Hello. Maxine, is Kenny there?

1005
01:04:29,513 --> 01:04:31,978
This is Rick down at the bar.

1006
01:04:33,432 --> 01:04:35,571
Your brother-in-law is down here...

1007
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,323
...and he's getting wasted.

1008
01:04:37,423 --> 01:04:39,443
Didn't know whether to call Bird or not.

1009
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,688
You need to send somebody to get him.

1010
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:46,441
There you go.

1011
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:49,683
There he is...
Cousin Blimp.

1012
01:04:49,783 --> 01:04:52,002
He's one of those cousins
you don't see much...

1013
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:54,615
'cause he's always spends
so much time in jail.

1014
01:04:54,715 --> 01:04:56,895
Of all the people Aunt Teri
could have called...

1015
01:04:56,995 --> 01:04:58,201
...to teach Lem a lesson...

1016
01:04:58,301 --> 01:05:00,638
I can't believe she called Blimp.

1017
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:03,738
Give me some brews.
A couple for my boys, too.

1018
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:05,197
Who's paying?

1019
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:07,297
He's paying for it.

1020
01:05:08,702 --> 01:05:10,912
Yeah, right, motherfucker.

1021
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:14,334
Don't shit me, motherfucker.

1022
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:17,110
What is wrong with you, punk?

1023
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,210
Hit that punk.

1024
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:24,978
I'll blow your motherfucking brains out.

1025
01:05:25,078 --> 01:05:28,053
Should've brought my gat.
- Shut up.

1026
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:37,851
Stop the car, Kenny.
Kenny, pull over.

1027
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,076
Lem. Lem.

1028
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:45,176
Ahmad, stay in the car.

1029
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:47,198
That's my husband.

1030
01:05:47,298 --> 01:05:49,151
Wait. That's my husband.

1031
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:50,708
No, no. Bird.

1032
01:05:50,808 --> 01:05:53,868
Wait, officer.
Please, somebody help.

1033
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:03,333
Kicking Simuel's ass was one thing...

1034
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:05,043
...but being an ex-felon with a gun...

1035
01:06:05,143 --> 01:06:09,206
Ianded Uncle Lem back where jail.

1036
01:06:09,306 --> 01:06:11,601
We're talking serious time.

1037
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:16,259
Sure enough, the family
was starting to fall apart.

1038
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:22,169
No.

1039
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,269
What happened?

1040
01:06:32,276 --> 01:06:34,276
Hey.

1041
01:06:37,044 --> 01:06:38,891
Teri in?

1042
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:40,991
She's at the hospital.

1043
01:06:46,385 --> 01:06:47,621
Any change?

1044
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:49,763
No.

1045
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:06,473
It's beautiful.

1046
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:09,546
For your CD?

1047
01:07:09,646 --> 01:07:11,646
I don't know.

1048
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:15,061
It's something I'm messing around with.

1049
01:07:15,886 --> 01:07:18,691
Hey... any news on your audition?

1050
01:07:21,724 --> 01:07:23,724
Get out of here.

1051
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:27,915
Yeah,
I'm pretty happy about it.

1052
01:07:28,015 --> 01:07:30,015
I'm sure you are.

1053
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:32,943
I was so scared.

1054
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:35,043
You?

1055
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:41,046
I gave two weeks at my firm today.

1056
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:46,555
I quit.

1057
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:55,779
Man, when your CD drops,
you are going to blow up.

1058
01:07:55,879 --> 01:07:58,259
I don't know about all that.

1059
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:00,359
Let's celebrate.

1060
01:08:08,976 --> 01:08:10,532
Miles...

1061
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:13,298
I'm moving out this weekend.

1062
01:08:13,398 --> 01:08:17,093
Teri and I living under
the same roof together...

1063
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,193
...is not working.

1064
01:08:19,818 --> 01:08:22,354
Teri's tough.

1065
01:08:22,454 --> 01:08:24,599
You letting her run you out,
huh?

1066
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:26,225
You're damn right.

1067
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:28,512
Besides that,
I need my own space.

1068
01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:31,605
Always on the go. I can't stay
in one place too long.

1069
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:33,523
I got this new gig, so--.

1070
01:08:33,623 --> 01:08:35,623
So you gotta go.

1071
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:39,723
I don't know.
It's always been like that.

1072
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:41,683
But, you know, we're all cool.

1073
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:43,803
There's no hostilities or anything like that.

1074
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,596
It's just...

1075
01:08:45,696 --> 01:08:47,549
...when it's time to go...

1076
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:49,649
...it's time to go.

1077
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:51,901
Ha. That's bullshit.

1078
01:08:52,554 --> 01:08:54,834
Excuse me?

1079
01:08:55,988 --> 01:08:57,253
Sounds like bullshit.

1080
01:08:57,353 --> 01:08:59,353
I mean, that's, uh...

1081
01:08:59,453 --> 01:09:01,453
...a lonely life.

1082
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:04,299
You should...

1083
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:07,153
...stop pretending you
don't need anybody...

1084
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:10,398
'cause you're just lying to yourself.

1085
01:09:11,908 --> 01:09:13,908
That's how I see it.

1086
01:09:18,928 --> 01:09:21,223
I'm going up to the studio.

1087
01:11:07,947 --> 01:11:10,343
You never know.

1088
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:12,986
You have to just be yourself.

1089
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,485
Miles?

1090
01:11:14,585 --> 01:11:16,625
Uncle Miles, we're home.

1091
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:22,476
He must be upstairs
in the studio on the roof.

1092
01:11:22,576 --> 01:11:24,919
The studio. Let's go.

1093
01:11:37,032 --> 01:11:39,459
I love it out here, Aunt Teri.

1094
01:11:39,559 --> 01:11:41,939
I know you love it out here.

1095
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,360
Um, we gotta go.

1096
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,859
But, Aunt Teri, I thought--...

1097
01:11:54,959 --> 01:11:56,899
Back to your house.
- Aunt Teri--.

1098
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:59,294
No. Let's just go back, OK?

1099
01:13:03,855 --> 01:13:06,954
I don't know why we left
Aunt Teri's house so fast...

1100
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:09,436
...or why Teri was so upset all of a sudden.

1101
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:12,429
All I know is she didn't speak
the whole trip.

1102
01:13:12,529 --> 01:13:14,493
We headed back to my house.

1103
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:15,995
Everybody was getting together...

1104
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:18,789
...for my Mom and Dad's
11th-year anniversary party.

1105
01:13:18,889 --> 01:13:22,864
Happy anniversary.

1106
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:32,538
One more kiss.

1107
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:40,482
All right. Look out now.
Watch me now.

1108
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,071
Where's my baby?

1109
01:14:43,476 --> 01:14:46,784
There sure seemed to be
a lot of tension in the air...

1110
01:14:46,884 --> 01:14:49,036
...especially between Teri and Miles.

1111
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:52,540
At one point,
I think I saw Aunt Teri crying.

1112
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,275
Not even my mama could say why.

1113
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:59,380
Good God almighty.

1114
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,882
At least my folks were getting along...

1115
01:15:01,982 --> 01:15:04,022
...which is always cool.

1116
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:17,388
Ahem.

1117
01:15:17,488 --> 01:15:19,014
Honey, uh...

1118
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:24,214
...why don't you get everybody
in the kitchen so we can talk?

1119
01:15:27,135 --> 01:15:29,304
Want to dance?

1120
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,950
Teri, you OK?

1121
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:00,958
Are you all right?

1122
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:18,397
After all these years,
you and Max are still together.

1123
01:16:18,497 --> 01:16:20,497
I still envy that.

1124
01:16:22,472 --> 01:16:27,907
I always thought if you and I
had gotten married...

1125
01:16:28,007 --> 01:16:30,201
...my life would be different.

1126
01:16:30,301 --> 01:16:31,702
But it wouldn't.

1127
01:16:31,802 --> 01:16:34,352
I'd find a way to screw it up.

1128
01:16:34,984 --> 01:16:36,984
Teri, you can't...

1129
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,445
What y'all doing in here?

1130
01:16:39,823 --> 01:16:42,826
Just talking about this cake.
Mmm.

1131
01:16:47,413 --> 01:16:48,511
It was good.

1132
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:50,611
Yeah, real good.

1133
01:16:52,585 --> 01:16:55,309
Since we're all together...

1134
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:58,395
I feel it's a good time to talk
about Mama's hospital bills.

1135
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,148
Y'all know her insurance
won't cover everything.

1136
01:17:01,248 --> 01:17:04,360
We're talking about it
since the five of us are here.

1137
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,655
Maybe we can all pitch in,
take care of this tonight?

1138
01:17:07,755 --> 01:17:09,115
Yes.

1139
01:17:09,215 --> 01:17:10,950
What about that money Mama has stashed?

1140
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,050
That's just a myth.

1141
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,871
So...

1142
01:17:15,971 --> 01:17:18,531
I felt that Teri and Miles
could pay for everything.

1143
01:17:18,631 --> 01:17:21,033
Then we can pay you back
in installments or--.

1144
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:24,370
Don't you start running
that game on me again.

1145
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,831
Expect me to bail Lem out of jail, too?

1146
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:29,875
Lem doesn't have anything to do with this.

1147
01:17:29,975 --> 01:17:34,395
We can pay for Mama's
bills by selling the big house.

1148
01:17:34,492 --> 01:17:36,006
What?

1149
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:37,633
We're not selling the house.

1150
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:40,657
Mama and Daddy saved
their whole life for that house.

1151
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:43,305
We can't even agree on anything
as small as Sunday dinners.

1152
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:46,392
Nobody's paying for the taxes
or utilities except me.

1153
01:17:46,492 --> 01:17:50,333
We can finally put Uncle Pete
in a home like we discussed.

1154
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,773
Uncle Pete in a home?
Mama would kill us.

1155
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:53,941
You are tripping.

1156
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,359
I'm selling the house.

1157
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:57,111
You're not selling the house.

1158
01:17:57,211 --> 01:18:00,343
I'm the guardian of her estate,
so I make the decisions.

1159
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:02,491
Teri,
listen to what they're saying.

1160
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:05,703
Your mama worked hard to keep
that house in the family.

1161
01:18:05,803 --> 01:18:07,621
For everyone-- you and your family--.

1162
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:09,721
Fuck the family.

1163
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:12,543
I let the family in my house.
You know what?

1164
01:18:12,643 --> 01:18:15,108
The family fucked my husband.

1165
01:18:16,576 --> 01:18:19,611
Yeah. Faith fucked my husband.

1166
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:22,695
Miles.

1167
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:26,025
Teri.

1168
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:27,548
What are you gonna say?

1169
01:18:27,648 --> 01:18:29,175
Teri.
- 'Teri' what?

1170
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:32,386
Can we talk about this?
- Talk about what? Fuck you.

1171
01:18:32,486 --> 01:18:34,486
Teri. Whoa. Teri.

1172
01:18:42,383 --> 01:18:44,383
Let go. Let go.

1173
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,347
My goodness.

1174
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,333
Get out.

1175
01:19:02,433 --> 01:19:03,563
I'm so sorry.

1176
01:19:03,663 --> 01:19:04,898
Get out.

1177
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:06,587
Get the fuck out.

1178
01:19:06,687 --> 01:19:08,687
I never meant to. God.

1179
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,288
God.

1180
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:25,375
God.

1181
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,434
It's OK. It's OK, Teri.

1182
01:19:30,534 --> 01:19:32,534
It's gonna be OK.

1183
01:19:32,631 --> 01:19:33,917
Second floor nursing station, maintenance.

1184
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:36,378
Second floor nursing station, maintenance.

1185
01:19:36,478 --> 01:19:39,386
ln the five weeks
Big Mama was in that coma...

1186
01:19:39,486 --> 01:19:42,999
...every grownup in the family
managed somehow to go crazy.

1187
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:46,839
I know, 'cause I just about went crazy, too.

1188
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,018
You...

1189
01:20:21,765 --> 01:20:23,850
You were...

1190
01:20:24,893 --> 01:20:26,761
...here...

1191
01:20:26,861 --> 01:20:28,534
...weren't you?

1192
01:20:28,634 --> 01:20:30,912
Yeah.

1193
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:34,832
Everybody was worried about you,
but not me.

1194
01:20:34,932 --> 01:20:37,057
I knew you'd come around.

1195
01:20:37,864 --> 01:20:39,864
I love you, Big Mama.

1196
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:47,789
The family's...

1197
01:20:49,459 --> 01:20:51,459
...a mess, isn't it?

1198
01:20:56,675 --> 01:21:00,755
A lot of bad things happened
while you were gone.

1199
01:21:02,097 --> 01:21:04,097
If you let...

1200
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,019
...bad things stop you...

1201
01:21:11,064 --> 01:21:14,080
...you won't be here...

1202
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,180
...for the good things.

1203
01:21:18,488 --> 01:21:20,488
I'm tired, baby.

1204
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:27,988
My soul is tired.

1205
01:21:30,282 --> 01:21:35,495
I need you to do something for me.

1206
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:41,918
Only you can do it.

1207
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:46,673
I need you to--.

1208
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:51,217
Big Mama, what's wrong?

1209
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:55,013
Big Mama. Big Mama.

1210
01:22:00,353 --> 01:22:02,451
Son, you'll have to wait outside.

1211
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,662
It's OK, son.

1212
01:22:04,762 --> 01:22:07,142
We'll take good care of her.

1213
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:15,867
Excuse me.

1214
01:22:24,743 --> 01:22:26,007
Dr. Horowitz...

1215
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,800
...please report to the nursing station.

1216
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,386
Dr. Horowitz to the nursing station.

1217
01:22:30,486 --> 01:22:33,055
Why.

1218
01:22:33,155 --> 01:22:38,144
Should I feel.

1219
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:42,940
Discouraged?

1220
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,776
Why.

1221
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:52,721
Should the shadows come.

1222
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:55,995
And why.

1223
01:22:56,095 --> 01:22:59,248
Should my heart.

1224
01:22:59,348 --> 01:23:02,877
Be lonely.

1225
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:05,630
And long.

1226
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:10,968
For heaven.

1227
01:23:11,068 --> 01:23:15,514
And home.

1228
01:23:15,614 --> 01:23:20,645
When Jesus is.

1229
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:24,941
My potion.

1230
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:29,560
A constant friend.

1231
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:33,356
Is he.

1232
01:23:33,456 --> 01:23:37,255
His eye.

1233
01:23:37,355 --> 01:23:40,634
Is on.

1234
01:23:40,734 --> 01:23:46,494
The sparrow.

1235
01:23:46,594 --> 01:23:48,079
And I know.

1236
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:54,072
He watches me.

1237
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,775
His eyes...

1238
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,090
Pulling together in times of need--.

1239
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:01,717
That had always been Big Mama's job...

1240
01:24:01,817 --> 01:24:05,897
...but who was gonna do it
now that she was gone?

1241
01:24:06,001 --> 01:24:09,642
And I know.

1242
01:24:09,742 --> 01:24:14,063
He watches.

1243
01:24:14,163 --> 01:24:16,261
Me.

1244
01:24:28,305 --> 01:24:30,611
Mama ain't even lukewarm
in the ground yet...

1245
01:24:30,711 --> 01:24:34,536
...and that damn girl got her house for sale.

1246
01:24:56,249 --> 01:24:58,249
Uncle Pete?

1247
01:25:04,716 --> 01:25:07,436
What you doing out of your room?

1248
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:15,323
We going to the creek today,
Joe?

1249
01:25:15,423 --> 01:25:19,493
We can catch some trout for dinner.

1250
01:25:19,593 --> 01:25:21,162
Put it in the iron pot...

1251
01:25:21,262 --> 01:25:24,498
...sear it with lard or cooking oil, Joe.

1252
01:25:24,598 --> 01:25:26,083
No.

1253
01:25:26,183 --> 01:25:28,647
I'm Maxine, Uncle Pete.

1254
01:25:30,106 --> 01:25:32,106
Joe's daughter.

1255
01:25:40,575 --> 01:25:42,575
She's gone.

1256
01:25:46,998 --> 01:25:48,998
She's dead.

1257
01:25:50,919 --> 01:25:54,268
Remember Daddy used to raise hogs?

1258
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:55,728
He'd gut 'em...

1259
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:59,273
...and he'd cure the cut-up meat
in brine, and...

1260
01:25:59,373 --> 01:26:03,198
...and put 'em in the smokehouse
for sausages.

1261
01:26:11,481 --> 01:26:14,067
Daddy's gone now.

1262
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:18,925
So you got to take care of me now, Joe.

1263
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,889
That's right.

1264
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:44,709
I'm gonna take good care of you.

1265
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:47,630
Come on, now, Uncle Pete.

1266
01:26:49,175 --> 01:26:51,175
You want some catfish?

1267
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,531
I'm happy we're doing this.

1268
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:00,631
Yeah, me, too.

1269
01:27:05,275 --> 01:27:07,275
Look. There she is.

1270
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:14,407
Teri.

1271
01:27:16,202 --> 01:27:17,592
Hi.

1272
01:27:17,692 --> 01:27:22,027
We didn't order yet,
'cause we were waiting for you.

1273
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:27,518
What's up?

1274
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,730
Look, Teri, I know you're mad at the world...

1275
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:33,181
...for what's happened
between you and Miles.

1276
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:34,765
I understand.

1277
01:27:34,865 --> 01:27:39,625
But you're taking it out
on the family, and that's wrong.

1278
01:27:46,348 --> 01:27:48,348
Sorry.

1279
01:27:50,101 --> 01:27:53,586
We're gonna stop
the sale of Mama's house.

1280
01:27:55,148 --> 01:27:57,038
I went to Kenny's lawyer...

1281
01:27:57,138 --> 01:28:01,048
...and I drew up a motion
to cease and desist.

1282
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,700
Sorry.

1283
01:28:09,871 --> 01:28:11,886
OK.

1284
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:13,986
OK?
- I'm sorry, too.

1285
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,080
Teri, don't leave.

1286
01:28:17,629 --> 01:28:20,094
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1287
01:28:21,132 --> 01:28:23,427
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1288
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:47,981
You OK?

1289
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:52,571
Lem's gonna be a daddy.

1290
01:28:54,489 --> 01:28:57,859
So you're the fish in Mama's dream.

1291
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,959
Yeah.

1292
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,460
Maxie, I miss him so much.

1293
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:09,058
I knew, Bird...

1294
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:11,060
...but you can't call your ex...

1295
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,480
...to help your husband
find a job behind his back.

1296
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:17,191
A man has to be a man.

1297
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:21,404
If he feels you take that away
from him, he has nothing.

1298
01:29:21,504 --> 01:29:23,698
Like with Mama.

1299
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:27,577
Remember when Daddy lost
all that money gambling?

1300
01:29:27,677 --> 01:29:28,995
Remember?
- Yes.

1301
01:29:29,095 --> 01:29:30,246
She didn't trip.

1302
01:29:30,346 --> 01:29:35,241
She did what she had to do
and left him with his dignity.

1303
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:37,381
You see what I'm saying?

1304
01:29:37,647 --> 01:29:39,370
Men need that.

1305
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,205
Yeah.

1306
01:29:41,305 --> 01:29:43,305
I guess you're right.

1307
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:46,502
I'm gonna be an auntie.

1308
01:29:46,602 --> 01:29:48,700
God.

1309
01:29:51,828 --> 01:29:54,888
I wish I could be like you.
- Please.

1310
01:29:54,983 --> 01:29:57,847
So does Teri. That's why
she acts the way she does.

1311
01:29:57,947 --> 01:30:00,766
Girl, you got your own shop...

1312
01:30:00,866 --> 01:30:04,249
...and Teri's got a great job at the firm.

1313
01:30:04,349 --> 01:30:07,732
Shoot, all I got is a husband
and some kids...

1314
01:30:07,832 --> 01:30:09,832
...but they badasses.

1315
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:17,986
Mama always said you were
the strongest one in the family.

1316
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:23,560
I want to say thank you
for always supporting me.

1317
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:25,660
You're my sister, girl.

1318
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,254
I love you, Maxie.

1319
01:30:30,354 --> 01:30:31,797
I love you, too.

1320
01:30:31,897 --> 01:30:33,897
Come here, girl.

1321
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:37,256
It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

1322
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,588
Just fine.

1323
01:30:40,688 --> 01:30:43,341
We gotta get some bottles,
some Pampers.

1324
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:46,010
You ready for that?
- I guess.

1325
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:48,110
Get ready.

1326
01:30:48,631 --> 01:30:52,043
It's Teri Joseph for Jonathan Oliver, please.

1327
01:30:52,143 --> 01:30:54,232
Teri must have felt really bad...

1328
01:30:54,332 --> 01:30:55,901
...about what she did to Lem...

1329
01:30:56,001 --> 01:31:00,761
'cause she called in a favor
from some downtown big shot.

1330
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:03,437
Um, I have a favor.

1331
01:31:07,149 --> 01:31:08,580
And that last steal.

1332
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,874
The way you pulled up and scored.

1333
01:31:10,974 --> 01:31:12,042
Mom.

1334
01:31:12,142 --> 01:31:14,142
Sweet move, baby.

1335
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:16,963
But, Mama,
why you always gotta be so loud?

1336
01:31:17,063 --> 01:31:19,257
I don't care what they say.

1337
01:31:19,357 --> 01:31:22,344
You my baby,
and I'm proud of you.

1338
01:31:22,444 --> 01:31:24,346
Can you hook up a victory dinner?

1339
01:31:24,446 --> 01:31:26,264
Sure, baby, anything you want.

1340
01:31:26,364 --> 01:31:28,475
Think I could grub on some lima beans...

1341
01:31:28,575 --> 01:31:31,686
...neck bones,
greens with some hot sauce...

1342
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:33,647
...hot cakes,
and some fried chicken.

1343
01:31:33,747 --> 01:31:34,981
Dang.

1344
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:36,191
All of that?

1345
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,100
All of that.

1346
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,851
All right.

1347
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:43,691
Besides, I haven't cooked like that since...

1348
01:31:45,678 --> 01:31:48,610
So when you want to have
this victory dinner?

1349
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:50,028
Sunday...

1350
01:31:50,128 --> 01:31:52,128
...at Big Mama's.

1351
01:31:56,313 --> 01:31:58,313
You up to something.

1352
01:32:00,526 --> 01:32:02,791
I carried you for nine months,
went through...

1353
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:06,962
...Twenty three hours,
45 minutes, 10 seconds of labor.

1354
01:32:07,062 --> 01:32:08,213
Wiped your little butt...

1355
01:32:08,313 --> 01:32:11,383
...while your lil' ding-a-ling
pee-peed in my face.

1356
01:32:11,483 --> 01:32:14,968
So Mama knows
when you're up to something.

1357
01:32:17,209 --> 01:32:22,054
You're trying to get everybody
together for Sunday dinner.

1358
01:32:22,882 --> 01:32:25,147
Big Mama wants me to.

1359
01:32:25,247 --> 01:32:29,582
It's what she was trying
to tell me before she died.

1360
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:34,677
You liked that last shot?

1361
01:32:34,777 --> 01:32:38,118
Man,
that last shot was the bomb.

1362
01:32:38,218 --> 01:32:39,609
Flow, you know.

1363
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:41,903
Keep doing like that,
and when you get older...

1364
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:44,489
...you're gonna get a fat contract, right?

1365
01:32:44,589 --> 01:32:47,909
Buy a house. Get me a Lexus.
- A Lexus.

1366
01:32:48,009 --> 01:32:51,204
And a fur,
you know what I'm saying?

1367
01:32:51,304 --> 01:32:54,958
Guys, that's sounding good,
but I'm still missing a note.

1368
01:32:55,058 --> 01:32:56,793
Let's do it again.

1369
01:32:56,893 --> 01:32:58,295
Let's try it again.

1370
01:32:58,395 --> 01:33:00,172
Here we go.

1371
01:33:00,272 --> 01:33:03,216
One, two, three, four.

1372
01:33:03,316 --> 01:33:04,718
Girl.

1373
01:33:04,818 --> 01:33:07,846
I care about you.

1374
01:33:07,946 --> 01:33:11,329
I'm there for you.

1375
01:33:11,429 --> 01:33:14,144
So why don't you care.

1376
01:33:14,244 --> 01:33:15,729
For me.

1377
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:19,399
Like I care about you?

1378
01:33:19,499 --> 01:33:21,276
Good, good, better.

1379
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,716
Let's take a break, all right?

1380
01:33:23,816 --> 01:33:26,961
Leave the little man to his business.

1381
01:33:30,773 --> 01:33:33,121
I'm glad you could make it,
shorty.

1382
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:34,289
I'm glad, too.

1383
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:36,249
It's been tough...

1384
01:33:36,349 --> 01:33:39,753
...with school and working
at the shop afterwards.

1385
01:33:39,853 --> 01:33:44,677
And figuring out what to do
with that loot Big Mama left me.

1386
01:33:44,777 --> 01:33:45,874
What loot?

1387
01:33:45,974 --> 01:33:48,085
Dead presidents?
- Cash?

1388
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:50,587
When did she leave it to you?
- Day she died.

1389
01:33:50,687 --> 01:33:52,672
I was the only one at the hospital.

1390
01:33:52,772 --> 01:33:55,467
Big mama told me where
she stashed a lot of money.

1391
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:57,344
How much money you talkin' about?

1392
01:33:57,444 --> 01:33:59,137
Lots. I mean beaucoup.

1393
01:33:59,237 --> 01:34:01,237
Beaucoup?
- Beaucoup.

1394
01:34:01,325 --> 01:34:05,227
Maybe you could help me
decide what to do with it.

1395
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:06,895
This isn't the money from the will?

1396
01:34:06,995 --> 01:34:09,064
Aunt Teri, you're the smartest in the family.

1397
01:34:09,164 --> 01:34:10,232
You know that's right.

1398
01:34:10,332 --> 01:34:13,485
If I was your son,
would you invest in my future?

1399
01:34:13,585 --> 01:34:16,113
Do the right thing for family?
- Absolutely.

1400
01:34:16,213 --> 01:34:19,199
If you help me,
I can give you a third.

1401
01:34:19,299 --> 01:34:20,784
Like a fee.

1402
01:34:20,884 --> 01:34:23,161
A fee?
- Yeah.

1403
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:27,457
Then you could pay Big Mama's
bills and not sell the house.

1404
01:34:27,557 --> 01:34:30,460
I can give you a percentage
if you help me invest it.

1405
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,879
You can use the money
to promote your CD.

1406
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:35,340
Have you told anybody else about this?

1407
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,261
No, but I'd give you some of it.
You could pay Aunt Teri's loan.

1408
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:41,716
Why don't you tell me...
- ...where the money is?

1409
01:34:41,816 --> 01:34:44,706
Let's get it.
- When's a good time?

1410
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:47,613
Sunday at 3:00...

1411
01:34:47,713 --> 01:34:49,713
...at Big Mama's.

1412
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:04,985
What y'all doing here?

1413
01:35:05,085 --> 01:35:08,145
Just cooking a little Sunday dinner.

1414
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,299
All right.

1415
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:29,468
Let the ladies handle this.

1416
01:35:29,568 --> 01:35:33,680
After all the hard work
is done, you're gonna come in.

1417
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:36,808
You can work hard with
that remote and watch football.

1418
01:35:36,908 --> 01:35:38,477
I can do that?
- Yeah.

1419
01:35:38,577 --> 01:35:39,728
You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

1420
01:35:39,828 --> 01:35:40,979
You don't need anything?
- No.

1421
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:43,079
Thank you.

1422
01:35:46,212 --> 01:35:48,852
You want me to start these dumplings?

1423
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:52,827
Yeah, but watch that measuring.
You know how you are.

1424
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:54,941
I'm gonna kick your butt.

1425
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,041
Why didn't you tell me?

1426
01:35:58,099 --> 01:35:59,821
This would be the test...

1427
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,824
...to see if 40 years of tradition
and Mama's soul food...

1428
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:06,749
...could pull our family back together again.

1429
01:36:17,952 --> 01:36:19,952
Aunt Teri, what's up?

1430
01:36:25,084 --> 01:36:27,099
There's a car outside.

1431
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,199
Is your mom here?

1432
01:36:33,592 --> 01:36:35,592
Somebody cooking?

1433
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:38,472
Go in the kitchen and see.

1434
01:37:46,197 --> 01:37:50,702
Smells in the kitchen
bringing back the good old days.

1435
01:37:51,734 --> 01:37:54,374
Mmm, dumplings,
deep-fried catfish...

1436
01:37:54,474 --> 01:37:58,420
...macaroni and cheese,
and sweet cornbread.

1437
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:03,280
The kind Big Mama made look
like pound cake for the kids.

1438
01:38:04,163 --> 01:38:07,648
I wanted the good old feelings back, too.

1439
01:38:07,738 --> 01:38:10,169
And so did Big Mama.

1440
01:39:16,142 --> 01:39:17,823
Miles, what's up, man?

1441
01:39:17,923 --> 01:39:19,923
How you doing?

1442
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:24,454
What's going on here, Ahmad?

1443
01:39:24,554 --> 01:39:25,706
We having Sunday dinner.

1444
01:39:25,806 --> 01:39:27,666
We got some string beans,
catfish...

1445
01:39:27,766 --> 01:39:30,585
...chicken and dumplings,
some cornbread.

1446
01:39:30,685 --> 01:39:32,685
I shouldn't be here.

1447
01:39:34,118 --> 01:39:36,118
What's happening?

1448
01:39:37,246 --> 01:39:39,052
When'd you get out of jail?

1449
01:39:39,152 --> 01:39:40,345
What's going on?

1450
01:39:40,445 --> 01:39:41,847
I wanna talk to you.

1451
01:39:41,947 --> 01:39:43,432
How you doing, Miles?

1452
01:39:43,532 --> 01:39:44,683
Have a seat.

1453
01:39:44,783 --> 01:39:46,643
We're going to serve dinner.

1454
01:39:46,743 --> 01:39:48,868
What's going on in there?

1455
01:39:49,749 --> 01:39:51,680
We're having Sunday dinner.

1456
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,780
Sunday dinner?

1457
01:39:57,798 --> 01:39:59,798
I fucked up, huh?

1458
01:40:01,761 --> 01:40:03,761
How's Bird doing?

1459
01:40:04,555 --> 01:40:06,555
She's in there.

1460
01:40:06,647 --> 01:40:09,031
Why don't you go ask her?

1461
01:40:09,131 --> 01:40:11,241
Looks like a family thing in there.

1462
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:13,452
I don't want to butt in.

1463
01:40:13,552 --> 01:40:15,203
Why not?

1464
01:40:15,303 --> 01:40:17,303
You're family.

1465
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,231
Hey, Ahmad, um...

1466
01:40:22,331 --> 01:40:26,048
I know I let you down,
and I'm sorry.

1467
01:40:26,148 --> 01:40:28,842
But I want you to know,
I ain't beat on your auntie.

1468
01:40:28,942 --> 01:40:31,261
I pushed her,
and that was bad enough...

1469
01:40:31,361 --> 01:40:33,055
...but I didn't hit her.

1470
01:40:33,155 --> 01:40:35,875
I would never, ever hit a woman.

1471
01:40:35,972 --> 01:40:37,972
Do you believe me?

1472
01:40:41,467 --> 01:40:46,057
Ahmad, your mama said go wash
and get ready for dinner.

1473
01:40:49,892 --> 01:40:51,605
I'll leave you two alone.

1474
01:40:51,705 --> 01:40:54,274
Boo, you're home?

1475
01:40:54,374 --> 01:40:56,680
Baby.

1476
01:40:57,973 --> 01:40:59,780
I missed you so much.

1477
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,531
I missed you.

1478
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:03,742
I missed you so much.
Are you OK?

1479
01:41:03,842 --> 01:41:04,951
I'm fine, baby.

1480
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:07,371
I messed up, baby.

1481
01:41:07,471 --> 01:41:08,580
I'm sorry.

1482
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,582
I love you.
- I love you, too.

1483
01:41:10,682 --> 01:41:13,147
I have something to tell you.

1484
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:16,158
Ahmad? Ahmad?

1485
01:41:21,539 --> 01:41:24,259
I can't even believe she's here.

1486
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,960
Come on.

1487
01:41:33,217 --> 01:41:34,856
Hey, Faith, what's up?

1488
01:41:34,956 --> 01:41:36,956
Ahmad, what's going on?

1489
01:41:37,055 --> 01:41:39,123
How come everybody's here?

1490
01:41:39,223 --> 01:41:41,113
We just having Sunday dinner.

1491
01:41:41,213 --> 01:41:43,044
Sunday dinner?

1492
01:41:43,144 --> 01:41:45,659
Yeah. We got some
chicken and dumplings...

1493
01:41:45,759 --> 01:41:49,244
...some string beans,
catfish, some cor--.

1494
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:55,310
Not cool, Ahmad.

1495
01:41:55,855 --> 01:41:57,119
I'm out of here.

1496
01:41:57,219 --> 01:41:58,286
Faith.

1497
01:41:58,386 --> 01:42:00,386
Wait. Please, stay.

1498
01:42:01,694 --> 01:42:03,694
Please?

1499
01:42:06,632 --> 01:42:07,729
Dear Lord...

1500
01:42:07,829 --> 01:42:10,356
...thank you for allowing us
another day on Earth--...

1501
01:42:10,456 --> 01:42:12,400
...another day to glorify your name...

1502
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:15,195
...and sanctify ourselves with your mercy.

1503
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:19,073
I'm grateful that the people
I love most in the world...

1504
01:42:19,173 --> 01:42:24,188
...are here to celebrate life
and the lessons as it unfolds.

1505
01:42:24,483 --> 01:42:28,124
And let one of those lessons
be acceptance and love...

1506
01:42:28,224 --> 01:42:30,168
...so we can be a family again...

1507
01:42:30,268 --> 01:42:32,879
...and love each other like we used to.

1508
01:42:32,979 --> 01:42:35,548
In Christ Jesus' name, amen.

1509
01:42:35,648 --> 01:42:36,800
Amen.

1510
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,900
Amen.

1511
01:42:39,414 --> 01:42:41,805
It's so good to be back.
I missed this place.

1512
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:44,224
I've got my favorite food.

1513
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:46,601
I have a surprise for everyone later...

1514
01:42:46,701 --> 01:42:49,854
...but for now,
why don't we just eat?

1515
01:42:49,954 --> 01:42:51,954
Amen to that.

1516
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:26,756
Everybody, um,
I got my job back.

1517
01:43:26,856 --> 01:43:28,299
That's good, Lem.

1518
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:29,509
Congratulations.

1519
01:43:29,609 --> 01:43:30,677
That's great.

1520
01:43:30,777 --> 01:43:32,095
They asked a brother back...

1521
01:43:32,195 --> 01:43:34,681
...because they know I'm a good,
strong, skilled worker.

1522
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:35,849
That's right.

1523
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:37,392
How'd you get out of jail?

1524
01:43:37,492 --> 01:43:39,853
I don't even know.

1525
01:43:39,953 --> 01:43:43,731
Somebody talked to somebody,
and the charges got dropped.

1526
01:43:43,831 --> 01:43:45,567
Here I am.

1527
01:43:45,667 --> 01:43:47,902
Glad to have you home, brother.

1528
01:43:48,002 --> 01:43:50,467
That's right. My boo is home.

1529
01:43:50,552 --> 01:43:55,689
Actually, I called a friend at
the D.A.'s office for a favor.

1530
01:44:01,894 --> 01:44:03,366
I felt bad.

1531
01:44:03,466 --> 01:44:05,201
You should feel bad.

1532
01:44:05,301 --> 01:44:07,454
Because of you,
I spent weeks in jail.

1533
01:44:07,554 --> 01:44:08,663
You should be thankful.

1534
01:44:08,763 --> 01:44:11,916
Now you can take care
of your pregnant wife.

1535
01:44:12,016 --> 01:44:14,669
Teri,
mind your own damn business.

1536
01:44:14,769 --> 01:44:16,713
Didn't nobody ask you for your help.

1537
01:44:16,813 --> 01:44:21,488
Worry about your husband
and why he's sleeping with her.

1538
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,017
Gee.

1539
01:44:29,117 --> 01:44:30,602
No, sit.

1540
01:44:30,702 --> 01:44:33,104
Let her go if she wants to.

1541
01:44:33,204 --> 01:44:36,044
Teri, I'm sorry,
but she's always running away.

1542
01:44:36,144 --> 01:44:39,969
You're family,
and we're gonna deal with this.

1543
01:44:42,309 --> 01:44:44,866
Baby, get me some more peas.
And take your sister.

1544
01:44:44,966 --> 01:44:46,785
Always worrying about
somebody else's business.

1545
01:44:46,885 --> 01:44:50,370
You need to take care
of your own husband.

1546
01:44:52,236 --> 01:44:56,323
So was that it, Miles?
I didn't take care of you?

1547
01:45:00,067 --> 01:45:03,637
We haven't been happy for a long time now.

1548
01:45:08,408 --> 01:45:10,788
We used to have so much fun.

1549
01:45:18,043 --> 01:45:20,338
I don't know what happened.

1550
01:45:24,174 --> 01:45:26,940
It seems that everything I love...

1551
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,040
I lose.

1552
01:45:35,185 --> 01:45:38,564
Well, um, ahem.

1553
01:45:43,444 --> 01:45:46,334
Good luck with Mother Joe's money.

1554
01:45:47,239 --> 01:45:49,754
M-Mother Joe's money?

1555
01:45:49,854 --> 01:45:51,464
What are you talking about?

1556
01:45:51,564 --> 01:45:53,883
Supposedly, Mama has
some large amount of money...

1557
01:45:53,983 --> 01:45:57,303
...stashed someplace in the house
she was saving for Ahmad and...

1558
01:45:57,403 --> 01:46:00,548
...that's why we're all here tonight.

1559
01:46:00,868 --> 01:46:03,216
Ahmad? Get in here.

1560
01:46:03,316 --> 01:46:05,316
Ahmad?

1561
01:46:05,706 --> 01:46:07,706
Right now.

1562
01:46:09,543 --> 01:46:13,708
Where's this money
Mother Joe supposedly left you?

1563
01:46:14,506 --> 01:46:17,481
There isn't any money.
I made it up.

1564
01:46:17,581 --> 01:46:18,857
You made it up?

1565
01:46:18,957 --> 01:46:22,026
Ahmad, what have I told you about lying?

1566
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:23,236
You know better.

1567
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:26,573
It's not my fault.
It's all y'all's fault.

1568
01:46:26,673 --> 01:46:28,283
Y'all messed up the family.

1569
01:46:28,383 --> 01:46:30,383
Can't you see that?

1570
01:46:33,233 --> 01:46:37,388
Big Mama wanted me to get you
together for a Sunday dinner.

1571
01:46:37,488 --> 01:46:41,600
I didn't know how to do that,
because all y'all do is fight.

1572
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:45,270
So I lied about the money so you'd come...

1573
01:46:46,705 --> 01:46:49,510
...so we could be a family again.

1574
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:53,690
Y'all know that's what Big Mama wanted.

1575
01:46:55,047 --> 01:46:57,758
Baby...come here.

1576
01:46:59,718 --> 01:47:00,951
It's OK.

1577
01:47:01,051 --> 01:47:03,266
Y'all smell that?

1578
01:47:03,366 --> 01:47:04,309
Smell what?

1579
01:47:04,409 --> 01:47:06,144
It's coming from the kitchen.

1580
01:47:06,244 --> 01:47:07,854
You mess with the stove?

1581
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:10,219
I'll go look.

1582
01:47:16,391 --> 01:47:18,391
Shit. Come on.

1583
01:47:19,353 --> 01:47:21,353
Let me get some water.

1584
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:25,747
Get back. Get back.

1585
01:47:25,847 --> 01:47:26,748
My God.

1586
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,625
Get back. Get back.

1587
01:47:28,725 --> 01:47:30,502
Look out. Look out.

1588
01:47:30,602 --> 01:47:32,796
Whoa. Whoa. Look out.

1589
01:47:32,896 --> 01:47:36,211
It's coming from the back of the stove.

1590
01:47:36,912 --> 01:47:38,176
It ain't working.

1591
01:47:38,276 --> 01:47:40,276
My God.

1592
01:47:40,376 --> 01:47:41,471
The house.

1593
01:47:41,571 --> 01:47:42,806
Wait.

1594
01:47:42,906 --> 01:47:43,807
The house.

1595
01:47:43,907 --> 01:47:46,032
It's getting out of hand.

1596
01:47:47,005 --> 01:47:48,686
We need an extinguisher.

1597
01:47:48,786 --> 01:47:50,786
Yeah.

1598
01:48:24,658 --> 01:48:25,588
No.

1599
01:48:25,688 --> 01:48:27,382
My God.

1600
01:48:27,482 --> 01:48:30,260
My goodness.

1601
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,511
No.

1602
01:48:31,611 --> 01:48:33,138
What happened?

1603
01:48:33,238 --> 01:48:34,305
I don't know.

1604
01:48:34,405 --> 01:48:36,405
I...

1605
01:48:44,136 --> 01:48:47,681
I forgot.
I left the towel on the stove.

1606
01:48:48,807 --> 01:48:50,807
Ahmad...

1607
01:48:55,856 --> 01:48:57,996
Uncle Pete, are you all right?

1608
01:48:58,096 --> 01:49:00,123
Got a little on your face.

1609
01:49:00,223 --> 01:49:01,958
He didn't mean nothing.

1610
01:49:02,058 --> 01:49:05,033
This is, uh, my surprise,
everybody.

1611
01:49:05,981 --> 01:49:07,981
Uncle Pete.

1612
01:49:09,818 --> 01:49:11,818
Uncle Pete?

1613
01:49:13,906 --> 01:49:15,420
I'm--I'm sorry, man.

1614
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:16,442
Look at this.

1615
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:18,542
What?
- What?

1616
01:49:20,037 --> 01:49:21,134
Look at all this money.

1617
01:49:21,234 --> 01:49:23,428
Yay.

1618
01:49:23,528 --> 01:49:26,097
Big Mama really had
hidden a pile of money.

1619
01:49:26,197 --> 01:49:29,221
It was in the last place we'd look--.

1620
01:49:29,321 --> 01:49:31,321
Uncle Pete's TV.

1621
01:49:32,633 --> 01:49:35,273
Now I understand
what soul food was all about.

1622
01:49:35,373 --> 01:49:38,777
During slavery, black folks
didn't have a lot to celebrate.

1623
01:49:38,877 --> 01:49:42,322
Cooking was how we expressed
love for each other.

1624
01:49:42,422 --> 01:49:44,616
That's what those Sunday dinners meant.

1625
01:49:44,716 --> 01:49:46,284
More than just eating.

1626
01:49:46,384 --> 01:49:49,120
It was a time for sharing
our joys and sorrows.

1627
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:53,810
Something old folks say
is missing in today's families.

1628
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:56,648
Things got better for my family after that.

1629
01:49:56,748 --> 01:49:58,797
Even though Miles
and Aunt Teri broke up...

1630
01:49:58,897 --> 01:50:01,299
...that doesn't stop
Miles from coming over...

1631
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:05,394
...and filling his belly
with Mama's soul food.

1632
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:07,420
Lem and Bird are doing good.

1633
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,817
They got their own place...

1634
01:50:08,917 --> 01:50:12,912
...and they're expecting
their baby any day now.

1635
01:50:13,038 --> 01:50:16,638
My mama and Aunt Teri are
cool again, at least for now.

1636
01:50:16,738 --> 01:50:19,557
And Faith is finally a part of the family, too.

1637
01:50:19,657 --> 01:50:22,310
As you can see,
we didn't sell the big house.

1638
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:24,813
No way, no how.

1639
01:50:24,913 --> 01:50:29,150
Even though we miss Big Mama's
cooking, laughter, and love...

1640
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:31,736
...none of us feel like life cheated her.

1641
01:50:31,836 --> 01:50:34,656
She accomplished what
she set out to do--...

1642
01:50:34,756 --> 01:50:38,076
...to build a strong family
with a rich tradition...

1643
01:50:38,176 --> 01:50:40,787
...and to leave love in her footprints.

1644
01:50:40,887 --> 01:50:42,943
Thanks, Big Mama.

1645
01:50:50,284 --> 01:50:52,409
You taught me everything.

1646
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:53,571
Everything you've given me.

1647
01:50:53,671 --> 01:50:55,656
I'll always keep it inside.

1648
01:50:55,756 --> 01:51:00,014
And you're the driving force in my life.

1649
01:51:00,114 --> 01:51:02,114
Yeah-eah-eah.

1650
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:05,311
There isn't anything
or anyone that I could be.

1651
01:51:05,411 --> 01:51:08,513
And it just wouldn't feel right.

1652
01:51:08,613 --> 01:51:13,380
If I didn't have you by my side.

1653
01:51:14,423 --> 01:51:15,770
You were there for me.

1654
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,710
To love and care for me.

1655
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:20,525
When skies were gray.

1656
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:22,277
Whenever I was down.

1657
01:51:22,377 --> 01:51:24,029
You were always there.

1658
01:51:24,129 --> 01:51:26,865
To comfort me.

1659
01:51:26,965 --> 01:51:30,326
And no one else can be
what you have been to me.

1660
01:51:30,426 --> 01:51:32,954
You will always be.

1661
01:51:33,054 --> 01:51:35,165
You will always be.

1662
01:51:35,265 --> 01:51:37,584
The girl in my life.

1663
01:51:37,684 --> 01:51:40,211
For all times.

1664
01:51:40,311 --> 01:51:43,423
Mama.

1665
01:51:43,523 --> 01:51:44,674
Mama.

1666
01:51:44,774 --> 01:51:45,884
You know.

1667
01:51:45,984 --> 01:51:47,761
I love you.

1668
01:51:47,861 --> 01:51:50,597
You know I love you.

1669
01:51:50,697 --> 01:51:53,183
You know I love you.

1670
01:51:53,283 --> 01:51:55,381
Mama.

1671
01:51:56,632 --> 01:51:59,981
Mama, you're the queen of my heart.

1672
01:52:00,081 --> 01:52:02,817
You are.

1673
01:52:02,917 --> 01:52:05,737
Your love is like tears from the stars.

1674
01:52:05,837 --> 01:52:09,152
Your love is like tears from the stars.

1675
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:12,400
Mama, I just want you to know.

1676
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:15,487
Mama, I just want you to know.

1677
01:52:15,587 --> 01:52:18,740
Lovin' you is like food to my soul.

1678
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,607
Lovin' you is like food to my soul.

1679
01:52:33,117 --> 01:52:34,506
You are the food.

1680
01:52:34,606 --> 01:52:38,093
To my soul.

1681
01:52:38,193 --> 01:52:42,960
Yes, you are.

1682
01:52:48,173 --> 01:52:50,438
Don't you stop it.

1683
01:52:50,538 --> 01:52:53,343
Don't you stop what you're doin'.

1684
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:56,111
You don't really want to stop.

1685
01:52:56,211 --> 01:52:57,779
No, you don't.

1686
01:52:57,879 --> 01:53:00,115
Don't you stop it.

1687
01:53:00,215 --> 01:53:02,784
Don't you stop what you're doin'.

1688
01:53:02,884 --> 01:53:03,952
Yeah, yeah.

1689
01:53:04,052 --> 01:53:05,286
You don't really want to stop.

1690
01:53:05,386 --> 01:53:07,288
Check it out, yeah, come on.

1691
01:53:07,388 --> 01:53:09,823
Whether you like it hard over live guitars.

1692
01:53:09,923 --> 01:53:10,907
Anything dropped.

1693
01:53:11,007 --> 01:53:11,992
If it's hot, it's ours.

1694
01:53:12,092 --> 01:53:13,535
If it's not, it's yours.

1695
01:53:13,635 --> 01:53:14,661
We on the job.

1696
01:53:14,761 --> 01:53:15,745
Everybody eatin'.

1697
01:53:15,845 --> 01:53:17,080
Everybody involved.

1698
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:19,332
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap.

1699
01:53:19,432 --> 01:53:20,417
Bad boy, stop.

1700
01:53:20,517 --> 01:53:21,418
What's the chance of that?

1701
01:53:21,518 --> 01:53:22,585
We don't stop.

1702
01:53:22,685 --> 01:53:24,337
So checks, advances, and stacks.

1703
01:53:24,437 --> 01:53:25,839
And we don't have to answer to jack.

1704
01:53:25,939 --> 01:53:27,757
No wonder we had this rap shit locked.

1705
01:53:27,857 --> 01:53:29,217
For eight straight summers.

1706
01:53:29,317 --> 01:53:30,427
Pull up at the party.

1707
01:53:30,527 --> 01:53:31,636
Eight straight hummers.

1708
01:53:31,736 --> 01:53:33,972
Six be the sixth, seventh,
and eighth wonders.

1709
01:53:34,072 --> 01:53:36,016
Pop corks,
we be the toast of New York.

1710
01:53:36,116 --> 01:53:38,810
And out West,
we want y'all to understand.

1711
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:40,937
All we wanna do is make you dance.

1712
01:53:41,037 --> 01:53:42,230
We know the song ain't done wrong.

1713
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,606
When the party is hot.

1714
01:53:43,706 --> 01:53:46,151
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

1715
01:53:46,251 --> 01:53:48,653
Don't you stop it.

1716
01:53:48,753 --> 01:53:51,558
Don't you stop what you're doin'.

1717
01:53:52,478 --> 01:53:54,326
You don't really want to stop.

1718
01:53:54,426 --> 01:53:55,869
Nah.

1719
01:53:55,969 --> 01:53:58,288
Don't you stop it.

1720
01:53:58,388 --> 01:54:02,000
Don't you stop what you're doin'.

1721
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:05,003
You don't really want to stop.

1722
01:54:05,103 --> 01:54:06,588
You can pump this in your jeep.

1723
01:54:06,688 --> 01:54:07,881
On an off-road.

1724
01:54:07,981 --> 01:54:08,882
Pump this through your Bose.

1725
01:54:08,982 --> 01:54:10,342
On the way to the toll.

1726
01:54:10,442 --> 01:54:11,333
Bang this in you're B.N.O.

1727
01:54:11,433 --> 01:54:12,459
When you at home.

1728
01:54:12,559 --> 01:54:14,544
On the six-four sittin' on chrome.

1729
01:54:14,644 --> 01:54:16,004
Yo, we don't stall, we ball.

1730
01:54:16,104 --> 01:54:17,213
While you playin' the wall.

1731
01:54:17,313 --> 01:54:18,798
We in the middle of the dance floor.

1732
01:54:18,898 --> 01:54:19,883
Gettin' off.

1733
01:54:19,983 --> 01:54:21,009
We got a bunch of hot chicks.

1734
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:22,177
Gettin' live with us.

1735
01:54:22,277 --> 01:54:23,261
At the end of the night.

1736
01:54:23,361 --> 01:54:25,013
They gonna slide with us.

1737
01:54:25,113 --> 01:54:27,307
Don't you stop it.

1738
01:54:27,407 --> 01:54:31,061
Don't you stop what you're doin'.

1739
01:54:31,161 --> 01:54:33,104
You don't really want to stop.

1740
01:54:33,204 --> 01:54:34,522
No, baby, uh-uh.

1741
01:54:34,622 --> 01:54:37,025
Don't you stop it.

1742
01:54:37,125 --> 01:54:40,612
Don't you stop what you're doin'.

1743
01:54:40,712 --> 01:54:43,262
You don't really want to stop.
