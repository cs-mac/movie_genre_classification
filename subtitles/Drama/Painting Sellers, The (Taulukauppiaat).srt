1
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,232
- There. You have just
entered the painting.

2
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,708
You would think time has stopped,
but it is not so.

3
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,071
Everyone is in their place
and holding their breath.

4
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,071
The castle over there,

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,077
is occupied by the Toupins
(Tout peint = totally painted).

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,300
At this moment, things
are going their way.

7
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,319
They think they're in paradise.

8
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,797
Lower down, in the shadow,
at the foot of the blue tree,

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,468
lovers are locked in a tender embrace.
Do you see them?

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,398
They believe in their love.

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,558
But they have to hide
for Ramo is a Toupin,

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,830
and my friend Claire,
a Pafini (Pas fini= Unfinished),

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,314
like me.

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,794
I await her,

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,197
and I'm starting to have
pins and needles in my legs.

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,994
I almost forgot to tell you about
the Reufs (Rough Sketches).

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,952
They are even worse.

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,594
It's said
that they believe in nothing!!

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,076
Oh yes! Here, everybody
sees the world in their own way.

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,872
Well, I must leave you.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,958
I, too, have role to play
in this story.

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,238
(Frenzied music)

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,989
- Over here!

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,315
- You see him?

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,238
- He's going to escape us!

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,469
He's over there!

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,715
He's going towards the lake.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,515
- Bastard!
What do we do?

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,708
- We won't see him in these thickets.
- Leave him.

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,717
We'll find another one.

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,875
(They laugh)

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,479
(He gasps for breath)

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,753
(Confused discussions)

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,797
- Did they catch him?
- No, they're coming back without him!

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,719
- It's true we don't see them easily.

36
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,070
- They are just doodles!

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,078
- How do you call them again?
- The Reufs.

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,715
- Oh yes, the Reufs.
They disgust me!

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,151
How did the painter let it happen?

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,353
- They were his first sketches.
- He should have erased them!

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,028
- As long as they don't
come close to the castle...

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,674
- Well, our young Toupins
need to amuse themselves!

43
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,394
- Say, it's beautiful!

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,117
You see all those lights?

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,673
What happened to you?

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,317
Oh, clever! What are we
gonna do now? The stairs...

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,158
are on the other side.

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,234
- Those colors, so wonderful!

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,990
- This color looks great on you, dear.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,111
- You're not so bad either.

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,231
- Look! Over there!

52
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,149
That Pafini!

53
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,870
- She got...

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,470
no self-respect!
- Surely they won't let her come up!

55
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,712
- Please, I implore you!
I'm almost completed...

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,875
- Go away!

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,069
Don't you understand?

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,430
To be a Toupin, you
need to be completed.

59
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,073
- Yes, but...
- Go away! Shoo!

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,958
- Ah, the Pafinis! They don't understand
that they have no place here.

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,278
- The garden is big enough.
They have all the space they need!

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,359
- There is only one way to make them
understand and I hope it's tonight!

63
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,278
(Sweet and sad music)

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,235
- Did you hear them?
Hatred, always with the hatred!

65
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,556
- To what lengths will they go?

66
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,320
- I'm afraid.
- They won't dare hurt you.

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,078
- I don't fear for myself.

68
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,909
I fear our love won't last any longer
in this cold shadow.

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,793
During the day, I wait for night
and when night comes, I have to hide!

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,151
- I can barely see your face!
- I see yours, Claire.

71
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,033
- Tell me then.
I don't know my own face.

72
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,117
- It's very beautiful,
elegantly simple.

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,629
Your eyes are like blue almonds

74
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,512
marvelously drawn.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,836
Your cheeks are golden sunset.

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,395
And your lips have
the color of this flower here,

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,273
rosy, with a touch of crimson.

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,710
- My lips are colored?
- Of course!

79
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,956
- Ramo, hold me tight, please!

80
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,594
Lie to me again.
Tell me we could...

81
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,076
love each other freely.
- They are not lies!

82
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,670
I feel that the painter will come back.
Even if he didn't,

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,474
I'd go look for him
at the end of the world.

84
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,398
And he'll finish the painting.

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,834
- Lola is right, we can't stay here.

86
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,032
I'll see you at the lake tonight.
- Come with us!

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,835
- I want to know what's happening.
And you know the Pafinis don't like me.

88
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,790
- Claire!

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,036
- I'll tell you what I'll have learned.
For now, go with them.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,312
I love you.

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,953
(Sweet melody)

92
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,234
(evening atmosphere,
loud discussions)

93
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,592
- There he is.
Look!

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,676
- Hush!

95
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,760
- My friends, my dear friends!

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,430
You have chosen me to proudly
wear our colors.

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,039
And maybe also...

98
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,232
to voice out loud what everyone
is thinking.

99
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,159
The painter will never come back!

100
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,715
- Finally, someone with the courage
to speak the truth.

101
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,071
- We must recognize this fact:
Such was his decision.

102
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,510
And if he has made of us, The Toupins,

103
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,998
the only perfectly drawn
beings of his works...

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,475
it's because such was his intention!

105
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,796
(The audience applauds)

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,750
And naturally...

107
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,748
that means it falls to us now to
put the castle in order.

108
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,030
- The Pafini have no business here!

109
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,639
- We must chase them away...

110
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,831
once and for all!

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,150
- You're no doubt right, our castle
is not infinite.

112
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,477
Can we find place for all the
sketches from the painting?

113
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,716
- They must go!
- In the Forest...

114
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,353
- In the Forest...
- Yes!

115
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,870
- Exactly!
Who could blame us?

116
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,830
- Me!

117
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,234
- Who is that?

118
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,477
- Young Ramo.
The one who... with that girl...

119
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,229
- How exactly are the Toupins
superior to the Pafinis?

120
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,353
- Isn't it obvious? The painter
wanted it that way, young man.

121
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,152
- What would you know of it?

122
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,351
Are you speaking in his name, now?

123
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,310
Listen to me!

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,557
We don't know why
the painter disappeared.

125
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,309
But he can come back any day,
and finish his work.

126
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,919
- Shut up!

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,917
- He's talking absolute nonsense!

128
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,315
- You are proud of your looks.

129
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,557
Me, I feel ashamed every time
I hear you talk.

130
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,957
To feel superior just because you're
wearing sparkling costumes!

131
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,230
- Better than a rough sketch!!

132
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,874
- Or a barely outlined girl!

133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,275
- My friends, my friends!

134
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,358
Our young Ramo is only trying
to defend his liaison

135
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,232
with a young Pafini.

136
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,908
We must understand,
it's typical of his young age.

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,112
But understanding doesn't mean
we just accept everything.

138
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,039
Blissfully happy idealism
belong to the past.

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,834
Equality, freedom,
the castle for everyone! Hah!

140
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,917
For the Pafinis?
Why not...

141
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,633
for the Reufs?

142
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,638
- Let go off me! Don't you see
he only wants power!

143
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,193
Don't be duped!

144
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,791
- The Painter will be back!
- Yes, yes, he'll be back, he'll back...

145
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,278
No, my friends, believe me.

146
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,438
You don't have to be ashamed
for being the betters,

147
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,835
the most beautiful!

148
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,998
My dear little hearts,

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,476
you're the light of this castle!

150
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,750
- Bravo!
- Vive The Great Chandelier!!

151
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,949
(dramatic music)

152
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,550
- Look!

153
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,149
- A Reuf!
- What horror!

154
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,910
He slipped into the castle!

155
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,795
- Stop!
Are you mad?

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,117
- This boy is dangerous.
Don't you think, Mr. Grey?

157
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,709
- We can take care of
it, Great Chandelier.

158
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,477
- Do you hear them?

159
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,271
- I don't like this song!

160
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,790
- They're getting each other
worked up, like the devils.

161
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,592
- If only you knew how

162
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,199
they treated me!

163
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,628
- Then why do you want to join them!

164
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,912
- Because it's unfair.
Me too, I want to dance, to have fun.

165
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,475
- The only dancing we're gonna do

166
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,319
is to try and dodge their blows.

167
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,112
- You know what he told me?
That my lips were colored!

168
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
I adore him!
I even almost believed him!

169
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,275
- You're lucky.
But if he loves you,

170
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,710
why does he lie to you?

171
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,008
- They are beautiful white lies.
Life is so sad here.

172
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,030
- We only have to keep
quiet, like they asked...

173
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,793
It's the Reufs they are after.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,433
They slip everywhere.

175
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,473
- It's hard to see them.
They risk nothing.

176
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,836
- Listen to them, they
all want to be Toupins.

177
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,992
Me too, I admit.

178
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,670
- Not me. I'm happy like this.
- You say that 'cause you have no lover.

179
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,713
When you love,
you're not alone in the world.

180
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,388
There is him, and me.
There is our love.

181
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,830
He wants to live large...

182
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,076
to be accepted by everyone.

183
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,874
- It's true I've never had a lover.

184
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,117
- But I'd go find my lover elsewhere.

185
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,070
- Elsewhere?

186
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,475
And where would you go, petite Lola?

187
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,195
There is no elsewhere.
There is the castle, the garden,

188
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,392
And then, nothing else.
Excepted the damned Forest.

189
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,717
- The Forest... We
know nothing about it.

190
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,592
No one has ever gone in there.

191
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,949
What are you doing?

192
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,515
- I'm going to see him.
You know he's waiting for me.

193
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,312
- Hey you,
where do you think you're going?

194
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,159
- Let me pass.
- She's going to see her lover!

195
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,238
- Come on, it's none of your business!

196
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,954
- Lola is right.
Let her go.

197
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,310
- No! She will tell them where we are!
- Her Ramo...

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,239
is a Toupin.
- No, he is not like the others.

199
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,635
- He will be worried.
- Relax.

200
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,435
Wait a little bit.
They will let me pass.

201
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,669
- Gom!

202
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,871
(Ominous music)

203
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,869
Oh, no!

204
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,876
What have they done to you?

205
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,911
The monsters!

206
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,039
Poor,

207
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,878
poor idiot.

208
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,150
No!

209
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,473
No!

210
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,114
(Dramatic music)

211
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,154
- Ramo? Is it you?

212
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,998
I can't help you,

213
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm waiting for someone.
- But I didn't ask you anything.

214
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,629
- Where's Claire?

215
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,718
- The Pafinis didn't want to let her go.

216
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,956
- Everybody is against us!

217
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,559
Let's go get her.

218
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,157
- What is he doing here, this Reuf?
- He, too, is hiding.

219
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,793
- There they are!

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,353
- Yes, I see them!

221
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,318
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

222
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,714
- This is not the way!

223
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,911
The current is carrying us away!

224
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,157
- Current?
This lake has no current!

225
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,558
- What are you doing?
We are going towards the...

226
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,875
- The Forest!

227
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,871
- The Flowers of Death!
- Oh, no! It's horrible!

228
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,277
The flowers will devour them.
It makes my blood run cold.

229
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,755
(Dramatic music)

230
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,312
(Ominous music)

231
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,875
- So, Silouet?

232
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,314
- What have you seen?

233
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:03,748
- The Toupins pursued
them to the Forest.

234
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,159
- And then?
- Well...

235
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,952
- Did they escape?

236
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,513
- They went into the Forest and

237
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,438
the giant flowers ate them.

238
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,677
There were three of them:
Lola, a Reuf, and...

239
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,069
- And the young Toupin,
- No!

240
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,315
That's not true!

241
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,431
Why are you lying?

242
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,835
(Sad music)

243
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,313
- We passed!

244
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,351
I can't believe it!

245
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,959
- They didn't...

246
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,912
eat us.
- Do you see now?

247
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,190
Our people talk nonsense!!

248
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,750
- The real nonsense was that I got
in your pirogue in the first place!

249
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,239
How are we gonna find Claire now?

250
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,750
- It's not my fault.
I did what I could.

251
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,554
Are you ok?
Nothing broken?

252
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,352
- Leave me alone!

253
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,709
And him, there,

254
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,673
I don't want him to come close.
- He won't hurt you.

255
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,355
- Don't touch it!
- Ok, calm down!

256
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,756
(He sighs)

257
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,394
- Claire is over there,
with those maniacs.

258
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,717
And me, stuck here with this imp and
this Reuf who won't stop whining.

259
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,478
If only the Painter could see this!

260
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,037
- We just have to go find him.

261
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,589
- If you want my opinion,
he doesn't care about us.

262
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,553
Why not? I've been thinking
about it for sometimes.

263
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,716
- We can always
go tell him about all this.

264
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,559
- He will finish the Pasfinis.
- And the Reufs!

265
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,512
- Naturally!
- Hmm!

266
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,393
- He'll just have to work a little
harder, that's all.

267
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,672
Where to find him?
You know that? You who are so smart?

268
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,440
- This forest is not so dreadful.

269
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,198
Why not continue on?

270
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,358
- In which direction?
Everything is so dark.

271
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,473
- I'd go over there.

272
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,437
- Or there!
- You're not helping.

273
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,438
- Enough!
We turn our back on the castle...

274
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,437
and go straight ahead.

275
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,110
- Hey! Can't you see me?
I am...

276
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,515
- He is caught in the vines again!

277
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,676
- Why doesn't he ever
complete his sentences?

278
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,110
- Maybe because he is a Reuf.

279
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,709
- It's annoying.
- I understand him well enough.

280
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,672
But you must have trouble doing so.

281
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,474
- Yes, I know.
I'm slowing you down, eh?

282
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,231
I just can't stop
getting all tangled up.

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,075
Aie!
Watch the head!

284
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,829
Well. Just leave me here. Leave me!
- Oh, all right!

285
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,792
Stay here, then, if it suits you.

286
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,910
- And if you...

287
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,351
see him, tell him that...

288
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,793
Hey! Don't you think that...

289
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,117
- He is right. We went this way
three times already.

290
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,151
We're going round and round in circles.
- Nonsense!

291
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,759
- It's true, I tell you.

292
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,518
- Stay together!

293
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,431
- It's funny,
I feel so light... Like a feather!

294
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,390
Look!

295
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,589
- Lola!

296
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,074
Lola!

297
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,272
Wait for us, I don't see you anymore!

298
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,710
Lola!

299
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,433
I can't hear her!

300
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,393
- I'm here... hanging!

301
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,433
- You see her?
- Yes, way down there. She is...

302
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,154
- Ramo!
- Yes, I see you!

303
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,756
All right?
- All right.

304
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,188
- Don't move.

305
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,958
We're coming.

306
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,870
- What happened?
Return to your positions.

307
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,116
- What's happening?
In line!

308
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,949
Who is that?

309
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,990
Catch that...

310
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,633
girl.
- Girl?

311
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,751
- There. In the tree!

312
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,229
- Plume!
I need more rope.

313
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,158
Oh no, you came down, too!

314
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,254
- So what? I was afraid,
all alone up there.

315
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,148
You can't blame me.

316
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,319
- Hang on!

317
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,799
- Damned little spy!
The Green sent you, didn't they?

318
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,750
- The Green?

319
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,598
No, I come from another painting...

320
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,392
hung just above yours.

321
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,113
The rope broke.

322
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,515
- A painting?
What rubbish!

323
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,359
- Well, I see that I bothered you.

324
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,515
My apologies.

325
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,119
- By my mustache, she is mocking us!

326
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,958
- But it's the truth, I swear!

327
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,720
You're in a painting. A painting of war.

328
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,071
- War is a serious matter, kid.

329
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,748
You will see tomorrow,
when we execute you,

330
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,916
that your blood is not watercolour.

331
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,997
- You are even worse than
the Toupins.

332
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,872
- Captain!
The Green are...

333
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,297
prepared for battle.

334
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:20,714
- Well, they certainly
didn't waste any time.

335
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,314
Magenta, Solférino!
Keep an eye on this little hussy.

336
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,792
- We have never seen you before.

337
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,560
- It's useless to tell,
nobody will believe me.

338
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,556
- Try me.

339
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,352
- She is a liar, don't listen to her.
- You are...

340
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,278
in a painting depicting a battle.

341
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,596
And I mean to get the hell out.

342
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,758
- Drummer Magenta,
prepare to sound the charge!!

343
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,995
- The charge...

344
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,950
I've had...

345
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,878
enough of this war!

346
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,438
My place is not here.

347
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,750
You sure we can get out of here?

348
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,235
- Of course, I got in, didn't I?
Cut me loose.

349
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,829
- Maybe she is right, Solférino.

350
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,870
- Don't listen to her!

351
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,959
What are you doing?

352
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,229
You won't get out...

353
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,236
of here!

354
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,078
- Where were you?

355
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,793
And him, where did he come from?

356
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,151
- It's Magenta. He helped me,
he is a brave boy.

357
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,509
He is with us now.

358
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,076
Oh, pardon!

359
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,475
What have I done?
- Go ahead!

360
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,511
Don't be shy, I'm used to it!

361
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,472
- Plume is very fragile.

362
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,274
- Forgive me, Plume.
True, it's not...

363
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,232
very solid, your nose!

364
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,474
- Well, I wonder

365
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,318
what are we doing here?

366
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,912
- It all seems abandoned.

367
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,516
Maybe he...

368
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,597
has gone far away.

369
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,755
- What if he is here,
listening to us right now?

370
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,758
- Let him show himself then!
We aren't going to spend the night...

371
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,793
talking about someone who
is not even here!

372
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,877
- That one sure is grumpy!

373
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,718
- Oh, life is so beautiful!

374
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,593
The paint is of the highest
quality every where.

375
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,438
Harmony, tolerance...

376
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,438
And down here, it's the big empty!

377
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,630
- Lola?

378
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,590
- Yes?

379
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,872
- When you meet him,
what will you ask him?

380
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,719
- Ramo thinks he hasn't finished

381
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,750
painting us.

382
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,392
- Me, I'll ask him...

383
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,909
why he painted a battle.

384
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,712
He should have painted the sea.

385
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,832
I've always dreamt of
standing on a seashore.

386
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,952
And you, what will you ask him?

387
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,149
- Me?

388
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,713
I don't know yet.

389
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,798
There are so many things
I'd like to understand!

390
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,719
Why are we sometimes
happy or unhappy...

391
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,995
- Claire!

392
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,274
- What's with him?
- He is in love.

393
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,358
- Oh yeah? And the painter
will fix that, too?

394
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,673
- Grand Chandelier.

395
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,156
When she came out of the forest,
she had blissful smile on her face.

396
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,920
I think our young Ramo is not dead.

397
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,874
- The Flowers of Death didn't
find him to their taste?

398
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,672
Odd.

399
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,473
Unless...

400
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,558
- You think something protects them?

401
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,032
- Love, mr. Grey!

402
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,437
- Love?
- Yes, love.

403
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,154
You know what you need to do?

404
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,909
- Your wishes are my commands,
Grand Chandelier.

405
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,831
- They are so fragile!

406
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,959
- Who spoke?

407
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,634
Did you hear?

408
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,671
- No.
- I tell you, somebody spoke.

409
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,916
It came from that big sheet over there!

410
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,635
- Ssshhh!

411
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,628
- Hello.

412
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,751
- Hello, ma'am.

413
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,515
- Ma'am!

414
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,278
Call me Garance.

415
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,198
And who are you?

416
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,713
- Go ahead, Lola.

417
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,909
- Er... well...

418
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,429
I'm sure you will believe us.

419
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,189
We fell out of our painting
and we are looking for the painter.

420
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,709
- Odd, that he left you like that.

421
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,337
I thought he always
finished his works...

422
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:20,753
to the least detail.

423
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,996
Take my dress, for example.

424
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,317
- But you're naked!

425
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,239
- Oh yes, it's true!
What was I thinking?

426
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,280
- I think we woke...

427
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,959
Orange of Mars.

428
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,752
- Hey, there!
Did you come play with me?

429
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,110
- We're looking for the painter.
- And you don't know...

430
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,197
where he is... what he looks like..

431
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,197
Is he tall? Short?...

432
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,039
If you meet him,
you won't even know it...

433
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,275
because you...

434
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,879
don't know him at all!

435
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,435
- And you, young man,
do you know him?

436
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,029
- Young man?
I am a Harlequin.

437
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,437
And the painter, I know him well.
He is not far.

438
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,631
Yes, yes. Behind you, on the easel.

439
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,874
- It's him?
- It's the painter?

440
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,157
- No, unfortunately.
It's just a self-portrait.

441
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,398
- Are you happy now?

442
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,875
You woke everyone up.

443
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,672
Where do you think you are?
A train station?

444
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,155
- We're in the painter's studio.

445
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,554
We are sorry to have...

446
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,194
bothered you.
- He abandoned you, eh?

447
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,358
I'm not surprised. He is
arrogant and contemptuous!

448
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,357
And you, you chase after him

449
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,028
like a bunch of idiots!
- Why are you saying...

450
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,990
that?

451
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,918
- Are you upset with us?

452
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,476
- I'm always upset!
I can't help it.

453
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,389
Don't expect me to ever be happy.
I just can't.

454
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,956
True, when He painted me,
he was in a good mood.

455
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,509
And so were I, consequently.

456
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,439
And then, I don't know
what happened to him.

457
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,119
Or rather, I know it well.

458
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,993
You don't know what
she has made us go through!

459
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,158
Look at her.
Madame is still in love!

460
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,352
You will notice the way
she looks at me.

461
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,075
- Hold on! I know full well
you're not the painter!

462
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,635
- They can't see themselves
in painting.

463
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,956
- I don't look like him.
- Not true, you're his...

464
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,596
spitting image!
- We have to find him!

465
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,028
- I hate him.

466
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,277
Meaning I hate myself, too, in a way.

467
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,914
If only you knew how painful it is
to have feelings...

468
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,872
not your own!!

469
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,355
I just want to be myself, that's all.

470
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,752
It's not too much to ask!

471
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,670
- Oh, you are so pretty!

472
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,632
He must have been pleased!

473
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,558
- Heu... I'm not sure...

474
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,228
- You forgot?
Come here, Lola.

475
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,996
Me, I could never forget him.

476
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,120
He was please with me, too, you know.

477
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,915
He loved me! He didn't say it but,
I could feel it.

478
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,235
One day, he...

479
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,476
soaked his brush in his coffee,

480
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,148
and drank from the
flake of castor oil!

481
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,795
He didn't even realize it!

482
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,473
I wasn't afraid.

483
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,193
His look was sweet.

484
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,153
First, he outlined me with
vigorous strokes.

485
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,432
Then he chose the colors of my eyes

486
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,029
my skin, my hair...

487
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,073
without neglecting the least detail
of my body.

488
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,716
Then he adorned me with
fine lace lingerie.

489
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,354
And to finish, an admirable dress.

490
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,358
The painter sure had style, I tell you!

491
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,676
- What happened to your dress?

492
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,156
- I thought he was done.
But then...

493
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,160
one day,
he picked up his paintbrushes,

494
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,558
and removed one after the other
all my clothes.

495
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,715
- Oh! Là, là!

496
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,751
And you said nothing?
- No.

497
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,757
It was a pleasant sensation.

498
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,110
- You're very beautiful this way.

499
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,639
- Oh yes? You think?

500
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,829
- I would like to...

501
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,952
meet him.
Where did he go? You should know.

502
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,799
- Maybe he returned to Venice.
Venice was for him...

503
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,230
a real passion.

504
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,876
- Venice is another woman?
- Venice is a city!

505
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,513
A dream.

506
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,793
Men love women, Lola. But
they love their dreams even better.

507
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,592
- And how do we get there?

508
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,631
- Easy.

509
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,876
- Oh no!

510
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,990
Lola!

511
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,113
Where are you going?

512
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,839
- Wait for us!

513
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,478
- Plume? Are you there?

514
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,193
- Yes, as you can well see!

515
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,789
- No. I see nothing.

516
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,871
- The paint..paint...

517
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,718
The painting!

518
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,155
- Who could have...

519
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,190
done this?

520
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,628
- Him, of course!

521
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,319
The painter!

522
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,637
- He can destroy us?

523
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,797
- At least, this means,

524
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,956
he really exists.

525
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,232
- Lola has gone to find him.
Quick, we must warn them!

526
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,275
- Oops!

527
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,754
I am out of breath.

528
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,518
- You dance like that

529
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,869
all day?

530
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,675
- Yes. Tomorrow, we start again.
Every day the same.

531
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,269
It's not funny, but that's how it is.
It's the carnival.

532
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,993
You're not from here!

533
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,350
- Hey!
What are you doing?

534
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,391
- You're not the painter.

535
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,795
- What do you mean I am not the painter?
And that, what is that then?

536
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,958
- Dead paint.
- Dead paint!

537
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,674
Why you little...
wait till I...

538
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,350
- You don't look like him.
He is way more handsome.

539
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,269
Impudent child! You know
nothing. Everyone

540
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,631
wears a mask here.
It's required.

541
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,955
- I didn't know that.

542
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,310
- You don't seem to know much.

543
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,589
- Take it off then,

544
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,789
your mask.

545
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,038
- Hey! No! Wait!

546
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,231
Don't leave!

547
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,672
- Look at this crowd?

548
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,517
We'll never find them!

549
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,109
- Nonsense!
They must be warned!

550
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,390
- Maybe he already erased them...

551
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,750
- Hey, you!

552
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,474
What have you all got
against this painting?

553
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,113
- Is it your work?

554
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,993
- I could have finished it,
but she vanished.

555
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,351
A real beauty.
But I couldn't make her stay!

556
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,630
You like paintings?

557
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,354
- It's unfinished.
- I'll give you a discount.

558
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,039
I can do even better.

559
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,232
As a rule, I don't paint from memory.

560
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,591
But you'll soon see...
It'll be done quickly.

561
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,314
I'm not so bad with colors,
if I dare say so.

562
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,717
It's capturing motions that
gives me trouble.

563
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,638
- And this girl, where is she?

564
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,637
- Gone.
Vanished, I told you!

565
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,276
So, don't you want it?

566
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,713
Oh well, too bad!

567
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,515
I'm giving up painting.
People just won't stop moving!

568
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,279
- Ramo!

569
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,953
- Well, mr. Grey,

570
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,549
how is she behaving?

571
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,320
- She cries, she calls for him.

572
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,990
Her cries are painful to hear,
Grand Chandelier.

573
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,112
- Of course, Mr. Grey!
Of course.

574
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,074
They say love is blind
though it can hear.

575
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,234
Ramo will soon re-appear.

576
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,034
Prepare our little ceremony.

577
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,994
- Lola!

578
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,474
- Follow me!

579
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,352
The painter!
He is over there!

580
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,676
- Don't go there!
It's dangerous!

581
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,069
- What?

582
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,713
I can't hear you!

583
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,510
- Follow...

584
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,994
that gondola.

585
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,636
Where are...

586
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,909
you...

587
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,793
- Here we are, miss.

588
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,356
There is your painter.

589
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,629
- Oh, no!

590
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,669
Look,

591
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,950
there are at least 350!

592
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,676
- They come here every evening,
for the sunset.

593
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,513
- No!

594
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,632
I don't believe you.
He couldn't have done that!

595
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,389
- It's true. There were
dozens of them, ripped open, burnt...

596
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,999
- Cut up!

597
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,792
- It's not possible!

598
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,908
Look how beautiful this is!

599
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,236
The sun descending into the sea,

600
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,998
green reflection on red water.

601
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,236
- A sunset, it's tasteless.

602
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,908
He should stop painting rubbish.

603
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,588
- It's not rubbish!
It's called feelings!

604
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,109
When he is sad, he paints sadness.

605
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,788
And when he is in love,
he paints Garance.

606
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,675
Even if it's not her he is in love with,
he still paints Garance.

607
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,429
- Then he cuts her up in pieces.
- I have no desire to meet him.

608
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,949
- Anyway, you won't
meet him any time soon.

609
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,276
- Why?
- The painter is not here.

610
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,311
We are in one of his paintings.

611
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,398
He can't be inside and outside
of his paintings at the same time.

612
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,953
- What about them?

613
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,072
- Imitators who paint
what he painted.

614
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,554
- I don't get it.

615
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,752
- Let me tell you something:
We don't need him.

616
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,354
Hmm, where did I put it?

617
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,199
- Oh! My dress!

618
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,551
- Look at that! You've
been sitting on my idea!

619
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,594
- What is it?
- Paint? So what?

620
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,674
- Oh, yes!
You think we could?

621
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,111
- We need some more.
A little practice and then...

622
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,552
- Say, will it pain you to
complete your sentences?

623
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,870
- Bah!

624
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,633
You've got some nerve!

625
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,070
- Well, well, here are
our friends again!

626
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,113
- Who gave you permission to enter
my home? Get out!

627
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,514
What is this...

628
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,597
horror?

629
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,677
- Yellow.
Plenty of it on my dress.

630
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,235
You should fix that.
It's awful.

631
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,078
- Ah, that's clever!

632
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,276
- There we go!
- Magnificent!

633
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,799
- You think?

634
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,274
- You can paint!

635
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,278
- It's funny,
I've never tried it before!

636
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,959
Yes, it's not so bad!

637
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,071
- You're no longer upset then?
- I still am, alas.

638
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,477
It's in my nature.
Even though I'd like to help you.

639
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,797
- Teach us how to paint!
- Yes! If you have his bad mood,

640
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,558
maybe you also have his talent!

641
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,557
- To complete his work?

642
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,637
It won't displease me.

643
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,071
I need more colors. Orange,
red ochers,

644
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,998
- There are some on the table.

645
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,873
- Indigo...
- On top of the piano.

646
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,310
- Veronese.
- In the opened drawer.

647
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,233
- No! You first, Plume.

648
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,589
- No!

649
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,438
I can wait.

650
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,551
Him first.

651
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,633
- Oh!

652
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,471
- What will I do...

653
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,511
with this doodle?

654
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,995
- Doodle?
He is my friend!

655
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,350
- What was he like, your friend?

656
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,788
- He was...

657
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,355
very kind!

658
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,993
- To paint...

659
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,873
kindness!
How will you do it?

660
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,478
- He... was a little plump.

661
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,551
Yes, but not like that.

662
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,754
No flabbiness.

663
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,035
Yes, that's it..

664
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,876
Delicate, sensitive.

665
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,593
A good guy, you know!

666
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,708
- What am I doing here?

667
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,592
- Plume!
- Dear old pal,

668
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,593
you've come back from afar!

669
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,798
- Silouet, have you got news?
Why...

670
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,194
all those noises?

671
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,198
- The Toupins are cooking up
something.

672
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,355
They caught...

673
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,074
all the Reufs and make them work.

674
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,551
- These Reufs are incompetent.

675
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,069
It's like they're doing it on purpose.

676
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,075
- Get out of there,

677
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,030
you!

678
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,275
We need able bodies.
Pafinis or Reufs,

679
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,675
all the same!
- Out!

680
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,356
- Faster!
You, too!

681
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,870
- We'll stay under the trees,
to the right of the camp.

682
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,277
- You come with us, Magenta.

683
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,315
- Wait. I have an idea.

684
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,999
- Come on! Hurry up!

685
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,229
- Go on ahead.
We'll join you later.

686
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,478
- There we go again!

687
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,036
- I'll see if the way is clear.

688
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,514
Wait for me here.

689
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,632
And don't touch anything
before I come back.

690
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,430
- Toupin!

691
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,119
Are you looking for Claire?

692
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,596
- What happened?
Where are they? Where is she?

693
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,677
- Come, I'll show you.

694
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,069
- I understand.
Count on me.

695
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,636
Don't forget anyone!

696
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,236
- Ramo? Is it you?

697
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,555
- Oh, my poor love!
- Where were you?

698
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,910
- Far, far away.
No more worry.

699
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,270
Everything will be all right now.

700
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,353
- Ramo! No!

701
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,110
Stop!

702
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,231
Don't hurt him!

703
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,875
Let go off him!
You have no right!

704
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,314
- Come on, advance!
There they are.

705
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,675
- But it's...
Plume and Gom!

706
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,233
- No, it's not them!

707
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,953
- Yes, look!

708
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,469
- Unbelievable!
- They are magnificent!

709
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,672
- It's not possible!
Are you sure it's them?

710
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,472
- Come closer.

711
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,639
You have here everything you need.

712
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,308
All the colors, all the brushes.

713
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,717
And most of all, the freedom
to paint yourselves!!

714
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,276
Take a pastel tone,
a lively tone, or a bleaker tone...

715
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,075
Look at me. I am sure
you don't recognize me!

716
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,670
- It's true he has changed a lot.
- He speaks well, now!

717
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,313
- I'll show you.

718
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,318
There. You need
good strokes and dexterity.

719
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,556
Follow the curves,

720
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,193
like this.

721
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,958
You see, it's not that hard.

722
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,515
- Yes, but I don't want this color.

723
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,597
- You don't like it? It's pretty!

724
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,394
- Gimme that!
- Do it yourself then, but...

725
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,319
- You said we could paint!
- Like that?

726
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,115
- Calm down!

727
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,753
There is enough for everyone.

728
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,632
- It's very beautiful.

729
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,195
- Mommy, I want purple!

730
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,550
Why is there no purple?

731
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,558
- Let go off me!

732
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,159
Let go!

733
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,758
- There you are, finally!

734
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,793
- Look at them. What a mess!
- A rotten mess!

735
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,428
- Sorry.

736
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,278
We did what we could.

737
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,955
- Oh, there you are!
- Please don't bother.

738
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,673
- What is the program?

739
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,757
- How are you doing, dear friend?

740
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,755
- He loves mysteries.

741
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,597
- I hope we'll have fun.

742
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,869
- I'm here!

743
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,312
- They are so young!

744
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,510
- Here are our young pigeons,
reunited, as they desired.

745
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,358
Aren't they cute?

746
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,037
But what am I seeing?
They don't look happy!

747
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,510
Look how pale they are!

748
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,517
They say nothing anymore.

749
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,678
So, young man?
Where are your fine speeches?

750
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,395
Has the painter returned?
Did you meet him?

751
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,478
Will he, according to your wishes...

752
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,190
What has he said already?

753
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,310
Ah yes!

754
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,875
Abolish differences.

755
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,593
To abolish differences!

756
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,677
You couldn't ask for anything more!

757
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,872
We shall no more be distinguished
one from the other!

758
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:33,910
Executioner,

759
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,154
black execution!

760
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,792
- Look at those colors!

761
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,797
- It's wonderful.

762
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,592
- Who are they?
- Toupins?

763
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,599
- Let's go take a closer look.

764
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,268
- It's absolutely magnificent!

765
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,434
- Fresher,

766
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,198
more Parisian.

767
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,391
- Don't talk to them!

768
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,953
I forbid you!

769
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,116
- A lot of colors are available.

770
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,880
- My dear, you are gorgeous.

771
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,308
- Change yourself!

772
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,351
- Your colors are glistening.

773
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,915
- We have paintbrushes, colors...

774
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,315
- Change the Great Chandelier, too!

775
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,593
- Bring up the colors!

776
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,438
- He is running away!

777
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,030
- Yes, yes, of course. There are
other paintings.

778
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,119
- We can go from one to another
without difficulty.

779
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,191
Well, almost. There are some
differences in colors.

780
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,517
Some paintings are greener,
some redder...

781
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,154
- Don't make a drama out of it!

782
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,308
- So, Lola?

783
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,999
How do you find me?

784
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,834
But... Your dress!

785
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,315
You can't stay that way!

786
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,157
- We can even abandon
ourselves to frenzied

787
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,074
farandoles (farandole=a
lively French dance)

788
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,272
- Exactly! Just ask Lola.

789
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,833
Heh, Lola?

790
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,109
- No.

791
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,354
You.

792
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,032
- Come on, Miro. Quiet!

793
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,798
Don't be afraid, he won't bite.

794
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,036
He can't see clearly anymore.

795
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,396
Say, I know you.

796
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,669
You left...

797
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,552
your painting!

798
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,796
- Yes. Are you angry?

799
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,110
And I'm not the only one, you know.

800
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,038
But rest assured, they won't...

801
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,593
bother you.

802
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,519
They are busy painting...

803
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,119
The Pafinis, The Reufs...

804
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,878
- Painting?

805
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,640
But who taught you to paint?

806
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,593
- Your self-portrait.
- Oh no, not him!

807
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,995
He came out, too?

808
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,155
- No, no.

809
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,918
He is sleeping again.

810
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,439
You know, back in our painting,

811
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,552
people thought you abandoned them.

812
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,958
- Abandoned?

813
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,034
What are you saying?

814
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,830
I didn't abandon them,

815
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,390
I gave them the basic essentials.

816
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,959
A simple drawing...

817
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,550
can be more beautiful than
an elaborate painting.

818
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,795
So, they completed themselves, eh?

819
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,998
Well, it's all right then!

820
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,113
It's all very good!

821
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,195
But you?

822
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,118
You are not like the others.

823
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,629
Why did you come here?

824
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,918
- You still paint?

825
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,476
- Yes, but only landscapes.
It's less tiring.

826
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,593
- What do you think?

827
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,994
- I like it.

828
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,997
The clouds look like they're dancing.

829
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,673
Can I take a walk...

830
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,359
in your garden?

831
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,870
- You can go anywhere you want.
There is no barrier.

832
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,596
You can even go to the sea.
Over that way,

833
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,234
on the other side of the dunes.

834
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,389
But you didn't answer my question.

835
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,352
What did you want?

836
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,356
- Oh, nothing!

837
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,949
I just wanted to meet you,
that's all.

838
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,559
And now...

839
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,955
- And now what?

840
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,878
- I'd love to know who painted you!
