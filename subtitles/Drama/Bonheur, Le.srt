580
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:15,341
<i>Father's Day, My son wiping the saliva 
that escapes my closed lips.</i>

581
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:19,785
<i>We have never before fitted this made-up 
holiday into our emotional calendar.</i>

582
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:27,822
[singing]

583
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,860
 

584
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,420
 

585
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:37,860
Claude says the book's going well,
I can't believe you're writing it.

586
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,862
I still think you're the most surprising man I've ever known. 

587
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,298
Have you had lots of visitors?

588
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,418
Laurent, Anne-Marie...

589
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:53,941
...Michel...

590
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:58,139
That's it?  She hasn't?

591
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:04,660
I thought she was supposed to be madly in love with you.
Well, that's her business. 

592
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:13,495
Shall we practice that alphabet?

593
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:01,379
When I began a diet a week before my stroke 

594
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:07,059
...I never dreamed of such dramatic results.

595
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:17,496
Now they know what it's like to have a 
zombie for a father. Thank you.

596
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:18,856
That's not amusing.

597
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:20,625
Kids.

598
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:24,345
You want to play Hangman, dad?

599
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:28,702
I'll help you, Whisper a word.

600
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:34,505
The first letter is a C, the last an E.
The word has 7 letters.

601
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:22,982
The kangaroo jumped the wall.

602
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:25,621
The wall of the zoo.

603
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:30,662
My God, it was high.

604
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:36,021
My God, it was beautiful.

605
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:39,896
That's it.
- Say goodbye to your dad, kids. We're leaving.

606
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:41,381
Bye, dad.

607
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:44,462
Bye, dad.

608
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:55,824
Bye dad, See you next week.

609
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:25,620
<i>It's hard to describe my grief.</i>

610
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>I'm their father, but I can't touch them, 
run my fingers through their hair...</i>

611
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:36,262
<i>...and hug them tight.</i>

612
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:41,825
<i>But I like to see them play and laugh.</i>

613
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:46,499
<i>That's what I call a wonderful day.</i>

614
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:53,586
<i>I feel sorry for myself, don't you think?</i>

615
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,179
You were genuinely happy. 

616
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,781
<i>You think so?</i>

617
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>Perhaps.</i>

618
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:12,620
<i>I don't want to miss this,
Step aside!</i>

619
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:22,537
<i>Enjoy. See you.
- Yeah, see you, What are you doing??</i>

620
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:33,501
<i>Finish the TV-Meal,
or shall I go out for dinner?</i>

621
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:39,746
<i>I will treat myself to a feast at Le Duc.</i>

622
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:54,139
What a coincidence to find you here. 
- Isn't that amazing?

623
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:56,144
An oyster?

624
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:39,826
It seems like it was just yesterday 
when I first heard your name.

625
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:00,335
Sweet.

626
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:05,665
No compliments.

627
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,899
And the next chapter?

628
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:14,497
<i>Sunday, I dread Sunday.</i>

629
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:20,103
<i>When they turn the TV on,
they have to make sure they're doing it right.</i>

630
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:22,138
<i>That is very strategic.</i>

631
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:28,626
<i>It can take hours until the next good samaritan comes by.</i>

632
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,896
<i>Horrible, these Sundays.
No speech therapists, no psychotherapist.</i>

633
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:37,419
<i>No physiotherapist, no visitors.
A skeleton staff.</i>

634
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,902
<i>Sunday is a long stretch of desert.</i>

635
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:44,942
<i>But today, Marie nobly suggests she takes me to mass.</i>

636
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:50,016
<i>I have tried to explain to her that I am not 
a religious man, but without avail.</i>

637
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:54,857
<i>All over the world people are praying for me.
Top of the list is my daughter, Céleste.</i>

638
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:57,660
<i>And Marie, of course.</i>

639
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,857
<i>The most diverse deities have been enlisted to help me.</i>

640
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,339
<i>In Nepal, I'm told, they chant a mantra for me.</i>

641
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:11,617
<i>In Cameroon a holy man has procured 
for me the goodwill of Africa's gods.</i>

642
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:14,338
<i>I have assigned him my right eye.</i>

643
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:20,103
<i>I can't deny that I have attempted to 
organise this vast spiritual energy...</i>

644
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:22,184
<i>...to support my existence.</i>

645
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:27,700
<i>It may not be admirable, it may even be 
a touch hypocritical, but I'll try anything.</i>

646
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,058
I'm very pleased to see you here.

647
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:43,737
I came to visit you a few days ago, I brought 
the Blessed Sacrament to give you Communion. 

648
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,585
But you were asleep.

649
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,456
<i>Yes, he was asleep.
- What?</i>

650
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,739
<i>Would you like me to give you Holy Communion now? 
- No.</i>

651
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,459
Yes.
- Would you like me to say a blessing over you? 

652
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,623
<i>No.
- Yes.</i>

653
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,062
Heavenly Father, have mercy on Jean-Dominique, 
who is cruelly afflicted.

654
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:09,456
Help his body to heal, keep his spirits buoyant,

655
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,306
<i>and help him to find faith.
- My spirit is very buoyant, mister.</i>

656
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:16,022
<i>In the name of the father...
- You made a fool of me.</i>

657
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:30,576
Fa?

658
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:35,901
Father?

659
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,226
There are...

660
00:10:57,427 --> 00:11:02,626
<i>Father, there are monks in Bordeaux who 
regularly dedicate their prayers to me.</i>

661
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:05,421
...who regularly dedicate their prayers to me.

662
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:10,664
<i>Do they, that's good.
- But the results have been unremarkable.</i>

663
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:14,542
<i>We must be patient.
- Yes, the doctors say that too.</i>

664
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,705
But Jean-Dominque, I want to suggest something to you

665
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:21,297
In a few weeks time, I shall be 
leading a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

666
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:22,462
<i>Lourdes?</i>

667
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,625
Dear Beatrice and I thought you 
might want to be part of it.

668
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,102
<i>This is a trap.
- There have been some miraculous cures.</i>

669
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:31,105
That's true.
<i>- I've been to Lourdes.</i>

670
00:11:56,627 --> 00:12:00,381
Let's stop and return.
- I am not turning back.

671
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,737
It's my car, I'll drive where I like.

672
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,939
You said you wanted a dirty weekend.
- I never said that.

673
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:10,459
Yes you did, Lourdes is not the right place for a dirty week-end.

674
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,022
You've got a one-track mind.

675
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,303
I want to see the Madonna.

676
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:23,739
I don't believe in any of this.
- I want to see her and drink holy water.

677
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,539
Spare me this.

678
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:30,539
You should do that too.
It will be good for you.

679
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,424
Impressive, right?

680
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,261
I'll buy some bottles for the holy water.

681
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:12,059
That's it for me, I'm leaving.
- Stay, It could do you a lot of good.

682
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,464
Don't be so sure, it might be dangerous.

683
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:20,502
What if someone in perfect health happened to be here when 
the Madonna appeared? One miracle, and he'd end up paralyzed.

684
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:22,186
You are terrible.

685
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:25,423
Hello.
- Good day, madam.

686
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,300
Look! Here's my Madonna! 

687
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:35,901
Forget it.
- Yeah, then get out of my life.

688
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:40,179
Okay, I'll give it to you as a present.

689
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:46,297
Madame has a wonderful eye.
That piece is unique, it has blessed by the Cardinal.

690
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:49,544
Do we have more 318's?
- Look in the storage.

691
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:53,023
How much is that?
-1899 franc (£217).

692
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:54,455
 

693
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:02,016
Don't we know each other?
- I don't think so, Mister.

694
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,299
I don't have change.

695
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:12,984
I can't make love to you with her looking at me.
- I understand.

696
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:17,939
I wasn't stating a fact, I was making a complaint.
Let me turn her off.

697
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,416
No.

698
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:26,700
The only one in the whole world
Blessed by the Cardinal.

699
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:33,345
Josephine, when we get back to Paris 
we're going to have to split up.

700
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:38,541
Because of her? 
- No, Because of everything. 

701
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:43,459
Ok, you're right.

702
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:59,336
Im going out again.
- Turn off the lights.

703
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:03,458
But not my Madonna.

704
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,345
La - la - la - , Come on, Jean-Do.

705
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:43,582
If you learn the L sound you'll learn to swallow. 

706
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:45,982
And you'll learn to say Lourdes.

707
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,225
Is that okay? Is it comfortable?

708
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,695
<i>'The Pressure Cooker' could be the title of the piece...</i>

709
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:20,183
<i>...I'm writing about my experiences here.</i>

710
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:23,936
<i>I could also call it 'The Eye' or 'The Diving Bell'.</i>

711
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,661
<i>Plot and location are well known.</i>

712
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:30,496
<i>In a hospital room, there's Mr. L,
at the climax of his life...</i>

713
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:36,259
<i>...trying to live with locked-in syndrome 
after a serious stroke.</i>

714
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:41,018
<i>Ambitious and somewhat cynical,
because he didn't know failures before...</i>

715
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,663
<i>...becomes acquainted with misfortune.</i>

716
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:48,143
<i>We can show his transformation,
whilst listining to a commentarial voice...</i>

717
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,941
<i>...which tells the inner monologue of Mr. L.</i>

718
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:54,139
<i>I already have the last scene.
It's night.</i>

719
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:57,259
<i>Mr L, who was paralysed since 
the beginning of the piece...</i>

720
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:02,666
<i>...suddenly jumps out of his bed
and runs over the darkly lit stage.</i>

721
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:08,419
<i>Then it gets dark again and we hear
Mr L's commentarial voice:</i>

722
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:10,060
<i>Fuck, it was a dream.</i>

723
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,939
Stand up, I can stand up.

724
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:44,103
Everything is alright.

725
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:27,058
'I want to remember how all this happened 
to me.'

726
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,985
Shall I ask someone?

727
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,056
No?

728
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,985
<i>Hello, room 119.
- Who's that?</i>

729
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:53,063
I'm Claude Mendibil.
I'm sitting with Jean-Do.

730
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:57,738
<i>This is his father speaking.
- Yes, we were expecting your call.</i>

731
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:04,540
So what do I do? Just talk? 

732
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:08,858
<i>Jean-Do can hear you.
He will answer you.</i>

733
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:14,499
<i>You'll hear me saying the alphabet and...
- Yes, Céline told me.</i>

734
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:20,898
<i>Just talk, Mister Bauby.</i>

735
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,705
Can he hear me? 

736
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:28,063
Jean-Dominique? This is Papinou.

737
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:34,582
<i>I'm sitting at the open window.</i>

738
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:40,377
<i>How are you or is that a foolish question??</i>

739
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,018
Yes, it's a foolish question.

740
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,339
I miss you.

741
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,659
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

742
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:23,061
God Almighty! This is an impossible way to 
conduct a conversation.

743
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:28,022
Everything goes out of my mind.
No, no, I've remembered.

744
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:34,141
<i>I'm sending you a present.
It's a surprise.</i>

745
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,060
<i>I had a thought...</i>

746
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:45,346
...about us. We're in the same boat.

747
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:53,022
I'm stuck in this apartment.
I can't get up and down the stairs.

748
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:58,301
<i>You try four flights of stairs 
when you're ninety-two years old.</i>

749
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:03,942
<i>we're both locked-in cases.</i>

750
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:09,062
<i>You in your body and me in my apartment.</i>

751
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,656
Jean-Dominique, remember...

752
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:17,021
...in the top right-hand drawer of my 
writing desk there's a letter...

753
00:22:17,187 --> 00:22:23,023
In it are my last wishes. It's in a file...

754
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,616
,,,marked 'Miscellaneous'.

755
00:22:35,307 --> 00:22:37,298
<i>I must stop now.</i>

756
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:55,380
Don't cry.
- That's easy to say.

757
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,465
You're my son for Christ's sake.

758
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,618
Good-bye, Jean-Dominique.

759
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:06,184
I forgot, it's almost your birthday.

760
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,345
<i>I'll call again.</i>

761
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:13,018
<i>Happy Birthday.</i>

762
00:23:55,907 --> 00:24:01,584
<i>It can't be easy for a father to speak 
to a son who he knows will never reply.</i>

763
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,584
I thought an outing with a new vista would do you good.

764
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:28,942
I have another surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

765
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,104
Close your eyes.

766
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,858
Okay, now open them.

767
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,585
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

768
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:46,826
<i>That was not necessary.
In two volumes.</i>

769
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,542
It's not a first edition, but it's pretty old.

770
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:57,537
Would you like me to read something to you? 
Which chapter?

771
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:03,298
<i>We should use Roman digits.
We didn't think of Roman digits.</i>

772
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,941
<i>What would it be in Roman digits?</i>

773
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:09,856
<i>That's L, I, X.</i>

774
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:14,183
<i>That's faster. Next time.</i>

775
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:18,137
<i>50? Higher?
- Yes, higher.</i>

776
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,418
Nine? 59? Ok.

777
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:26,221
Ok, there we go.

778
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:30,500
<i>There's even an illustration.
The coincidence frightens me.</i>

779
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,661
'They sat down beside him.'

780
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:39,781
<i>'Noirtier was sitting in a wheelchair where 
they put him from morning till evening...</i>

781
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:44,020
<i>...in front of a mirror which allowed 
him to see the whole apartment...</i>

782
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:48,015
<i>without attempting any movement: this was something 
that had become impossible for him.</i>

783
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:52,105
<i>Sight and hearing were the only two senses...</i>

784
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:56,425
<i>...which, like two sparks,
still lit up this human matter...'</i>

785
00:25:57,187 --> 00:26:00,065
'...this human matter.'

786
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:03,940
<i>That's me, don't you think?</i>

787
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:06,978
<i>But no.
- But yes.</i>

788
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:10,304
<i>I frighten people, make them shudder.</i>

789
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:15,899
<i>You don't.
- I should have stayed away from Dumas.</i>

790
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,941
<i>Don't tamper with a masterpiece.
That's the lesson.</i>

791
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:25,063
<i>I didn't know Noirtier was the man 
I was going to become.</i>

792
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:30,461
<i>My diving bell has dragged you down 
to the bottom of the sea with me.</i>

793
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:36,219
Jean-Do, I don't find it so bad that you 
drag me down to the bottom of the sea...

794
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:39,021
...because you are also my butterfly.

795
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,941
<i>That's a declaration of love.</i>

796
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:47,301
<i>After we finish this book...</i>

797
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:51,022
<i>...we'll write another one about 
a long-distance runner.</i>

798
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:53,457
<i> You never know. Perhaps I'll become like him.</i>

799
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:58,581
'I missed you at the bullfight.

800
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:02,063
I hope we meet again next year.
Jean-Paul.'

801
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,502
Le Tango, Nîmes.

802
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:20,306
'Dear Mr Bauby, the customized campmobile...

803
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:27,504
...can be delivered six to eight 
weeks after your order.

804
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:30,858
Yours sincerely, Henri Raynaud.'
That's good news.

805
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:35,778
This is from Papinou.

806
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,744
'This is a present.'

807
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:50,505
Look, a photo of you as a kid.

808
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,981
Jean-Do, aged eight, Berck on sea.

809
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:00,826
From Anne-Marie.

810
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:08,576
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby's room.
- Who are you? </i>

811
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,857
Céline Desmoulins. And you?

812
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:16,223
<i>Inès. I want to speak with Jean-Do.</i>

813
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,175
One moment.

814
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:25,419
I turned the speaker on, so he can hear you.

815
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:28,937
<i>I can't speak with you there.</i>

816
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:33,106
You have to, there's no one else.

817
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:35,940
<i>Isn't the therapist there?
- No, she's not here today.</i>

818
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:45,816
<i>Darling?</i>

819
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:53,741
<i>I know I said I'd come but I got as far as 
the train station and then turned back.</i>

820
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:56,340
<i>I just can't.</i>

821
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,497
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

822
00:29:03,587 --> 00:29:05,305
<i>Céline?
- Yes.</i>

823
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:11,144
<i>Can't you just go out for a moment?
I have personal things to say.</i>

824
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:13,815
<i>I feel embarrassed.
- I can't leave him.</i>

825
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:17,781
There's nobody else.
Wait, he wants to say something.

826
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:22,386
O?

827
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:27,821
One?

828
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:37,983
One minute?

829
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:40,860
I'm leaving. But not for long.

830
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:50,224
<i>Jean-Do, are you alone now?</i>

831
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,101
<i>Darling...</i>

832
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,463
<i>I love you more than ever.</i>

833
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,425
<i>I want to see you but I haven't the courage.</i>

834
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,542
<i>I want to think of you as you were.</i>

835
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,540
<i>I hope you'll recover.</i>

836
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,703
<i>I miss you.</i>

837
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:20,459
<i>I miss you and I feel so alone.</i>

838
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,257
<i>I know you understand.</i>

839
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:29,696
<i>You're in my thoughts all the time.</i>

840
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:40,096
<i>I know your family is always with you.</i>

841
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,978
<i>Do you want me to come?</i>

842
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:50,781
<i>I'm back.
- Do you want me to come?</i>

843
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:55,265
<i>Do you want me to come?
- I'm back, Inès.</i>

844
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,106
Every...

845
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:46,183
Every day.

846
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:04,379
Every day I'm...

847
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,942
Every day I'm waiting for you.

848
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:30,582
<i>I can't understand you. Could you repeat that?</i>

849
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:33,105
<i>I can't understand you.</i>

850
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,061
He said: I'm waiting for you every day.

851
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:48,581
If I don't get a seat on this plane.
I will miss my connection to Hong-Kong.

852
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:54,626
Take mine.

853
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:58,019
I'll take the next flight.
- Thank you.

854
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,220
Have a good trip.

855
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:08,258
But you're not going to Hong-Kong 
you are going to Beirut.

856
00:34:20,747 --> 00:34:23,466
Anything wrong? You don't feel good?

857
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,182
Don't worry.

858
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:39,345
<i>Most times I forget my dreams.
People who tell you their dreams are tiresome.</i>

859
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,903
<i>But this one comes again and again.
I don't know why.</i>

860
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:46,505
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

861
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:51,222
<i>The feeling of doom wouldn't leave.</i>

862
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:55,466
<i>It took what I can only describe as 
a miracle to lift my spirits.</i>

863
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:02,622
<i>It's dangerous to believe in personal miracles. 
They tend to make one feel self-important.</i>

864
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:08,106
<i>Nevertheless, I must report that I believe 
something miraculous did occur.</i>

865
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:11,461
<i>I began to sing.</i>

866
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:15,745
<i>I grunt, I sing.</i>

867
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,786
<i>My hearing isn't great and sometimes 
I think I hear my heart beating.</i>

868
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:24,297
<i>But I tell myself it's the sound 
of butterfly's wings.</i>

869
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:29,018
<i>Yes, I am making indomitable progress and 
I may even have butterfly hearing.</i>

870
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,902
<i>I can look forward to the future. 
Soon the summer will come to an end...</i>

871
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:35,905
<i>...and I will begin my first 
autumn in this hospital.</i>

872
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,386
<i>My life is here.</i>

873
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,059
<i>An everlasting repetition.</i>

874
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:44,866
<i>Here.</i>

875
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,704
How goes it?

876
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:50,542
He's speaking!

877
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:54,305
You're speaking.
- He can sing a song, too.

878
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:59,304
Come on, sing for Laurent.
- Please, for me.

879
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:10,905
<i>'The kangaroo jumped the wall, 
the wall of the zoo.</i>

880
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:15,581
<i>My God it was high,
My God it was beautiful.'</i>

881
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,298
Are you ok?

882
00:36:19,507 --> 00:36:22,021
Is he singing?
- No, he isn't.

883
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,306
<i>I have pneumonia.</i>

884
00:36:45,227 --> 00:36:47,377
<i>Just when I thought...</i>

885
00:36:59,947 --> 00:37:06,182
<i>Like a sailor who watches the shore gradually disappear,
I watch my past recede.</i>

886
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:10,264
<i>Becoming ashes of oblivion.</i>

887
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,185
<i>What a comeback.</i>

888
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:33,259
<i>That's where I worked. And that couple, I know them,
but I can't remember their names.</i>

889
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:36,578
<i>That's my car!</i>

890
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:39,143
<i>My new car.</i>

891
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,578
Where is the horn?

892
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:39,259
Let me hug you.
- See my car?

893
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,219
Lovely.

894
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,699
Everything ok, Théo?

895
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:47,978
Had a good week?

896
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:52,943
Are we going to the theatre?
- To the theatre? If you want to.

897
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:56,856
Can we have oysters? 
- Do you like oysters now?

898
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,703
Don't bring him back too late.

899
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:08,058
We are leaving.

900
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,825
Can I get in the front?
- Sure, there's no room in the back. 

901
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,380
Next time only you and I will go.

902
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:26,382
A little bit of wind?

903
00:40:39,627 --> 00:40:43,222
Your team ok?
- Yeah, the players are ok.

904
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:49,536
You take a shower afterwards?
- We shower and wash our stuff.

905
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,422
Got pubic hair around your willy?
- No, not yet.

906
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:59,099
When i was young, We had one guy who didn't want to undress for the shower.

907
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:04,745
They stopped him playing football because of it.
His father wanted to fight the trainer.

908
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:10,377
He didn't do it.
His mother stopped him.

909
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:15,265
In the end, he had to leave the team.

910
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:22,102
You don't have that problem, do you?
-No, I dont have a problem with that.

911
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:25,458
Good, you dont need that.

912
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:29,546
Other news? Everything ok with mum?
- Yeah, she's ok.

913
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:33,376
You know this way?
- Yes, it's the way to Aunt Diane.

914
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:37,097
It's hot, You feel that, too?

915
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:40,617
No, I don't.

916
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:45,746
We have...

917
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,105
We have...

918
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:04,540
It might start to rain, I'll stop for a moment.

919
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:23,416
Dad, what's the matter? 

920
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:16,017
Phone your mother!

921
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:22,383
My last thought was we'll have to cancel 
going to the theatre.

922
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:27,575
We'd be late in any case.
We'll go tomorrow night.

923
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:30,782
And then I sank into a coma.

924
00:44:09,187 --> 00:44:11,303
It is a book? 

925
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:15,303
'THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY'

925
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:24,459
For Théophile, Céleste and Hortense.

926
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:27,824
I wish them lots of butterflies.

927
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,861
And my deepest gratitude to Claude Mendibil.

928
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:38,300
You'll understand that wihout her 
this book couldn't have been written.

929
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:10,580
I was with you the whole time.

930
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:12,381
You know that.

931
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,698
These reviews are terrific! 
You want to hear them? 

932
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:23,065
The man who dictates in silence.
Without gestures or speech.

933
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:28,057
Jean-Dominque Bauby communicates
with an eyelid and writes this book.

934
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:33,421
