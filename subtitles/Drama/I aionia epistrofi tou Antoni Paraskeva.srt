1
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,027
Mother

2
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,118
Have you washed your hair?

3
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,766
Always trying to be Elvis,

4
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,133
Yeah, just fooling around,
don't tease me!

5
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,354
Do you like the kite? Ellen
Take a look! Ellen!

6
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,164
Hey man!

7
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,860
You got the wrong guy,
my husband's innocent!

8
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,830
Frank! Still pissing around?

9
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,831
I'll kill you

10
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,673
Told you to watch out for cops!

11
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,574
And now your dad got arrested!

12
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,469
Mom!

13
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,373
I'm your son!

14
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,290
Dad, quit this sweeping job

15
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,393
When I get a job, you can...

16
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,465
Its destiny, I'm a nobody, its okay

17
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,897
But my son won't be sweeping streets

18
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,171
It's a cruel world, money talks

19
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,908
Without it you're shit!

20
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,670
Remember!
If you get a break, hang on in there!

21
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,227
Workers, joint our strike!

22
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,172
Against oppression, act now
Fight for equality

23
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:36,732
Come on!
Put a few more up here

24
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,217
Here comes prince Charming, no wonder

25
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,257
Ben

26
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,321
Here for Jane
Treat her well, or you'll regret it

27
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,459
Here's an orange to shut you up!

28
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,319
Don't go, don't go

29
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,799
You too! Work okay?

30
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,265
It's okay!

31
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,957
What the hell? It's sour!

32
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,567
Bastard! Get lost!

33
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,832
Hey stop it!

34
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,856
Wash up those glasses! So slow!

35
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,490
Hey! Watch out!

36
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:31,820
Hey! What's up!

37
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,660
Hong Kong sucks!

38
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,663
We'll get nowhere in this place

39
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,968
Must go somewhere

40
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,267
I don't want to be a nobody
for the rest of my life

41
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,569
Wherever you go,

42
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,377
count us in!

43
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,407
Yeah, we're just like windflower

44
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:57,620
Settle down in wherever the wind takes

45
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,850
we're all orphans here

46
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,823
One day, I'll come back in a Mercedes

47
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,427
Let's not wait,
we'll go drive a Mercedes now

48
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,369
Who lose, who treat!

49
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,411
It is a deal!

50
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,314
You'll lose!

51
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,342
You're gonna lose, Paul!

52
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,374
No way, I'm winning!

53
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,408
Don't fall in the sea. Frank!

54
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,677
That's you who will fall

55
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,348
You watch out!

56
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,022
Frank, go get it!

57
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,598
Hang on

58
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,425
Cut the crap, help me up

59
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,569
Punk fell in the gutter...

60
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,833
His girl's gonna cry

61
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,505
His body's so stinky,

62
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,012
she doesn't find it kinky

63
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,545
Smells like ammonia

64
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,187
He's mad that he fell - ah

65
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,687
Gutter smells isn't so swell

66
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,652
The riot is worsening, I'm afraid

67
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,920
I wonder what the future would be like

68
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,697
Let's get married

69
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,656
We're poor. How can we have money
for our wedding?

70
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,434
Poor can marry

71
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,096
No matter what the future would like

72
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,170
Just want to be a bird

73
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,734
And be free to fly around

74
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,976
Go places, see the world

75
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,006
I know there are great
places out there!

76
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,744
I want you to come too

77
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,452
Are you dreaming?

78
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,420
It's not a dream!

79
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,525
It's my ambition!
Many people don't even have that

80
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,512
Pay respect to your in-laws

81
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,517
Ben, mind the knees!

82
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,750
Make room, the bride's here!

83
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,228
Going down, careful

84
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,462
Paul, be careful, mind the shit!

85
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,194
You're great! In this situation...

86
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,561
your wedding is more incredible than
the wedding of third uncle

87
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,228
Don't say that

88
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:01,535
Frank

89
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,003
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:03,903
Is the banquet money okay?

91
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,111
No problem, trust me,
don't worry!

92
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:06,945
Are you sure?

93
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,238
No problem! Get inside

94
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,047
Frank, remember to change
out of the shit

95
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,547
To inside, go on!

96
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,573
Try and get there early!

97
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,560
Cheers!

98
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,529
Cheers!

99
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,032
Thanks for coming,
help yourselves, drink up

100
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:33,904
Take photo

101
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,532
The bride and groom, photo time

102
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:01,861
Mr Kwai, take a seat

103
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,601
Is the money okay?

104
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,560
Your guarantee?

105
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,339
You sure you can repay?

106
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,639
No problem!
I swear with my life!

107
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,747
Right! I trust you

108
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,582
Thanks Mr Kwai

109
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,022
What time is it?

110
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,113
Ten thirty!

111
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:25,723
Thanks!

112
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,798
Frankie baby

113
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,603
Ringo

114
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,135
You're on my turf!

115
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,936
Really? Sorry, sorry man

116
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,734
Let me through, it's important, please

117
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,876
Son of a bitch

118
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,626
Punk

119
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,391
I know you've been to see Kwai

120
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,654
Give me the cash

121
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:06,727
That's enough. Ringo

122
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,697
You've made a fool out of me,

123
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,768
if you want more

124
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,732
We'll fight again one day!

125
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,102
But this money is staying with me!

126
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,709
Shithead, you got no choice

127
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,405
No... You can't

128
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,373
No? Come on

129
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,679
Bastard

130
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,749
Give it back

131
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,724
You bastard

132
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,728
Drink up

133
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,702
Mr Shing, show me how to make a buck

134
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,801
You gotta take risks!

135
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,797
Take my word for it

136
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,972
The more chaos, the easier the cash

137
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,435
Vietnam's at war,
there's no law and order

138
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,139
Smuggling, drugs,

139
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,975
anything goes to make a buck

140
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,910
Lots of millionaires started this way

141
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,046
What's bugging you!

142
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,644
Frank's not here,

143
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,952
hope nothing's wrong!

144
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,990
Don't worry, he's always like this

145
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,035
Thanks for coming

146
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,674
Thank you!

147
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,807
Hey, Frank

148
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:38,754
Here comes Mighty Mouse, Ben, Ben!

149
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,794
You're late, everyone's going!

150
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:43,823
Scared you shitless, Huh?

151
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:44,996
Only if you didn't show up!

152
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,823
You can trust me man

153
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,996
The boss is getting impatient, got it?

154
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,304
Yeah, let's go!

155
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:57,734
Have a drink!

156
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,709
Here's your money, thanks

157
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,301
This drink's been waiting for you

158
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,309
Let's wait for Paul!

159
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,202
Yeah!

160
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,778
Paul!

161
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:02,881
Exactly three thousand
two hundred plus tips

162
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,280
This one's for you!

163
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,818
It's your wedding, drink to the fool

164
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,322
Let's see the bride

165
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,135
Yeah the bride!

166
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:27,967
What happened?

167
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,408
Nothing what?

168
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:38,013
Oh that? Fell in the gutter

169
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,850
I was rushing, fell down!

170
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,017
In a gutter?

171
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:50,787
Yeah, yeah, Punk in the gutter

172
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,430
His girl's gonna cry

173
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,570
You're terrible

174
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,213
Smelly like stale fish

175
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,455
And his girl's gonna fry

176
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,364
Hey, as your pal, can I kiss the bride?

177
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:30,902
Come on,
It's late, move!

178
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,127
No sweat, only her hand, she's safe

179
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,897
He's really coming!

180
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,842
Congratulations, all the best

181
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,304
Don't let him kiss you!

182
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,209
I've asked Ben, he said your hand's okay

183
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,372
Right Ben?

184
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,575
Jane, don't let him!

185
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,015
The bastard!

186
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,414
He cheated, he kissed my face!

187
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,915
Guys, stop that

188
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,927
Shut up! You guys are always the boss

189
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,161
What's this boss crap?

190
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,922
We're all just trying to make a buck

191
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,897
We're buddies right?

192
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,965
And buddies are all equal

193
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,177
Punk, spineless worm, piss off!

194
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,847
You got me arrested,
you only know how to fight

195
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:19,879
Got beaten again

196
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:20,848
Dad, forget it!

197
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,181
Please making a sense!

198
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,055
So what?

199
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:25,848
Bastard!

200
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,982
You good for nothing!

201
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,559
Just piss off, don't come back!
Scram!

202
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,657
Get lost!

203
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,490
I don't care! You're not my son!

204
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,378
It's you? What's the matter?

205
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,121
What happened to your head?

206
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,023
Nothing! I fell in a gutter

207
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,958
It's nothing! Only a bit of blood

208
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,123
I'm used to getting beaten up by mom

209
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,430
Nothing new!

210
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:19,309
Hey

211
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,240
You crazy?

212
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,950
If it's only bruised, it won't hurt so much

213
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,583
You've been bleeding all night,
it must hurt

214
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,252
Now will you tell me who did it?

215
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:40,995
Ringo

216
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,533
He wanted to take it

217
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,634
I wouldn't let him, so he did this

218
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,105
With what?

219
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,269
A glass bottle

220
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,745
Hey! What are you doing?

221
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,426
Give to the poor, thank you

222
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,124
Okay? Go on!

223
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,102
What are you doing? Stop?

224
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,641
Stop! Get him!

225
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:30,674
Stop!

226
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,011
Ringo!

227
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,048
Did Frank cross you?

228
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,056
He made me mad!

229
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,285
Go to hell!

230
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,706
Die, die!

231
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,116
Ben...Ben...

232
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,388
Paul, open up!

233
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:49,288
What happened?

234
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,153
We killed Ringo!

235
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,093
What now?

236
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,190
I don't know, run I guess

237
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:00,737
Wait a second

238
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,077
Sorry

239
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,113
I really got you screwed,
and Jane too

240
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,447
We owe you so much

241
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,301
Is Ben there?

242
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,171
What's the matter?

243
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,307
He's wanted for murder,
we're looking for him

244
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,878
Ben, Frank, Paul!

245
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:16,637
Fatso!

246
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,147
I brought you lots of food

247
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,245
Were you followed

248
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,216
No, I was smart this time, here, bread
Change your clothes, change your look,

249
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,415
then no one will recognize you both

250
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,222
Lots of people on your back!

251
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,593
The police, Ringo's boys

252
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,254
And Mr Kwai's out for you Frank

253
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:34,731
Yeah?

254
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,329
How's Jane?

255
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,737
She's okay, the cops talked to her,
she's scared!

256
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,273
Don't worry,

257
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,700
I'll look after her

258
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,255
I got your passports

259
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,147
Thanks Mr Shing

260
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,183
I've got a friend called Luke over there
He'd help you to solve problem

261
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,962
Take these two boxes of penicillin,
Rolexes

262
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,323
and medicine

263
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,624
To the Saigon coast,

264
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,327
hand it to Mr Y. S. Leong

265
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,205
No tricks,

266
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:18,773
he's dangerous

267
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:19,602
I got it, Shing

268
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,911
Overthrow the government, we want liberty

269
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,481
Overthrow the Capitalism;
long live to Communism

270
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,249
Overthrow the British government,
we want liberty

271
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,221
Come back, Jane

272
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,526
It's dangerous. Riot outside. Come back

273
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,226
Be careful

274
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,319
Jane

275
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,727
What are you doing here, go

276
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:54,597
I want to talk to you!

277
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,534
I don't want to hear!

278
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,805
It is dangerous here, follow me!

279
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:00,911
Let's go

280
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:28,897
Feel hard!?

281
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:34,935
Run,

282
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,610
or you'll be recognized by the police

283
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,414
I have to leave Hong Kong for a while

284
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,985
You do whatever you want to do, as usual

285
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,923
You even killed somebody
in the wedding night

286
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,589
Don't worry, Jane
I'll be back to take you away

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,902
Forget it, everywhere is the same

288
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,396
The future cannot be foreseen, God knows

289
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,368
Anyway I'll take care of myself

290
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,137
Take care

291
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,538
No matter what,

292
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,839
the goods come first
It's over lifeline

293
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,513
It's so peaceful,
don't seem to be at war

294
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,142
Who gives a shit, war's their problem

295
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,079
They're killing Vietnamese,
nothing to do with us

296
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,611
We're here to get rich!

297
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,446
Then move on to Thailand!

298
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,046
Will we make it?

299
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,791
No sweat! Smugglers,
they're all millionaires

300
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,060
With a new place there's new hope

301
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,962
And this is our new hope

302
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,167
Guess how I'm gonna spent
my first million!

303
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,230
Buy yourself a Mercedes!
That's obvious!

304
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,204
Dummy! Would I risk my life my
life for a pissing Mercedes?

305
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,042
Either I don't go back,
if I do, I go back loaded!

306
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,440
If I make a fortune, first

307
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,675
I'd buy my mom loads
of embroidered slippers

308
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,745
Then she can't hit me
with her wooden clogs!

309
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,282
I only want to go back for Jane

310
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,181
Then I'll get you your ticket!

311
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:58,919
You're funny

312
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,914
Wow! What a scene!

313
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,747
Hey! What's a happening

314
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,546
Get out!

315
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,308
Why?

316
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,907
Bomb!

317
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,086
Explosives!

318
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,687
Grab the goods!

319
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,659
Forget it!

320
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,633
Come on! Let's run!

321
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,209
My stuff, Oh no! It's over!

322
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,748
Run!

323
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,991
Officer, run! Run!

324
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,972
Forget it! Let's split! Run!

325
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,934
Don't shoot... Don't shoot!

326
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,126
Don't fire! Don't fire!

327
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:38,878
Take them away
Run! Let's go! Quickly

328
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,763
Don't be scared! Go in quickly!

329
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,666
Move! Shut the gate! No reporters!

330
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,678
No! I'm Chinese, Chinese!

331
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:18,917
Move over, over there!
Down! Kneel down!

332
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,700
Look up! Was it you?

333
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,029
Did you plant the bomb?

334
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,033
No!

335
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,369
Denying huh?

336
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,503
It's not him... Look up!

337
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,803
If he gets it wrong, we're in hell!

338
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,736
I won't let him shoot me!

339
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,141
It's gonna be okay!
We're not local!

340
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,775
Shut up! No talking! Don't move!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot...

341
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,710
Did you plant the bomb? Speak up!

342
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:56,088
No! Sir, I don't!

343
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,093
Look up!

344
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,335
Sir, I'm from Hong Kong!

345
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:10,799
No! No! I'm from Hong Kong!

346
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,738
No! No Sir, I'm from Hong Kong!

347
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,434
HK people!

348
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:18,212
We are Chinese...please...

349
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,341
Please! Don't shoot!

350
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,544
Come out!

351
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:32,229
Are you okay?

352
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,827
We wanna take some pictures

353
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,294
Who are your accomplices?

354
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:38,760
Pig

355
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,199
Why can't we go in and take pictures?

356
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,839
Move on! No photos!

357
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,804
Bastard! Who's behind it? Come on talk!

358
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,542
Tell me where your
accomplices are hiding?

359
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,768
We have the right to know!

360
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,478
Scram! You can't go inside!

361
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,915
Bastard! So you won't talk!

362
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,548
Right? Well, die!

363
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:58,911
Go inside!

364
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,376
In our business,
we can't be running scared

365
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,915
With a gun in our hands,
this world is ours

366
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,285
How to say?

367
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,046
Bolero

368
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,455
Hey! Come in

369
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,988
It's the first time I've been
in a place like this!

370
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,254
Well, time to open your mind!

371
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,980
Great!

372
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,222
Get off...get off!

373
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:54,135
Excuse me! You...aren't you...

374
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,273
Go! Go!

375
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,441
Hi, John!

376
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,312
Hi, Lieu. Nguyen, Lieu. Ko

377
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,049
You should take Mr. Leong as an example!

378
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,314
He's really a big shot,
his nose is in the air!

379
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:17,221
How come Hong Kong singer is here?

380
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,497
Excuse me, I want...

381
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,465
Are you from Hong Kong?

382
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,935
You're Chinese? Great!

383
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,035
You know a guy called Luke?

384
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:30,970
I'd like to talk to him!

385
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,899
Hey! That Frenchman?

386
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,672
Is he a foreigner?

387
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,980
He's a Eurasian. Take a seat!

388
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,003
If he knows his friends are coming,

389
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,239
he will look for you!

390
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,273
Thanks!

391
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,477
Oh no...!

392
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,945
Be good!

393
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,156
Mr. Leong, would you please ask

394
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,686
them to behave themselves!

395
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,724
I'm here just to drink with them,
no hanky-panky!

396
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,495
I'm sure you're used to
being caressed by strangers

397
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,634
Are you Sally?

398
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,077
Any problem?

399
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,451
There are tons of girls like her!

400
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:16,745
Oh my god!

401
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:18,985
Can I be of any help to you?

402
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,014
Why should you help me?

403
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,417
Because we are Chinese!

404
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,093
Wait for me at the bridge tomorrow!

405
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,502
Promise to come. It's a deal!

406
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,472
Shit, I've got to go!

407
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,321
I told you not to talk to strangers,
go back to your seat!

408
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,187
You're looking for me?

409
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,355
Are you Luke?

410
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,300
I'm so happy to see you!

411
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,230
Take a seat!

412
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,702
I'm tied up with something,
see you later!

413
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,839
Good night, my friend!

414
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,043
Good night!

415
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,376
Habana

416
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,179
Thank you!

417
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,277
Mr. Chan,

418
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,671
Our goods were being held up
by your customs earlier.

419
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,217
Mr. Leong, this goods is
so important to you!

420
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:00,157
Currently my boss wants
to visit the States

421
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,657
I'd like to buy him a return air-ticket

422
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,592
How much is the ticket?

423
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:08,889
U.S.$100,000!

424
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,599
So you're a greedy person!

425
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,808
Fine with me - U.S.$100,000!

426
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:25,604
Have you been waiting long?

427
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:26,466
It's alright!

428
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:33,411
Luke, let me introduce!

429
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:34,843
Have we met?

430
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:35,785
How are you!

431
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,328
What now? Anything I can help?

432
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,725
We were meant to bring some goods
and exchange with Mr. Leong

433
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,928
Unfortunately we ran into trouble,
everything's gone!

434
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,300
What now?

435
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,302
Get something out of Leong!

436
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,431
But this is not our original plan!

437
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,206
You want to be in jail in HK?

438
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,244
You want me to lead a dog's life forever?

439
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,338
I've forgotten I have a father
who is a sweeper!

440
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,846
What you want? Please don't!

441
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,315
Today I saw some soldiers killed people,

442
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,318
I learned something!

443
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,209
In this world, if you have guns,
you have everything!

444
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,512
Tell me how much does a human life cost?

445
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,953
I'm a bit worried you'll get involved!

446
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,896
Leong is so powerful because he's got weapons

447
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:24,925
I need gun!

448
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,706
I'm not sure it's right or wrong,
but anyway I'll try my best to help you

449
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,883
Wait! What is going on?

450
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,521
I want to prove something!

451
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,865
Two coke, please!

452
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,064
Two coke!

453
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:58,734
Yes!

454
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:02,967
$14

455
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:04,533
We have no money!

456
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:07,940
Why?

457
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,073
You must pay me!

458
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:09,902
Don't mess around!

459
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:10,747
Hurry up! Give me the money!

460
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,750
Don't do that, you'll hurt somebody!
Let's go!

461
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:14,441
Pay me right away!

462
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,915
Look, such an easy job!
He was scared to death!

463
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,312
Let's go, we'll be in deep shit
if the policemen's around

464
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,946
Give it to me! Hurry up, you bastard!

465
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,483
Please don't!
Give me the money to get lost!

466
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:27,956
Don't shoot...don't...!

467
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,496
Oh shit!

468
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:35,902
Let's go!

469
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,410
Get back! Shit, the soldiers are coming!
Don't shoot!

470
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,646
Don't shoot!

471
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,683
We get problem! Let's run!

472
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:58,994
Lie down...
I surrender! What?

473
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,455
Lie down

474
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,361
Oh! Lie down!

475
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,476
Get it! Let's go!

476
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,936
We get it!

477
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,876
Let's get in!

478
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:56,915
Wow, what a fucking world!

479
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,818
This is really a fucked up world!

480
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,379
You got big robbery and
you get small money pincher

481
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:01,517
You scared?

482
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:25,006
Peace no war! Peace no war!

483
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:29,516
We want the governor respects
our peaceful desire

484
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:43,595
Stop the war, respect human rights
Peace. No war

485
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:56,608
Peace no war! Peace no war!
Peace. No war

486
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,144
Stop!

487
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,061
Don't worry, Jane
I'll be back to take you away

488
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,327
Forget it, everywhere is the same

489
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,671
The future cannot

490
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:02,770
Be foreseen

491
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,609
I'm sure I cannot get away!

492
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,278
A year ago, Leong signed me up
to sing in this nightclub

493
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,982
He told me I will make a lot money!

494
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,021
At that time, I was only dreaming...

495
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,589
I arrived Saigon,
he held up my passport

496
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:26,785
And did not allow me to go away...

497
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:31,167
He even forced me to deal in drug,
trafficking, and made me a whore

498
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,399
I won't want to see you dead

499
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,708
You're my little money maker

500
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,077
In 10 years time you'll forget everything

501
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,642
Forget you been in Saigon

502
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,214
Forget you were a whore,
won't that be swell?

503
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,229
There's no one to help you?

504
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,726
Yes...

505
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:31,691
Please get me out of this shit, please...

506
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,060
We sneaked out to see the boats here

507
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,966
We wish one day we can get on one
of these boats and flee away

508
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:42,363
Let's go!

509
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,399
I want you to kill people only!

510
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,766
I did tell you to take her away

511
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,189
Don't worry! We traveled here by boat!

512
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,329
We'll traveled back by boat too!

513
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:23,936
Are you sure there will be guns?

514
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,918
Don't worry, just go by the plan

515
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,517
We gotta trust him

516
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,147
Yeah, that's what friends are for!

517
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,791
You need this stuff

518
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,319
I have a permanent supply,
just have to ask

519
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,825
This lot is better than that the last

520
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,434
Check it out!

521
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:56,974
Habana

522
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,044
Thanks Luke

523
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:06,778
Still the same song?

524
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:08,819
Yes!

525
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,129
This contains a list of names

526
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,999
and contacts of CIA agents
You'll make big money

527
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,076
selling guns to North Vietnam for us

528
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,147
Right, no problem,
we'll split the profits

529
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:47,886
Come in!

530
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,267
Hello, Luke!

531
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:56,905
Mr. Leong

532
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,802
He is my best friend, Ben

533
00:47:59,543 --> 00:47:59,975
Frank

534
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,370
Mr. Leong

535
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:02,243
Paul

536
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,274
They're friends of Mr. Shing

537
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:04,913
Mr. Leong, nice to meet you

538
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:08,512
Mr. Leong

539
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,423
Well, the youth of today, huh!

540
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,253
Well, what do you have for me?

541
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,021
Penicillin

542
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,359
Great! The North needs that stuff

543
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:24,458
Check it out

544
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,232
It's okay!

545
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,568
I'll trust you if you're Luke's friends

546
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,011
Relax downstairs, have a drink,
It's okay! Drink and have fun

547
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:48,949
Help yourself

548
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,122
Go have a drink too

549
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,930
I won't, someone's waiting for me!

550
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,996
Still the Don Juan, huh?

551
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,003
I hope no one get killed

552
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,674
I don't give a damn

553
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,547
I'll kill anyone who gets in my way

554
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:20,421
Ben

555
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,317
I'm worried

556
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,027
Don't worry

557
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,374
Miss Yen, are you alright?

558
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,379
I like that song you sing Wind Flower

559
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,475
Will you sing it for me?

560
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:16,678
Windflower, flying in the wind

561
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,349
Sit down, how is it?
Had something to drink?

562
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,072
A bit

563
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,381
A bit isn't enough!
Come, get some more glasses

564
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,581
You're all gotta drink

565
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,053
Do you know her?

566
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,693
You Hong Kong boys are real Romeos!

567
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,133
Got your eyes on my girl
before the deals even done!

568
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,071
Mr. Leong, you got it wrong,
we didn't mean it

569
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,203
We just like her singing

570
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,338
I also heard, you wanted
to take her with you!

571
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,047
She's my trump card,

572
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,116
I spent a lot of time grooming her

573
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,618
Mr. Leong, you got it wrong

574
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,421
We already liked Sally
when we were in Hong Kong

575
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,122
Loved her singing

576
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,668
We were staring at her
because it was strange

577
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,672
She seemed to have changed!

578
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,805
She's not beautiful any more

579
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:19,438
Ben!

580
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,701
She's lost her innocence

581
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,206
She's not happy anymore

582
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,515
What sort of grooming is that?

583
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,547
Are you accusing me?

584
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,359
No one else dares to
talk to me like that!

585
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,321
Young man, you've got guts!

586
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:43,691
Bring the booze

587
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,138
Let's empty the bottle

588
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,178
I made the screw up, it's my fault!

589
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,053
I'll drink!

590
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,445
Right! Real buddies!

591
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,447
Since you're buddies,

592
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,218
all three of you drink!

593
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,887
Ben! What are you doing?
You call yourself our pal?

594
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:45,527
Don't let him step on us!

595
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,594
Aren't you being selfish?

596
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:50,128
Don't let him step on us!
What did you say?

597
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,098
You screwed up,

598
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,294
don't drag me into it!

599
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,474
I did that for all of us

600
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:01,633
Stop it!

601
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,541
What are you two fighting about?

602
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,245
You hit me?

603
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,151
Serves you bleeding right!

604
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,292
Ben!

605
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,199
You traitors!

606
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:31,867
Bastard

607
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:34,642
Watch over Ben

608
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,442
Old shithead! Pull him up!

609
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,639
Run!

610
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,382
Run! Quick!

611
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,260
Go back, quickly!
Let me go, let me go...

612
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:00,692
Don't come over!

613
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,303
Don't move! Or I'll kill him!

614
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:07,971
One step more and I'll shoot!

615
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,275
Help! Don't come over!

616
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,640
Kill them!

617
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,225
Let me go or you'll die!

618
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,193
Ben, where are you going?

619
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:24,693
Ben

620
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,394
Bitch! You're not going any where!

621
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,271
Sally!

622
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,913
Ben, Frank!

623
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,339
Help! Quick!

624
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,883
Don't move. Let me go

625
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,516
Sally, Sally

626
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:01,763
Will we make it?

627
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,358
Let's go now?

628
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,360
Watch out!

629
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,358
Are you guys crazy?
Stuck with this dame

630
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,727
Do you wanna get us killed?

631
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,264
I promised her I'd take her away

632
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,599
That's your dame business,
leave me out

633
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:46,934
Stop it Paul!

634
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,409
If we're still buddies

635
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:49,710
It's not important

636
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:50,504
Let's get the hell out first!

637
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,408
No way! You'll never leave!

638
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,279
Stop fighting!

639
00:55:59,422 --> 00:55:59,820
Get down

640
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,887
The gold leaves, where is it?

641
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,728
Luke! Where is the gold?

642
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,627
Where's Sally's passport?

643
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:10,899
I don't know

644
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,928
You said it was here! Where's the gold?

645
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:15,802
In the safe

646
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,405
Where is Sally's passport?

647
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,441
You'll get it over my dead body

648
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,011
Where the hell is Sally's passport?

649
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:33,947
Speak up!

650
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:35,355
You'll have to kill me first!

651
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,456
I bet it's in the safe

652
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,328
Bastards! You won't get of here alive

653
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,129
Sally, don't worry

654
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,464
Ben will help you,
even without your passport

655
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,834
We could be refuges,

656
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,905
sneak over to Hong Kong

657
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:15,496
Sally

658
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,598
You see! I told you not to worry

659
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,001
We'll get back to Hong Kong, right?

660
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,403
Hey! Release Mr. Leong

661
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,055
Take your clothes off

662
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,738
Not Mr. Leong, he's our brother

663
00:58:58,868 --> 00:58:59,562
Where's my passport?

664
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,905
My passport's gone!

665
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,567
Sally keep cool!

666
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,743
Bitch!

667
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:20,784
Sally!

668
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:21,882
Stay away

669
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:24,517
Help!

670
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,661
Bastards! Don't touch my gold!

671
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,532
How dare you take my gold! My gold!

672
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,660
You can't, give it back...

673
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:35,565
Let her go!

674
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,767
Okay! I'll let her go

675
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,568
Sally!

676
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:49,017
Sally!

677
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:08,895
Don't move!

678
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:10,331
Stay away!

679
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,632
Or I'll kill them

680
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:22,912
Don't move! Wanna die?

681
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,552
This is Vietnam, you won't get out alive!

682
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,350
Come on! You shut up!

683
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,718
Punk, you won't get out of Saigon!

684
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:32,586
No way!

685
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:33,961
Shut up!

686
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:35,291
Drive, just go on!

687
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,623
Go on! Quickly

688
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:39,592
Come on!

689
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,202
Drive on!

690
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,378
Ben, get in, quick, quick!

691
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,323
Don't let them get away

692
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,921
You must get them

693
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,652
Get in, quick, quick!

694
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,968
You'll be alright! Don't worry!

695
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,048
What do we do?

696
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:40,389
Don't worry, I used to work for the CIA,
I'll handle it

697
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:45,731
What are you doing here?

698
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,798
Sorry sir, I have a pass

699
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,304
Sir, what's going on?

700
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,065
We're being attacked by Vietcongs,
it's dangerous here

701
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,001
You better get out of here

702
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,742
One of our friends is seriously hurt

703
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,245
We must move her to another town urgently

704
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,704
Okay, but take care

705
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:00,280
Thanks

706
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:00,916
Let them pass

707
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,412
Can't turn back now!
Let's just get through! Quick!

708
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,764
Help me, take me...

709
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,778
What are you doing? Go away, piss off...

710
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,110
Piss off, go, get lost!

711
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:17,192
They're so pitiful

712
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,239
Move, move! Bastards!

713
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,975
Drive on, faster!

714
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,880
Frank, start from there,

715
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,819
plant a mine every there steps in case

716
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:19,453
Right!

717
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,055
Quickly!

718
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:42,874
You okay?

719
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:54,921
Hang on

720
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:56,517
You'll be okay

721
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,396
Will we make it?

722
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:06,129
We'll get away! The boat will
leave soon, don't worry

723
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:08,565
Really?

724
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,971
Really! Believe me

725
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,435
I told you, once we have
the change to leave

726
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,140
We'll go back to Hong Kong together

727
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:21,884
Be strong

728
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,021
You'll make it back to Hong Kong

729
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,489
I've got a record of yours at home
Waiting to be autographed

730
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,958
Hey! Luke, is this boat coming?

731
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,969
If those Vietnam bastards get here,
we'll be dead!

732
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,003
Is that boat for real?

733
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,233
Hey! What do you want?

734
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,239
Answer me okay?

735
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:56,318
Are you human? Spare a thought for us

736
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,386
You only care about your gold,
what about us?

737
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,546
Are you blind? Can't you see?

738
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:06,923
Frank!

739
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,057
What are you doing?

740
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,399
I feel like shit!

741
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,483
Ben, the boat's here!

742
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,457
Why did it take so long?

743
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:39,388
Last night there was a Vietcong
attack, it's dangerous

744
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,993
Stop the boat up front first

745
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,189
Up front... Up front...

746
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,024
Sally, the boat! The boat's here!

747
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,652
Hey! Stop the boat! Stop! Stop!

748
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,361
Can't stop! It's too dangerous!

749
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,696
Stop! Wait for me! Wait for me!

750
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:00,768
I can't wait for you!

751
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,355
Go on! No! come on!

752
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,420
Go on! I'll give you gold!

753
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,188
Help me please!

754
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,020
Come on!

755
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,395
Like this! Okay! Come on, quickly...

756
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,239
Ben, I'll cover you,
get on the boat, quick!

757
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,190
Paul

758
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,798
Ben! Quick! Quick!

759
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:07,572
Wait!

760
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,233
Sally, Sally...

761
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,916
Sally, Sally...

762
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,291
They're catching up!
Luke, get on the boat! Luke!

763
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,137
Luke, Luke!

764
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,172
Go, Luke

765
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,238
Let her go, let go now!

766
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,299
Get on the boat, Luke!

767
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,204
Shit! Why doesn't the boat move?

768
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:23,370
God damn!

769
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,645
Hey! Give us a hand now!

770
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,343
If those damn Vietcong get us we're dead!

771
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,485
God damn it! Aren't you guys worried?
The boat's screwed!

772
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,589
Come and help!
Stop sitting there like statues?

773
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,893
Luke, can you fix it?

774
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,423
I know you're upset over Sally's death,

775
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,260
so am I!

776
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,326
But it's better this way?
She won't drag us down!

777
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:50,397
We're scared shitless

778
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:51,305
not knowing how much longer we'll die

779
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,030
Isn't that worse?

780
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:53,764
If this boat sinks,

781
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,441
we'll lose all this gold

782
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,310
Hey! Don't touch my gold!

783
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,481
Hey, Ben, put it back!

784
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,589
Hey! Stop doing that, or I'll shoot!

785
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:13,356
Come on!

786
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,591
Put the gold down!

787
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:18,292
Are you crazy?

788
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,901
Go on! If you shoot
I'll blow your head up!

789
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:23,770
For me I'm already dead,

790
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,399
but I don't want to lose the gold

791
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,378
Frank, put the gun done

792
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,608
Put the gun down!

793
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,052
Are you putting this gold
before your friends?!

794
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,825
Do you still know what friends are?

795
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:49,895
Do you know what you're doing?

796
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,099
You're pointing your gun
at a buddy of over 10 years!

797
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,405
Do you measure your friendship in gold?

798
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,769
Is this enough?

799
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,513
Over 10 years of friendship...

800
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,385
That friendship is over,

801
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,452
we're not friends anymore

802
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:13,715
Shoot then!

803
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,386
I've known you for over 10 years

804
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,418
Over 10 years!
If you want you can kill me!

805
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,627
Shoot! Go on shoot...

806
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:26,126
Please stop throwing it away!
I'm sorry!

807
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,663
That's all I'm asking for

808
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,334
All I want in this life is simple

809
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,809
Just this box of gold, is that too much?

810
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,418
This boat is sinking

811
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,628
We better do something about it?

812
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:04,500
Do you want to die?

813
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:05,695
I want my gold!

814
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:06,704
Let's jump!

815
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,134
Quick jump!

816
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:29,728
The gold, the gold...

817
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,103
Paul

818
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,203
My gold!

819
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,039
Paul, come on now, Ah!

820
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,212
Come on now!

821
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,484
I found it, I found the gold!

822
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,586
Paul, are you crazy! Paul!

823
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,032
Paul

824
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:10,902
Help!

825
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:13,736
Go and help him

826
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:17,204
I can't make it!
Help me! Help!

827
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:21,478
Help me... Help!

828
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:23,576
The gold's too heavy...

829
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:30,248
The gold...

830
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,584
You wanna die? Forget about the gold!

831
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:33,623
Let's go!

832
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:56,743
Don't you wanna live?

833
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,119
You can let me die, but I want my gold!

834
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,155
Damn your gold! Damn, damn it...

835
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,223
If I'd known, I won't have
bothered saving you!

836
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,492
We'll go and find Luke

837
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,229
Come if you want if you
don't you can stay

838
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:15,797
Move, Frank

839
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,038
Come on!

840
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:02,674
Grab him, grab him, don't move

841
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,150
Don't kill him yet

842
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:04,777
Luke

843
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,812
Luke

844
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,780
Luke

845
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,592
All of you stand there, don't move!
Hands up!

846
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,691
Don't shoot! Vietcong!

847
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:14,554
Shit! Why did we look for Luke?

848
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,596
Put the guns down, quick...

849
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,595
Today our comrades

850
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:57,762
found American soldiers on hill 43

851
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,835
Right, tomorrow we attack through the bushes

852
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:35,199
Wow, all that gold

853
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:37,311
Ben

854
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:41,146
Put the gold on the table

855
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:43,307
What is it?

856
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,018
Open it. Right

857
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:55,091
Some military map and a name list
It belongs to the 3 outside

858
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:57,959
Something's wrong!

859
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,466
Those three guys had the
name list and the gold

860
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:15,414
A G.I. escaped, get him!

861
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,813
A G.I. escaped, shoot him

862
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:34,434
Run away?
No way, you won't get away!

863
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,395
Speak up!

864
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,899
Is this gold and list of agents?
connected to the CIA?

865
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,111
The gold and name list belongs to them

866
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,073
Ask them

867
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:49,010
Take him away

868
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,846
Right! Move!

869
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,721
Is this gold yours?

870
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:04,354
Is this gold yours?

871
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:05,830
No! Yes... The gold is mine

872
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,031
Don't hit him. Stop it!

873
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,201
Don't say yes! Paul!
He knows nothing!

874
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,229
Don't admit it, Paul
He knows nothing, don't hit him!

875
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,540
Are you working for the CIA?

876
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:18,777
We're not Vietnamese

877
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,473
We're not with the CIA

878
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,406
We don't know anything
No! He's lying!

879
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:25,251
We know nothing!
He's lying! I don't know!

880
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,413
Is it form CIA?

881
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:28,915
We don't know anything,

882
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,181
we don't know if these are connected CIA

883
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:31,258
We don't know anything!

884
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:32,756
We're Chinese! We don't know!

885
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,052
Please believe me! Go to hell!

886
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,160
How much information do you have?

887
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,126
We don't know anything

888
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,195
We're not from the CIA,

889
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,931
Ben... Ben

890
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,038
Ben... Tell them not to shoot at us!

891
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:20,869
Calm down... don't panic...!

892
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:21,398
Ben...

893
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,510
Frank...Calm down! Calm down...!
It's alright!

894
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,318
It's not easy to get rid of me!

895
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,878
He's staring at me! Calm down!

896
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,220
Staring at me! Clam down!

897
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:47,301
You!

898
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:53,370
Get up! Damn it! Run!

899
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:57,306
Stand still!

900
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:01,938
You kill him! Kill him!

901
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,143
You kill him!

902
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,945
Shoot him!

903
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,444
He kill him!

904
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:18,229
He is form the CIA!

905
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,294
Don't kill me! Don't kill me...!
Please spare me

906
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,440
Will you tell the truth now?

907
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,879
We're Chinese

908
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,579
We're not from the CIA

909
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,416
Calm down!

910
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,013
No! No...

911
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,014
You wanna run? Damn you Americans!

912
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:47,960
No...oh... No...Rupert!

913
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,664
Your turn!

914
01:22:58,974 --> 01:22:59,906
You...

915
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,444
No...I don't kill people...No way...!
Calm down...!

916
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,672
I don't kill people,
tell them to leave me alone!

917
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,015
Alright! Don't be afraid, Frank!
I don't kill people...

918
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:11,575
Got out!

919
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,387
Come out...quick!
He's going to shoot him!

920
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,088
No...No...! I won't...

921
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,550
Go out! You want to get killed?
Go out!

922
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,319
Listen to me!

923
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:21,691
We can't die in here,

924
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,464
we have to go back to Hong Kong!

925
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:31,700
I'm so frightened...
don't force me to kill...!

926
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,668
Get outside, Frank!
We got to get some gun!

927
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:35,732
Tell them not to take me away!

928
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:38,007
This is our only chance!

929
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:40,046
I'm not going out! Go out!

930
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:42,249
Take the gun with you and get inside!
Get out!

931
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,145
Ben...

932
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:47,082
Don't panic! Frank, these bastards
are just playing games

933
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,088
Take it, Frank!

934
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:51,047
Shut up!

935
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:56,724
Kill him...kill him!
No...Don't kill me!

936
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,162
Shoot him!

937
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,432
Don't just stand there,
they will kill you!

938
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:09,602
I don't want to kill people...

939
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,014
Save your life, don't cry! Shoot!

940
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:17,983
Please don't force me to kill people

941
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:18,508
No...

942
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:40,540
Stand up, quick, stand up...!

943
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,476
I talk, I talk...

944
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,077
I know CIA, come on!

945
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,111
Come on

946
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,313
Let me go, come on!

947
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,394
Frank, you must be strong! Frank...

948
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:05,031
I can't...I can't

949
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,033
Frank, don't give a shit,
just keep shooting!

950
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,080
Come on!

951
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:32,186
Kill him!

952
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,227
You have done a great job! Frank!

953
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,189
Bastards, let's do it!

954
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:38,160
Shoot him!

955
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:39,092
Kill him!

956
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,065
Shoot him!

957
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,074
I won't kill...!

958
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,341
Keep cool! Frank... Keep cool...!

959
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,448
I won't kill people...

960
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,782
Captain, come over here...

961
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:03,317
Choose me, let me do it for you!

962
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:08,162
Let me do it, I hate Americans!
I'll kill him for you, please take me!

963
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,124
Good! You'll do it? Good!

964
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:15,160
Where is CIA? You tell me, where?

965
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:15,668
In Saigon

966
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:16,798
Where...

967
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,705
I killed him, are you happy with it?

968
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,380
Who first?

969
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,148
He? OK

970
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,758
Kill him, fine

971
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:57,402
Are you happy? Punk!

972
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,296
Are you happy? I'm happy too

973
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:22,299
You like it? Bloody hell!

974
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:23,730
Hey! Come on, come on...

975
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:25,199
What?

976
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:28,340
I make you more happy and
have more fun... OK?

977
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,204
I'll kill more Americans

978
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,371
Kill him!

979
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:37,807
Don't move!

980
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:41,845
Say...I'm not going to make it...

981
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,254
Why not...

982
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,226
No bullet, no bullet...

983
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:58,666
Give him!

984
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,380
Damn you! OK!

985
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,647
I make you happy! OK?

986
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,291
CIA is here? Sure?

987
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:25,822
Yes, here...in Town Fook

988
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:31,397
Whom should we kill?

989
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:40,948
Frank...I've said that
we are going back to Hong Kong together

990
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:46,320
If you don't, nobody will!

991
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,041
Go to hell

992
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:38,500
Don't move

993
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,033
Don't move, I'll shoot

994
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:46,344
Damn it, I go for it!

995
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,212
Don't move, I'll kill him, don't move!

996
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,246
What?

997
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:20,638
Frank, where's Paul? Who knows

998
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:27,716
Take care, Frank!

999
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,894
Let's look for Paul?
Go to find Paul, go!

1000
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,397
Go! Go to those buildings!

1001
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,163
Force me to kill, isn't it funny?

1002
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:56,969
I'm a man! The hell with you! Damn you...

1003
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:06,314
Apache one, get your ass in here!

1004
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:12,251
Ben, Ben, let go...

1005
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:43,587
Paul, be careful

1006
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,293
Paul, let's go to search for Ben!

1007
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,005
This far, how can we find him?
Maybe he is dead

1008
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:01,241
Don't take the gold again

1009
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:03,834
I want to take the gold. Leave me alone

1010
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:07,036
Go to find Ben...leave the gold!

1011
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,078
We are stuck together

1012
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:22,425
Frank!

1013
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:39,840
When we find Ben, we three will leave

1014
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:44,074
Let me go. Paul...

1015
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:55,853
Stay away from me

1016
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:01,933
Don't leave me alone

1017
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:05,637
Frank!

1018
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:11,501
Luke, did you see Frank?
Let's look for him

1019
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:13,373
The US army are going to
leave in 5 minutes

1020
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,217
Paul...

1021
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:19,410
Keep quite! Be patient

1022
01:34:23,257 --> 01:34:24,019
I'm in pain!

1023
01:34:24,258 --> 01:34:27,250
Just hang on, can you?

1024
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:31,764
Shut up! It hurts...

1025
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,024
I don't want to die

1026
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:35,927
Let's look around

1027
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,559
Damn!

1028
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:43,164
Let me go

1029
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:44,966
I feel so painful!

1030
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:46,730
Stop making any noise!

1031
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:50,368
Paul, what are you doing?

1032
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,344
Don't press my head!

1033
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:56,238
I'm out of breath

1034
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:01,980
It's killing me

1035
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:04,885
I'll kill you if you speak again

1036
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:26,708
I'd rather you die. Don't blame me

1037
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:20,228
Frank, Frank...

1038
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:01,240
Paul

1039
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:51,014
For God's sake
He needs our help!

1040
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:53,054
Get to that side!
You are badly wounded

1041
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,850
We have to send him to the base
People will take care of him!

1042
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:57,597
He can be, for sure!
Thanks!

1043
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:04,232
Have trouble, let's get ashore, quick!

1044
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:13,769
See if there is anyone still alive...

1045
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:19,750
Our father...

1046
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:42,028
Don't move! Or I'll beat you up!

1047
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:58,215
Luke!

1048
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:07,649
Everyone has to sacrifice in this war!

1049
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:08,758
We are quite lucky though...

1050
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,495
We have a chance to see our
friends again....!

1051
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:15,962
Any news from Frank?

1052
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:19,700
He's still alive!

1053
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:20,831
Really?

1054
01:41:23,944 --> 01:41:25,343
I wish I did not bring him back

1055
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,807
He's not the same Frank anymore!

1056
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,415
He doesn't even know who he is!

1057
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:36,279
I saw Frank shoot him in the head...

1058
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:42,026
He didn't die, it's just a miracle!

1059
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:47,524
Maybe he wants to see his old friends
before he dies!

1060
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:21,651
Give me the money,
and I will kill him for you

1061
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,884
Take me to see him...

1062
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:33,354
Frank!

1063
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:54,674
Frank. It's me!

1064
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:11,553
The bullet is still in his head,

1065
01:46:16,803 --> 01:46:17,701
even though he has an operation

1066
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:20,036
He will become a vegetable

1067
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:30,947
Frank...Frank...

1068
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:32,913
Stop it!

1069
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:41,852
Frank, Frank!

1070
01:46:44,264 --> 01:46:47,028
Frank...

1071
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:55,003
Please don't!

1072
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,178
Don't do that...!Give me...

1073
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:22,425
Frank. Stop it!

1074
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:25,235
Frank...Stop it...!

1075
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:27,029
Did your hear? Frank

1076
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,035
Don't fight, you will die!

1077
01:47:30,544 --> 01:47:31,374
Frank

1078
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:52,425
Why don't you save some for me?

1079
01:47:56,069 --> 01:48:03,066
We agreed we'll share everything in life!

1080
01:48:05,178 --> 01:48:06,702
We were like brothers since we were kids

1081
01:48:09,182 --> 01:48:10,114
We fought together...

1082
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:13,516
We cruised chicks together...

1083
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:30,197
You called me brother all the time

1084
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:35,340
I told you we can just be friends

1085
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:39,207
Friends are all equal

1086
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:52,990
Frank. You get so many scars in your head

1087
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,324
Beaten up by your mother, remember?

1088
01:49:00,634 --> 01:49:01,601
Because you were so naughty,

1089
01:49:03,303 --> 01:49:05,271
she had to beat you up

1090
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,153
It rained heavily the night I get married

1091
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:26,256
We did not have enough money
to pay the bill...

1092
01:49:28,295 --> 01:49:29,592
If not because of your loan!

1093
01:49:31,298 --> 01:49:32,856
We could not afford to get married!

1094
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:38,200
At that night,
Ringo, hit your head with a bottle

1095
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,834
But you didn't let me know

1096
01:49:43,643 --> 01:49:44,667
You're an introvert!

1097
01:49:46,646 --> 01:49:51,413
You keep everything to yourself

1098
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:56,121
I'd like to listen to you,
just a few words...

1099
01:49:58,358 --> 01:49:59,985
Just a few words...!

1100
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:02,627
Come on...!
Does it ring a bell?

1101
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:04,090
I'm Ben

1102
01:51:01,588 --> 01:51:02,486
I don't mean that!

1103
01:51:06,793 --> 01:51:08,124
I can't see you like this!

1104
01:52:00,046 --> 01:52:01,172
Didn't you tell me you want
to go to Hong Kong

1105
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:06,809
The world is changing...

1106
01:52:08,588 --> 01:52:12,718
I'm used to my own way of life

1107
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,552
All of a sudden, I have to make a change

1108
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:16,887
I just can't...

1109
01:52:17,697 --> 01:52:18,686
I've got to go back!

1110
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,232
That's my home!

1111
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,268
It's a long way to go...

1112
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:29,697
I've got to go back!

1113
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:33,679
Take care!

1114
01:52:34,848 --> 01:52:35,507
Take care!

1115
01:54:07,473 --> 01:54:08,201
Sugar cane juice...

1116
01:54:08,575 --> 01:54:09,337
60 cents pleases...

1117
01:54:11,277 --> 01:54:14,041
He's not feeling so well these days...

1118
01:54:14,314 --> 01:54:18,375
Be good, eat something...

1119
01:54:19,219 --> 01:54:19,913
Be good

1120
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:22,620
Come on

1121
01:55:01,995 --> 01:55:05,590
Ben! You're back, great...!

1122
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:19,178
His name is Frank

1123
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:53,542
Boss, Mr King says he's
ready for the meeting!

1124
01:55:55,581 --> 01:55:56,741
I think it's time for me to retire

1125
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,046
The world belong to the young people

1126
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,788
Paul is a very capable person

1127
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,548
We made money,

1128
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:07,154
we spent all...!

1129
01:56:07,593 --> 01:56:09,288
Even the government could
not lay a finger on us!

1130
01:56:09,862 --> 01:56:11,921
Have guts, and friend enough!

1131
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:15,333
I seldom make a wrong choice!

1132
01:56:16,669 --> 01:56:19,502
Paul will be the most suitable successor!

1133
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:23,240
Congratulations...

1134
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:24,808
Thank you, Mr. King...

1135
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:25,706
I'll try my best to fulfill my duties...

1136
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,342
I won't disappoint you!

1137
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:31,375
I have never disappointed myself...

1138
01:56:36,889 --> 01:56:37,685
Congratulations, Paul

1139
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:38,548
Thank you

1140
01:56:39,425 --> 01:56:41,893
An old friend of Paul

1141
01:56:42,095 --> 01:56:43,119
wants to see him!

1142
01:56:43,563 --> 01:56:45,531
Okay...anyway. We're through!

1143
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:46,590
Show him in...!

1144
01:56:46,866 --> 01:56:47,389
Yes

1145
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:06,949
Ben, when did you come back?

1146
01:57:09,889 --> 01:57:11,379
Let me introduce, Mr. King!

1147
01:57:12,225 --> 01:57:13,522
Mr. King, this is Ben,

1148
01:57:13,993 --> 01:57:15,119
my old friend

1149
01:57:15,728 --> 01:57:17,389
He stickled with me throughout
my time in Vietnam

1150
01:57:17,897 --> 01:57:20,764
So thrilled to see you again, really!

1151
01:57:21,934 --> 01:57:23,333
I'm so happy to see you...!

1152
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:27,264
Half of mine is yours!

1153
01:57:29,976 --> 01:57:30,772
What about Frank?

1154
01:57:31,444 --> 01:57:31,933
Frank?

1155
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:39,343
He kept telling us to leave him
behind when he was wounded alone

1156
01:57:40,186 --> 01:57:41,414
And go with you to Hong Kong

1157
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:45,687
I wanted to help him,
but I was badly wounded

1158
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:49,791
I was so up set,
yet I have done my best!

1159
01:57:51,864 --> 01:57:53,661
When we went to Vietnam
to try our luck!

1160
01:57:55,134 --> 01:57:57,034
I promised to bring Frank
back to Hong Kong

1161
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,069
I kept my words!

1162
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:04,869
I bring him home!

1163
01:58:10,016 --> 01:58:10,641
Ben are you out of your mind

1164
01:58:10,783 --> 01:58:12,876
When I saw him in Saigon he was crazy
He lived like animal, he led a dog's life!

1165
01:58:13,019 --> 01:58:13,781
You know why?

1166
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,222
Because he got a bullet in his head!

1167
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:26,993
Why didn't you shoot straight?

1168
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:30,596
Now he has to suffer more?

1169
01:58:33,339 --> 01:58:35,398
Is it worth it to kill a friend
for a box of gold?

1170
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:37,034
There are dead people lying
all over the place in wartime

1171
01:58:37,243 --> 01:58:39,768
You can bring back any bone
and said it belongs to Frank!

1172
02:01:55,708 --> 02:01:57,699
You want to get a revenge? Damn it!

1173
02:01:59,845 --> 02:02:01,107
I never lose in my life...

1174
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:03,241
They did not kill me in Vietnam,
you think you can scare me now?

1175
02:02:04,216 --> 02:02:05,877
We are all fugitives in our lives,
see who run out of our luck first!

1176
02:02:18,197 --> 02:02:19,221
You're going to lose, Paul

1177
02:02:19,932 --> 02:02:22,423
Don't worry, I never lose in my life

1178
02:06:51,337 --> 02:06:54,465
Ben, we must die together

1179
02:07:07,086 --> 02:07:09,247
Frank, shut up

1180
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:19,223
You bring it yourself, you are a dead man
You dare follow me

1181
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:23,596
You want to rest in peace

1182
02:07:25,938 --> 02:07:30,307
Let me help you

1183
02:07:32,811 --> 02:07:34,745
I'm going to take the box of gold!

1184
02:07:36,515 --> 02:07:38,380
Do you envy?

1185
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:00,199
You don't have a long life to enjoy it

1186
02:08:01,573 --> 02:08:03,404
Let me help you to rest in peace

1187
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:08,810
He said he wanted to rest in peace
What shall we do?

1188
02:08:09,381 --> 02:08:11,372
Give him one more shoot to help him
Come on, help your friend

1189
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:12,140
Shoot him!

1190
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:17,754
Give him one more shoot!
So that he can rest in peace!

1191
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:19,516
And he can't follow us

1192
02:08:20,626 --> 02:08:22,992
Shoot, Ben! Help him to rest in peace!

1193
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:25,326
Then we won't suffer anymore

1194
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:32,600
I can continue to earn money

1195
02:08:34,206 --> 02:08:35,605
You can make some new friends

1196
02:08:35,808 --> 02:08:38,436
Shoot him!
