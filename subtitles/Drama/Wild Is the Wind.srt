1
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,857
What do we care if we were expelled
from college?

2
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,921
The war is gonna start any day.
We would've left college anyhow.

3
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,660
War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?

4
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,793
You know those fool Yankees
actually want a war?

5
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:02,064
- We'll show them.
- Fiddle-dee-dee!

6
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,332
War, war, war.

7
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,431
This war talk's spoiling all the fun
at every party this spring.

8
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,807
I get so bored I could scream.

9
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:12,342
- Besides, there isn't going to be any war.
- Not gonna be any war?

10
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,815
Why, honey, of course
there's going to be a war!

11
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,911
If either of you says "war" just once again,
I'll go in the house and slam the door.

12
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,082
- But, Scarlett, honey...
- Don't you want us to have a war?

13
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,123
Well...

14
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,628
but remember...

15
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,329
I warned you.

16
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,103
I've got an idea.

17
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:37,639
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.

18
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,437
That's a good idea.
Aren't you eating barbecue with us?

19
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,638
I hadn't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

20
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,907
We want all your waltzes.

21
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:47,643
First Brent, then me, then Brent,
then me again, and so on.

22
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,277
- Promise?
- I'd just love to.

23
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:54,145
If only I didn't have
every one of them taken already.

24
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,952
Why, honey, you can't do that to us.

25
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,619
- How about if we tell you a secret?
- A secret? Who about?

26
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,822
You know Miss Melanie Hamilton
from Atlanta?

27
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,297
Ashley Wilkes' cousin.
She's visiting the Wilkes...

28
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:06,301
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know a secret about her?

29
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:07,996
Anyway, we heard, that is, they say...

30
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:12,098
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.

31
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:13,870
Now do we get those waltzes?

32
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,441
Of course.

33
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:20,578
- The other boys will be hopping mad.
- Let them be mad. We can handle them!

34
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,414
It can't be true. Ashley loves me.

35
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:24,646
Scarlett!

36
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,681
What has gotten into her?

37
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,519
Do you suppose we made her mad?

38
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,425
Where are you going without your shawl,
and the night air fixing to set in?

39
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,157
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen
to stay for supper?

40
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,426
You ain't got no more manners
than a field hand...

41
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,695
after me and Miss Ellen done labored
with you.

42
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,169
Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!

43
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,536
Come on in before you catch
your death of dampness.

44
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,269
No! I'll wait for Pa to come home
from the Wilkes'.

45
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,935
Come on in here!

46
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:50,979
Come on!

47
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,460
Quitting time.

48
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,929
Who says it's quitting time?

49
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,158
I says it's quitting time.

50
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:13,634
I's the foreman. I's the one that says
when it's quitting time at Tara!

51
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,295
Quitting time!

52
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,672
Quitting time!

53
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,879
There's none in the county can touch you,
and none in the state.

54
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:04,276
Pa!

55
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,885
So proud of yourself you are.

56
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,957
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.

57
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,463
So you've been spying on me,
and like your sister Suellen...

58
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,964
you'll tell your mother on me
that I was jumping again.

59
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,196
You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,
but it does seem to me...

60
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:23,261
after you broke your knee last year
jumping that same fence...

61
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,673
I'll not have me own daughter telling me
what I shall jump and not jump.

62
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,267
It's my own neck, so it is.

63
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:33,280
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.
How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?

64
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,373
The Wilkeses?

65
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,546
Just as you'd expect with the barbecue
tomorrow and talking nothing but war.

66
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,385
Oh, bother the war.
Was there anyone else there?

67
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:44,824
Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton
from Atlanta, and her brother, Charles.

68
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,156
Melanie Hamilton!

69
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,561
She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.
I hate her.

70
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,121
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

71
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,225
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like
anyone like her.

72
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,170
What's your interest in Ashley
and Miss Melanie?

73
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,635
It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.

74
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,872
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?

75
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,378
- No!
- No, nor will he.

76
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:07,678
I have it in strictest confidence
from John Wilkes this afternoon...

77
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,445
Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.

78
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,079
It will be announced tomorrow night
at the ball.

79
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,145
I don't believe it.

80
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,450
Here! Here, where are you off to?

81
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:17,681
Scarlett!

82
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,459
What are you about?

83
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:23,661
Have you made a spectacle of yourself
running after a man...

84
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,964
who's not in love with you when
you might have any man in the county?

85
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:30,437
I haven't been running after him.
It's just a surprise, that's all.

86
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:33,339
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.

87
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,901
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes. "

88
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:40,471
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.

89
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,811
I would, I would!

90
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,852
What difference does it make
who you marry...

91
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,388
so long as he's a Southerner
and thinks like you?

92
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,685
And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.

93
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:51,352
I don't want Tara.
Plantations don't mean anything when...

94
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:55,989
You mean to say, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
that land doesn't mean anything to you?

95
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,932
Why, land is the only thing in the world
worth working for...

96
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,801
worth fighting for, worth dying for,
because it's the only thing that lasts.

97
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:06,399
- Oh, Pa, you talk like an Irishman.
- It's proud I am that I'm Irish.

98
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,036
And don't you be forgetting, missy,
that you're half Irish too.

99
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,512
And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood
in them...

100
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,812
why, the land they live on
is like their mother.

101
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:19,446
Oh, but you're just a child.
It'll come to you, this love of the land.

102
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,888
There's no getting away from it
if you're Irish.

103
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:47,840
Yonder she comes!

104
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,715
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,
your ma's home!

105
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,687
Acting like a wet nurse
to them low-down, poor white trash...

106
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:57,248
instead of being here eating her supper.
Cookie, stir up the fire!

107
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,817
Miss Ellen's got no business
wearing herself out.

108
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,831
Take the lamp out on the porch.
Wearing herself out.

109
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:04,991
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.

110
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,399
Wearing herself out
waiting on poor white trash.

111
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,563
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house like that.

112
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,335
Get up from there, boy.
Don't you hear Miss Ellen's coming?

113
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,740
Get out there and get her medicine chest.

114
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,409
We was getting worried about you,
Miss Ellen.

115
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,108
- Mr. Gerald...
- All right, Pork. I'm home.

116
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,212
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing
the creek bottom today.

117
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,881
What do you want me
to start on tomorrow?

118
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:30,687
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come
from Emmie Slattery's bedside.

119
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,384
Your child has been born.

120
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,726
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.

121
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,230
Has been born, and mercifully, has died.

122
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,762
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.

123
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,540
I'll fix your supper for you myself,
and you eats it.

124
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:47,735
After prayers, Mammy.

125
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,936
Yes, ma'am.

126
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,477
Mr. O'Hara.

127
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,675
You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.

128
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,310
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.

129
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,445
He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.

130
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:00,614
But...

131
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,183
- No!
- Yes.

132
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,323
The Yankee Wilkerson
and the white trash Slattery girl?

133
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,364
We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.

134
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:10,557
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.

135
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,034
I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!

136
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,803
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown is lovely.

137
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:24,573
- Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?
- But you may wear my garnets with it.

138
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,172
Why can't I stay up for the ball
tomorrow night?

139
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:28,910
Scarlett...

140
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,544
you look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.

141
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,786
I'm all right, Mother.

142
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,119
Why can't I stay up for the ball
tomorrow night?

143
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,284
I'm 13 now.

144
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,056
You may go to the barbecue
and stay up till supper.

145
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,427
I didn't want to wear
your tacky green dress anyhow.

146
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,522
Oh, hush up!

147
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,089
Prayers, girls.

148
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:56,677
"And to all the saints, that I have sinned
exceedingly in thought, word and deed...

149
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,343
"through my fault.

150
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:01,710
"Through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

151
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:05,517
"Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,
ever Virgin...

152
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,918
"Blessed Michael, the Archangel...

153
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,990
"Blessed John the Baptist...

154
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,323
"the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...

155
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,987
"and all the saints
to pray to the Lord, our God, for me. "

156
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:18,157
Ashley doesn't know I love him.

157
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:23,031
I'll tell him that I love him
and then he can't marry her.

158
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,332
"May the Almighty,
and most merciful Lord...

159
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,173
"grant us pardon, absolution...

160
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,336
"and remission of our sins. Amen. "

161
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,609
Just hold on and suck in.

162
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,717
Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.

163
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:42,389
You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.

164
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,050
Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!

165
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,424
You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.

166
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,521
No, I'm not!

167
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,327
Put on the dress, 'cause we're late already.

168
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,303
- What's my lamb gonna wear?
- That.

169
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,399
No you ain't! You can't show your bosom
before 3:00.

170
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,443
I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!

171
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,878
If you say one word to Mother,
I won't eat a bite.

172
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,943
Well...

173
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:20,925
Keep your shawl on.
I ain't aiming for you to get all freckled...

174
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:25,126
after the buttermilk I done put on you
all this winter, bleaching them freckles.

175
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,343
Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on
and be good, and eat just a little, honey.

176
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,469
No.

177
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,579
I'm going to have a good time today
and do my eating at the barbecue.

178
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,582
If you don't care what folks says
about this family, I does!

179
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,917
I has told you and told you
that you can always tell a lady...

180
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,116
by the way she eats with folks. Like a bird.

181
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,318
I ain't aiming for you to go to Mr. Wilkes'...

182
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,623
and eat like a field hand
and gobble like a hog!

183
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,027
Fiddle-dee-dee.

184
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,764
Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl
with a healthy appetite.

185
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,826
What gentlemen says and
what they thinks is two different things.

186
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,896
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley
asking to marry you!

187
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:24,959
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
of having it come right back up again.

188
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:30,431
Why does a girl have to be so silly
to catch a husband?

189
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:35,535
Scarlett, if you're not here by the time
I count ten, we'll be going without you!

190
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:36,999
I'm coming, Pa!

191
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,197
One...

192
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,901
two, three...

193
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,668
four, five, six...

194
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,772
Oh, dear!

195
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:48,778
My stays are so tight I know I'll never
get through the day without belching.

196
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,373
Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day
you'll be having for the barbecue.

197
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:20,381
So it seems, Gerald.
But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

198
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,576
She's after settling accounts
with the overseer.

199
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,516
But she'll be along for the ball tonight.

200
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,418
Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.

201
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,513
Thank you kindly, India.

202
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:31,287
Your daughter's getting prettier every day,
John.

203
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:34,625
India, here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.

204
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,133
I can't stand Scarlett. If you see
the way she throws herself at Ashley.

205
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,225
Now, that's your brother's business.

206
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,930
You must remember your duties
as hostess.

207
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:45,235
Good morning, girls. You're looking lovely.

208
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,435
Good morning, Scarlett.

209
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,501
Why, India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!

210
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,944
- Perfectly lovely, darling.
- I just can't take my eyes off it.

211
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,942
Scarlett, honey...

212
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,010
You're looking mighty fine this morning.

213
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:01,386
- Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
- Good morning.

214
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:04,016
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- Good morning.

215
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,321
Howdy, Miss Scarlett.

216
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:07,853
Ashley!

217
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,890
Scarlett, my dear.

218
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,596
I've been looking for you everywhere.

219
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,639
I've got something I must tell you.

220
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:21,298
- Can't we go some place where it's quiet?
- Yes, I'd like to, but I...

221
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,375
I have something to tell you, too.

222
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,209
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.

223
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,616
But come say hello
to my cousin Melanie, first.

224
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,277
Oh, do we have to?

225
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,420
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again.

226
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:35,547
Melanie!

227
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,283
Here's Scarlett.

228
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:39,716
Scarlett!

229
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,857
I'm so glad to see you again.

230
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,923
Melanie Hamilton!
What a surprise to run into you here.

231
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,294
I hope you'll stay with us
a few days at least.

232
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,828
I hope I shall stay long enough for us
to become real friends, Scarlett.

233
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,238
I do so want us to be.

234
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,105
We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?

235
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,611
We'll just have to make
the biggest fuss over her.

236
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,911
If there's anybody knows how to give
a girl a good time, it's Ashley.

237
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:04,817
Though I expect our good times will seem
silly to you because you're so serious.

238
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,447
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

239
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,013
I've always admired you so.

240
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,718
I wish I could be more like you.

241
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,728
You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,
and say things you don't mean.

242
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,197
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

243
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,859
Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?

244
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,335
Ashley never means a word he says
to any girl.

245
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:26,397
Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!

246
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,942
But, oh, Miss O'Hara, I...

247
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,444
Was it kind to bring
your good-looking brother here...

248
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,003
just to break my poor, simple,
country girl's heart?

249
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:35,050
She never even noticed Charles before.

250
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,585
Because he's your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.

251
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,121
Charles Hamilton,
I want to eat barbecue with you.

252
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:43,989
Mind you, don't go philandering with
any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.

253
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,458
I won't, Miss O'Hara!

254
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,190
I couldn't!

255
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,392
I do declare, Frank Kennedy,
if you don't look dashing...

256
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,797
with that new set of whiskers!

257
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,358
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

258
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:57,533
Charles and Rafe asked me
to eat barbecue with them...

259
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,870
but I told them I couldn't
because I promised you.

260
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:03,537
You needn't be so amused. Look at her!
She's after your beau now!

261
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,744
Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.

262
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:09,273
I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.

263
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:12,045
What's your sister so mad about?
You sparking her beau?

264
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,181
As if I couldn't get a better beau
than that old maid in britches.

265
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:18,784
Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome
old things, you! No, you're not!

266
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,385
I won't say that. I'm mad at you!

267
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:21,451
What have we done?

268
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,964
You haven't been near me all day.
I wore this dress...

269
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,260
'cause I thought you liked it.

270
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,393
I was counting on eating barbecue
with you two.

271
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,664
- Well, you are, Scarlett.
- Of course you are.

272
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:33,674
Oh, I never can make up my mind
which of you two is the handsomer.

273
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,172
I was awake all last night
trying to figure it out.

274
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:44,480
Cathleen, who's that?

275
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,577
Who?

276
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:47,679
That man looking at us and smiling.

277
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,250
The nasty, dark one.

278
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:53,385
My dear, don't you know?
That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.

279
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,589
He has the most terrible reputation.

280
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:03,666
He looks as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy!

281
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,797
Scarlett!

282
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,971
Why, my dear, he isn't received!

283
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,800
He spends a lot of time up North...

284
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:11,505
because his folks in Charleston
won't even speak to him.

285
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,912
He was expelled from West Point,
he's so fast.

286
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:17,247
And then there's that business
about that girl he wouldn't marry.

287
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,343
Tell, tell!

288
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,752
Well, he took her out buggy riding
in the late afternoon without a chaperon!

289
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,816
And then he refused to marry her!

290
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,025
No, but she was ruined just the same.

291
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,297
Ashley!

292
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:40,566
Happy?

293
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:41,665
So happy!

294
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,539
You seem to belong here...

295
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,415
as if it had all been imagined for you.

296
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:52,218
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.

297
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,879
You love Twelve Oaks as I do.

298
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,014
Yes, Ashley.

299
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:56,914
I love it as...

300
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:58,516
as more than a house.

301
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:03,154
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.

302
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,459
It's so unaware that it may not last...

303
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,293
forever.

304
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,634
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes, aren't you?

305
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,366
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

306
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,410
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

307
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:18,709
Whatever comes...

308
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,144
I'll love you, just as I do now...

309
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,044
until I die.

310
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,889
Isn't this better than sitting at a table?

311
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,427
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her
at a table.

312
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,922
I'll go get her dessert.

313
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,398
- Here, she said me.
- Allow me, Miss O'Hara.

314
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,830
I think...

315
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,938
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

316
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,205
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!

317
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:52,975
Thank you.

318
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:54,341
Go get it.

319
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,643
Isn't he the luckiest?

320
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,983
Miss O'Hara...

321
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,517
I love you.

322
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,531
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.

323
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:17,735
Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.

324
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:20,338
Well-brought-up young ladies
take naps at parties.

325
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:24,368
It's high time you started behaving and
acting like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

326
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:27,847
When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice
any Yankee girls taking naps.

327
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:31,784
No, and you ain't gonna see
no Yankee girls at the ball tonight, neither.

328
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:33,546
How was Ashley today, Scarlett?

329
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:36,216
He didn't seem to be paying
much attention to you.

330
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,986
You mind your own business!

331
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,460
You'll be lucky not to lose
old whisker-face Kennedy.

332
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:41,962
You've liked Ashley for months!

333
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,658
Pa said that his engagement's
gonna be announced tonight.

334
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,098
That's all you know.

335
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:49,126
Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!
You all behave yourselves.

336
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,899
Acting like poor white trash children!

337
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:54,465
If you's old enough to go to parties,
you's old enough to act like ladies.

338
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:55,669
Who cares!

339
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,387
We've borne enough insults
from the meddling Yankees.

340
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,126
It's time we made them understand
we'll keep our slaves...

341
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,531
with or without their approval.

342
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:57,003
'Twas Georgia's sovereign right
to secede from the Union!

343
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,061
That's right!

344
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,631
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.

345
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:04,873
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!

346
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:07,413
- There's no other way!
- Fight! That's right. Fight!

347
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,211
Let the Yankees ask for peace!

348
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:12,913
The situation is very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.

349
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:15,388
There won't even be a battle.

350
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,084
They'll just turn and run every time.

351
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,956
One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.

352
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:20,858
We'll finish them in one battle.

353
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,954
Gentlemen can always fight better
than rabble.

354
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:25,431
Yes, gentlemen always can fight better
than rabble.

355
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,661
What does the captain of our troop say?

356
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,272
Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights,
I go with her.

357
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:35,369
But, like my father, I hope the Yankees
will let us leave the Union in peace.

358
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,708
- But, Ashley...
- But, Ashley, they've insulted us!

359
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,246
You can't mean you don't want war!

360
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:42,750
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.

361
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,844
And when the wars were over
no one ever knew what they were about.

362
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,389
If it wasn't that I knew you...

363
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:52,484
Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been
up North, I hear.

364
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:54,686
Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?

365
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,790
I think it's hard winning a war with words,
gentlemen.

366
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,265
What do you mean, sir?

367
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:02,165
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.

368
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,262
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?

369
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:07,604
Lt'll make a great deal of difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.

370
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,440
Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,
that the Yankees can lick us?

371
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:11,570
No, I'm not hinting.

372
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,877
I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees
are better equipped than we.

373
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,214
They've got factories, shipyards,
coal mines...

374
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:20,118
and a fleet to bottle up our harbors
and starve us to death.

375
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:23,521
All we've got is cotton and slaves
and arrogance.

376
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:27,119
- That's treacherous!
- I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!

377
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,886
I'm sorry if the truth offends you.

378
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:31,262
Apologies aren't enough, sir!

379
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,234
I hear you were turned out of West Point,
Mr. Rhett Butler...

380
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:38,534
and you aren't received by any decent
family in Charleston, not even your own!

381
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:45,947
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.

382
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,608
Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about
and look over your place.

383
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:53,984
I seem to be spoiling
everybody's brandy and cigars and...

384
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,518
dreams of victory.

385
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:06,258
That's just about what you could expect
from somebody like Rhett Butler.

386
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,131
You did everything but call him out.

387
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:09,363
He refused to fight.

388
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,235
Not quite that, Charles.
He refused to take advantage of you.

389
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:13,331
Take advantage of me?

390
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:16,866
He's one of the best shots in the country,
as he's proved several times...

391
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,742
against steadier hands and cooler heads.

392
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:20,007
- I'll show him!
- No, please.

393
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:22,606
Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.

394
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:25,517
You may be needed
for more important fighting, Charles.

395
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,254
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler is our guest.

396
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:30,416
I think I'll just show him around.

397
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,263
Ashley!

398
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,438
Ashley!

399
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,873
Scarlett.

400
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,946
Who are you hiding from in here?

401
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:05,921
What are you up to?

402
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:10,989
Well, why aren't you upstairs
resting with the other girls?

403
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,325
What is this, Scarlett? A secret?

404
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:17,102
Oh, Ashley, Ashley...

405
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:18,932
I love you.

406
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:20,265
Scarlett!

407
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,809
I love you, I do!

408
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:27,875
Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered
every other man's heart today?

409
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:30,349
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.

410
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,045
Oh, don't tease me now.

411
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,918
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you.

412
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,619
You mustn't say such things.
You'll hate me for hearing them.

413
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:42,891
Oh, I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.

414
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,425
Oh, you do care, don't you?

415
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,794
Yes...

416
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:49,429
I care.

417
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:53,806
Oh, can't we go away and forget
we ever said these things?

418
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,305
But how can we do that?

419
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:59,876
Don't you want to marry me?

420
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,539
I'm going to marry Melanie.

421
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:04,049
But you can't. Not if you care for me.

422
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,347
Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?

423
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,315
How can I make you understand?

424
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,516
You're so young and unthinking.

425
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:14,118
You don't know what marriage means.

426
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:16,629
I know I love you
and I want to be your wife.

427
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,164
You don't love Melanie.

428
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,833
She's like me, Scarlett.

429
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,965
She's part of my blood
and we understand each other.

430
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,136
But you love me.

431
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:27,000
How could I help loving you?

432
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,909
You have all the passion for life that I lack.

433
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:32,674
That kind of love isn't enough
for a successful marriage...

434
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,408
for two people as different as we are.

435
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:37,576
Well, why don't you say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

436
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:40,212
You'd rather live with that fool
who can't speak except...

437
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:43,985
to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel
of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.

438
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,822
You mustn't say such things
about Melanie.

439
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:47,259
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?

440
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:50,093
You led me on, you made me believe
you wanted to marry me.

441
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,497
Now, Scarlett, be fair.
I never, at any time...

442
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:56,094
You did, it's true you did!
I'll hate you till I die!

443
00:30:56,705 --> 00:31:00,004
I can't think of anything bad enough
to call you.

444
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,866
Has the war started?

445
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,872
Sir, you should have made
your presence known.

446
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:35,335
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?

447
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,738
That wouldn't have been very tactful,
would it?

448
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,372
But don't worry,
your secret is safe with me.

449
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,075
Sir, you are no gentleman!

450
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,277
And you, miss, are no lady.

451
00:31:44,753 --> 00:31:46,584
Don't think I hold that against you.

452
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,383
Ladies have never held any charm for me.

453
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:51,482
First you take a low, common advantage
of me, then you insult me.

454
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,995
I meant it as a compliment
and I hope to see more of you...

455
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:57,896
when you're free of the spell
of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.

456
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:02,232
He doesn't strike me as half good enough
for a girl of your... What was it?

457
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,937
Your "passion for living. "

458
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,767
How dare you!
You aren't fit to wipe his boots.

459
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,168
And you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life.

460
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:17,641
She certainly made a fool of herself
running after all the men at the barbecue.

461
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,380
That's not fair, India.

462
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:22,218
She's so attractive,
the men just naturally flock to her.

463
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,224
Oh, Melanie, you're just too good
to be true.

464
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:26,658
Didn't you see her
going after your brother Charles?

465
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,696
Yes, and she knows
Charles belongs to me.

466
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:30,390
Oh, you're wrong, India.

467
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:33,525
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.

468
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:36,564
Men may flirt with girls like that
but they don't marry them.

469
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,833
I think you're being very mean to her.

470
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:50,451
War! War's declared! War!

471
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,529
Miss O'Hara!

472
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,728
Miss O'Hara!

473
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:11,301
Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,
volunteers to fight against us.

474
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:13,966
Don't you men ever think
about anything important?

475
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,203
But it's war and everybody's going off
to enlist.

476
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:18,040
They're going right away. I'm going, too.

477
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,170
Everybody?

478
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,885
Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?

479
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,747
To see us go, I mean.

480
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,357
I'll cry into my pillow every night.

481
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:32,483
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.

482
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,063
You're the most beautiful girl in the world,
and the sweetest and the dearest.

483
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,496
I know I couldn't hope
that you could love me.

484
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:43,025
I'm so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you.

485
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,972
But if you could think of marrying me,
I'd do anything in the world for you.

486
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,565
Just anything. I promise.

487
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,372
What did you say?

488
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:53,411
Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?

489
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,021
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.

490
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,953
You will? You'll marry me?
You'll wait for me?

491
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:05,723
I don't think I'd want to wait.

492
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,227
You mean you'll marry me before I go?

493
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,698
Oh, Miss O'Hara.

494
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,494
Scarlett...

495
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:15,592
When may I speak to your father?

496
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,728
The sooner the better.

497
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,362
I'll go now. I can't wait.

498
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,339
Will you excuse me, dear?

499
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,145
Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.

500
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,308
It'll be a week at least
before they call on me.

501
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:32,512
Only a week, and then they'll take you
away from me.

502
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,148
Scarlett, I thought of you
at our wedding yesterday...

503
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:11,316
and I hoped that yours would be
as beautiful, and it was.

504
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,984
Was it?

505
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:15,828
Now we're really and truly sisters.

506
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,987
- Charles.
- Melanie.

507
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:29,035
Don't cry, darling.
The war will be over in a few weeks...

508
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,237
and I'll be coming back to you.

509
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:16,316
Miss Scarlett!

510
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:20,555
Well, I don't care.
I'm too young to be a widow.

511
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,225
Miss Scarlett!

512
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:26,426
Why, I'd just go around scaring people
in that thing.

513
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:30,130
You ain't supposed to be around people.
You's in mourning.

514
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:32,502
For what? I don't feel anything.

515
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,769
Why should I have to pretend
and pretend...

516
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:37,810
What is it?

517
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,807
Oh, baby...

518
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,414
What is it?

519
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:44,883
My life is over.

520
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,779
Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.

521
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:51,555
Oh, Mother.

522
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,120
I know you'll think I'm horrible,
but I just can't bear going around in black.

523
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,058
It's bad enough not being able
to go to any parties...

524
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,760
but looking this way, too.

525
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,735
I don't think you're at all horrible.

526
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,934
It's only natural to want to look young
and be young when you are young.

527
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,037
Oh, baby...

528
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:11,979
How would you like
to go visiting somewhere?

529
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:13,206
Savannah, perhaps?

530
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,340
What would I do in Savannah?

531
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,108
Well, Atlanta, then.

532
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:19,443
There's lots going on there.

533
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,614
And you could stay
with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.

534
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:24,551
Melanie.

535
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:26,151
Yes.

536
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,223
Yes, I could, couldn't I?

537
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:31,424
Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,
sweeter than anybody in the world.

538
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:32,931
You'd like it, really?

539
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:36,699
All right then.
Now stop your crying and smile.

540
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,200
You can take Prissy with you.

541
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:43,141
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,
Mammy.

542
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,378
I'll go write the necessary letters.

543
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:49,371
Atlanta!

544
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,817
Savannah would be better for you.
You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.

545
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,411
What trouble are you talking about?

546
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:58,186
You know what trouble I's talking about.
I's talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.

547
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:00,386
He'll come to Atlanta
when he gets his leave...

548
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,986
and you're sitting there
waiting for him like a spider!

549
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:06,397
- He belongs to Miss Melanie...
- You go pack my things like Mother said.

550
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:30,185
They're all whispering,
and I just know it's about her.

551
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:32,249
What's it matter what they say,
Aunt Pittypat?

552
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:36,956
But Scarlett is living under my roof,
so they all think I'm responsible for her.

553
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,795
And for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering!

554
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,496
Every time I think of it I feel faint!

555
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:47,903
Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the cause.

556
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:51,035
It was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice.

557
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,908
Anyone would think, to hear you talk...

558
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,472
that she came here to dance
instead of to sell things.

559
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,559
Ladies and gentlemen!

560
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:13,327
I have important news! Glorious news!

561
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:16,795
Another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms.

562
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,769
General Lee has completely
whipped the enemy...

563
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:24,835
and swept the Yankee Army
northward from Virginia.

564
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,083
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.

565
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:41,688
We have with us tonight that most daring
of all blockade-runners...

566
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:45,624
whose fleet schooners,
slipping past the Yankee guns...

567
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,534
have brought us here the very woolens
and laces we wear tonight.

568
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:53,798
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that
will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.

569
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:56,806
None other than our friend
from Charleston...

570
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:58,669
Capt. Rhett Butler!

571
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,033
Permit me.

572
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,536
Capt. Butler, it's such a pleasure
to see you again.

573
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,868
I met you last at my husband's home.

574
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:33,208
That's kind of you to remember,
Mrs. Wilkes.

575
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,242
Did you meet Capt. Butler
at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?

576
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,410
Yes, I think so.

577
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,314
Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.
It was in the library.

578
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:43,289
You had broken something.

579
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:46,826
Yes, Capt. Butler, I remember you.

580
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:50,921
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for
your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.

581
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,057
We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.

582
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:54,396
Wait.

583
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:57,368
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes
and Mrs. Hamilton.

584
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,737
Thank you, Capt. Butler.

585
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,668
Just a moment, please.

586
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,503
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.

587
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:10,213
It may help my husband more,
off my finger.

588
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:11,977
Thank you.

589
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:17,015
That's a very beautiful thing to do,
Mrs. Wilkes.

590
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,583
Here.

591
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:21,419
You can have mine, too, for the cause.

592
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:27,566
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.

593
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,167
- Melanie!
- Yes, Dr. Meade.

594
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,636
I need your approval,
as a member of the Committee...

595
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,231
for something we want to do
that's rather shocking.

596
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,642
Will you excuse us, please?

597
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:42,442
I'll say one thing. The war makes
the most peculiar widows.

598
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:43,877
I wish you'd go away.

599
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:47,148
If you had any raising you'd know
I'd never want to see you again.

600
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,491
Now, why be silly?

601
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,723
You've no reason for hating me.
I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.

602
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,026
I guess I'd be very unpatriotic
to hate one of the great heroes of the war.

603
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:04,868
I do declare I was surprised to see you
turn out to be such a noble character.

604
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,431
I can't bear to take advantage
of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.

605
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:10,568
I'm neither noble nor heroic.

606
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,109
But you are a blockade-runner?

607
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,238
For profit, and profit only.

608
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,678
Are you telling me
you don't believe in the cause?

609
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:19,379
I believe in Rhett Butler.
He's the only cause I know.

610
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,784
The rest doesn't mean much to me.

611
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:26,360
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

612
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,429
I have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital.

613
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:35,328
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening
reel with the lady of your choice...

614
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,365
you must bid for her.

615
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:41,933
Caroline Meade, how can you permit
your husband to conduct this...

616
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,636
this slave auction?

617
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:46,271
Dolly Merriwether,
how dare you criticize me!

618
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,205
Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...

619
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:51,251
that if it's for the benefit of the cause,
it's quite all right.

620
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,512
She did!

621
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:55,612
Oh dear, oh dear.
Where are my smelling salts?

622
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,252
I think I shall faint.

623
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,656
Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.

624
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,421
If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.

625
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,462
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?
Make your offers.

626
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,062
Don't be bashful, gentlemen.

627
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,772
$20. $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.

628
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:16,103
$25 for Miss Fanny Elsing.

629
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,304
Only $25 to give your...

630
00:43:18,446 --> 00:43:20,505
$150 in gold.

631
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:22,242
For what lady, sir?

632
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,317
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

633
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:28,313
For whom, sir?

634
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,381
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

635
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,619
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,
Capt. Butler...

636
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:35,490
but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles
would be proud to...

637
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:39,021
Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

638
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:42,029
She will not consider it, sir.

639
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,600
Oh, yes, I will.

640
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,751
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.

641
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:02,179
We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.

642
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:04,190
It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?

643
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:05,247
It's worse.

644
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:07,260
But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.

645
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:09,455
I don't care what you expect
or what they think.

646
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,827
I'm going to dance and dance.

647
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,924
Tonight I wouldn't mind
dancing with Abe Lincoln himself.

648
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,360
Another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever.

649
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,835
With enough courage,
you can do without a reputation.

650
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:52,372
Oh, you do talk scandalous.

651
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,045
You do waltz divinely, Capt. Butler.

652
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:07,084
Don't start flirting with me.
I'm not one of your plantation beaux.

653
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:09,451
I want more than flirting from you.

654
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,617
What do you want?

655
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:16,428
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take
that Southern belle simper off your face.

656
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,822
Some day I want you to say to me...

657
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:21,732
the words I heard you say
to Ashley Wilkes:

658
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:23,262
"I love you. "

659
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:28,036
That's something you'll never hear from
me, Capt. Butler, as long as you live.

660
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:50,824
How sweet, how kind.

661
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:52,866
He is a thoughtful gentleman.

662
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:56,664
Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say
something about my sacrifice?

663
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:06,671
Oh, the darling thing.

664
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:08,681
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.

665
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,943
You didn't really bring it all the way
from Paris just for me.

666
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,477
Yes, I thought it was about time
I got you out of that fake mourning.

667
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:18,849
Next trip, I'll bring you some green silk
for a frock to match it.

668
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:19,950
Oh, Rhett.

669
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:25,298
It's my duty to our brave boys at the front
to keep our girls at home looking pretty.

670
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,434
Oh, it's so long
since I've had anything new.

671
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:40,204
How do I look?

672
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:43,346
Awful! Just awful.

673
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:44,946
Why, what's the matter?

674
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,576
This war has stopped being a joke...

675
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:49,919
when a girl like you doesn't know
how to wear the latest fashion.

676
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:57,624
Oh, Rhett, let me do it.

677
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,971
But, Rhett, I don't know
how I'd dare wear it.

678
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,966
You will, though.

679
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:11,300
And another thing. Those pantalets.

680
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,313
I don't know a woman in Paris
who wears pantalets anymore.

681
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:15,540
Oh, what do they...

682
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:18,243
You shouldn't talk about such things.

683
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,308
You little hypocrite.

684
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:21,911
You don't mind my knowing about them,
just my talking.

685
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:25,823
I really can't go on accepting these gifts,
though you are awfully kind.

686
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:27,827
I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.

687
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:31,763
I never give anything without expecting
something in return. I always get paid.

688
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,528
If you think I'll marry you to pay
for the bonnet, I won't.

689
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,967
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.

690
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:40,267
Well, I won't kiss you for it, either.

691
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,380
Open your eyes and look at me.

692
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:55,755
No, I don't think I will kiss you...

693
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:57,518
although you need kissing badly.

694
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:58,922
That's what's wrong with you.

695
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:01,927
You should be kissed, and often.
And by someone who knows how.

696
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:04,657
Oh, and I suppose you think
you're the proper person.

697
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:07,530
I might be, if the right moment ever came.

698
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:10,731
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,
Rhett Butler.

699
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,534
And I don't know why
I let you come and see me.

700
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:15,501
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.

701
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:17,771
Because I'm the only man over 16
and under 60...

702
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:20,143
who's around to show you a good time.

703
00:48:20,214 --> 00:48:22,774
But cheer up,
the war can't last much longer.

704
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,383
Really, Rhett? Why?

705
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:28,080
There's a battle going on right now
that ought to pretty well fix things...

706
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,213
one way or the other.

707
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:31,189
Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?

708
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:36,060
You haven't gotten the wooden-headed
Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.

709
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,461
Yes, I suppose he's in it.

710
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:39,522
Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?

711
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,996
Some little town in Pennsylvania
called Gettysburg.

712
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,434
Casualty list.

713
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:05,543
Here you is, Miss Melanie.

714
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:08,315
They was fighting for them,
so it just got tore in half.

715
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,387
Scarlett, you look. The "W's" at the end.

716
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:18,662
"Wellman, Wendell, White,
Whitner, Wilkins...

717
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,527
"Williams, Woolsey, Workman. "

718
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,865
Scarlett, you've passed him.

719
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,301
Oh, he isn't there!

720
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:26,361
He isn't there!

721
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,635
Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.

722
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,870
Oh, he's safe, he's safe.

723
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:36,706
Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet
to worry about Ashley like this for me.

724
00:50:44,157 --> 00:50:45,590
I must go to her.

725
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,891
Don't, my dear, not here.

726
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:51,125
Let's go home.

727
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,328
Dr. Meade, not...

728
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:57,063
Yes, our boy, Darcy.

729
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:00,534
I was making these mittens for him.

730
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,972
He won't need them now.

731
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:07,439
Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show them.
I'll kill all those Yankees.

732
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:08,879
Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.

733
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:12,112
You think it'll help your mother
to have you off getting shot, too?

734
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:13,743
I never heard of anything so silly.

735
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,451
It's a black day, Scarlett.
You haven't had bad news, have you?

736
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:20,753
Ashley's safe.

737
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,522
I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.

738
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:24,188
Rhett, there are so many others.

739
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:25,288
Any of your friends?

740
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:29,096
Just about every family in the county.
The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.

741
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,866
Yes, look at them.
All these poor tragic people.

742
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:37,234
The South's sinking to its knees.
It'll never rise again.

743
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,342
The cause...

744
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:42,774
The cause of living in the past
is dying right in front of us.

745
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,918
I never heard you talk like that before.

746
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:49,149
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.
And that's what all this is, sheer waste.

747
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,882
But don't you be downcast.

748
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,629
Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home
to the women who love him...

749
00:51:56,964 --> 00:51:58,363
both of them.

750
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:36,626
Oh, you're here.

751
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,009
Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.

752
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,505
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.

753
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:48,112
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.

754
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:54,111
Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.

755
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:56,919
Scarlett, dear.

756
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,125
Well, is this any way to greet
a returning warrior?

757
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:04,987
Ashley, I...

758
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,136
Merry Christmas, Ashley.

759
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:22,212
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We've got all your wives.

760
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:24,883
We've got all your little chicks.

761
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,079
You got nobody to worry your head
about leaving.

762
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:29,546
Come on.

763
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:34,326
Now you just stand still so you can be
a Christmas gift for the white folks.

764
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,126
Now hold on.

765
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,588
Hold on!

766
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:40,356
Don't go getting so uppity...

767
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:42,834
even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.

768
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:47,537
Let's not talk about the war.
It's Christmas.

769
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:51,538
Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara,
and all the times before the war.

770
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:53,135
Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?

771
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:55,613
Why did you say there wasn't enough,
Uncle Peter?

772
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:59,209
There's plenty. It's the very last
of my father's fine Madeira.

773
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:03,321
He got it from his uncle,
Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...

774
00:54:03,423 --> 00:54:06,756
who married his cousin,
Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...

775
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,589
who was his second cousin once removed
and a kin to the Wilkeses, too.

776
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:14,098
I saved it to wish Ashley
a Merry Christmas.

777
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:18,565
But you mustn't drink it all at once
because it is the last.

778
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:26,140
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.

779
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,879
Only generals have tunics like this
nowadays.

780
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:30,712
I'm so happy you like it, dear.

781
00:54:30,784 --> 00:54:32,581
Where did you get the cloth?

782
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,779
It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.

783
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:39,485
I nursed her son while he was in
the hospital, Ashley, before he died and...

784
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:42,187
Oh, you will take good care of it,
won't you?

785
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:44,355
You won't let it get torn.

786
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:45,856
Promise me.

787
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:47,092
You mustn't worry.

788
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:51,002
I'll bring it back to you
without any holes in it, I promise.

789
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:55,031
Good night, my dear.

790
00:54:55,108 --> 00:54:57,372
Good night, Scarlett, darling.

791
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,690
Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,
for Mr. Ashley to leave?

792
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:14,624
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.

793
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:18,152
She isn't going to the depot with him?
She hasn't changed her mind?

794
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,960
No, ma'am. She's laying down.

795
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:24,265
She's so upset Mr. Wilkes told her
she can't even come downstairs.

796
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:31,535
Ashley!

797
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:38,546
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.

798
00:55:39,052 --> 00:55:42,215
Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you
as you are now...

799
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:44,189
not shivering at the depot.

800
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,451
All right.

801
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:49,428
Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.

802
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:58,767
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.

803
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,970
Tie it on me, my dear.

804
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:06,043
While Melly was making your new tunic,
I made this to go with it.

805
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:08,443
You made it yourself?

806
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,782
Well, then I shall value it all the more.

807
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:15,045
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

808
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:17,819
There's something you can do for me.

809
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:19,256
What is it?

810
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:22,052
Will you look after Melanie for me?

811
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,996
She's so frail and gentle
and she loves you so much.

812
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,590
You see, if I were killed and she...

813
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:31,501
Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.
Say a prayer quickly.

814
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:32,970
You say one for me.

815
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,507
We shall need all our prayers
now the end is coming.

816
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:38,700
The end?

817
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,541
The end of the war.

818
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,706
And the end of our world, Scarlett.

819
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:47,283
But, Ashley, you don't think
the Yankees are beating us?

820
00:56:47,354 --> 00:56:50,323
Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...

821
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:53,824
and the snow in Virginia is deep.

822
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:56,122
When I see them...

823
00:56:56,263 --> 00:57:00,597
and I see the Yankees coming
and coming, always more and more...

824
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:06,766
Well, when the end does come
I shall be far away.

825
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:10,538
It'll be a comfort to me to know
that she has you.

826
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,038
You will promise, won't you?

827
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:16,707
Yes.

828
00:57:17,984 --> 00:57:19,815
Is that all, Ashley?

829
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,350
All except goodbye.

830
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,949
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.

831
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,186
- You must be brave...
- No...

832
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,557
You must.

833
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,853
How else can I bear going?

834
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:35,527
Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine
and strong and beautiful.

835
00:57:36,736 --> 00:57:39,261
Not just your sweet face, my dear...

836
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:41,004
but you.

837
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:46,639
Ashley, kiss me.

838
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,841
Kiss me goodbye!

839
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:56,550
No, Scarlett.

840
00:57:56,623 --> 00:57:58,557
Oh, Ashley, I love you.

841
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:01,955
I've always loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.

842
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:04,656
I only married Charles just to hurt you.

843
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,097
Ashley, tell me you love me.

844
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,461
I'll live on it the rest of my life.

845
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:13,534
Goodbye.

846
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:35,556
When the war is over, Ashley.

847
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:38,330
When the war is over.

848
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:01,181
And there's a place back home...

849
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:04,946
where a wild plum tree comes to flower
in the springtime.

850
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,881
Down by the creek, you know.

851
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,755
Yes, I know, I know.

852
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,021
When we were little,
my brother Jeff and I used to...

853
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:17,533
I told you about my brother Jeff,
didn't I, ma'am?

854
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:19,392
I know I did.

855
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:20,629
He...

856
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:23,737
We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.

857
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:27,473
Since Bull Run we haven't heard
anything and...

858
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:30,445
Please, we must have
your temperature now.

859
00:59:30,514 --> 00:59:32,982
Just take this in your mouth
and not talk anymore.

860
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,483
Not just now.

861
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:37,783
Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home.

862
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,981
Aren't you tired, Melanie?

863
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:43,385
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

864
00:59:44,428 --> 00:59:45,986
This might be...

865
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:47,257
Ashley.

866
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:50,698
And only strangers here to comfort him.

867
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,261
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

868
00:59:54,338 --> 00:59:56,033
They could all be...

869
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:57,768
Ashley.

870
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:14,116
I've been sitting by this curb one solid
hour waiting to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.

871
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,887
Go on, you trash,
don't you be pestering these ladies.

872
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,484
Don't talk to her, Melly.

873
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:20,928
It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?

874
01:00:20,998 --> 01:00:23,523
My name's Belle Watling.
But that don't matter.

875
01:00:23,634 --> 01:00:25,829
I expect you think
I've got no business here.

876
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,564
Hadn't you best tell me
what you want to see me about?

877
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,870
First time I come here, I says,
"Belle, you're a nurse. "

878
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:34,206
But the ladies didn't want
my kind of nursing.

879
01:00:34,277 --> 01:00:36,268
Well, they was more than likely right.

880
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:38,473
Then I tried giving them money.

881
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,778
My money wasn't good enough
for them, either.

882
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:42,182
Old peahens!

883
01:00:42,753 --> 01:00:45,313
I know a gentleman
who says you're a human being.

884
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:49,120
If you are, which they ain't,
you'll take my money for the hospital.

885
01:00:49,192 --> 01:00:52,286
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?

886
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:54,353
This time I'm conversing with Miss Wilkes.

887
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:56,524
You might as well take my money,
Miss Wilkes.

888
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,625
It's good money, even if it is mine.

889
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:00,294
I'm sure you're very generous.

890
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,703
No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate
like everybody else, that's all.

891
01:01:03,774 --> 01:01:05,298
Of course you are.

892
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,639
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.

893
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,805
But maybe they ain't
as good Christians as you.

894
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:20,284
Look, Mrs. Meade.
It's a great deal of money.

895
01:01:20,624 --> 01:01:22,785
$10, $20, $30, $50.

896
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:25,891
And it's not our paper money. It's gold.

897
01:01:26,063 --> 01:01:27,997
Let me see that handkerchief.

898
01:01:28,065 --> 01:01:29,293
"R. B."

899
01:01:31,535 --> 01:01:34,732
And she's driving away
in Rhett Butler's carriage!

900
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:39,640
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady
what wouldn't I tell that varmint!

901
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,543
"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

902
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,715
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

903
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,374
"He leadeth...

904
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:25,051
"He restoreth my soul.

905
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:29,482
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

906
01:02:29,693 --> 01:02:33,254
"Yeah, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

907
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,161
"I will fear no evil.

908
01:02:35,232 --> 01:02:36,756
"For thou art with me.

909
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:39,666
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "

910
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:41,328
Yankees!

911
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:44,999
Yankees!
Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.

912
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:48,533
They'll never get into Atlanta. They'll
never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.

913
01:02:48,612 --> 01:02:50,273
We'll be safe in the hospital.

914
01:02:50,447 --> 01:02:52,677
Give me something for the pain.

915
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,011
Give me something for the pain!

916
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:58,213
Sorry, son, we haven't got anything
to give you.

917
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:01,756
These animals is driving me crazy!

918
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:04,578
What luck! You've got my jack!

919
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:07,247
Give me an ace and I'll start another war!

920
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:08,983
I'll bid the moon!

921
01:03:12,894 --> 01:03:16,955
I'll never see you or Pa again.

922
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:19,662
This leg's got to come off, soldier.

923
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,066
No, no! Leave me alone!

924
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,296
I'm sorry, soldier.

925
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:25,305
We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.

926
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:27,034
Then we'll have to operate without it.

927
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:28,905
No, no! Leave me alone!

928
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:31,241
You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!

929
01:03:31,313 --> 01:03:34,544
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off
immediately. It's gangrene.

930
01:03:34,616 --> 01:03:36,675
No, no! Don't!

931
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:39,481
I haven't seen my family in three days.

932
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:41,886
I'm going home for half an hour.

933
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,548
Orderly! Give me a lift.

934
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:49,926
Nurse, you can free this bed.

935
01:03:50,932 --> 01:03:52,456
Miss Scarlett!

936
01:03:54,102 --> 01:03:55,797
Why, Frank Kennedy!

937
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,929
Miss Suellen, is she well?

938
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:01,302
When did they bring you in?
You all right? Are you badly hurt?

939
01:04:01,376 --> 01:04:03,970
- But Miss Suellen, is she...
- She's all right, but I...

940
01:04:04,045 --> 01:04:05,945
Dr. Wilson needs you
in the operating room.

941
01:04:06,014 --> 01:04:09,006
He's going to take off that leg.
Better hurry.

942
01:04:10,285 --> 01:04:11,718
I'll be back.

943
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:15,812
No, no, leave me alone!

944
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:19,021
No, no, I can't stand it!

945
01:04:19,461 --> 01:04:22,089
No don't! Don't cut!

946
01:04:22,864 --> 01:04:24,195
Don't cut!

947
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:26,563
Don't, don't!

948
01:04:26,935 --> 01:04:28,061
Please!

949
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,165
Where's the nurse?

950
01:04:34,743 --> 01:04:35,767
Dr. Wilson's waiting.

951
01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:38,039
Let him wait! I'm going home!
I've done enough.

952
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:41,605
I don't want any more men dying!
I don't want any more!

953
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:43,972
Big Sam!

954
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:46,947
Big Sam! Big Sam!

955
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:50,540
Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett!

956
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:51,778
Big Sam!

957
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,446
Big Sam!

958
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:56,888
Sam, 'Lige, 'Postel, Prophet!
I'm so glad to see you!

959
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:59,654
Tell me about Tara, about my mother.
She didn't write me.

960
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:01,786
- She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett.
- Sick?

961
01:06:01,863 --> 01:06:03,353
Just a little bit sick, that's all.

962
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:07,026
Your pa was wild when they wouldn't
let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.

963
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:11,232
He had fits when they took us field hands
to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.

964
01:06:11,306 --> 01:06:13,137
But your ma says
the Confederacy needs us.

965
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,641
So we's gonna dig for the South.

966
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:15,835
Sam, was there a doctor?

967
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:17,036
Ma'am, we've got to march.

968
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:19,945
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.

969
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:23,711
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.
If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.

970
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:25,218
- Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
- Goodbye.

971
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:26,947
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

972
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:48,268
Scarlett!

973
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:49,637
Scarlett!

974
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:56,007
Climb into this buggy.
This is no day for walking.

975
01:06:56,084 --> 01:06:57,312
You'll get run over.

976
01:06:57,385 --> 01:06:58,613
Oh, Rhett!

977
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:01,317
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.

978
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:05,291
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?

979
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:10,723
That's just another of Gen. Sherman's
calling cards.

980
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:12,129
He'll be paying us a visit soon.

981
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,964
I've got to get out of here
before the Yankees come!

982
01:07:15,036 --> 01:07:16,970
And leave your work at the hospital?

983
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:20,838
Or have you had enough of death and lice
and men chopped up?

984
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:23,207
I suppose you weren't meant
for sick men, Scarlett.

985
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:25,303
Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.

986
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,439
I wish I could get out of here.

987
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:28,948
Let's get out of here together.

988
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:32,248
No use staying here and letting the South
come down around your ears.

989
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,118
There are too many nice places
to go and visit.

990
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,488
Mexico, London, Paris...

991
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:39,424
- With you?
- Yes, ma'am.

992
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:43,163
With a man who understands you
and admires you for just what you are.

993
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,325
I figure we belong together,
being the same sort.

994
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:51,365
I've been waiting for you to grow up and
get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.

995
01:07:51,439 --> 01:07:55,876
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have
a baby in another month or so.

996
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:59,903
It'll be hard loving a man
with a wife and baby clinging to him.

997
01:08:02,317 --> 01:08:06,378
Well, here we are. Are you going with me,
or are you getting out?

998
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:11,489
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,
and I'll hate and despise you till I die.

999
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:15,060
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.

1000
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:24,128
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!

1001
01:08:24,205 --> 01:08:27,902
Folks is all going to Macon and folks is
running away and running away.

1002
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:31,343
I can't bear it!
Those cannon balls right in my ears!

1003
01:08:31,412 --> 01:08:33,642
I faint every time I hear one!

1004
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:36,914
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!

1005
01:08:36,985 --> 01:08:38,612
But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?

1006
01:08:38,686 --> 01:08:41,018
I may be a coward, but oh, dear!

1007
01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:43,456
Yankees in Georgia!

1008
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:44,750
How did they ever get in?

1009
01:08:44,826 --> 01:08:47,556
I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things.
Get them, quick!

1010
01:08:47,629 --> 01:08:49,392
Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't be a minute.

1011
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:51,432
Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?

1012
01:08:51,499 --> 01:08:52,557
Scarlett!

1013
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:55,603
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?

1014
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,128
And don't you dare try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital.

1015
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:02,233
I've had enough of smelling death
and rot and death.

1016
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:05,404
I'm going home. I want my mother.
My mother needs me.

1017
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,176
Now you've got to listen to me.
You must stay here!

1018
01:09:08,249 --> 01:09:11,241
Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?
It simply isn't done!

1019
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:13,879
Good heavens, woman, this is war,
not a garden party!

1020
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:15,582
You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.

1021
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:16,715
Oh, bother Melanie.

1022
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,282
She's ill already.
She shouldn't even be having a baby.

1023
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,588
She may have a difficult time.

1024
01:09:20,662 --> 01:09:21,890
Can't we take her along?

1025
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:23,453
Do you want her to take that chance?

1026
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:25,089
To be jounced over rough roads...

1027
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,100
and have her baby ahead of time,
in a buggy?

1028
01:09:27,168 --> 01:09:29,033
It isn't my baby! You take care of her!

1029
01:09:29,103 --> 01:09:30,968
Scarlett! We haven't enough doctors...

1030
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:33,337
much less nurses
to look after a sick woman.

1031
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:34,932
You've got to stay for Melanie.

1032
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:35,998
What for?

1033
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,078
I don't know anything about babies
being born!

1034
01:09:38,146 --> 01:09:39,738
I knows, I knows.

1035
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:42,647
I knows how to do it.
I's done it lots and lots.

1036
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:45,686
Let me, Doctor, let me.
I can do everything.

1037
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:48,847
- Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us.
- Yes, Doctor.

1038
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:52,154
Ashley's fighting in the field,
fighting for the cause.

1039
01:09:52,226 --> 01:09:54,751
He may never come back. He may die.

1040
01:09:55,463 --> 01:09:57,988
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.

1041
01:09:58,499 --> 01:09:59,557
Ashley.

1042
01:09:59,634 --> 01:10:02,159
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!

1043
01:10:02,537 --> 01:10:04,129
I promised Ashley...

1044
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:05,297
something.

1045
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:06,897
Then you'll stay?

1046
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:10,470
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.
Scarlett's staying.

1047
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:13,742
Go on, Uncle Peter.
Oh, dear, I don't know what to do.

1048
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:16,339
It's like the end of the world.

1049
01:10:17,118 --> 01:10:20,554
Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.

1050
01:10:27,328 --> 01:10:29,626
Melanie, it's all your fault!

1051
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:32,189
I hate you, I hate you!

1052
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:34,063
And I hate your baby!

1053
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:36,500
If only I hadn't promised Ashley!

1054
01:10:36,571 --> 01:10:38,801
If only I hadn't promised him!

1055
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:10,235
Stop! Stop, please stop!

1056
01:11:10,304 --> 01:11:11,896
Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?

1057
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:13,964
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
The Army's pulling out.

1058
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,271
Pulling out of Atlanta?
Leaving us to the Yankees?

1059
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:17,811
Not leaving, ma'am, evacuating.

1060
01:11:17,879 --> 01:11:21,007
We've got to before Sherman cuts
the McDonough Road and catches us.

1061
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:23,983
It can't be true! It can't be true!
What'll I do?

1062
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:28,215
Better refugee south right quick, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

1063
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:30,150
Prissy!

1064
01:11:31,092 --> 01:11:32,719
Prissy, come here!

1065
01:11:32,794 --> 01:11:36,252
Pack my things and Miss Melanie's, too.
We're going to Tara right away.

1066
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,388
The Yankees are coming!

1067
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:38,659
Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:41,292
Scarlett!

1069
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:42,927
Scarlett!

1070
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:45,498
Melly, we're going to...

1071
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:48,767
Melly!

1072
01:11:51,412 --> 01:11:54,745
I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.

1073
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:59,515
It began at daybreak.

1074
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:01,521
But, but...

1075
01:12:02,323 --> 01:12:04,450
But the Yankees are coming.

1076
01:12:05,593 --> 01:12:07,117
Poor Scarlett.

1077
01:12:07,628 --> 01:12:10,756
You'd be at Tara now with your mother,
wouldn't you...

1078
01:12:11,566 --> 01:12:13,397
if it weren't for me?

1079
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:15,866
Oh, Scarlett, darling...

1080
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,170
you've been so good to me.

1081
01:12:18,272 --> 01:12:20,740
No sister could have been sweeter.

1082
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:26,310
I've been lying here thinking...

1083
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,776
if I should die...

1084
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:31,842
will you take my baby?

1085
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:36,180
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.

1086
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:39,192
Aren't things bad enough
without you talking about dying?

1087
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:42,528
- I'll send for Dr. Meade right away.
- Not yet, Scarlett.

1088
01:12:42,597 --> 01:12:45,998
I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here
for hours, while...

1089
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:50,261
- while all those poor, wounded boys...
- Prissy!

1090
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:53,569
Prissy! Prissy! Come here, quick!

1091
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,108
Go get Dr. Meade! Run, quick!

1092
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:57,542
Yes, ma'am. The baby!

1093
01:12:58,246 --> 01:13:01,374
Well, don't stand there like a scared goat.
Run!

1094
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:07,110
Hurry! I'll sell you South, I will!
I swear I will!

1095
01:13:08,856 --> 01:13:10,619
Where's that Prissy?

1096
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:15,754
This room's like an oven already...

1097
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,764
and it isn't noon yet.

1098
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:22,398
Oh, don't worry, Melly.

1099
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:26,600
Mother says it always seems
like the doctor will never come.

1100
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:30,504
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!

1101
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:39,080
Oh, Melly.

1102
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:42,348
You know what I heard
about Maybelle Merriwether?

1103
01:13:42,423 --> 01:13:44,618
You remember that funny-looking beau
of hers?

1104
01:13:44,692 --> 01:13:48,025
The one with a uniform
like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.

1105
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:51,622
You don't have to keep on talking
for my sake, Scarlett.

1106
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:53,834
I know how worried you are.

1107
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:10,744
Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you
some cool water.

1108
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,912
You're as slow as molasses in January.

1109
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,546
And where's Dr. Meade?

1110
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:17,955
- I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
- What?

1111
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:20,391
No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.

1112
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:25,330
A man, he told me the doctor's down at
the car shed with the wounded soldiers...

1113
01:14:25,499 --> 01:14:27,865
Well, why didn't you go after him?

1114
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:29,429
Miss Scarlett.

1115
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,495
I's scared to go down there
to the car shed.

1116
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,776
There's folks dying down there
and I's scared of dead folks.

1117
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:40,608
Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.

1118
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:44,515
And don't you be upsetting her,
or I'll whip the hide off you!

1119
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,984
- Have you seen Dr. Meade?
- Side, lady, please.

1120
01:15:28,929 --> 01:15:30,260
Dr. Meade!

1121
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,638
Dr. Meade! At last!

1122
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:20,076
Oh, thank heavens you're here.
I need every pair of hands.

1123
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:23,048
Come, child! Wake up!
We've got work to do.

1124
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,944
But Melly's having her baby.
You've got to come with me!

1125
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:29,921
Are you crazy?
I can't leave these men for a baby!

1126
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:32,823
They're dying, hundreds of them!
Get some woman to help you.

1127
01:16:32,893 --> 01:16:35,987
But there isn't anybody.
Dr. Meade, she might die!

1128
01:16:36,063 --> 01:16:37,121
Die!

1129
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,133
Look at them!
Bleeding to death in front of my eyes!

1130
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:44,399
No chloroform! No bandages!
Nothing! Nothing to even ease their pain!

1131
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:47,205
Now run along and don't bother me.

1132
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:50,573
Now don't worry, child.
There's nothing to bringing a baby.

1133
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:52,134
Now bring those stretchers in here!

1134
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:53,202
Dr. Meade!

1135
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,838
I'm coming.

1136
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:15,592
Is the doctor come?

1137
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:17,670
No, he can't come.

1138
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:20,536
Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.

1139
01:17:20,674 --> 01:17:23,268
He can't come. There's nobody to come.

1140
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:27,505
Prissy, you've got to manage
without the doctor. I'll help you.

1141
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:29,378
Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.

1142
01:17:30,584 --> 01:17:31,881
Well, what is it?

1143
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:34,216
Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.

1144
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:37,121
I don't know nothing
about birthing babies.

1145
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:40,290
- What do you mean?
- I don't know...

1146
01:17:40,361 --> 01:17:42,192
You told me you knew everything about it.

1147
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:44,322
I don't know how come I told such a lie.

1148
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:47,925
Ma ain't never let me around
when folks was having them.

1149
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:49,427
Scarlett!

1150
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:51,163
Scarlett!

1151
01:17:51,872 --> 01:17:53,669
Oh, Miss Scarlett...

1152
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:55,569
Stop it!

1153
01:17:57,077 --> 01:17:58,510
Go light a fire in the stove!

1154
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:01,548
Keep boiling water in the kettle,
get me the ball of twine and...

1155
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:04,140
and all the clean towels you can find,
and the scissors.

1156
01:18:04,218 --> 01:18:06,049
Don't come telling me you can't find them.

1157
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,281
Go get them, and get them quick!

1158
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,752
Scarlett!

1159
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,331
Coming, Melly.

1160
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:23,630
Coming.

1161
01:18:27,474 --> 01:18:29,772
Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.

1162
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:31,835
I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.

1163
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:33,607
It's no use. I'm going to die.

1164
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,878
Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.
Hold on to me.

1165
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:39,146
Talk to me, Scarlett.

1166
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,347
Please talk to me.

1167
01:18:41,522 --> 01:18:42,819
Don't try to be brave, Melly.

1168
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,290
Yell all you want, there's nobody to hear.

1169
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:49,693
Ma says that if you puts a knife
under the bed, it cuts the pain in two.

1170
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:56,865
Capt. Butler!

1171
01:18:57,738 --> 01:18:59,035
Capt. Butler!

1172
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:01,832
Who do you want?

1173
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:02,898
Capt. Butler.

1174
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:05,639
He's upstairs. Belle Watling's
giving a party.

1175
01:19:07,882 --> 01:19:09,076
Thank you.

1176
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:13,852
Capt. Butler! Oh, Capt. Butler!

1177
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:16,147
What's all the rumpus about?

1178
01:19:16,323 --> 01:19:19,520
I's got a message for Capt. Butler,
Miss Watling!

1179
01:19:19,727 --> 01:19:23,185
Capt. Butler, you come out here
in the streets to me.

1180
01:19:24,398 --> 01:19:25,490
What is it, Prissy?

1181
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:28,057
Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.

1182
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:30,965
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.

1183
01:19:31,472 --> 01:19:34,373
A fine baby boy...

1184
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:37,606
and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.

1185
01:19:37,678 --> 01:19:39,339
Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett...

1186
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:43,008
Well, it was mostly me, Capt. Butler,
only Miss Scarlett...

1187
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:47,952
she helped me a little, but I don't expect
no doctor could have done no better!

1188
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:52,385
Only Miss Melly, she feeling kind of poorly
now it's all over!

1189
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,857
Yes, I can believe that!

1190
01:19:54,929 --> 01:19:58,524
And the Yankees is coming,
and Miss Scarlett, she said...

1191
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,530
Oh, Capt. Butler, the Yankees is here!

1192
01:20:03,203 --> 01:20:06,468
Please come and bring your carriage
for us right away.

1193
01:20:06,607 --> 01:20:09,405
I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army
took my horse and carriage.

1194
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:11,808
You'd better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

1195
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:13,437
Oh, no, Capt. Butler!

1196
01:20:13,714 --> 01:20:18,344
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk
if I was to go into Miss Watling's.

1197
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:23,249
Any of you beauties know where I can
steal a horse for a good cause?

1198
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:32,997
- Whoa, Marse Robert.
- Is that you, Rhett?

1199
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:36,293
- We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here!
- Rhett, I knew you'd come.

1200
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,201
Good evening. Nice weather we're having.

1201
01:20:38,272 --> 01:20:40,433
Prissy tells me you're planning
on taking a trip.

1202
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:42,532
If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you!

1203
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:43,940
Don't tell me you're frightened.

1204
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:47,970
I'm scared to death. If you had the sense
of a goat, you'd be scared too.

1205
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:50,039
- Oh, the Yankees.
- No, not yet.

1206
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:52,847
That's what's left of our Army,
blowing up the ammunition...

1207
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,046
so the Yankees won't get it.

1208
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:55,816
We've got to get out of here.

1209
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:56,878
At your service, madam.

1210
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:58,549
Just where are you figuring on going?

1211
01:20:58,625 --> 01:20:59,649
Home, to Tara.

1212
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:01,957
They've been fighting all day around Tara.

1213
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:04,463
Do you think you can parade
through the Yankee Army...

1214
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,999
with a sick woman,
a baby, and a simple-minded darky...

1215
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:08,728
or do you intend leaving them behind?

1216
01:21:08,802 --> 01:21:11,327
They're going with me. I'm going home.
You can't stop me!

1217
01:21:11,405 --> 01:21:15,136
Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing
Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?

1218
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:16,642
I want my mother!

1219
01:21:17,511 --> 01:21:19,411
I want to go home to Tara!

1220
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,277
Tara's probably been burned
to the ground.

1221
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:23,543
The woods are full of stragglers
from both armies.

1222
01:21:23,617 --> 01:21:25,983
The least they'll do is take the horse
away from you.

1223
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:28,647
It isn't much of an animal,
but I had trouble stealing it.

1224
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:31,782
I'm going home if I have to walk
every step of the way.

1225
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:35,056
I'll kill you if you try to stop me.
I will, I will!

1226
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:36,654
I will!

1227
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:45,996
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.

1228
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:51,333
I guess anybody who did what you've done
today can take care of Sherman.

1229
01:21:52,946 --> 01:21:55,278
Here, now. Stop crying.

1230
01:21:57,785 --> 01:22:00,083
Now blow your nose like a good little girl.

1231
01:22:00,354 --> 01:22:01,514
There.

1232
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:14,325
Prissy! What are you doing?

1233
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:15,834
I's packing, Miss Scarlett.

1234
01:22:15,903 --> 01:22:17,370
Stop it and come get the baby.

1235
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:18,560
Yes, ma'am.

1236
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:22,334
Melly!

1237
01:22:23,343 --> 01:22:26,176
Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.

1238
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:27,471
Tara...

1239
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:29,413
- It's the only way, Melly.
- No.

1240
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:32,213
Sherman will burn the house
over our heads if we stay.

1241
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:33,919
It's all right, Melly.

1242
01:22:33,987 --> 01:22:35,545
My baby.

1243
01:22:36,156 --> 01:22:37,680
My poor baby.

1244
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:44,663
Have you the strength to put your arms
around my neck?

1245
01:22:44,731 --> 01:22:46,494
I think so.

1246
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:50,565
Never mind.

1247
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,003
Oh, Ashley, Charles...

1248
01:22:53,073 --> 01:22:54,665
What is it? What does she want?

1249
01:22:54,741 --> 01:22:57,574
Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.
She wants us to bring them.

1250
01:22:57,644 --> 01:22:58,668
Get them.

1251
01:23:14,628 --> 01:23:15,686
What's that?

1252
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:19,228
Our gallant lads must have set fire
to the warehouses near the depot.

1253
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:22,166
There's enough ammunition
in the boxcars to blow us to Tara.

1254
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:24,204
We'll have to hurry
to get across the tracks.

1255
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:26,000
- You're not going that way!
- We have to.

1256
01:23:26,073 --> 01:23:29,236
The McDonough Road's the only one
the Yankees haven't cut yet.

1257
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:40,919
Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.

1258
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:42,351
What are you laughing at?

1259
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:44,549
At you, locking the Yankees out.

1260
01:24:01,608 --> 01:24:03,235
Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.

1261
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:06,040
I wouldn't be in such a hurry
to see them go if I were you.

1262
01:24:06,113 --> 01:24:08,581
With them goes the last semblance
of law and order.

1263
01:24:10,951 --> 01:24:13,112
The scavengers aren't wasting any time.

1264
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:19,320
We've got to get out of here fast.

1265
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:20,621
There's a horse!

1266
01:24:32,105 --> 01:24:33,766
Down the alley, cut them off.

1267
01:24:47,754 --> 01:24:49,449
Give me that horse.

1268
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:00,657
Miss Scarlett!

1269
01:25:05,005 --> 01:25:07,633
They haven't left much for the Yankees
to take, have they?

1270
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:11,166
We'll have to make a dash for it
before the fire reaches that ammunition.

1271
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:33,390
Come on!

1272
01:25:37,904 --> 01:25:39,565
Throw me your shawl.

1273
01:25:42,242 --> 01:25:45,803
Sorry, but you'll like it better
if you don't see anything.

1274
01:26:45,172 --> 01:26:47,163
Take a good look, my dear.

1275
01:26:47,607 --> 01:26:48,631
It's a historic moment.

1276
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:50,176
You can tell your grandchildren...

1277
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:53,474
how you watched the old South
disappear one night.

1278
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:12,230
They were going to lick the Yankees
in a month.

1279
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:14,130
Poor gallant fools!

1280
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:15,566
They make me sick, all of them!

1281
01:27:15,635 --> 01:27:18,763
Getting us all into this
with their swaggering and boasting.

1282
01:27:19,106 --> 01:27:22,439
That's the way I felt once
about their swaggering and boasting.

1283
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,676
Rhett, I'm so glad
you aren't with the Army.

1284
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:30,012
You can be proud now, proud that you've
been smarter than all of them.

1285
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:33,886
I'm not so proud.

1286
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:54,398
Why did you stop?

1287
01:27:54,474 --> 01:27:57,204
This is the turn to Tara.
Let the horse breathe a bit.

1288
01:27:57,577 --> 01:27:58,601
Mrs. Wilkes.

1289
01:27:58,678 --> 01:28:01,977
Miss Melly done fainted way back,
Capt. Butler.

1290
01:28:02,182 --> 01:28:03,740
Well, she's probably better off.

1291
01:28:03,817 --> 01:28:06,877
She couldn't stand the pain
if she were conscious.

1292
01:28:07,387 --> 01:28:10,254
Scarlett, are you still determined
to do this crazy thing?

1293
01:28:10,323 --> 01:28:13,156
Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.
I'm sure we can.

1294
01:28:13,226 --> 01:28:15,057
Not we, my dear. You.

1295
01:28:15,429 --> 01:28:16,896
I'm leaving you here.

1296
01:28:17,197 --> 01:28:19,791
You're what? Rhett, where are you going?

1297
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:22,263
I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.

1298
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:25,097
You're joking!
I could kill you for scaring me so!

1299
01:28:25,172 --> 01:28:26,901
I'm very serious, Scarlett.

1300
01:28:26,973 --> 01:28:29,703
I'm going to join up
with our brave lads in gray.

1301
01:28:29,776 --> 01:28:30,902
But they're running away!

1302
01:28:30,977 --> 01:28:34,276
No. They'll turn and make a last stand,
if I know anything about them.

1303
01:28:34,347 --> 01:28:37,475
When they do, I'll be with them.
A little late, but "Better late... "

1304
01:28:37,551 --> 01:28:39,280
Rhett, you must be joking!

1305
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,844
Selfish to the end, aren't you?

1306
01:28:41,922 --> 01:28:45,824
Thinking only of your own precious hide,
with never a thought for the noble cause.

1307
01:28:45,892 --> 01:28:47,655
Rhett, how could you do this to me...

1308
01:28:47,727 --> 01:28:50,662
and why should you go now,
after it's all over and I need you?

1309
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:51,719
Why? Why?

1310
01:28:51,798 --> 01:28:52,822
Why?

1311
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:55,891
Maybe it's because I've always had
a weakness for lost causes...

1312
01:28:55,969 --> 01:28:57,266
once they're really lost.

1313
01:28:57,337 --> 01:28:58,429
Or maybe...

1314
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:01,698
maybe I'm ashamed of myself.

1315
01:29:02,943 --> 01:29:03,932
Who knows?

1316
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,877
You should die of shame
to leave me here alone and helpless!

1317
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,647
You helpless?

1318
01:29:09,716 --> 01:29:12,480
Heaven help the Yankees
if they capture you!

1319
01:29:13,019 --> 01:29:16,079
Now climb down here.
I want to say goodbye.

1320
01:29:16,423 --> 01:29:17,412
No!

1321
01:29:18,024 --> 01:29:19,389
Climb down.

1322
01:29:22,762 --> 01:29:26,095
Oh, Rhett, please don't go.
You can't leave me, please.

1323
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:27,895
I'll never forgive you!

1324
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:31,995
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never understand or forgive myself.

1325
01:29:32,072 --> 01:29:36,509
And if a bullet gets me, so help me,
I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.

1326
01:29:36,743 --> 01:29:38,370
But there's one thing I do know...

1327
01:29:38,445 --> 01:29:40,072
and that is that I love you, Scarlett.

1328
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:43,638
In spite of you, me and the whole
silly world going to pieces around us...

1329
01:29:43,717 --> 01:29:44,809
I love you...

1330
01:29:44,885 --> 01:29:47,410
because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.

1331
01:29:47,787 --> 01:29:49,584
Selfish and shrewd...

1332
01:29:49,923 --> 01:29:53,290
but able to look things in the eyes
and call them by their right names.

1333
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,260
Don't hold me like that!

1334
01:29:55,362 --> 01:29:57,193
Scarlett, look at me.

1335
01:29:58,365 --> 01:30:00,799
I love you
more than I've ever loved any woman.

1336
01:30:00,934 --> 01:30:04,165
And I've waited longer for you
than I've ever waited for any woman.

1337
01:30:04,237 --> 01:30:05,431
Let me alone!

1338
01:30:06,606 --> 01:30:09,131
Here's a soldier of the South
who loves you, Scarlett...

1339
01:30:09,209 --> 01:30:10,836
wants to feel your arms around him...

1340
01:30:10,911 --> 01:30:13,778
wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle with him.

1341
01:30:13,847 --> 01:30:15,474
Never mind about loving me.

1342
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:19,315
You're a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory.

1343
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:21,383
Scarlett, kiss me.

1344
01:30:22,522 --> 01:30:23,887
Kiss me, once.

1345
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:31,697
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!

1346
01:30:31,998 --> 01:30:35,798
They were right! Everybody was right!
You aren't a gentleman!

1347
01:30:38,572 --> 01:30:40,733
A minor point at such a moment.

1348
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:43,634
Here.

1349
01:30:44,277 --> 01:30:46,575
If anyone lays a hand on that nag,
shoot him.

1350
01:30:46,646 --> 01:30:48,580
But don't make a mistake
and shoot the nag.

1351
01:30:48,648 --> 01:30:52,778
Oh, go on. I want you to go.
I hope a cannonball lands slap on you.

1352
01:30:52,852 --> 01:30:54,649
I hope you're blown into a million pieces!

1353
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:57,622
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.

1354
01:30:57,691 --> 01:30:59,784
And when I'm dead on the altar
of my country...

1355
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:02,191
I hope your conscience hurts you.

1356
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:04,195
Goodbye, Scarlett.

1357
01:31:30,223 --> 01:31:32,817
Come on, you! We're going home.

1358
01:32:48,568 --> 01:32:50,559
Oh, my poor baby.

1359
01:32:52,472 --> 01:32:53,905
Don't worry, Melly.

1360
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,267
Mother will take care of him
when we get home.

1361
01:32:56,342 --> 01:32:59,140
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.

1362
01:32:59,379 --> 01:33:01,176
We's got to have something to eat.

1363
01:33:01,247 --> 01:33:02,509
Oh, hush up!

1364
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,908
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.
We'll stop there.

1365
01:33:06,686 --> 01:33:07,846
Go on!

1366
01:34:14,954 --> 01:34:17,946
Ashley, I'm glad you're not here
to see this.

1367
01:34:19,259 --> 01:34:20,954
The Yankees!

1368
01:34:21,027 --> 01:34:22,961
The dirty Yankees!

1369
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:40,101
Prissy, come tie up this cow!

1370
01:34:40,613 --> 01:34:42,979
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.

1371
01:34:43,049 --> 01:34:46,109
We'll be home soon,
and I's scared of cows.

1372
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:49,745
Tear up your petticoat and tie her
on to the back of the wagon.

1373
01:34:49,989 --> 01:34:53,618
We need milk for the baby, and
we don't know what we'll find at home.

1374
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:04,860
Melly! Melly, we're home!

1375
01:35:05,071 --> 01:35:06,095
We're at Tara!

1376
01:35:06,172 --> 01:35:08,037
Hurry! Move, you brute!

1377
01:35:09,642 --> 01:35:12,076
Miss Scarlett, he's dead!

1378
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:16,811
I can't see the house! Is it there?
I can't see the house. Have they burned it?

1379
01:35:20,553 --> 01:35:22,180
Oh, it's all right.

1380
01:35:22,255 --> 01:35:24,587
It's all right! They haven't burned it!

1381
01:35:24,924 --> 01:35:26,255
It's still there!

1382
01:35:29,929 --> 01:35:32,489
Mother! Mother! I'm home.

1383
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:37,226
Mother! Mother! I'm home.

1384
01:35:42,742 --> 01:35:45,677
Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!

1385
01:35:50,183 --> 01:35:51,275
Pa!

1386
01:35:51,918 --> 01:35:53,385
Oh, Pa!

1387
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,451
I'm home!

1388
01:35:56,956 --> 01:35:58,048
I'm home!

1389
01:36:01,127 --> 01:36:02,526
Katie.

1390
01:36:03,296 --> 01:36:04,820
Katie Scarlett.

1391
01:36:05,798 --> 01:36:07,595
Oh, darling.

1392
01:36:18,778 --> 01:36:19,972
Mammy!

1393
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:24,483
- Mammy, I'm home.
- Honey, honey child!

1394
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:28,379
Oh, Mammy, I'm so...

1395
01:36:30,056 --> 01:36:31,580
Where's Mother?

1396
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:33,115
Why...

1397
01:36:33,693 --> 01:36:37,288
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen,
they was sick with the typhoid.

1398
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:40,864
They had it bad,
but they's doing all right now.

1399
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,667
Just weak like little kittens.

1400
01:36:42,735 --> 01:36:44,703
But where's Mother?

1401
01:36:46,406 --> 01:36:47,532
Well...

1402
01:36:48,107 --> 01:36:53,010
Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse
that Emmie Slattery, that white trash...

1403
01:36:53,713 --> 01:36:55,738
and she took down with it, too.

1404
01:36:58,084 --> 01:37:00,484
- And last night, she...
- Mother!

1405
01:37:04,123 --> 01:37:05,351
Mother.

1406
01:38:13,292 --> 01:38:14,759
Miss Scarlett, honey.

1407
01:38:14,827 --> 01:38:17,557
If there's anything I can do,
Miss Scarlett...

1408
01:38:18,431 --> 01:38:19,955
What did you do with Miss Melly?

1409
01:38:20,033 --> 01:38:22,627
Don't you worry your pretty head
about Miss Melly, child.

1410
01:38:22,702 --> 01:38:25,535
I done slapped her in bed already,
along with the baby.

1411
01:38:25,605 --> 01:38:28,073
You better put that cow I brought
into the barn, Pork.

1412
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:30,439
There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.

1413
01:38:30,543 --> 01:38:32,477
The Yankees done burned it for firewood.

1414
01:38:32,545 --> 01:38:34,672
They used the house
for their headquarters.

1415
01:38:34,747 --> 01:38:36,408
They camped all around the place.

1416
01:38:36,482 --> 01:38:37,949
Yankees in Tara!

1417
01:38:38,017 --> 01:38:40,952
Yes, ma'am, and they stole
most everything they didn't burn.

1418
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:45,081
All the clothes and all the rugs
and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.

1419
01:38:47,326 --> 01:38:49,294
I'm starving, Pork.
Get me something to eat.

1420
01:38:49,362 --> 01:38:52,559
There ain't nothing to eat, honey.
They took it all.

1421
01:38:52,899 --> 01:38:54,457
All the chickens, everything?

1422
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,295
They took them the first thing.

1423
01:38:56,369 --> 01:38:59,304
And what they didn't eat
they carried off across their saddles.

1424
01:38:59,372 --> 01:39:02,136
Don't tell me any more
about what they did!

1425
01:39:18,024 --> 01:39:20,015
What's this, Pa?

1426
01:39:20,093 --> 01:39:21,185
Whiskey?

1427
01:39:21,661 --> 01:39:22,923
Yes, daughter.

1428
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:29,093
Katie Scarlett, that's enough!

1429
01:39:29,168 --> 01:39:32,501
You're not knowing spirits,
you'll make yourself tipsy.

1430
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:34,472
I hope it makes me drunk.

1431
01:39:34,774 --> 01:39:36,366
I'd like to be drunk.

1432
01:39:39,512 --> 01:39:40,638
Oh, Pa.

1433
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:45,948
What are those papers?

1434
01:39:46,886 --> 01:39:48,012
Bonds.

1435
01:39:49,889 --> 01:39:51,584
They're all we've saved.

1436
01:39:51,657 --> 01:39:53,249
All we have left.

1437
01:39:53,793 --> 01:39:54,987
Bonds.

1438
01:39:55,394 --> 01:39:57,123
What kind of bonds, Pa?

1439
01:39:58,197 --> 01:40:00,757
Why, Confederate bonds,
of course, daughter.

1440
01:40:00,933 --> 01:40:02,594
Confederate bonds.

1441
01:40:02,902 --> 01:40:05,132
What good are they to anybody?

1442
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:08,033
I'll not have you talking like that,
Katie Scarlett.

1443
01:40:08,241 --> 01:40:12,302
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do
with no money and nothing to eat?

1444
01:40:13,779 --> 01:40:15,747
We must ask your mother.

1445
01:40:16,482 --> 01:40:17,813
That's it!

1446
01:40:18,251 --> 01:40:20,481
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.

1447
01:40:21,988 --> 01:40:23,717
- Ask Mother?
- Yes.

1448
01:40:24,624 --> 01:40:27,184
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.

1449
01:40:28,294 --> 01:40:30,194
Now don't be bothering me.

1450
01:40:30,263 --> 01:40:32,026
Go out for a ride.

1451
01:40:32,665 --> 01:40:33,927
I'm busy.

1452
01:40:51,918 --> 01:40:53,476
Oh, Pa...

1453
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,313
don't worry about anything.

1454
01:40:57,123 --> 01:40:58,988
Katie Scarlett's home.

1455
01:41:01,394 --> 01:41:03,055
You needn't worry.

1456
01:41:18,177 --> 01:41:19,201
Miss Scarlett.

1457
01:41:19,278 --> 01:41:23,214
What are we gonna to do with nothing
to feed those sick folks and that child?

1458
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,342
I don't know, Mammy.

1459
01:41:27,186 --> 01:41:28,312
I don't know.

1460
01:41:28,387 --> 01:41:31,447
We ain't got nothing but radishes
in the garden.

1461
01:41:31,524 --> 01:41:34,584
Miss Scarlett,
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...

1462
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:37,026
they's fussing to be sponged off.

1463
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:39,288
Where are the other servants, Mammy?

1464
01:41:39,365 --> 01:41:41,925
Miss Scarlett, there's only
just me and Pork left.

1465
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:44,265
The others went off to the war
or runned away.

1466
01:41:44,337 --> 01:41:47,568
I can't take care of that baby
and sick folks, too.

1467
01:41:48,441 --> 01:41:50,204
I's only got two hands.

1468
01:41:50,643 --> 01:41:55,012
Who's going to milk that cow,
Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.

1469
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:19,998
As God is my witness...

1470
01:43:20,566 --> 01:43:23,865
As God is my witness,
they're not going to lick me.

1471
01:43:24,303 --> 01:43:29,172
I'm going to live through this, and when
it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.

1472
01:43:29,542 --> 01:43:31,203
No, nor any of my folks.

1473
01:43:32,778 --> 01:43:35,338
If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.

1474
01:43:36,649 --> 01:43:40,517
As God is my witness,
I'll never be hungry again!

1475
01:50:50,066 --> 01:50:52,159
My back's near broken.

1476
01:50:54,571 --> 01:50:56,300
Look at my hands.

1477
01:50:57,007 --> 01:51:00,443
Mother said you could always tell a lady
by her hands.

1478
01:51:00,644 --> 01:51:04,705
I guess things like hands and ladies
don't matter so much anymore.

1479
01:51:05,448 --> 01:51:09,384
You rest, Sue. You're not well yet,
and I can pick cotton for both of us.

1480
01:51:09,452 --> 01:51:13,081
Scarlett's hateful, making us work
in the fields like...

1481
01:51:13,156 --> 01:51:14,885
Too bad about that.

1482
01:51:15,225 --> 01:51:18,319
Now get back to work.
I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.

1483
01:51:18,395 --> 01:51:21,125
What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!

1484
01:51:24,334 --> 01:51:27,269
Don't you ever dare say
you hate Tara again!

1485
01:51:28,071 --> 01:51:30,562
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.

1486
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,044
Katie Scarlett, there's something
I must speak to you about.

1487
01:51:40,116 --> 01:51:41,174
Yes, Pa, what is it?

1488
01:51:41,251 --> 01:51:45,119
I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.
I don't like the way you're treating them.

1489
01:51:45,188 --> 01:51:48,680
You must be firm with inferiors,
but you must be gentle with them...

1490
01:51:48,758 --> 01:51:50,191
especially darkies.

1491
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:54,128
Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them
to do anything I'm not doing myself.

1492
01:51:54,197 --> 01:51:58,531
Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.

1493
01:52:13,183 --> 01:52:15,276
What are you doing out of bed, Melly?

1494
01:52:15,351 --> 01:52:18,548
Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.
You are all working so hard.

1495
01:52:18,621 --> 01:52:20,316
I can't lie in bed doing nothing.

1496
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:22,915
Go on back upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.

1497
01:52:22,992 --> 01:52:24,254
Please, Scarlett, let me.

1498
01:52:24,327 --> 01:52:26,625
Stop being noble.
I've got enough on my hands...

1499
01:52:26,696 --> 01:52:29,597
without you making yourself sick
so you'll never be any use.

1500
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:32,191
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.

1501
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:30,485
Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot.

1502
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,734
You're alone, little lady?

1503
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:43,937
You ain't very friendly, are you?

1504
01:53:46,943 --> 01:53:49,741
You got anything else
besides these earbobs?

1505
01:53:49,813 --> 01:53:52,338
You Yankees have been here before.

1506
01:53:52,515 --> 01:53:55,143
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?

1507
01:53:56,186 --> 01:53:58,654
What have you got hidden in your hand?

1508
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:36,258
Scarlett, you killed him.

1509
01:54:37,427 --> 01:54:39,292
I'm glad you killed him.

1510
01:54:40,463 --> 01:54:44,422
Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?

1511
01:54:48,271 --> 01:54:51,502
Don't be scared, chickens.
Your big sister was cleaning a revolver...

1512
01:54:51,574 --> 01:54:54,134
and it went off
and nearly scared her to death.

1513
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:57,338
Oh, thank goodness.
Haven't we got enough to frighten us?

1514
01:54:57,513 --> 01:55:00,073
Tell Katie Scarlett
she must be more careful.

1515
01:55:03,286 --> 01:55:05,584
What a cool liar you are, Melly.

1516
01:55:06,222 --> 01:55:08,486
We've got to get him out of here
and bury him.

1517
01:55:08,558 --> 01:55:10,583
If the Yankees find him here, they'll...

1518
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:13,720
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.

1519
01:55:13,796 --> 01:55:15,423
But even so, we've got to hide him.

1520
01:55:15,498 --> 01:55:19,264
They might hear about it,
and then they'd come and get you.

1521
01:55:22,171 --> 01:55:24,799
I could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft...

1522
01:55:24,874 --> 01:55:27,342
but how will I get him out of here?

1523
01:55:27,977 --> 01:55:29,604
We'll both take a leg and drag him.

1524
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:31,442
You couldn't drag a cat.

1525
01:55:38,254 --> 01:55:41,587
Do you think it would be dishonest
if we went through his haversack?

1526
01:55:41,658 --> 01:55:44,126
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.

1527
01:55:44,193 --> 01:55:47,026
You take the haversack,
I'll search his pockets.

1528
01:55:59,242 --> 01:56:00,504
You look.

1529
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:02,673
I'm feeling a little weak.

1530
01:56:02,745 --> 01:56:05,339
Melly, I think it's full of money!

1531
01:56:06,182 --> 01:56:07,774
Oh, Melly, look!

1532
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:08,976
Look!

1533
01:56:09,585 --> 01:56:10,677
$10, $20, $30, $40...

1534
01:56:10,753 --> 01:56:12,880
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time.

1535
01:56:12,956 --> 01:56:15,447
Do you realize this means
we'll have something to eat?

1536
01:56:15,525 --> 01:56:17,356
Look in his other pockets.

1537
01:56:19,395 --> 01:56:20,828
Hurry, hurry!

1538
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:23,396
- We've got to get him out of here.
- Here.

1539
01:56:36,679 --> 01:56:39,580
If he bleeds across the yard,
we can't hide it.

1540
01:56:39,649 --> 01:56:42,618
Give me your nightgown, Melly.
I'll wad it around his head.

1541
01:56:42,685 --> 01:56:44,277
Don't be silly. I won't look at you.

1542
01:56:44,354 --> 01:56:47,687
If I had my petticoat or pantalets,
I'd use them.

1543
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:03,568
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.

1544
01:57:04,574 --> 01:57:07,099
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't.

1545
01:57:07,176 --> 01:57:09,838
I'll clean up the mess
when I've buried him.

1546
01:57:09,912 --> 01:57:12,073
No, I'll clean it up.

1547
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:17,749
Well, I guess I've done murder.

1548
01:57:19,322 --> 01:57:21,449
I won't think about that now.

1549
01:57:21,524 --> 01:57:23,788
I'll think about that tomorrow.

1550
01:57:33,102 --> 01:57:34,626
Katie Scarlett!

1551
01:57:35,571 --> 01:57:37,095
Katie Scarlett!

1552
01:57:37,373 --> 01:57:39,204
It's over! It's over!

1553
01:57:40,276 --> 01:57:42,141
It's all over! The war!

1554
01:57:42,211 --> 01:57:43,735
Lee surrendered.

1555
01:57:43,813 --> 01:57:46,407
- It's not possible.
- Why did we ever fight?

1556
01:57:46,482 --> 01:57:48,541
Ashley will be coming home.

1557
01:57:48,618 --> 01:57:50,848
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.

1558
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,547
We'll plant more cotton.

1559
01:57:52,622 --> 01:57:54,590
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!

1560
01:58:11,908 --> 01:58:14,138
<i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>

1561
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:15,541
<i>Hurrah, hurrah!</i>

1562
01:58:15,611 --> 01:58:17,010
<i>We bring the jubilee</i>

1563
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:18,604
<i>Hurrah, hurrah!</i>

1564
01:58:18,681 --> 01:58:20,546
<i>The flag that makes you free</i>

1565
01:58:20,616 --> 01:58:23,585
<i>So we sing the chorus
from Atlanta to the sea</i>

1566
01:58:23,786 --> 01:58:26,516
<i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>

1567
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:29,683
Get out of the road, rebel!
Get out of the way!

1568
01:58:29,759 --> 01:58:32,057
Have you room in your carriage
for a dying man?

1569
01:58:32,128 --> 01:58:34,790
I got no room for any Southern scum,
alive or dead.

1570
01:58:34,864 --> 01:58:36,263
Get out of the way.

1571
01:58:36,332 --> 01:58:38,857
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.

1572
01:58:38,935 --> 01:58:41,563
Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!

1573
01:58:41,704 --> 01:58:43,604
Act like they won the war!

1574
01:58:44,273 --> 01:58:47,003
Now you come on and give me
them pants, Mr. Kennedy.

1575
01:58:47,076 --> 01:58:48,134
Come on.

1576
01:58:50,413 --> 01:58:53,940
You scrub yourself with that strong
lye soap before I scrubs you myself.

1577
01:58:54,016 --> 01:58:57,076
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boiling pot.

1578
01:58:59,789 --> 01:59:02,223
The whole Confederate Army's got
the same trouble:

1579
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:04,350
Crawling clothes and dysentery.

1580
01:59:05,261 --> 01:59:07,161
It's humiliating,
how you treat Mr. Kennedy.

1581
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:11,496
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you!

1582
01:59:13,102 --> 01:59:14,467
Come on, Beau.

1583
01:59:14,537 --> 01:59:18,803
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry.

1584
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:22,075
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.

1585
01:59:22,145 --> 01:59:23,544
Nice little fellow.

1586
01:59:23,613 --> 01:59:27,344
Another two years of war and we could
have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.

1587
01:59:28,217 --> 01:59:29,707
Were you in Cobb's Legion?

1588
01:59:29,785 --> 01:59:31,082
Yes, ma'am.

1589
01:59:31,154 --> 01:59:34,385
Why, then, you must know my husband,
Maj. Wilkes.

1590
01:59:34,457 --> 01:59:35,924
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1591
01:59:35,992 --> 01:59:38,460
He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.

1592
01:59:38,528 --> 01:59:39,756
Captured!

1593
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:42,894
Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't...

1594
01:59:42,965 --> 01:59:45,627
Oh, my poor Ashley in a Yankee prison!

1595
01:59:45,701 --> 01:59:46,929
Melanie.

1596
01:59:47,036 --> 01:59:49,800
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.

1597
01:59:49,872 --> 01:59:52,204
I'll watch out for him, ma'am.
We're good friends.

1598
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:53,765
Oh, thank you.

1599
01:59:58,181 --> 02:00:01,639
I slave day and night so we can have
food to keep body and soul together.

1600
02:00:01,717 --> 02:00:04,185
And you give it all away
to these starving scarecrows.

1601
02:00:04,253 --> 02:00:06,221
I'd sooner have a plague of locusts here.

1602
02:00:06,289 --> 02:00:08,223
Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.

1603
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:11,055
I've just heard
that Ashley was taken prisoner.

1604
02:00:11,127 --> 02:00:12,822
- Ashley, a prisoner?
- Yes.

1605
02:00:12,895 --> 02:00:17,093
And maybe if he's alive and well,
he's on some Northern road right now.

1606
02:00:17,466 --> 02:00:20,697
And maybe some Northern woman
is giving him a share of her dinner...

1607
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:23,830
and helping my beloved
to come back home to me.

1608
02:00:25,775 --> 02:00:26,935
I hope so, Melly.

1609
02:00:27,009 --> 02:00:28,169
Miss Scarlett.

1610
02:00:31,881 --> 02:00:35,317
Miss Scarlett, I want to take up
something with your pa, but...

1611
02:00:35,384 --> 02:00:36,476
he doesn't seem to...

1612
02:00:36,552 --> 02:00:39,146
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.

1613
02:00:39,222 --> 02:00:40,883
Well, I...

1614
02:00:41,457 --> 02:00:44,517
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming
to ask for Suellen.

1615
02:00:45,127 --> 02:00:47,425
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't asked for her...

1616
02:00:47,496 --> 02:00:49,691
after all these years
she's been counting on you?

1617
02:00:49,765 --> 02:00:53,531
Well, the truth is,
I'm so much older than she is, and...

1618
02:00:53,669 --> 02:00:55,864
Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.

1619
02:00:55,938 --> 02:00:57,565
Who has nowadays?

1620
02:00:57,740 --> 02:01:00,675
Miss Scarlett, if true love
carries any weight with you...

1621
02:01:00,743 --> 02:01:03,371
you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.

1622
02:01:03,446 --> 02:01:07,075
I'll go out somewhere and get myself
a little business if we're engaged.

1623
02:01:07,149 --> 02:01:08,707
As soon as I get on my feet again...

1624
02:01:08,784 --> 02:01:11,218
All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa.

1625
02:01:11,287 --> 02:01:13,016
You go ask her now.

1626
02:01:13,556 --> 02:01:15,888
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

1627
02:01:19,128 --> 02:01:21,153
Excuse me, excuse me.

1628
02:01:23,899 --> 02:01:26,868
Scarlett, what seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?

1629
02:01:26,936 --> 02:01:28,870
More trouble than he guesses.

1630
02:01:28,938 --> 02:01:30,838
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.

1631
02:01:30,906 --> 02:01:32,498
Oh, I'm so glad.

1632
02:01:32,575 --> 02:01:37,171
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
At least there'd be one less mouth to feed.

1633
02:01:40,616 --> 02:01:42,140
Oh, another one.

1634
02:01:42,718 --> 02:01:44,049
I hope this one isn't hungry.

1635
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,212
He'll be hungry.

1636
02:01:45,288 --> 02:01:48,121
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate...

1637
02:01:59,568 --> 02:02:00,762
Ashley!

1638
02:02:02,905 --> 02:02:04,167
Ashley!

1639
02:02:05,875 --> 02:02:07,103
Darling!

1640
02:02:17,253 --> 02:02:19,949
Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.

1641
02:02:20,022 --> 02:02:22,923
Turn me loose, you fool!
Turn me loose, it's Ashley!

1642
02:02:22,992 --> 02:02:25,085
He's her husband, ain't he?

1643
02:02:37,306 --> 02:02:39,501
- Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
- High time you got back.

1644
02:02:39,575 --> 02:02:42,408
- Did you get the horse shod?
- Yes, he shod all right.

1645
02:02:42,478 --> 02:02:46,278
Fine thing when a horse can get shoes
and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.

1646
02:02:46,349 --> 02:02:48,442
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.

1647
02:02:48,517 --> 02:02:51,918
I gotta know how much money
have you got left, in gold.

1648
02:02:52,154 --> 02:02:53,849
$10. Why?

1649
02:02:54,924 --> 02:02:56,152
That won't be enough.

1650
02:02:56,225 --> 02:02:58,420
What in heaven's name are you
talking about?

1651
02:02:58,494 --> 02:03:02,726
Well, Miss Scarlett, I seed that old
no-count white-trash Wilkerson...

1652
02:03:02,798 --> 02:03:05,494
that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

1653
02:03:05,568 --> 02:03:08,969
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was making a brag...

1654
02:03:09,238 --> 02:03:14,175
that his carpetbagger friends done run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

1655
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:16,175
But how much more have we got to pay?

1656
02:03:16,245 --> 02:03:19,305
I hear the taxman say $300.

1657
02:03:19,382 --> 02:03:20,713
$300!

1658
02:03:22,184 --> 02:03:24,414
Might just as well be $3 million.

1659
02:03:24,487 --> 02:03:26,284
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

1660
02:03:26,355 --> 02:03:27,549
Yes, ma'am.

1661
02:03:27,623 --> 02:03:28,647
How?

1662
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:32,391
I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.

1663
02:03:32,461 --> 02:03:34,793
Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.

1664
02:03:34,864 --> 02:03:37,662
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?

1665
02:03:39,735 --> 02:03:41,327
Asking ain't getting.

1666
02:03:50,713 --> 02:03:51,907
Ashley!

1667
02:03:53,182 --> 02:03:56,447
They say Abe Lincoln got his start
splitting rails.

1668
02:03:56,619 --> 02:03:59,087
Think what heights I may climb to
once I get the knack.

1669
02:04:00,523 --> 02:04:02,991
The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.

1670
02:04:04,794 --> 02:04:06,386
What shall we do?

1671
02:04:07,096 --> 02:04:09,428
Ashley, what's to become of us?

1672
02:04:09,698 --> 02:04:13,190
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?

1673
02:04:13,269 --> 02:04:16,238
Those who have brains and courage
come through all right.

1674
02:04:16,305 --> 02:04:17,966
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

1675
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:21,339
For heaven's sake,
don't stand there talking nonsense at me...

1676
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:23,275
when it's us who are being winnowed out.

1677
02:04:23,345 --> 02:04:25,074
You're right, Scarlett.

1678
02:04:25,147 --> 02:04:28,173
Here I am talking tommyrot
about civilization...

1679
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:30,343
when your Tara's in danger.

1680
02:04:30,519 --> 02:04:33,886
You've come to me for help,
and I've no help to give you.

1681
02:04:33,956 --> 02:04:35,617
Oh, Scarlett, I...

1682
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:37,181
I'm a coward.

1683
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:39,825
You, Ashley, a coward?

1684
02:04:40,596 --> 02:04:42,393
What are you afraid of?

1685
02:04:42,465 --> 02:04:45,957
Oh, mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.

1686
02:04:47,136 --> 02:04:49,502
Not that I mind splitting rails...

1687
02:04:49,939 --> 02:04:54,308
but I do mind very much
losing the beauty of that life I loved.

1688
02:04:56,445 --> 02:05:00,939
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

1689
02:05:01,550 --> 02:05:03,450
But the war did come.

1690
02:05:03,686 --> 02:05:06,348
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

1691
02:05:06,422 --> 02:05:09,482
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.

1692
02:05:10,192 --> 02:05:14,253
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.

1693
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:17,828
A world in which there's no place for me.

1694
02:05:19,502 --> 02:05:23,404
I can never make you understand because
you don't know the meaning of fear.

1695
02:05:23,472 --> 02:05:25,906
You never mind facing realities...

1696
02:05:26,709 --> 02:05:29,576
and you never want
to escape from them as I do.

1697
02:05:32,214 --> 02:05:33,408
Escape?

1698
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:36,513
Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.

1699
02:05:36,919 --> 02:05:38,853
I do want to escape, too.

1700
02:05:39,188 --> 02:05:43,284
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.

1701
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:47,762
I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton
until I can't stand it another minute.

1702
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:50,321
I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.
It's dead.

1703
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:55,132
The Yankees and the carpetbaggers
have got it and there's nothing left for us.

1704
02:05:56,539 --> 02:05:57,836
Oh, Ashley...

1705
02:05:58,674 --> 02:06:00,301
let's run away.

1706
02:06:00,376 --> 02:06:01,570
We'd go to Mexico.

1707
02:06:01,644 --> 02:06:04,841
They want officers in the Mexican Army.
We could be so happy there.

1708
02:06:04,914 --> 02:06:08,714
I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.
You know you don't love Melanie.

1709
02:06:08,784 --> 02:06:10,979
You told me you loved me
that day at Twelve Oaks.

1710
02:06:11,053 --> 02:06:12,987
And anyway, Melanie can't...

1711
02:06:13,055 --> 02:06:16,821
Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have
any more children and I could give you...

1712
02:06:16,892 --> 02:06:18,917
Can't we ever forget
that day at Twelve Oaks?

1713
02:06:18,994 --> 02:06:21,758
Do you think I could ever forget it?
Have you forgotten it?

1714
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:24,526
Can you honestly say you don't love me?

1715
02:06:25,534 --> 02:06:27,900
- No. I don't love you.
- It's a lie!

1716
02:06:28,003 --> 02:06:32,064
Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie
and the baby, break Melanie's heart?

1717
02:06:32,141 --> 02:06:34,132
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.

1718
02:06:34,209 --> 02:06:36,939
I could leave them. I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them.

1719
02:06:37,012 --> 02:06:40,914
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.

1720
02:06:41,584 --> 02:06:43,779
You've carried the load for all of us...

1721
02:06:43,852 --> 02:06:47,151
but from now on I'm going to be
more help to you, I promise.

1722
02:06:47,222 --> 02:06:49,315
There's only one way you can help me.

1723
02:06:49,391 --> 02:06:50,858
Take me away.

1724
02:06:51,026 --> 02:06:53,358
There's nothing to keep us here.

1725
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:55,592
Nothing.

1726
02:06:57,299 --> 02:06:59,096
Nothing except honor.

1727
02:07:11,714 --> 02:07:13,443
Oh, please, Scarlett.

1728
02:07:13,515 --> 02:07:15,745
Please, dear, you mustn't cry.

1729
02:07:15,951 --> 02:07:17,009
You mustn't.

1730
02:07:17,086 --> 02:07:19,884
Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.

1731
02:07:32,868 --> 02:07:35,132
You do love me, you do love me.

1732
02:07:35,204 --> 02:07:37,468
- Say it, say it.
- Don't, don't.

1733
02:07:37,539 --> 02:07:38,938
You love me, you love me.

1734
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:41,568
We won't do this, I tell you.
It won't happen again.

1735
02:07:41,644 --> 02:07:43,737
I'm going to take Melanie
and the baby, and go.

1736
02:07:43,812 --> 02:07:45,143
Say it, you love me.

1737
02:07:45,214 --> 02:07:48,843
All right, I'll say it. I love your courage
and your stubbornness.

1738
02:07:48,917 --> 02:07:52,683
So much that I could have forgotten
the best wife a man ever had.

1739
02:07:52,755 --> 02:07:55,656
But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.

1740
02:08:04,867 --> 02:08:07,301
Then there's nothing left for me.

1741
02:08:08,303 --> 02:08:10,362
Nothing to fight for.

1742
02:08:11,206 --> 02:08:13,140
Nothing to live for.

1743
02:08:15,844 --> 02:08:17,812
Yes, there is something.

1744
02:08:18,747 --> 02:08:21,272
Something you love better than me...

1745
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:23,643
though you may not know it.

1746
02:08:29,391 --> 02:08:30,517
Tara!

1747
02:08:34,296 --> 02:08:35,854
Yes, I...

1748
02:08:37,633 --> 02:08:39,294
I still have this.

1749
02:08:44,306 --> 02:08:45,830
You needn't go.

1750
02:08:46,508 --> 02:08:50,842
I won't have you all starve simply
because I threw myself at your head.

1751
02:08:51,447 --> 02:08:53,312
It won't happen again.

1752
02:09:20,809 --> 02:09:23,300
- Why, it's Emmy Slattery.
- Yes, ma'am, it's me.

1753
02:09:23,378 --> 02:09:24,470
Stop!

1754
02:09:25,114 --> 02:09:28,015
You haven't forgotten your old overseer,
have you?

1755
02:09:28,851 --> 02:09:30,751
Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

1756
02:09:30,819 --> 02:09:33,788
Get off those steps, you trashy wench!
Get off this land!

1757
02:09:33,856 --> 02:09:35,687
You can't speak that way to my wife.

1758
02:09:35,758 --> 02:09:38,318
Wife! High time you made her your wife.

1759
02:09:38,393 --> 02:09:41,089
Who baptized your other brats
after you killed my mother?

1760
02:09:41,163 --> 02:09:45,725
We came out here to pay a friendly call
and talk a little business with old friends.

1761
02:09:45,801 --> 02:09:48,736
Friends! When were we ever friends
with the likes of you?

1762
02:09:48,804 --> 02:09:52,035
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.

1763
02:09:52,107 --> 02:09:53,802
I know your father's turned idiot.

1764
02:09:53,876 --> 02:09:55,366
You can't pay your taxes.

1765
02:09:55,444 --> 02:09:58,004
And I come here
to offer to buy the place from you...

1766
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:59,809
to make you a right good offer.

1767
02:09:59,882 --> 02:10:01,474
Emmy's had a hankering to live here.

1768
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:03,313
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.

1769
02:10:03,385 --> 02:10:06,752
You high-flying Irish will find out
who's running things around here...

1770
02:10:06,822 --> 02:10:08,483
when you get sold out for taxes.

1771
02:10:08,557 --> 02:10:11,492
I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel
and I'll live in it.

1772
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:13,960
But I'll wait for the Sheriff's sale.

1773
02:10:14,029 --> 02:10:16,520
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!

1774
02:10:17,733 --> 02:10:19,724
You'll be sorry for that.

1775
02:10:28,243 --> 02:10:29,540
We'll be back!

1776
02:10:29,611 --> 02:10:32,307
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.

1777
02:10:37,653 --> 02:10:39,143
Pa, come back!

1778
02:10:42,291 --> 02:10:43,451
Pa, come back!

1779
02:10:43,525 --> 02:10:44,549
Pa!

1780
02:10:46,228 --> 02:10:47,718
Yankee coward!

1781
02:10:55,671 --> 02:10:56,695
Pa!

1782
02:11:17,192 --> 02:11:20,286
Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.
That's Mr. Gerald's watch.

1783
02:11:20,562 --> 02:11:23,725
You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.

1784
02:11:23,799 --> 02:11:27,132
You ain't got no business parting
from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.

1785
02:11:27,202 --> 02:11:30,638
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.

1786
02:11:30,806 --> 02:11:33,206
You think I'd sell Pa's watch?

1787
02:11:34,476 --> 02:11:36,000
And don't cry.

1788
02:11:36,712 --> 02:11:39,476
I can stand everybody's tears but yours.

1789
02:11:43,151 --> 02:11:44,846
Oh, Mammy, Mammy.

1790
02:11:50,759 --> 02:11:55,162
You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,
you just gotta go on being brave.

1791
02:11:55,364 --> 02:11:57,355
Think about your pa like he used to be.

1792
02:11:57,432 --> 02:11:59,263
I can't think about Pa.

1793
02:11:59,501 --> 02:12:01,628
I can't think of anything but that $300.

1794
02:12:01,703 --> 02:12:03,864
Ain't no good thinking about that,
Miss Scarlett.

1795
02:12:03,939 --> 02:12:05,702
Ain't nobody got that much money.

1796
02:12:06,708 --> 02:12:10,269
Nobody but Yankees and scalawags
got that much money now.

1797
02:12:12,447 --> 02:12:13,505
Rhett!

1798
02:12:13,582 --> 02:12:15,311
Who that? A Yankee?

1799
02:12:20,489 --> 02:12:23,390
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...

1800
02:12:24,259 --> 02:12:26,124
I haven't any clothes.

1801
02:12:35,737 --> 02:12:38,865
Scoot up to the attic and get down
Ma's old box of dress patterns.

1802
02:12:38,941 --> 02:12:40,738
What you up to with Miss Ellen's portiere?

1803
02:12:40,809 --> 02:12:41,901
You'll make me a new dress.

1804
02:12:41,977 --> 02:12:44,810
Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.
Not while I got breath in me.

1805
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,474
Great balls of fire!
They're my portieres now.

1806
02:12:47,549 --> 02:12:51,110
I'm going to Atlanta for that $300
and I've got to go looking like a queen.

1807
02:12:51,186 --> 02:12:53,381
- Who going to Atlanta with you?
- I'm going alone.

1808
02:12:53,455 --> 02:12:55,855
That's what you think.
I's going to Atlanta with you.

1809
02:12:55,924 --> 02:12:57,482
With you and that new dress.

1810
02:12:57,559 --> 02:12:58,583
Now, Mammy, darling.

1811
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:00,651
No use to try to sweet-talk me,
Miss Scarlett.

1812
02:13:00,729 --> 02:13:03,425
I's knowed you since I put
the first pair of diapers on you.

1813
02:13:03,498 --> 02:13:06,092
I said I's going to Atlanta with you,
and going I is.

1814
02:13:06,735 --> 02:13:09,898
Kings and treys, huh?
Too good for me, Major!

1815
02:13:10,305 --> 02:13:13,138
Pity we couldn't have fought the war out
in a poker game.

1816
02:13:13,208 --> 02:13:16,234
You'd have done better than Gen. Grant
with far less effort.

1817
02:13:16,311 --> 02:13:17,437
What is it, Corporal?

1818
02:13:17,512 --> 02:13:21,243
Sir, there's a lady to see Capt. Butler.
Says she's his sister.

1819
02:13:21,316 --> 02:13:22,840
Another sister?

1820
02:13:23,185 --> 02:13:25,551
This is a jail, not a harem, Capt. Butler.

1821
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:27,451
No, Major, she ain't one of those.

1822
02:13:27,522 --> 02:13:29,990
This one's got her mammy with her.

1823
02:13:30,225 --> 02:13:31,385
She has?

1824
02:13:32,494 --> 02:13:35,759
I'd like to see this one, Major,
without her mammy.

1825
02:13:37,265 --> 02:13:40,564
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon
come to what?

1826
02:13:42,537 --> 02:13:44,129
$340.

1827
02:13:44,206 --> 02:13:46,936
My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?

1828
02:13:47,142 --> 02:13:48,370
All right, Corporal.

1829
02:13:48,443 --> 02:13:51,310
Show Capt. Butler's sister to his cell.

1830
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:54,910
Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.

1831
02:13:59,488 --> 02:14:03,083
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.

1832
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:07,458
- Rhett!
- Scarlett!

1833
02:14:07,929 --> 02:14:10,022
My dear little sister.

1834
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:15,764
It's all right, Corporal.
My sister has brought me no files or saws.

1835
02:14:21,109 --> 02:14:22,303
Can I really kiss you now?

1836
02:14:22,377 --> 02:14:24,504
On the forehead like a good brother.

1837
02:14:24,579 --> 02:14:27,275
No, thanks.
I'll wait and hope for better things.

1838
02:14:28,083 --> 02:14:31,109
Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed
when I heard you were in jail.

1839
02:14:31,249 --> 02:14:33,342
I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.

1840
02:14:33,418 --> 02:14:35,409
It's not true they're going to hang you?

1841
02:14:35,487 --> 02:14:36,647
Would you be sorry?

1842
02:14:36,754 --> 02:14:38,585
- Oh, Rhett!
- Well, don't worry yet.

1843
02:14:38,656 --> 02:14:40,624
They have plotted
some charge against me...

1844
02:14:40,692 --> 02:14:42,387
but they're really after my money.

1845
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:44,792
They think I made off
with the Confederate Treasury.

1846
02:14:44,863 --> 02:14:46,353
Well, did you?

1847
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:48,089
What a leading question.

1848
02:14:48,166 --> 02:14:50,657
But let's not talk
about sordid things like money.

1849
02:14:50,735 --> 02:14:53,966
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look.

1850
02:14:54,038 --> 02:14:57,007
Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.

1851
02:14:57,075 --> 02:15:00,340
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of seeing women in rags.

1852
02:15:00,411 --> 02:15:01,810
Turn around.

1853
02:15:02,447 --> 02:15:04,972
You look good enough to eat.
And prosperous, too.

1854
02:15:05,049 --> 02:15:06,880
Thank you, I've been doing very well.

1855
02:15:06,951 --> 02:15:08,748
Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...

1856
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:12,381
I got so bored I just thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.

1857
02:15:12,457 --> 02:15:15,187
You're a heartless creature.
But that's part of your charm.

1858
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,524
You know you've got more charm
than the law allows.

1859
02:15:17,595 --> 02:15:20,155
Now I didn't come here
to talk silliness about me, Rhett.

1860
02:15:20,231 --> 02:15:23,325
I came because I was so miserable
at the thought of you in trouble.

1861
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:26,268
I was mad at you the night you left me
on the road to Tara...

1862
02:15:26,337 --> 02:15:27,861
and I still haven't forgiven you.

1863
02:15:27,939 --> 02:15:29,531
Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.

1864
02:15:29,607 --> 02:15:33,304
Well, I must admit
I might not be alive now, only for you.

1865
02:15:33,678 --> 02:15:37,409
And when I think of myself
with everything I could possibly hope for...

1866
02:15:37,482 --> 02:15:41,350
and not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail...

1867
02:15:41,853 --> 02:15:44,822
and not even a human jail, Rhett,
a horse jail.

1868
02:15:46,257 --> 02:15:48,817
Oh, listen to me
trying to make jokes when...

1869
02:15:48,893 --> 02:15:50,952
when I really want to cry.

1870
02:15:51,095 --> 02:15:53,063
In a minute I shall cry.

1871
02:15:56,167 --> 02:15:59,000
Scarlett, can it be possible that...

1872
02:15:59,704 --> 02:16:01,672
Can what be possible, Rhett?

1873
02:16:01,739 --> 02:16:05,231
That you've grown a woman's heart,
a real woman's heart?

1874
02:16:05,476 --> 02:16:07,603
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

1875
02:16:10,415 --> 02:16:14,215
You know, it's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.

1876
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,249
It's well worth it.

1877
02:16:21,759 --> 02:16:24,227
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolias, Scarlett.

1878
02:16:24,295 --> 02:16:26,695
So things have been going well
at Tara, have they?

1879
02:16:26,764 --> 02:16:28,288
What have you done with your hands?

1880
02:16:28,366 --> 02:16:30,266
I went riding last week without my gloves.

1881
02:16:30,335 --> 02:16:33,736
These don't belong to a lady.
You've worked with them like a field hand.

1882
02:16:33,805 --> 02:16:35,636
Why did you lie? What are you up to?

1883
02:16:35,707 --> 02:16:38,403
In another minute, I'd almost believe
you cared something.

1884
02:16:38,476 --> 02:16:39,568
But I do care.

1885
02:16:39,644 --> 02:16:41,043
Suppose we get down to the truth.

1886
02:16:41,112 --> 02:16:42,875
You want something from me
badly enough...

1887
02:16:42,947 --> 02:16:45,347
to put on quite a show in your velvets.

1888
02:16:45,416 --> 02:16:46,815
What is it? Money?

1889
02:16:47,952 --> 02:16:50,546
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

1890
02:16:50,822 --> 02:16:53,552
I did lie to you
when I said everything was all right.

1891
02:16:53,625 --> 02:16:57,618
Things are just as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.

1892
02:16:58,596 --> 02:17:00,461
What collateral are you offering?

1893
02:17:00,565 --> 02:17:02,157
- My earbobs.
- Not interested.

1894
02:17:02,233 --> 02:17:04,428
- A mortgage on Tara.
- What would I do with a farm?

1895
02:17:04,502 --> 02:17:07,300
You wouldn't lose.
I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.

1896
02:17:07,372 --> 02:17:10,136
Not good enough.
Have you nothing better?

1897
02:17:11,976 --> 02:17:14,103
You once said you loved me.

1898
02:17:14,479 --> 02:17:16,674
If you still love me, Rhett...

1899
02:17:16,748 --> 02:17:19,945
You haven't forgotten
that I'm not a marrying man?

1900
02:17:20,018 --> 02:17:22,316
No, I haven't forgotten.

1901
02:17:27,992 --> 02:17:29,857
You're not worth $300.

1902
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:33,328
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.

1903
02:17:33,398 --> 02:17:34,456
Go on, insult me.

1904
02:17:34,532 --> 02:17:36,693
I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.

1905
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:40,534
I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go
while there's a breath left in my body.

1906
02:17:40,772 --> 02:17:41,830
Oh, Rhett.

1907
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:44,267
Won't you please give me the money?

1908
02:17:44,442 --> 02:17:46,808
I couldn't give you the money
if I wanted to.

1909
02:17:46,878 --> 02:17:48,971
My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.

1910
02:17:49,047 --> 02:17:52,881
If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd
be on me like a duck on a June bug.

1911
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:56,020
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.

1912
02:17:59,257 --> 02:18:01,054
Here, here, here, stop it!

1913
02:18:01,826 --> 02:18:03,953
Want the Yankees to see you like this?

1914
02:18:04,028 --> 02:18:05,859
Take your hands off me, you skunk.

1915
02:18:05,963 --> 02:18:08,227
You knew what I was going to say
before I started.

1916
02:18:08,299 --> 02:18:11,564
You knew you wouldn't lend me
the money and yet you let me go on.

1917
02:18:11,636 --> 02:18:13,433
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.

1918
02:18:13,504 --> 02:18:16,905
Cheer up. You can come to my hanging
and I'll remember you in my will.

1919
02:18:16,974 --> 02:18:19,841
I'll come to your hanging.
The only thing I'm afraid of...

1920
02:18:19,911 --> 02:18:23,005
is that they won't hang you in time
to pay the taxes on Tara.

1921
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:31,281
Tell him Belle Watling.

1922
02:18:31,356 --> 02:18:34,189
Where you been lately?
Thought you'd deserted Capt. Butler.

1923
02:18:34,258 --> 02:18:36,954
Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.

1924
02:18:46,003 --> 02:18:49,598
Who that? I ain't never seen hair
that color before in my life.

1925
02:18:49,941 --> 02:18:51,772
Does you know a dyed-haired woman?

1926
02:18:51,843 --> 02:18:54,505
I wish I did know that one.
She'd get my money for me.

1927
02:18:56,714 --> 02:18:59,114
No matter what they done to you
in that jail...

1928
02:18:59,183 --> 02:19:00,980
they didn't do no more than you deserve...

1929
02:19:01,052 --> 02:19:03,111
for visiting white trash in a jail!

1930
02:19:09,927 --> 02:19:11,121
Fresh and green.

1931
02:19:11,195 --> 02:19:12,355
Right off the farm.

1932
02:19:12,430 --> 02:19:14,489
Hey, what are you doing tonight, Susy?

1933
02:19:14,565 --> 02:19:16,226
That's one of them Georgia peaches.

1934
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:18,325
There's nothing like that in Ohio.

1935
02:19:18,403 --> 02:19:20,997
- You know what we're going to do?
- What?

1936
02:19:21,072 --> 02:19:24,098
We're going to give every last one of you
40 acres and a mule!

1937
02:19:24,175 --> 02:19:26,609
- And a mule?
- Forty acres and a mule!

1938
02:19:26,711 --> 02:19:27,837
Gee!

1939
02:19:27,912 --> 02:19:29,675
'Cause we're your friends...

1940
02:19:29,747 --> 02:19:31,647
and you're gonna become voters...

1941
02:19:31,716 --> 02:19:33,980
and you're gonna vote like your friends do!

1942
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:37,219
What's your hurry, sister?

1943
02:19:37,288 --> 02:19:38,687
What's come over this here town?

1944
02:19:38,756 --> 02:19:42,658
Yankees have come over it!
Same as they've come over all of us.

1945
02:19:44,462 --> 02:19:46,362
Out of our way, trash!

1946
02:19:46,564 --> 02:19:47,758
Get out of the way here.

1947
02:19:47,832 --> 02:19:49,390
Get away! Go on!

1948
02:19:57,508 --> 02:19:58,907
Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!

1949
02:19:58,976 --> 02:20:01,410
- Why, Frank Kennedy!
- And Mammy!

1950
02:20:01,479 --> 02:20:03,242
It sure is good to see home folks.

1951
02:20:03,314 --> 02:20:04,838
I didn't know you were in Atlanta.

1952
02:20:04,916 --> 02:20:06,349
I didn't know you were.

1953
02:20:06,417 --> 02:20:08,885
Didn't Miss Suellen tell you
about my store?

1954
02:20:08,953 --> 02:20:11,854
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?

1955
02:20:12,023 --> 02:20:13,081
This?

1956
02:20:13,157 --> 02:20:15,421
Won't you come in and look around a bit?

1957
02:20:23,835 --> 02:20:26,429
I don't suppose it looks like much
to a lady, but...

1958
02:20:26,504 --> 02:20:28,369
I can't help being proud of it.

1959
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:30,337
You're not making money?

1960
02:20:30,408 --> 02:20:33,605
Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

1961
02:20:34,111 --> 02:20:36,671
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.

1962
02:20:36,747 --> 02:20:39,875
It won't be long now
before Miss Suellen and I can marry.

1963
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:41,509
Are you doing as well as all that?

1964
02:20:41,586 --> 02:20:43,383
Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.

1965
02:20:43,454 --> 02:20:45,285
I'm no millionaire yet...

1966
02:20:45,356 --> 02:20:47,722
but I've cleared $1,000 already.

1967
02:20:48,025 --> 02:20:49,117
And lumber, too.

1968
02:20:49,193 --> 02:20:50,285
Well...

1969
02:20:50,995 --> 02:20:52,292
that's only a sideline.

1970
02:20:52,363 --> 02:20:53,830
A sideline, Frank?

1971
02:20:53,998 --> 02:20:57,934
With all the good Georgia pine around
Atlanta and all this building going on?

1972
02:20:58,002 --> 02:21:00,971
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...

1973
02:21:01,506 --> 02:21:03,633
and I've got to be thinking
about buying a home.

1974
02:21:03,708 --> 02:21:05,232
What do you want a home for?

1975
02:21:05,309 --> 02:21:07,937
For Miss Suellen and me
to set up housekeeping.

1976
02:21:08,012 --> 02:21:11,345
Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her
to Atlanta, wouldn't you?

1977
02:21:12,216 --> 02:21:15,151
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.

1978
02:21:15,553 --> 02:21:18,488
I don't rightly know what you mean,
Miss Scarlett.

1979
02:21:18,556 --> 02:21:19,818
I don't mean a thing.

1980
02:21:19,891 --> 02:21:23,452
Frank, how'd you like to drive me out
to my Aunt Pitty's?

1981
02:21:24,028 --> 02:21:26,360
Nothing would give me
more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.

1982
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:28,125
You'd better stay to supper, too.

1983
02:21:28,199 --> 02:21:31,760
I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable
and I'd like a good long visit with you.

1984
02:21:31,836 --> 02:21:34,464
Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.

1985
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:37,770
And will you tell me all the news...

1986
02:21:37,842 --> 02:21:40,037
all the news of Miss Suellen?

1987
02:21:42,446 --> 02:21:44,277
What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?

1988
02:21:44,348 --> 02:21:45,872
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

1989
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:47,315
Oh, no, no.

1990
02:21:47,652 --> 02:21:49,620
I thought surely she had written you.

1991
02:21:49,687 --> 02:21:51,348
I guess she was ashamed to write you.

1992
02:21:51,422 --> 02:21:53,014
She should be ashamed.

1993
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:55,718
Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.

1994
02:21:55,793 --> 02:21:59,490
You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

1995
02:21:59,964 --> 02:22:03,764
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.

1996
02:22:04,535 --> 02:22:08,164
She just got tired of waiting
and was afraid she'd be an old maid...

1997
02:22:08,239 --> 02:22:10,969
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.

1998
02:22:11,642 --> 02:22:14,338
Oh, it's cold. I left my muff at home.

1999
02:22:14,579 --> 02:22:17,446
Would you mind
if I put my hand in your pocket?

2000
02:22:33,831 --> 02:22:36,891
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done.

2001
02:22:36,968 --> 02:22:39,368
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.

2002
02:22:39,437 --> 02:22:41,564
He's my beau,
and she's gone and married him.

2003
02:22:41,639 --> 02:22:43,869
She did it to save Tara,
you must understand that.

2004
02:22:43,941 --> 02:22:45,203
I hate Tara!

2005
02:22:45,276 --> 02:22:49,337
And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing
I hate worse than Tara.

2006
02:22:53,150 --> 02:22:54,811
It's all my fault.

2007
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:59,019
I should have committed highway robbery
to get that tax money for you.

2008
02:22:59,090 --> 02:23:01,456
I couldn't let you
do anything like that, and...

2009
02:23:01,726 --> 02:23:03,216
Well, anyway, it's done now.

2010
02:23:03,294 --> 02:23:05,057
Yes, it's done now.

2011
02:23:05,563 --> 02:23:07,656
You wouldn't let me
do anything dishonorable...

2012
02:23:07,732 --> 02:23:11,259
but you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.

2013
02:23:11,335 --> 02:23:15,533
Well, at least you won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.

2014
02:23:15,873 --> 02:23:17,363
What do you mean?

2015
02:23:17,441 --> 02:23:19,341
I'm going to New York.

2016
02:23:20,344 --> 02:23:22,471
I've arranged to get a position
in a bank there.

2017
02:23:22,546 --> 02:23:24,411
But you can't do that.

2018
02:23:25,983 --> 02:23:29,180
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business, Ashley...

2019
02:23:29,253 --> 02:23:31,118
and, well, I counted on you.

2020
02:23:31,188 --> 02:23:32,450
I wouldn't be any good to you.

2021
02:23:32,523 --> 02:23:34,616
I don't know anything
about the lumber business.

2022
02:23:34,692 --> 02:23:37,183
You know as much as you do
about banking.

2023
02:23:37,261 --> 02:23:40,162
And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.

2024
02:23:40,231 --> 02:23:42,631
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

2025
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:44,861
But it isn't that.

2026
02:23:44,935 --> 02:23:48,063
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...

2027
02:23:48,139 --> 02:23:50,630
I'd bury forever any hope
of standing alone.

2028
02:23:50,708 --> 02:23:52,198
Oh, is that all?

2029
02:23:52,276 --> 02:23:56,337
Well, you could gradually buy the business
and then it would be your own, and...

2030
02:23:57,682 --> 02:23:58,979
No, Scarlett.

2031
02:24:02,586 --> 02:24:03,780
Ashley...

2032
02:24:11,629 --> 02:24:12,857
Ashley.

2033
02:24:20,304 --> 02:24:21,669
Scarlett!

2034
02:24:23,207 --> 02:24:24,572
Scarlett, what is it?

2035
02:24:24,642 --> 02:24:26,837
Ashley's so mean and hateful.

2036
02:24:27,044 --> 02:24:28,807
What have you done?

2037
02:24:31,015 --> 02:24:32,744
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

2038
02:24:32,817 --> 02:24:37,015
To help me start my lumber business, and
he won't lift a finger to help me, and he...

2039
02:24:37,088 --> 02:24:39,022
Why, how unchivalrous of you.

2040
02:24:39,090 --> 02:24:41,081
Why, think, Ashley, think.

2041
02:24:41,292 --> 02:24:44,489
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta.

2042
02:24:44,562 --> 02:24:47,360
And maybe we wouldn't have had
little Beau...

2043
02:24:47,431 --> 02:24:50,867
and when I think of her picking cotton
and plowing just to keep food...

2044
02:24:50,935 --> 02:24:52,664
in our mouths, I could just...

2045
02:24:52,737 --> 02:24:54,261
Oh, my darling.

2046
02:24:58,843 --> 02:25:00,572
All right, Melanie.

2047
02:25:00,711 --> 02:25:02,440
I'll go to Atlanta.

2048
02:25:03,781 --> 02:25:05,715
I can't fight you both.

2049
02:25:24,969 --> 02:25:27,995
Well, here's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.

2050
02:25:28,072 --> 02:25:30,939
The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.

2051
02:25:31,442 --> 02:25:33,603
They look pretty thin and weak to me,
Gallagher.

2052
02:25:33,677 --> 02:25:34,837
Halt!

2053
02:25:37,148 --> 02:25:38,809
They're the best you can lease, ma'am.

2054
02:25:38,883 --> 02:25:41,716
And if you'll just give Johnny Gallagher
a free hand...

2055
02:25:41,786 --> 02:25:44,118
you'll get what you want out of them.

2056
02:25:44,188 --> 02:25:46,156
All right, you're the foreman.

2057
02:25:46,223 --> 02:25:49,954
All I ask is, you keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it.

2058
02:25:50,027 --> 02:25:51,585
Johnny Gallagher's your man, miss.

2059
02:25:51,662 --> 02:25:52,959
But remember...

2060
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:55,498
no questions and no interference.

2061
02:25:55,566 --> 02:25:58,262
That's a bargain.
Start them in the morning, Gallagher.

2062
02:25:58,335 --> 02:26:00,667
Come on, get a move on!
Come on, move on there!

2063
02:26:00,738 --> 02:26:03,263
But, Scarlett, this isn't right
and you know it.

2064
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:05,865
It's bad enough for a woman
to be in business, but...

2065
02:26:05,943 --> 02:26:07,240
What are you complaining about?

2066
02:26:07,311 --> 02:26:09,609
You wouldn't have owned a mill
had I not taken over.

2067
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:12,274
I didn't want the mill,
and we couldn't have bought it...

2068
02:26:12,349 --> 02:26:15,512
if you hadn't pressed all of our friends
for the money they owed me.

2069
02:26:15,586 --> 02:26:16,712
Isn't that right, Ashley?

2070
02:26:16,787 --> 02:26:18,880
What, are you running
a charitable institution?

2071
02:26:18,956 --> 02:26:21,584
Go back to the store,
then go home and take your medicine.

2072
02:26:21,659 --> 02:26:22,853
You're not looking very well.

2073
02:26:22,927 --> 02:26:24,986
But, sugar, shouldn't you come home
with me?

2074
02:26:25,062 --> 02:26:28,429
Great balls of fire. Don't bother me
anymore, and don't call me sugar!

2075
02:26:28,499 --> 02:26:30,330
All right, all right.

2076
02:26:30,868 --> 02:26:32,358
Good night, Ashley.

2077
02:26:34,438 --> 02:26:37,236
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.

2078
02:26:38,776 --> 02:26:40,903
Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...

2079
02:26:40,978 --> 02:26:44,243
I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies
instead of using convicts.

2080
02:26:44,315 --> 02:26:45,748
I believe we could do better.

2081
02:26:45,816 --> 02:26:48,979
Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,
and convicts are dirt-cheap.

2082
02:26:49,053 --> 02:26:50,714
If we just give Gallagher a free hand...

2083
02:26:50,788 --> 02:26:54,155
A free hand! You know what that means.
He'll starve them and whip them.

2084
02:26:54,225 --> 02:26:56,193
Some of them are sick, underfed...

2085
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:57,852
Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.

2086
02:26:57,928 --> 02:27:00,954
Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken
three times a day and...

2087
02:27:01,031 --> 02:27:03,192
tucking them to sleep
with eiderdown quilts.

2088
02:27:03,267 --> 02:27:06,998
I will not make money out
of the enforced labor and misery of others.

2089
02:27:07,071 --> 02:27:09,096
You weren't so particular
about owning slaves.

2090
02:27:09,173 --> 02:27:11,607
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.

2091
02:27:11,675 --> 02:27:14,007
Besides, I'd have freed them all
when father died...

2092
02:27:14,078 --> 02:27:16,308
if the war hadn't already freed them.

2093
02:27:16,380 --> 02:27:17,677
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.

2094
02:27:18,015 --> 02:27:20,313
But have you forgotten
what it's like without money?

2095
02:27:20,384 --> 02:27:23,444
I found out that money is
the most important thing in the world...

2096
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:25,681
and I don't intend ever to be
without it again.

2097
02:27:25,756 --> 02:27:28,748
I'll make enough so the Yankees
can never take Tara away from me.

2098
02:27:28,826 --> 02:27:30,418
I'll make it the only way I know how.

2099
02:27:30,494 --> 02:27:32,985
But we're not the only Southerners
who have suffered.

2100
02:27:33,063 --> 02:27:36,829
Look at all our friends. They're keeping
their honor and their kindness, too.

2101
02:27:36,901 --> 02:27:40,564
And they're starving. I've got no use
for fools who won't help themselves.

2102
02:27:40,638 --> 02:27:43,072
I know what they're saying about me,
and I don't care.

2103
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:45,165
I'll make friends
with Yankee carpetbaggers.

2104
02:27:45,242 --> 02:27:48,177
I'll beat them at their own game,
and you'll beat them with me.

2105
02:27:50,581 --> 02:27:53,573
That's it. Move it a little over to that side.

2106
02:27:53,951 --> 02:27:55,509
Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.

2107
02:27:55,586 --> 02:27:56,575
Good afternoon.

2108
02:27:56,654 --> 02:27:58,417
Business is certainly growing, ain't it?

2109
02:27:58,489 --> 02:27:59,615
It certainly is.

2110
02:28:01,025 --> 02:28:03,994
But you're doing business
with the same people who robbed us...

2111
02:28:04,061 --> 02:28:06,621
and tortured us and left us to starve.

2112
02:28:06,697 --> 02:28:07,857
All that's past, Melly.

2113
02:28:07,932 --> 02:28:11,424
And I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things.

2114
02:28:14,104 --> 02:28:17,505
And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,
that Dr. Meade actually saw her...

2115
02:28:17,574 --> 02:28:19,940
peddling lumber to those Yankees herself.

2116
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:21,034
And that isn't all...

2117
02:28:21,111 --> 02:28:23,978
I think it's shocking what she's doing
to my brother Ashley.

2118
02:28:24,048 --> 02:28:26,573
She's even taken
to driving her own buggy.

2119
02:28:34,391 --> 02:28:36,086
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2120
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:37,889
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2121
02:28:38,228 --> 02:28:40,219
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me.

2122
02:28:40,297 --> 02:28:42,288
When I think you could have had
my millions...

2123
02:28:42,366 --> 02:28:43,890
if you'd just waited a little while.

2124
02:28:43,968 --> 02:28:45,936
Oh, how fickle is woman!

2125
02:28:46,103 --> 02:28:48,503
What is it you want?
I have important things to do.

2126
02:28:48,572 --> 02:28:52,770
Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has bothered me for some time?

2127
02:28:52,843 --> 02:28:54,470
Well, what is it? Be quick.

2128
02:28:54,545 --> 02:28:58,379
Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love?

2129
02:28:58,916 --> 02:29:02,443
How did you ever get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?

2130
02:29:02,519 --> 02:29:04,214
Oh, that! Not much trouble.

2131
02:29:04,288 --> 02:29:06,153
There's nothing much
that money won't buy.

2132
02:29:06,223 --> 02:29:09,659
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes.

2133
02:29:09,727 --> 02:29:11,786
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.

2134
02:29:11,862 --> 02:29:13,853
Do you know,
I believe you're jealous of him.

2135
02:29:13,931 --> 02:29:16,559
You still think
you're the belle of the county, don't you?

2136
02:29:16,633 --> 02:29:18,965
That you're the cutest little trick
in shoe leather.

2137
02:29:19,036 --> 02:29:21,163
Every man you meet
is dying of love for you.

2138
02:29:21,238 --> 02:29:22,569
Let me by!

2139
02:29:22,973 --> 02:29:26,067
Don't be angry, Scarlett.
Tell me, where are you going?

2140
02:29:26,143 --> 02:29:28,008
To the mill, if it's any of your business.

2141
02:29:28,078 --> 02:29:29,340
Through shantytown, alone?

2142
02:29:29,413 --> 02:29:33,144
Haven't you been told it's dangerous
to drive alone through all that riffraff?

2143
02:29:33,217 --> 02:29:34,650
Don't worry about me.

2144
02:29:34,718 --> 02:29:37,983
I can shoot straight
if I don't have to shoot too far.

2145
02:29:45,095 --> 02:29:46,528
What a woman!

2146
02:30:21,498 --> 02:30:23,056
Could you give me a quarter?

2147
02:30:23,133 --> 02:30:24,498
Let go of my horse!

2148
02:30:26,804 --> 02:30:28,431
Hold this horse!

2149
02:30:38,982 --> 02:30:40,040
Help!

2150
02:30:40,584 --> 02:30:41,983
Help!

2151
02:30:43,587 --> 02:30:44,679
Help!

2152
02:31:18,922 --> 02:31:20,219
Miss Scarlett!

2153
02:31:39,276 --> 02:31:41,767
Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!

2154
02:31:42,212 --> 02:31:43,736
Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!

2155
02:31:43,814 --> 02:31:44,838
Big Sam!

2156
02:31:45,182 --> 02:31:47,013
Miss Scarlett! Wait!

2157
02:31:49,186 --> 02:31:50,585
Sam! Sam!

2158
02:31:51,054 --> 02:31:54,046
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?

2159
02:31:54,958 --> 02:31:58,655
Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.
Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.

2160
02:31:59,596 --> 02:32:01,223
Horse, make tracks!

2161
02:32:04,635 --> 02:32:07,229
You get to Tara just as quick as you can
and stay there.

2162
02:32:07,304 --> 02:32:09,932
I sure will.
I got enough of them carpetbaggers.

2163
02:32:10,007 --> 02:32:12,168
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.

2164
02:32:12,242 --> 02:32:13,869
Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.

2165
02:32:13,944 --> 02:32:17,380
Scarlett, change your dress and go over
to Miss Melly's for the evening.

2166
02:32:17,447 --> 02:32:19,312
I've got to go to a political meeting.

2167
02:32:19,383 --> 02:32:20,475
A political meeting!

2168
02:32:20,551 --> 02:32:22,280
How can you go to a political meeting...

2169
02:32:22,352 --> 02:32:24,411
after what I've been through
this afternoon?

2170
02:32:24,488 --> 02:32:27,082
Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.

2171
02:32:27,157 --> 02:32:31,218
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though it was nothing at all.

2172
02:32:53,016 --> 02:32:55,917
The men talk, talk, talk
about protecting our women...

2173
02:32:55,986 --> 02:33:00,548
and after what happened to me today
Frank has to go to a political meeting.

2174
02:33:03,961 --> 02:33:06,691
And if it won't pain you too much,
India Wilkes...

2175
02:33:06,763 --> 02:33:09,664
I'd be much obliged
if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.

2176
02:33:09,733 --> 02:33:11,291
Has my face gone green or something?

2177
02:33:11,368 --> 02:33:12,630
It won't pain me!

2178
02:33:12,703 --> 02:33:15,228
What happened this afternoon
was just what you deserved!

2179
02:33:15,305 --> 02:33:17,705
If there was any justice,
you'd have gotten worse.

2180
02:33:17,774 --> 02:33:18,763
India, hush up!

2181
02:33:18,842 --> 02:33:20,469
Let her talk. She's always hated me!

2182
02:33:20,544 --> 02:33:22,637
Ever since I took your brother
away from her...

2183
02:33:22,713 --> 02:33:24,908
though she's too much of a hypocrite
to admit it!

2184
02:33:24,982 --> 02:33:26,574
If she thought anyone'd go for her...

2185
02:33:26,650 --> 02:33:28,083
she'd walk down the street naked!

2186
02:33:28,151 --> 02:33:29,709
I do hate you!

2187
02:33:30,587 --> 02:33:33,818
You've done all you could
to lower the prestige of decent people.

2188
02:33:33,890 --> 02:33:36,620
Now you've endangered the lives
of our men, because they...

2189
02:33:36,693 --> 02:33:37,819
India!

2190
02:33:37,894 --> 02:33:41,694
I don't think we'd better say any more,
or one of us will be saying too much.

2191
02:33:41,765 --> 02:33:44,427
What's going on around here
that I don't know about?

2192
02:33:50,274 --> 02:33:52,071
Somebody's coming up the walk.

2193
02:33:52,142 --> 02:33:54,440
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.

2194
02:33:54,778 --> 02:33:57,872
Will you hand me the pistol, please,
Mrs. Meade?

2195
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:05,312
Whoever it is...

2196
02:34:06,123 --> 02:34:07,920
we know nothing.

2197
02:34:10,827 --> 02:34:11,953
Where have they gone?

2198
02:34:12,062 --> 02:34:14,553
You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.
It's life or death!

2199
02:34:14,631 --> 02:34:16,861
Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.

2200
02:34:16,933 --> 02:34:19,163
Quickly, please! There may still be time.

2201
02:34:19,236 --> 02:34:20,225
How did you know?

2202
02:34:20,304 --> 02:34:22,238
I was playing poker
with two Yankee captains.

2203
02:34:22,306 --> 02:34:23,637
They knew there'd be trouble.

2204
02:34:23,707 --> 02:34:25,072
They've sent their cavalry out.

2205
02:34:25,142 --> 02:34:27,474
Your husband and his friends
are walking into a trap.

2206
02:34:27,544 --> 02:34:30,308
Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!

2207
02:34:32,849 --> 02:34:35,477
At the Decatur Road.
The old Sullivan plantation.

2208
02:34:35,552 --> 02:34:37,850
The house is burned.
They're meeting in the cellar.

2209
02:34:37,921 --> 02:34:39,650
I'll do what I can.

2210
02:34:44,061 --> 02:34:46,928
What's all this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!

2211
02:34:46,997 --> 02:34:48,589
We thought it best not to tell you.

2212
02:34:48,665 --> 02:34:51,862
Ashley, Frank and the others
have gone to clean out those woods...

2213
02:34:51,935 --> 02:34:52,993
where you were attacked.

2214
02:34:53,070 --> 02:34:55,038
A great many Southern gentlemen have...

2215
02:34:55,105 --> 02:34:56,697
done this lately for our protection.

2216
02:34:56,773 --> 02:35:00,004
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,
Scarlett!

2217
02:35:00,077 --> 02:35:01,339
And it will be your fault!

2218
02:35:01,411 --> 02:35:03,606
Another word,
and you go out of this house, India!

2219
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:05,671
Scarlett did what she thought
she had to do.

2220
02:35:05,749 --> 02:35:09,116
And our men are doing
what they think they have to do.

2221
02:35:09,186 --> 02:35:10,380
Frank!

2222
02:35:11,021 --> 02:35:12,386
And Ashley!

2223
02:35:14,591 --> 02:35:16,456
Oh, it isn't possible!

2224
02:35:19,763 --> 02:35:22,288
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.

2225
02:35:22,366 --> 02:35:24,300
You're sewing, you're sewing.

2226
02:35:28,872 --> 02:35:30,669
Open the door, Mammy.

2227
02:35:40,384 --> 02:35:42,477
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.

2228
02:35:44,521 --> 02:35:46,216
Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?

2229
02:35:46,289 --> 02:35:47,916
I am Mrs. Wilkes.

2230
02:35:48,225 --> 02:35:50,659
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,
if you please.

2231
02:35:50,727 --> 02:35:51,989
He's not here.

2232
02:35:52,062 --> 02:35:53,051
Are you sure?

2233
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:55,257
Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.

2234
02:35:55,332 --> 02:35:57,800
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.

2235
02:35:57,868 --> 02:36:00,336
If you'll give me your word,
I won't search the house.

2236
02:36:00,404 --> 02:36:04,431
Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at
a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.

2237
02:36:04,508 --> 02:36:07,375
He's not at the store,
and there's no meeting tonight!

2238
02:36:07,444 --> 02:36:09,105
No political meeting.

2239
02:36:09,179 --> 02:36:12,376
We'll wait outside
till he and his friends return.

2240
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:16,210
Sergeant, surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.

2241
02:36:16,286 --> 02:36:17,548
Yes, sir!

2242
02:36:21,958 --> 02:36:24,358
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.

2243
02:36:24,694 --> 02:36:26,992
And I'll read aloud.

2244
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:34,163
"The Personal History and Experience
of David Copperfield.

2245
02:36:36,673 --> 02:36:38,163
"Chapter one.

2246
02:36:38,241 --> 02:36:39,538
"I am born.

2247
02:36:43,914 --> 02:36:47,680
"To begin my life with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was born.

2248
02:36:48,618 --> 02:36:51,178
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.

2249
02:36:51,254 --> 02:36:53,279
"I pass over all that happened at school...

2250
02:36:53,356 --> 02:36:56,553
"until the anniversary of my birthday
came around in March.

2251
02:36:57,661 --> 02:37:00,357
"Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever...

2252
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:01,692
"I remember nothing.

2253
02:37:01,765 --> 02:37:04,859
"He was going away at the end
of the half-year, if not sooner...

2254
02:37:04,968 --> 02:37:08,301
"and was more spirited and independent
than before in my eyes...

2255
02:37:08,738 --> 02:37:11,172
"and therefore more engaging
than before; but...

2256
02:37:11,241 --> 02:37:13,141
"beyond this I remember nothing.

2257
02:37:14,010 --> 02:37:15,238
"The great...

2258
02:37:17,614 --> 02:37:18,740
"I remember nothing. "

2259
02:37:23,787 --> 02:37:25,482
Melly! They're drunk!

2260
02:37:26,189 --> 02:37:27,918
Leave this to me, Scarlett.

2261
02:37:27,991 --> 02:37:29,788
And please, say nothing.

2262
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:35,130
You stupid fool!

2263
02:37:36,933 --> 02:37:38,059
Quiet!

2264
02:37:38,702 --> 02:37:41,102
Will you shut up for the love of...

2265
02:37:41,171 --> 02:37:42,365
Hello, Melly.

2266
02:37:42,439 --> 02:37:45,840
So you've got my husband
intoxicated again, Capt. Butler!

2267
02:37:45,909 --> 02:37:46,933
Well, bring him in.

2268
02:37:47,010 --> 02:37:49,376
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.
Your husband's under arrest.

2269
02:37:49,446 --> 02:37:51,676
If you arrest all the men
who get intoxicated...

2270
02:37:51,748 --> 02:37:54,342
you must have
a good many Yankees in jail.

2271
02:37:54,417 --> 02:37:57,875
Bring him in, Capt. Butler.
If you can walk yourself.

2272
02:37:59,055 --> 02:38:00,522
I want to tell you a story...

2273
02:38:00,590 --> 02:38:02,217
Listen, Doctor, I...

2274
02:38:02,292 --> 02:38:04,419
Put him there in that chair.

2275
02:38:07,397 --> 02:38:10,059
And now, Capt. Butler,
will you please leave my house...

2276
02:38:10,133 --> 02:38:12,727
and try to remember
not to come here again?

2277
02:38:13,036 --> 02:38:15,834
Well, now, that's fine thanks I get
for bringing him home...

2278
02:38:15,906 --> 02:38:18,773
and not leaving him on the streets
in this shameful condition!

2279
02:38:18,842 --> 02:38:20,469
Now, boys, all together!

2280
02:38:20,911 --> 02:38:22,435
Dr. Meade...

2281
02:38:23,046 --> 02:38:24,911
I'm astonished at you!

2282
02:38:31,688 --> 02:38:34,316
Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?

2283
02:38:35,759 --> 02:38:37,954
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.

2284
02:38:38,328 --> 02:38:41,229
Take him into the bedroom
and lay him out on the bed as usual.

2285
02:38:41,298 --> 02:38:42,890
Don't touch him, he's under arrest!

2286
02:38:42,966 --> 02:38:43,990
Now, Tom.

2287
02:38:44,067 --> 02:38:45,864
What do you want to arrest him for?

2288
02:38:46,202 --> 02:38:47,863
I've seen him drunker.

2289
02:38:48,104 --> 02:38:50,698
I've seen you drunker!
And you've seen me...

2290
02:38:50,774 --> 02:38:54,073
He can lie in the gutter for all I care!
I'm not a policeman.

2291
02:38:54,144 --> 02:38:56,237
But he led a raid tonight
on that shantytown...

2292
02:38:56,313 --> 02:38:59,111
where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble
this afternoon.

2293
02:38:59,182 --> 02:39:02,208
A lot of those shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.

2294
02:39:02,285 --> 02:39:06,346
It's about time you rebels learned you
can't take the law into your own hands.

2295
02:39:06,423 --> 02:39:08,391
What are you laughing at?

2296
02:39:09,659 --> 02:39:12,492
This isn't your night
to teach that lesson, Tom.

2297
02:39:12,562 --> 02:39:15,429
These two have been
with me tonight. Yes, sir.

2298
02:39:15,699 --> 02:39:17,326
With you, Rhett?

2299
02:39:17,901 --> 02:39:19,095
Where?

2300
02:39:23,073 --> 02:39:25,906
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.

2301
02:39:25,976 --> 02:39:27,603
You'd better say.

2302
02:39:27,711 --> 02:39:29,838
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.

2303
02:39:29,913 --> 02:39:31,107
Speak out, Capt. Butler!

2304
02:39:31,181 --> 02:39:34,673
I think I have a right to know
where my husband's been.

2305
02:39:36,086 --> 02:39:39,351
Well, ma'am, we dropped in
on a friend of mine...

2306
02:39:40,624 --> 02:39:42,285
and the Captain's.

2307
02:39:42,392 --> 02:39:44,223
A Mrs. Belle Watling.

2308
02:39:44,828 --> 02:39:47,922
We played cards, drank champagne and...

2309
02:39:48,698 --> 02:39:49,995
well...

2310
02:39:50,066 --> 02:39:53,502
Now you've done it! Did you have to
show me up in front of my wife?

2311
02:39:55,105 --> 02:39:57,073
Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.

2312
02:39:57,140 --> 02:40:00,473
These ladies won't be on speaking terms
with their husbands tomorrow.

2313
02:40:01,911 --> 02:40:03,936
Rhett, I had no idea, I...

2314
02:40:05,215 --> 02:40:09,174
Look here, will you take an oath
that they were with you tonight at...

2315
02:40:09,252 --> 02:40:10,378
at Belle's?

2316
02:40:10,787 --> 02:40:13,722
Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you, Captain.

2317
02:40:13,790 --> 02:40:16,224
Will you give me your word
as a gentleman?

2318
02:40:16,292 --> 02:40:17,725
As a gentleman?

2319
02:40:17,794 --> 02:40:19,557
Why, certainly, Tom.

2320
02:40:21,765 --> 02:40:23,062
Well, if I...

2321
02:40:23,133 --> 02:40:25,260
if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.

2322
02:40:26,369 --> 02:40:29,304
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I...

2323
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:32,533
If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.

2324
02:40:32,609 --> 02:40:35,203
Well, I say I'm sorry, and...

2325
02:40:36,346 --> 02:40:37,973
well, I am sorry.

2326
02:40:38,048 --> 02:40:39,743
Come on, Sergeant.

2327
02:40:46,022 --> 02:40:48,616
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.

2328
02:40:50,193 --> 02:40:51,285
Ashley.

2329
02:40:51,361 --> 02:40:53,886
He's all right. It's only in the shoulder.

2330
02:40:53,963 --> 02:40:56,329
Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound.

2331
02:40:56,399 --> 02:40:57,832
I think I can walk.

2332
02:40:58,868 --> 02:41:00,927
It's not worth the effort. Which way?

2333
02:41:01,004 --> 02:41:02,062
In here.

2334
02:41:03,740 --> 02:41:05,708
- Mammy, I want some hot water.
- Yes, sir.

2335
02:41:05,775 --> 02:41:07,572
- And lint for bandages.
- I'll find some.

2336
02:41:07,644 --> 02:41:10,272
Now what can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.

2337
02:41:10,346 --> 02:41:13,008
Were you really there?
What did it look like?

2338
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:17,746
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?

2339
02:41:17,821 --> 02:41:20,688
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,
remember yourself.

2340
02:41:22,692 --> 02:41:26,355
Now, Capt. Butler,
tell me what happened, all that happened.

2341
02:41:26,429 --> 02:41:27,794
I was too late.

2342
02:41:27,864 --> 02:41:29,729
When I got to the old Sullivan place...

2343
02:41:29,833 --> 02:41:31,994
there'd already been a skirmish
with the Yankees.

2344
02:41:32,068 --> 02:41:35,162
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded
and Dr. Meade was with him.

2345
02:41:35,238 --> 02:41:38,537
I had to prove they had been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.

2346
02:41:39,609 --> 02:41:41,270
So I took them to Belle's.

2347
02:41:41,344 --> 02:41:42,936
And she took them in?

2348
02:41:43,012 --> 02:41:45,674
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine.

2349
02:41:45,749 --> 02:41:47,740
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

2350
02:41:47,817 --> 02:41:51,150
I'm sorry I couldn't think up
a more dignified alibi.

2351
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:58,049
This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster, Capt. Butler.

2352
02:41:58,128 --> 02:42:01,620
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours.

2353
02:42:03,166 --> 02:42:06,431
And now I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs.

2354
02:42:12,142 --> 02:42:13,507
Oh, Ashley!

2355
02:42:15,311 --> 02:42:16,403
Ashley!

2356
02:42:18,448 --> 02:42:22,407
Have you no interest in what's become
of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?

2357
02:42:24,721 --> 02:42:27,155
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?

2358
02:42:27,223 --> 02:42:28,315
No.

2359
02:42:28,925 --> 02:42:30,586
Well, where is he?

2360
02:42:30,994 --> 02:42:33,394
He's lying out on Decatur Road...

2361
02:42:33,863 --> 02:42:35,728
shot through the head.

2362
02:42:36,499 --> 02:42:37,864
He's dead.

2363
02:42:47,877 --> 02:42:49,139
Who is it?

2364
02:42:49,312 --> 02:42:50,711
It's Miss Watling.

2365
02:42:50,780 --> 02:42:53,647
Oh, Miss Watling!
Won't you come in the house?

2366
02:42:53,716 --> 02:42:56,446
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.

2367
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:59,480
You come in and sit a minute with me.

2368
02:43:06,996 --> 02:43:09,464
How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us?

2369
02:43:09,532 --> 02:43:11,295
How can any of us thank you enough?

2370
02:43:11,367 --> 02:43:14,495
I got your note saying you was going
to call on me and thank me.

2371
02:43:14,571 --> 02:43:17,301
Why, Miss Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind.

2372
02:43:17,373 --> 02:43:19,898
I come up here as soon
as it was dark to tell you...

2373
02:43:19,976 --> 02:43:22,240
you mustn't even think of any such thing.

2374
02:43:22,312 --> 02:43:23,677
Why, I'm...

2375
02:43:24,247 --> 02:43:25,714
Why, you're...

2376
02:43:25,782 --> 02:43:27,579
Well, it wouldn't be fitting at all.

2377
02:43:27,650 --> 02:43:31,677
It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind
woman who saved my husband's life?

2378
02:43:31,754 --> 02:43:36,123
Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady
in this town nice to me like you was.

2379
02:43:36,893 --> 02:43:39,691
I mean, about the money
for the hospital, you know.

2380
02:43:39,762 --> 02:43:41,491
And I don't forget a kindness.

2381
02:43:41,564 --> 02:43:44,931
And I got to thinking about you
being left a widow with a little boy...

2382
02:43:45,001 --> 02:43:46,696
if Mr. Wilkes got hung...

2383
02:43:47,303 --> 02:43:50,636
and he's a nice little boy,
your boy is, Miss Wilkes.

2384
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:53,465
I got a boy myself and so I...

2385
02:43:54,077 --> 02:43:56,272
Oh, you have? Does he live...

2386
02:43:56,346 --> 02:43:59,076
Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.

2387
02:43:59,816 --> 02:44:01,716
He ain't never been here.

2388
02:44:01,784 --> 02:44:03,718
He's off at school.

2389
02:44:04,187 --> 02:44:06,815
I ain't seen him since he was little.

2390
02:44:09,225 --> 02:44:13,457
Well, anyway, if it had been
that Miss Kennedy's husband by himself...

2391
02:44:13,529 --> 02:44:16,965
I wouldn't have lifted a finger,
no matter what Capt. Butler said.

2392
02:44:17,033 --> 02:44:18,967
She's a mighty cold woman.

2393
02:44:19,035 --> 02:44:21,196
Prancing about Atlanta by herself.

2394
02:44:21,671 --> 02:44:24,538
She killed her husband
same as if she shot him.

2395
02:44:24,607 --> 02:44:27,269
You mustn't say unkind things
about my sister-in-law.

2396
02:44:30,914 --> 02:44:33,144
Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.

2397
02:44:33,216 --> 02:44:35,309
I forgot how you liked her.

2398
02:44:36,185 --> 02:44:40,212
But she just ain't in the same class
with you and I can't help it if I think so.

2399
02:44:41,024 --> 02:44:43,686
Well, anyway, I got to be going.

2400
02:44:44,327 --> 02:44:48,093
I'm scared somebody'll recognize
this carriage if I stayed here any longer.

2401
02:44:48,164 --> 02:44:50,359
That wouldn't do you no good.

2402
02:44:50,867 --> 02:44:52,300
And, Miss Wilkes...

2403
02:44:52,835 --> 02:44:56,236
if you ever see me on the street,
you don't have to speak to me.

2404
02:44:56,839 --> 02:44:58,431
I'll understand.

2405
02:44:58,975 --> 02:45:03,036
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you.

2406
02:45:04,113 --> 02:45:05,842
I hope we meet again.

2407
02:45:05,915 --> 02:45:08,145
Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fitting.

2408
02:45:10,219 --> 02:45:13,245
- Good night, Miss Wilkes.
- Good night, Miss Watling.

2409
02:45:18,528 --> 02:45:20,689
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.

2410
02:45:20,763 --> 02:45:22,958
She's brokenhearted about her husband.

2411
02:46:07,343 --> 02:46:09,607
Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.

2412
02:46:35,838 --> 02:46:38,329
Miss Scarlett, Capt. Butler here
to see you.

2413
02:46:38,408 --> 02:46:40,569
I told him you was prostrate with grief.

2414
02:46:40,643 --> 02:46:43,271
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.

2415
02:47:13,876 --> 02:47:15,309
She says she's coming.

2416
02:47:15,378 --> 02:47:18,040
I don't know why she's coming.
But she's a-coming.

2417
02:47:18,147 --> 02:47:19,637
You don't like me, Mammy.

2418
02:47:19,715 --> 02:47:22,946
Now don't you argue with me.
You don't. You really don't.

2419
02:47:35,031 --> 02:47:36,862
It's no good, Scarlett.

2420
02:47:36,933 --> 02:47:37,991
What?

2421
02:47:38,067 --> 02:47:39,466
The cologne.

2422
02:47:39,602 --> 02:47:41,763
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

2423
02:47:42,271 --> 02:47:45,672
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot.

2424
02:47:46,375 --> 02:47:49,538
What if I have? Is that any of your affair?

2425
02:47:51,514 --> 02:47:53,277
Don't drink alone, Scarlett.

2426
02:47:53,349 --> 02:47:56,250
People always find out
and it ruins the reputation.

2427
02:48:02,758 --> 02:48:03,884
What is it?

2428
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:06,326
This is more than losing old Frank.

2429
02:48:06,395 --> 02:48:07,760
Oh, Rhett...

2430
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:09,195
I'm so afraid.

2431
02:48:09,265 --> 02:48:11,961
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid in your life.

2432
02:48:12,034 --> 02:48:13,501
I'm afraid now.

2433
02:48:13,769 --> 02:48:16,397
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.

2434
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:20,675
You look pretty healthy,
and maybe there isn't any hell.

2435
02:48:20,743 --> 02:48:23,940
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it.

2436
02:48:24,881 --> 02:48:28,510
Well, far be it from me
to question the teachings of childhood.

2437
02:48:28,584 --> 02:48:31,883
Tell me what you've done
that hell yawns before you.

2438
02:48:32,788 --> 02:48:35,518
I ought never to have married Frank
to begin with.

2439
02:48:35,591 --> 02:48:38,651
He was Suellen's beau
and he loved her, not me.

2440
02:48:38,961 --> 02:48:41,691
And I made him miserable.
And I killed him.

2441
02:48:42,231 --> 02:48:44,165
Yes, I did. I killed him.

2442
02:48:47,603 --> 02:48:52,267
For the first time I'm finding out what it is
to be sorry for something I've done.

2443
02:48:52,808 --> 02:48:54,799
Here. Dry your eyes.

2444
02:48:55,711 --> 02:48:58,578
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently.

2445
02:48:58,714 --> 02:49:01,683
You're like the thief who isn't
the least bit sorry he stole...

2446
02:49:01,751 --> 02:49:04,743
but he's terribly, terribly sorry
he's going to jail.

2447
02:49:04,820 --> 02:49:06,788
I'm glad Mother's dead.

2448
02:49:07,523 --> 02:49:10,185
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.

2449
02:49:11,127 --> 02:49:14,290
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind and...

2450
02:49:15,097 --> 02:49:18,066
And I certainly have
turned out disappointing.

2451
02:49:19,502 --> 02:49:23,063
You know, Scarlett, I think
you're on the verge of a crying jag.

2452
02:49:31,013 --> 02:49:34,210
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say.

2453
02:49:34,283 --> 02:49:36,308
Say it, then, and get out!

2454
02:49:37,186 --> 02:49:38,175
What is it?

2455
02:49:38,254 --> 02:49:41,052
That I can't go on any longer without you.

2456
02:49:41,123 --> 02:49:45,219
You are the most ill-bred man to come
here at a time like this with your filthy...

2457
02:49:45,294 --> 02:49:47,888
I made up my mind that you were
the only woman for me...

2458
02:49:47,964 --> 02:49:49,625
the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.

2459
02:49:49,699 --> 02:49:52,224
Now that you've got the lumber mill
and Frank's money...

2460
02:49:52,301 --> 02:49:54,633
you won't come to me
as you did to the jail.

2461
02:49:54,704 --> 02:49:56,672
So I see I shall have to marry you.

2462
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:59,205
I never heard of such bad taste.

2463
02:49:59,275 --> 02:50:01,470
Would you be more convinced
if I fell to my knees?

2464
02:50:01,544 --> 02:50:03,637
Turn me loose, you varmint,
and get out of here!

2465
02:50:03,713 --> 02:50:06,944
Forgive me for startling you
with the impetuosity of my sentiments...

2466
02:50:07,016 --> 02:50:09,541
my dear Scarlett.
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2467
02:50:09,619 --> 02:50:12,747
But it cannot have escaped your notice
that for some time past...

2468
02:50:12,822 --> 02:50:16,223
the friendship I have felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.

2469
02:50:16,292 --> 02:50:19,693
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred.

2470
02:50:20,796 --> 02:50:22,889
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

2471
02:50:23,532 --> 02:50:26,126
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.

2472
02:50:26,202 --> 02:50:28,067
This is an honorable proposal
of marriage...

2473
02:50:28,137 --> 02:50:30,662
made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.

2474
02:50:31,641 --> 02:50:34,610
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.

2475
02:50:35,244 --> 02:50:37,405
You're coarse, and you're conceited.

2476
02:50:38,414 --> 02:50:40,974
And I think this conversation
has gone far enough.

2477
02:50:41,917 --> 02:50:44,385
Besides, I shall never marry again.

2478
02:50:45,454 --> 02:50:48,150
Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.

2479
02:50:48,491 --> 02:50:50,220
You? You?

2480
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:52,325
I don't love you!

2481
02:50:52,828 --> 02:50:55,092
And I don't like being married.

2482
02:50:56,065 --> 02:50:58,465
Did you ever think
of marrying just for fun?

2483
02:50:58,534 --> 02:51:01,970
Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.
Fun for men, you mean.

2484
02:51:02,772 --> 02:51:04,797
Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?

2485
02:51:04,874 --> 02:51:07,308
You've been married to a boy
and an old man.

2486
02:51:07,376 --> 02:51:10,436
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?

2487
02:51:11,314 --> 02:51:15,808
You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know
I shall always love another man.

2488
02:51:17,153 --> 02:51:20,782
Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?
Stop it! No more of that talk.

2489
02:51:26,796 --> 02:51:28,263
Rhett, don't, I shall faint.

2490
02:51:28,331 --> 02:51:31,095
I want you to faint.
This is what you were meant for.

2491
02:51:31,167 --> 02:51:34,364
None of the fools you've known
have kissed you like this, have they?

2492
02:51:34,437 --> 02:51:37,031
Your Charles, or your Frank,
or your stupid Ashley.

2493
02:51:45,214 --> 02:51:48,479
Say you're going to marry me.
Say "yes. " Say "yes. "

2494
02:51:48,551 --> 02:51:49,575
Yes.

2495
02:51:51,721 --> 02:51:54,383
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?

2496
02:51:54,457 --> 02:51:55,481
No.

2497
02:51:56,125 --> 02:51:58,753
Look at me and try to tell me the truth.

2498
02:51:58,828 --> 02:52:01,353
Did you say "yes" because of my money?

2499
02:52:01,430 --> 02:52:02,419
Well...

2500
02:52:02,732 --> 02:52:04,165
Yes. Partly.

2501
02:52:05,368 --> 02:52:06,460
Partly?

2502
02:52:07,169 --> 02:52:11,902
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,
and of course I am fond of you.

2503
02:52:12,074 --> 02:52:13,098
Fond of me?

2504
02:52:13,175 --> 02:52:16,667
If I said I was madly in love with you,
you'd know I was lying...

2505
02:52:16,746 --> 02:52:18,771
but you always said
we had a lot in common...

2506
02:52:18,848 --> 02:52:20,509
Yes, you're right, my dear.

2507
02:52:20,583 --> 02:52:23,051
I'm not in love with you any more
than you are with me.

2508
02:52:23,119 --> 02:52:25,849
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you.

2509
02:52:25,921 --> 02:52:28,014
What kind of a ring would you like,
my darling?

2510
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:31,287
A diamond ring.
And do buy a great big one, Rhett.

2511
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:34,261
You shall have the biggest
and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.

2512
02:52:34,330 --> 02:52:37,060
We'll go to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon...

2513
02:52:37,133 --> 02:52:38,293
my ill-gotten gains can buy.

2514
02:52:38,367 --> 02:52:40,028
That would be just heavenly.

2515
02:52:40,102 --> 02:52:42,297
And I think I'll buy your trousseau
for you, too.

2516
02:52:42,371 --> 02:52:44,498
Rhett, how wonderful, but...

2517
02:52:44,673 --> 02:52:47,233
you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?

2518
02:52:47,309 --> 02:52:49,334
Still the little hypocrite.

2519
02:52:51,447 --> 02:52:53,472
Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?

2520
02:52:53,549 --> 02:52:56,313
Don't you think you've had enough kissing
for one afternoon?

2521
02:52:56,385 --> 02:52:57,477
You're impossible.

2522
02:52:57,553 --> 02:52:59,953
You can go and I don't care
if you never come back.

2523
02:53:00,022 --> 02:53:01,819
But I will come back.

2524
02:53:16,338 --> 02:53:18,397
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?

2525
02:53:18,507 --> 02:53:21,032
I'm thinking about how rich we are.

2526
02:53:22,378 --> 02:53:24,710
Rhett, I can keep
the lumber business too, can't I?

2527
02:53:24,780 --> 02:53:26,941
Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.

2528
02:53:27,016 --> 02:53:29,985
Now that you're rich
you can tell everyone to go to the devil...

2529
02:53:30,052 --> 02:53:31,644
as you've always said you wanted to.

2530
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:34,188
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.

2531
02:53:52,141 --> 02:53:55,838
Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.

2532
02:53:55,911 --> 02:53:59,813
Rhett, can I have one of those
chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?

2533
02:53:59,882 --> 02:54:03,215
If you don't stop being such a glutton,
you'll get as fat as Mammy.

2534
02:54:03,285 --> 02:54:04,616
Then I'll divorce you.

2535
02:54:05,554 --> 02:54:08,284
Wouldn't it be nice if you bought
something for Mammy, too?

2536
02:54:08,357 --> 02:54:12,020
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?

2537
02:54:12,094 --> 02:54:13,527
Mules? Why mules?

2538
02:54:13,596 --> 02:54:17,362
Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,
and get ourselves all slicked up...

2539
02:54:17,433 --> 02:54:20,061
like racehorses but we were just mules
in horse harness...

2540
02:54:20,135 --> 02:54:22,228
and we didn't fool anybody.

2541
02:54:22,605 --> 02:54:24,402
I never heard anything more true.

2542
02:54:24,473 --> 02:54:26,270
Mammy's a smart old soul...

2543
02:54:26,342 --> 02:54:29,641
and one of the few people I know
whose respect I'd like to have.

2544
02:54:30,379 --> 02:54:32,609
I won't give her a thing.
She doesn't deserve it.

2545
02:54:32,681 --> 02:54:34,444
Then I'll take her a petticoat.

2546
02:54:34,517 --> 02:54:36,712
My Mammy always said
when she went to heaven...

2547
02:54:36,785 --> 02:54:40,744
she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,
so stiff that it would stand by itself...

2548
02:54:40,823 --> 02:54:44,054
and so rustly, the Lord would think
it was made of angels' wings.

2549
02:54:44,126 --> 02:54:47,289
Well, she won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.

2550
02:54:47,363 --> 02:54:50,127
That may be, but I'm making the gesture
just the same.

2551
02:54:54,837 --> 02:54:57,032
Wake up! Wake up!

2552
02:54:58,974 --> 02:55:01,442
You were having another nightmare.

2553
02:55:02,011 --> 02:55:03,376
Oh, Rhett.

2554
02:55:03,445 --> 02:55:05,640
I was so cold and hungry...

2555
02:55:05,714 --> 02:55:07,375
and so tired I...

2556
02:55:07,816 --> 02:55:11,775
I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist
and I couldn't find it.

2557
02:55:12,621 --> 02:55:15,146
- Find what, honey?
- I don't know.

2558
02:55:15,391 --> 02:55:18,451
I always dream the same dream
and I never know.

2559
02:55:18,561 --> 02:55:20,552
It seems to be hidden in the mist.

2560
02:55:20,629 --> 02:55:21,721
Darling.

2561
02:55:23,032 --> 02:55:27,162
Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I've found it and that I'm safe?

2562
02:55:28,504 --> 02:55:32,600
Dreams don't work that way, but when
you get used to being safe and warm...

2563
02:55:33,075 --> 02:55:35,305
you'll stop dreaming that dream.

2564
02:55:35,377 --> 02:55:38,744
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see
that you are safe.

2565
02:55:42,718 --> 02:55:45,380
Would you do something
for me if I asked you?

2566
02:55:45,454 --> 02:55:47,081
You know I would.

2567
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:50,188
Will you take me away from here?

2568
02:55:50,526 --> 02:55:51,993
Don't you like New Orleans?

2569
02:55:52,061 --> 02:55:56,157
I love New Orleans,
but I want to go home and visit Tara.

2570
02:55:56,999 --> 02:55:59,024
Will you take me to Tara?

2571
02:55:59,368 --> 02:56:03,862
Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow.

2572
02:56:07,276 --> 02:56:10,074
You get your strength
from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.

2573
02:56:10,145 --> 02:56:12,204
You're part of it, and it's part of you.

2574
02:56:12,281 --> 02:56:16,012
Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara
the way it was before the war.

2575
02:56:16,085 --> 02:56:18,986
Would you?
Then go ahead and make it that way.

2576
02:56:19,521 --> 02:56:22,820
Spend whatever you want,
make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.

2577
02:56:23,425 --> 02:56:24,915
Oh, Rhett.

2578
02:56:25,527 --> 02:56:27,290
Rhett, you are good to me.

2579
02:56:27,363 --> 02:56:29,695
And can we still have
our big new house in Atlanta?

2580
02:56:29,765 --> 02:56:32,325
Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want:

2581
02:56:32,801 --> 02:56:35,167
Marble terraces, stained-glass windows
and all.

2582
02:56:35,237 --> 02:56:37,137
Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?

2583
02:56:37,206 --> 02:56:40,607
I want everybody who's been mean to me
to be pea-green with envy.

2584
02:56:42,177 --> 02:56:46,341
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,
building that new house just to show off...

2585
02:56:46,482 --> 02:56:48,712
and even taking our servants.

2586
02:56:49,685 --> 02:56:52,586
Oh, darling, you mustn't think
unkindly of her.

2587
02:56:53,055 --> 02:56:56,081
She's made it possible for us
to keep Tara always.

2588
02:56:56,158 --> 02:56:58,149
Yes, and what good is Tara?

2589
02:56:58,227 --> 02:57:01,788
She's had three husbands
and I'll be an old maid.

2590
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:06,631
Great Jehoshaphat!

2591
02:57:07,436 --> 02:57:09,131
Great Jehoshaphat!

2592
02:57:09,571 --> 02:57:11,402
Lordsy, we sure is rich now!

2593
02:57:11,473 --> 02:57:12,804
It ain't quality.

2594
02:57:13,342 --> 02:57:15,537
But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?

2595
02:57:16,011 --> 02:57:18,741
I'm entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like.

2596
02:57:18,814 --> 02:57:22,580
You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.
You'll be seeing it for a long time.

2597
02:57:23,118 --> 02:57:25,951
I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,
about it's not being a boy.

2598
02:57:26,021 --> 02:57:28,387
Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.
Who wants a boy?

2599
02:57:28,457 --> 02:57:31,654
Boys aren't any use to anybody.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?

2600
02:57:32,428 --> 02:57:34,259
Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.

2601
02:57:34,329 --> 02:57:36,854
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?

2602
02:57:37,166 --> 02:57:38,497
She sure is.

2603
02:57:39,401 --> 02:57:41,028
Did you ever see a prettier one?

2604
02:57:41,103 --> 02:57:45,403
Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh
that pretty when she come, but not quite.

2605
02:57:45,474 --> 02:57:47,499
Have another glass, Mammy.

2606
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:53,673
What's that rustling noise I hear?

2607
02:57:53,749 --> 02:57:57,981
Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothing but
my red silk petticoat you done give me.

2608
02:57:58,053 --> 02:58:01,147
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it. Let me see.

2609
02:58:01,223 --> 02:58:02,815
Pull up your skirt.

2610
02:58:02,891 --> 02:58:05,086
Mr. Rhett, you is bad.

2611
02:58:05,527 --> 02:58:06,755
Yeah, oh, Lord!

2612
02:58:12,701 --> 02:58:15,864
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it.

2613
02:58:15,938 --> 02:58:17,565
Yes, sir, too long.

2614
02:58:18,273 --> 02:58:20,468
No more mule in horse's harness?

2615
02:58:20,542 --> 02:58:23,773
Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad
telling you about that.

2616
02:58:23,846 --> 02:58:26,781
You ain't holding that
against old Mammy, is you?

2617
02:58:26,849 --> 02:58:29,682
No, I ain't holding it against you.
I just wanted to know.

2618
02:58:29,752 --> 02:58:32,653
Have another glass, Mammy.
Here, take the whole bottle.

2619
02:58:32,721 --> 02:58:35,713
Dr. Meade says you may go in now,
Capt. Butler.

2620
02:58:39,061 --> 02:58:41,222
This sure is a happy day to me.

2621
02:58:41,296 --> 02:58:44,527
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls...

2622
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:46,659
and it sure is a happy day.

2623
02:58:46,835 --> 02:58:50,202
Oh, yes, Mammy.
The happiest days are when babies come.

2624
02:58:50,272 --> 02:58:51,671
I wish...

2625
02:58:52,007 --> 02:58:55,170
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?

2626
02:58:55,277 --> 02:58:57,677
Miss Scarlett done told me
if it was a girl...

2627
02:58:57,780 --> 02:59:01,011
she's going to name it Eugenie Victoria.

2628
02:59:01,683 --> 02:59:02,911
Yes...

2629
02:59:02,985 --> 02:59:04,919
she's a beautiful baby...

2630
02:59:05,687 --> 02:59:08,087
the most beautiful baby ever.

2631
02:59:09,158 --> 02:59:10,352
Yes.

2632
02:59:11,894 --> 02:59:14,226
Do you know that this is your birthday?

2633
02:59:14,930 --> 02:59:17,091
That you're a week old today?

2634
02:59:17,733 --> 02:59:22,568
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes
of which this town has never seen.

2635
02:59:23,605 --> 02:59:27,132
Yes, I'm gonna send her
to the best schools in Charleston.

2636
02:59:27,209 --> 02:59:31,236
Yes. And her'll be received
by the best families in the South.

2637
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:34,571
And when it comes time for her to marry...

2638
02:59:34,650 --> 02:59:37,585
well, she'll be a little princess.

2639
02:59:38,487 --> 02:59:40,682
You certainly are making a fool of yourself.

2640
02:59:40,756 --> 02:59:42,018
And why shouldn't I?

2641
02:59:43,058 --> 02:59:46,357
She's the first person
who's ever completely belonged to me.

2642
02:59:47,362 --> 02:59:49,057
Great balls of fire!

2643
02:59:49,131 --> 02:59:50,962
I had the baby, didn't I?

2644
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:53,158
It's Melanie. May I come in?

2645
02:59:53,235 --> 02:59:54,395
Come in, Melly.

2646
02:59:54,469 --> 02:59:58,132
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's
beautiful blue eyes.

2647
02:59:59,775 --> 03:00:02,869
But, Capt. Butler, most babies
have blue eyes when they're born.

2648
03:00:02,978 --> 03:00:06,038
Don't try to tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.

2649
03:00:06,114 --> 03:00:09,311
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they're going to stay blue.

2650
03:00:09,384 --> 03:00:11,716
As blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag.

2651
03:00:12,287 --> 03:00:14,778
That's it. That's what we'll call her.

2652
03:00:14,857 --> 03:00:16,586
Bonnie Blue Butler.

2653
03:00:24,831 --> 03:00:26,423
Try again, Mammy.

2654
03:00:34,040 --> 03:00:35,166
Twenty inches.

2655
03:00:35,675 --> 03:00:38,735
Twenty inches!
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

2656
03:00:38,811 --> 03:00:41,609
You've simply got to make it
18.5 again, Mammy.

2657
03:00:41,681 --> 03:00:43,273
You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...

2658
03:00:43,349 --> 03:00:45,840
and you ain't never going to be
no 18.5 inches again.

2659
03:00:45,919 --> 03:00:48,911
Never. And there ain't nothing
to do about it.

2660
03:00:49,489 --> 03:00:51,650
There is something to do about it!

2661
03:00:51,724 --> 03:00:55,057
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.

2662
03:00:55,461 --> 03:00:57,861
I just won't have any more babies!

2663
03:00:58,331 --> 03:01:02,062
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'll be wanting a son next year.

2664
03:01:02,135 --> 03:01:04,968
Go tell Capt. Butler
I've decided not to go out after all.

2665
03:01:05,038 --> 03:01:06,972
I'll have supper in my room.

2666
03:01:27,327 --> 03:01:31,058
I got your message. I'll have them bring
my supper up here, too.

2667
03:01:38,071 --> 03:01:39,766
No objections to that, I hope?

2668
03:01:39,872 --> 03:01:40,998
No.

2669
03:01:42,275 --> 03:01:43,435
Yes.

2670
03:01:45,244 --> 03:01:48,145
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.

2671
03:01:50,383 --> 03:01:51,407
Rhett?

2672
03:01:52,285 --> 03:01:53,309
Yes?

2673
03:01:53,386 --> 03:01:54,717
You see...

2674
03:01:54,988 --> 03:01:56,888
well, I've decided...

2675
03:01:58,891 --> 03:02:01,792
well, I hope I don't have
any more children.

2676
03:02:14,007 --> 03:02:16,908
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...

2677
03:02:17,810 --> 03:02:20,802
it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20!

2678
03:02:20,913 --> 03:02:23,006
No, but you know what I...

2679
03:02:23,149 --> 03:02:24,741
Do you know what I mean?

2680
03:02:24,817 --> 03:02:27,877
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?

2681
03:02:28,855 --> 03:02:31,346
You're just low enough
to think of something like that!

2682
03:02:31,424 --> 03:02:35,360
If you had any chivalry in you or would
be nice, like... Well, Ashley Wilkes!

2683
03:02:35,428 --> 03:02:37,953
Melanie can't have any more children
and he...

2684
03:02:40,066 --> 03:02:42,899
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon, haven't you?

2685
03:02:42,969 --> 03:02:45,301
What has that got to do with it?

2686
03:02:46,205 --> 03:02:49,663
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.

2687
03:02:49,742 --> 03:02:51,972
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

2688
03:02:53,279 --> 03:02:55,270
You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.

2689
03:02:55,348 --> 03:02:56,508
Sorry for me?

2690
03:02:56,582 --> 03:02:59,881
Yes, because you're throwing away
happiness with both hands...

2691
03:02:59,952 --> 03:03:02,716
and reaching out for something
that'll never make you happy.

2692
03:03:02,789 --> 03:03:04,518
I don't know what you're talking about.

2693
03:03:04,590 --> 03:03:07,821
If you were free and Melly were dead
and you had your precious...

2694
03:03:07,894 --> 03:03:10,795
honorable Ashley, do you think
you'd be happy with him?

2695
03:03:11,664 --> 03:03:15,122
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...

2696
03:03:15,401 --> 03:03:18,302
any more than you understand anything
except money.

2697
03:03:18,371 --> 03:03:20,635
Never mind about that!
What I want to know is...

2698
03:03:20,707 --> 03:03:24,575
You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.
It'll work no hardship on me.

2699
03:03:25,044 --> 03:03:26,602
Do you mean to say you don't care?

2700
03:03:26,679 --> 03:03:30,410
The world is full of many things
and many people, and I shan't be lonely.

2701
03:03:30,983 --> 03:03:32,917
I'll find comfort elsewhere.

2702
03:03:32,985 --> 03:03:34,976
Well, that's fine. But I warn you.

2703
03:03:35,054 --> 03:03:38,217
Just in case you change your mind,
I intend to lock my door.

2704
03:03:38,291 --> 03:03:41,749
Why bother? If I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out!

2705
03:04:00,379 --> 03:04:03,780
I always knew that most women
were cheats, hypocritical and hard.

2706
03:04:03,850 --> 03:04:06,284
- But this one...
- Rhett, it ain't no use.

2707
03:04:06,352 --> 03:04:09,253
- What do you mean?
- I mean you're poisoned with her.

2708
03:04:09,322 --> 03:04:12,519
I don't care what she's done to you,
you're still in love with her.

2709
03:04:12,592 --> 03:04:14,651
And don't think it pleasures me none
to say it.

2710
03:04:14,727 --> 03:04:17,628
Maybe so! But I'm through with her,
I tell you! I'm through.

2711
03:04:17,697 --> 03:04:21,360
You gotta think of the child.
The child's worth ten of the mother.

2712
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:30,871
You're a shrewd woman, Belle,
and a very nice one.

2713
03:04:32,512 --> 03:04:33,501
Yes, Rhett?

2714
03:04:33,579 --> 03:04:37,140
I was just thinking of the difference
between you and...

2715
03:04:37,216 --> 03:04:40,674
You're both hardheaded businesswomen
and you're both successful.

2716
03:04:40,753 --> 03:04:42,846
But you've got a heart, Belle...

2717
03:04:44,490 --> 03:04:46,117
and you're honest.

2718
03:04:48,561 --> 03:04:50,119
Goodbye, Rhett.

2719
03:04:51,030 --> 03:04:52,588
Goodbye, Belle.

2720
03:05:08,147 --> 03:05:10,308
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!

2721
03:05:10,550 --> 03:05:12,575
Look at those hands, and that seat!

2722
03:05:12,819 --> 03:05:13,877
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!

2723
03:05:13,953 --> 03:05:17,286
Why do we have to wheel a baby
when there are servants...

2724
03:05:17,356 --> 03:05:18,755
Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.

2725
03:05:18,825 --> 03:05:20,019
Good morning, Capt. Butler.

2726
03:05:20,092 --> 03:05:21,423
Good morning, Scarlett.

2727
03:05:21,494 --> 03:05:24,088
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these old buffaloes!

2728
03:05:24,163 --> 03:05:27,655
If you'd thought of your position
years ago, you wouldn't have to do this.

2729
03:05:27,733 --> 03:05:32,170
But as it is, we'll cultivate every female
dragon of the old guard in this town.

2730
03:05:32,605 --> 03:05:34,095
Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.

2731
03:05:34,173 --> 03:05:37,472
Good morning, Capt. Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.

2732
03:05:38,244 --> 03:05:41,475
So the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable!

2733
03:05:41,614 --> 03:05:43,878
All of our money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.

2734
03:05:43,950 --> 03:05:46,180
Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.

2735
03:05:46,252 --> 03:05:48,777
But Bonnie's going to have her place
among decent people.

2736
03:05:48,855 --> 03:05:52,450
Yes, even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat.

2737
03:05:53,226 --> 03:05:54,921
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

2738
03:05:55,228 --> 03:05:57,890
Good morning, Capt. Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.

2739
03:06:04,103 --> 03:06:07,231
Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had
a great regard for your knowledge.

2740
03:06:07,306 --> 03:06:09,035
I wonder if you could give me
some advice.

2741
03:06:09,108 --> 03:06:10,166
Certainly.

2742
03:06:10,243 --> 03:06:12,575
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't make her stop it.

2743
03:06:12,645 --> 03:06:15,079
Make her stop it.
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

2744
03:06:15,147 --> 03:06:16,239
I know, I know.

2745
03:06:16,315 --> 03:06:19,944
She has such a beautiful mouth, too.
I tried putting soap under her nails.

2746
03:06:20,019 --> 03:06:21,111
Soap! Bah!

2747
03:06:21,187 --> 03:06:24,679
Put quinine on her thumb
and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

2748
03:06:24,924 --> 03:06:27,722
Quinine! I never would have thought of it.

2749
03:06:27,793 --> 03:06:29,988
I can't thank you enough,
Mrs. Merriwether.

2750
03:06:30,062 --> 03:06:33,156
You've taken a great load off my mind!
Good morning.

2751
03:06:36,769 --> 03:06:38,259
Good morning, Dolly.

2752
03:06:38,337 --> 03:06:39,964
Wasn't that Capt. Butler?

2753
03:06:40,039 --> 03:06:42,906
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking.

2754
03:06:42,975 --> 03:06:47,071
There must be a great deal of good
in a man who could love a child so much.

2755
03:06:47,146 --> 03:06:49,011
But of course there is!

2756
03:06:49,081 --> 03:06:52,847
Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing
told Dr. Meade that Capt. Butler...

2757
03:06:52,919 --> 03:06:55,752
finally admitted he was honored
by the Confederate Congress...

2758
03:06:55,821 --> 03:06:57,846
for his services at the Battle of Franklin?

2759
03:06:57,924 --> 03:07:01,052
No! And did I tell you, Caroline,
that Capt. Butler...

2760
03:07:01,127 --> 03:07:04,688
made a stupendous contribution
to the Association for the Beautification...

2761
03:07:04,764 --> 03:07:06,698
of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?

2762
03:07:06,766 --> 03:07:07,824
No.

2763
03:07:08,501 --> 03:07:12,267
My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week.

2764
03:07:12,338 --> 03:07:15,136
Why, Dolly Merriwether,
you know right well it was my idea...

2765
03:07:15,207 --> 03:07:16,731
to give a party for Bonnie Butler.

2766
03:07:16,809 --> 03:07:18,140
Why Caroline Meade...

2767
03:07:27,253 --> 03:07:30,689
Now watch Daddy put your pony over,
Bonnie. Now watch.

2768
03:07:33,426 --> 03:07:35,724
Daddy, let me! Let me!

2769
03:07:35,895 --> 03:07:38,489
All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!

2770
03:07:41,934 --> 03:07:43,196
Up we go.

2771
03:07:43,402 --> 03:07:44,699
Oh, there!

2772
03:07:45,004 --> 03:07:47,495
Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!

2773
03:07:47,573 --> 03:07:51,270
Grip tightly with your legs. Sit close.
Lean forward. Be sure you go with him.

2774
03:07:51,344 --> 03:07:54,108
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.
Up!

2775
03:07:54,981 --> 03:07:57,108
That was fine! I knew you'd do it!

2776
03:07:57,183 --> 03:08:00,380
When you get a little older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.

2777
03:08:00,453 --> 03:08:04,355
You'll be the greatest horsewoman
in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.

2778
03:08:05,057 --> 03:08:06,820
Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!

2779
03:08:07,460 --> 03:08:08,620
Mr. Rhett!

2780
03:08:09,528 --> 03:08:12,122
Did you see her, Mammy?
Wasn't she wonderful?

2781
03:08:12,198 --> 03:08:16,134
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you
it just ain't fitting...

2782
03:08:16,202 --> 03:08:19,399
for a girl child to ride astraddle
with her dress flying up!

2783
03:08:19,472 --> 03:08:21,838
All right, Mammy.
I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.

2784
03:08:21,907 --> 03:08:25,138
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.
She'll love that.

2785
03:08:25,211 --> 03:08:27,509
A nice black broadcloth
is what little girls wear.

2786
03:08:27,580 --> 03:08:29,707
Now, Mammy, be reasonable.

2787
03:08:30,216 --> 03:08:32,411
Well, I don't think it's fitting, but...

2788
03:08:34,453 --> 03:08:37,115
It ain't fitting, it just ain't fitting.

2789
03:08:38,090 --> 03:08:39,387
It ain't fitting.

2790
03:08:49,869 --> 03:08:51,336
Why, Scarlett!

2791
03:08:51,670 --> 03:08:53,797
What are you doing downtown
at this time of day?

2792
03:08:53,873 --> 03:08:54,931
Ashley, I just...

2793
03:08:55,007 --> 03:08:58,568
Why aren't you helping Melly get ready
for my surprise birthday party?

2794
03:08:58,644 --> 03:09:02,239
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed
to know anything about that.

2795
03:09:02,314 --> 03:09:05,044
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised.

2796
03:09:05,117 --> 03:09:08,575
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.

2797
03:09:09,288 --> 03:09:11,620
As long as you're here,
let me show you the books...

2798
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:14,488
so you can see just how bad
a businessman I really am.

2799
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:16,721
Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.

2800
03:09:16,796 --> 03:09:19,594
When I'm wearing a new bonnet,
all the figures I ever knew...

2801
03:09:19,665 --> 03:09:21,394
go right slap out of my head.

2802
03:09:21,467 --> 03:09:25,096
The figures are well lost
when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.

2803
03:09:25,171 --> 03:09:28,140
Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time.

2804
03:09:29,108 --> 03:09:32,942
You haven't changed a bit since the day
of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...

2805
03:09:33,479 --> 03:09:36,846
where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaux.

2806
03:09:38,484 --> 03:09:40,884
That girl doesn't exist anymore.

2807
03:09:41,387 --> 03:09:44,220
Nothing's turned out
as I expected, Ashley.

2808
03:09:44,290 --> 03:09:45,587
Nothing.

2809
03:09:46,092 --> 03:09:50,392
Yes, we've traveled a long road
since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?

2810
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:52,192
Oh, the lazy days...

2811
03:09:52,264 --> 03:09:54,789
the warm, still country twilights...

2812
03:09:55,768 --> 03:09:58,999
the high, soft Negro laughter
from the quarters...

2813
03:09:59,572 --> 03:10:02,803
the golden warmth and security
of those days.

2814
03:10:05,044 --> 03:10:07,035
Don't look back, Ashley.

2815
03:10:07,246 --> 03:10:08,873
Don't look back.

2816
03:10:10,549 --> 03:10:15,248
It drags at your heart
till you can't do anything but look back.

2817
03:10:20,392 --> 03:10:23,088
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.

2818
03:10:23,762 --> 03:10:27,254
I never want you to be anything
but completely happy.

2819
03:10:47,219 --> 03:10:48,277
Oh, Ashley!

2820
03:10:50,789 --> 03:10:51,881
Who is it?

2821
03:10:51,957 --> 03:10:53,618
Only your husband.

2822
03:10:54,260 --> 03:10:55,522
Come in.

2823
03:10:56,562 --> 03:10:59,656
Am I actually being invited
into the sanctuary?

2824
03:11:00,332 --> 03:11:02,732
You're not ready for Melanie's party.

2825
03:11:02,801 --> 03:11:04,325
I've got a headache, Rhett.

2826
03:11:04,403 --> 03:11:07,600
You go without me
and make my excuses to Melanie.

2827
03:11:08,874 --> 03:11:12,401
What a white-livered little coward
you are. Get up.

2828
03:11:12,478 --> 03:11:14,810
You're going to that party
and you'll have to hurry.

2829
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:16,472
- Has India dared to...
- Yes. India has!

2830
03:11:16,549 --> 03:11:18,483
Every woman and man in town
knows the story!

2831
03:11:18,551 --> 03:11:20,178
You should kill them, spreading lies.

2832
03:11:20,252 --> 03:11:23,085
I have a strange way of not killing people
who tell the truth.

2833
03:11:23,155 --> 03:11:24,679
There's no time to argue. Get up!

2834
03:11:24,757 --> 03:11:27,726
I won't go! I can't go
till this misunderstanding is cleared up.

2835
03:11:27,793 --> 03:11:30,489
Don't cheat Melly
out of the satisfaction of publicly...

2836
03:11:30,563 --> 03:11:31,860
ordering you out of her house.

2837
03:11:31,931 --> 03:11:33,796
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so.

2838
03:11:33,866 --> 03:11:35,629
I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.

2839
03:11:35,701 --> 03:11:39,193
If you don't go, you won't be able
to show your face as long as you live.

2840
03:11:39,271 --> 03:11:42,172
That wouldn't bother me, but
you won't ruin Bonnie's chances.

2841
03:11:42,241 --> 03:11:46,007
You're going to that party,
if only for her sake. Now get dressed!

2842
03:11:59,124 --> 03:12:02,992
Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly
will do for this occasion.

2843
03:12:03,062 --> 03:12:06,259
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.

2844
03:12:13,339 --> 03:12:18,208
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

2845
03:12:18,644 --> 03:12:23,445
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny</i>

2846
03:12:24,116 --> 03:12:27,813
<i>Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny</i>

2847
03:12:28,554 --> 03:12:30,988
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

2848
03:12:32,791 --> 03:12:35,316
- Good night, Scarlett.
- But Rhett, you can't...

2849
03:12:35,394 --> 03:12:38,363
You go into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry for you.

2850
03:12:38,430 --> 03:12:40,159
Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.

2851
03:12:40,232 --> 03:12:41,529
You're not afraid?

2852
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:43,727
<i>Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny</i>

2853
03:12:43,802 --> 03:12:48,364
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

2854
03:12:48,474 --> 03:12:52,911
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny</i>

2855
03:13:08,260 --> 03:13:10,558
What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.

2856
03:13:10,629 --> 03:13:12,290
India wasn't able to come tonight.

2857
03:13:12,364 --> 03:13:13,592
Will you be an angel?

2858
03:13:13,666 --> 03:13:16,897
I do need you to help me
receive my guests.

2859
03:13:19,972 --> 03:13:21,405
Mrs. Meade...

2860
03:13:21,640 --> 03:13:23,801
here's our darling Scarlett.

2861
03:13:25,311 --> 03:13:26,369
Good evening.

2862
03:13:26,478 --> 03:13:27,740
Good evening.

2863
03:13:27,813 --> 03:13:29,212
Why, Scarlett!

2864
03:13:29,648 --> 03:13:32,515
- Good evening, Miss Scarlett.
- Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

2865
03:13:33,285 --> 03:13:36,777
Ashley, aren't you going to get
our Scarlett a glass of punch?

2866
03:13:44,363 --> 03:13:47,298
Did you have a good time tonight
at Miss Melly's party, child?

2867
03:13:47,366 --> 03:13:48,390
Yes, yes.

2868
03:13:48,467 --> 03:13:50,332
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word.

2869
03:13:50,402 --> 03:13:53,496
If Capt. Butler asks for me
when he comes back, I'm asleep.

2870
03:13:53,872 --> 03:13:55,134
Yes, ma'am.

2871
03:14:24,303 --> 03:14:26,100
Come in, Mrs. Butler.

2872
03:14:35,114 --> 03:14:36,445
Come here.

2873
03:14:52,131 --> 03:14:53,155
Sit down!

2874
03:14:55,834 --> 03:14:59,270
There's no reason why you shouldn't have
your nightcap even if I am here.

2875
03:14:59,338 --> 03:15:01,772
I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and...

2876
03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:04,104
You heard nothing of the kind.

2877
03:15:04,176 --> 03:15:06,974
You wouldn't have come down
if you'd thought I was here.

2878
03:15:07,045 --> 03:15:09,275
- You must need a drink badly.
- I do not!

2879
03:15:09,348 --> 03:15:12,146
Take it. Don't give yourself airs.

2880
03:15:12,217 --> 03:15:15,277
I know you drink on the quiet,
and I know how much you drink.

2881
03:15:15,721 --> 03:15:18,019
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?

2882
03:15:24,797 --> 03:15:26,492
You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!

2883
03:15:26,565 --> 03:15:28,055
I'm very drunk...

2884
03:15:28,400 --> 03:15:31,597
and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over...

2885
03:15:32,404 --> 03:15:35,134
but you're not going to bed, not yet.

2886
03:15:36,408 --> 03:15:37,534
Sit down.

2887
03:15:40,746 --> 03:15:42,680
So she stood by you, did she?

2888
03:15:43,916 --> 03:15:47,511
How does it feel to have the woman
you've wronged cloak your sins for you?

2889
03:15:49,188 --> 03:15:52,157
You're wondering if she knows
all about you and Ashley.

2890
03:15:52,424 --> 03:15:55,018
You're wondering if she did it
just to save her face.

2891
03:15:55,427 --> 03:15:59,295
You're thinking that she's a fool for
doing it even if it did save your hide.

2892
03:15:59,364 --> 03:16:01,525
- I will not listen.
- Yes, you'll listen!

2893
03:16:02,601 --> 03:16:05,001
Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think.

2894
03:16:05,604 --> 03:16:09,199
It's just that there's too much honor in her
to ever conceive of dishonor...

2895
03:16:09,274 --> 03:16:10,866
in anyone she loves.

2896
03:16:11,643 --> 03:16:13,235
And she loves you.

2897
03:16:13,679 --> 03:16:16,512
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know!

2898
03:16:17,683 --> 03:16:20,948
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything.

2899
03:16:21,420 --> 03:16:24,480
- As it is, though...
- If you get out of that chair once more...

2900
03:16:28,727 --> 03:16:33,357
Of course, the comic figure in all this
is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.

2901
03:16:34,399 --> 03:16:37,368
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife...

2902
03:16:37,469 --> 03:16:40,029
and won't be unfaithful to her technically.

2903
03:16:41,707 --> 03:16:43,470
Why doesn't he make up his mind?

2904
03:16:43,575 --> 03:16:45,065
Rhett, you...

2905
03:16:48,113 --> 03:16:50,513
Observe my hands, my dear.

2906
03:16:51,517 --> 03:16:53,951
I could tear you to pieces with them.

2907
03:16:54,620 --> 03:16:58,147
And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley
out of your mind forever.

2908
03:16:59,224 --> 03:17:00,782
But it wouldn't.

2909
03:17:01,627 --> 03:17:05,393
So I'll remove him
from your mind forever this way.

2910
03:17:06,598 --> 03:17:08,691
I'll put my hands so...

2911
03:17:09,568 --> 03:17:11,695
one on each side of your head...

2912
03:17:12,704 --> 03:17:16,765
and I'll smash your skull between them
like a walnut.

2913
03:17:17,576 --> 03:17:19,806
That'll block him out.

2914
03:17:21,079 --> 03:17:23,775
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.

2915
03:17:29,054 --> 03:17:32,285
You know I've always admired
your spirit, my dear.

2916
03:17:33,258 --> 03:17:36,022
Never more than now,
when you're cornered.

2917
03:17:36,728 --> 03:17:38,093
I'm not cornered.

2918
03:17:38,163 --> 03:17:40,996
You'll never corner me,
Rhett Butler, or frighten me!

2919
03:17:41,066 --> 03:17:44,558
You've lived in dirt so long,
you can't understand anything else.

2920
03:17:44,636 --> 03:17:48,367
And you're jealous of something
you can't understand. Good night!

2921
03:17:50,909 --> 03:17:52,274
Jealous, am I?

2922
03:17:52,377 --> 03:17:54,174
Yes, I suppose I am.

2923
03:17:54,780 --> 03:17:58,272
Even though I know
you've been faithful to me all along.

2924
03:17:58,417 --> 03:17:59,645
How do I know?

2925
03:17:59,785 --> 03:18:02,948
Because I know Ashley Wilkes
and his honorable breed.

2926
03:18:03,555 --> 03:18:05,147
They're gentlemen.

2927
03:18:05,290 --> 03:18:08,521
And that's more than I can say
for you or for me.

2928
03:18:08,961 --> 03:18:12,488
We're not gentlemen,
and we have no honor, have we?

2929
03:18:22,140 --> 03:18:24,233
It's not that easy, Scarlett.

2930
03:18:28,213 --> 03:18:30,545
You turned me out
while you chased Ashley Wilkes...

2931
03:18:30,616 --> 03:18:32,413
while you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.

2932
03:18:32,484 --> 03:18:34,714
This is one night
you're not turning me out.

2933
03:19:03,215 --> 03:19:05,342
How are you feeling
this morning, Mammy?

2934
03:19:05,417 --> 03:19:09,285
Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.

2935
03:19:12,257 --> 03:19:14,782
You acting mighty happy this morning,
Miss Scarlett.

2936
03:19:14,926 --> 03:19:16,393
I am, Mammy. I am.

2937
03:19:23,535 --> 03:19:28,370
<i>Oh, she wept with delight
when he gave her a smile</i>

2938
03:19:28,874 --> 03:19:32,833
<i>And trembled with fear at his frown</i>

2939
03:19:50,328 --> 03:19:51,352
Hello.

2940
03:19:54,199 --> 03:19:57,794
I'd like to extend my apology
for my conduct of last night.

2941
03:19:58,070 --> 03:19:59,697
Oh, but Rhett...

2942
03:19:59,771 --> 03:20:00,999
I was very drunk...

2943
03:20:01,073 --> 03:20:04,338
and quite swept off my feet
by your charms.

2944
03:20:06,778 --> 03:20:10,339
Well, you needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you ever do surprises me!

2945
03:20:10,849 --> 03:20:13,647
I've been thinking things over,
and I really believe that...

2946
03:20:13,719 --> 03:20:15,243
it would be better for both of us...

2947
03:20:15,320 --> 03:20:18,050
if we admitted we'd made a mistake
and got a divorce.

2948
03:20:18,390 --> 03:20:19,857
- A divorce?
- Yes.

2949
03:20:19,925 --> 03:20:22,621
There's no point in our holding on
to each other, is there?

2950
03:20:22,694 --> 03:20:25,094
I'll provide for you amply.
You've plenty of grounds.

2951
03:20:25,163 --> 03:20:28,132
Just give me Bonnie.
Say what you please. I won't contest.

2952
03:20:28,200 --> 03:20:29,189
Thank you very much.

2953
03:20:29,267 --> 03:20:32,293
But I wouldn't dream
of disgracing my family with a divorce.

2954
03:20:33,038 --> 03:20:35,529
You'd disgrace it quick enough
if Ashley were free.

2955
03:20:35,607 --> 03:20:38,599
It makes my head spin to think
how quickly you'd divorce me.

2956
03:20:39,745 --> 03:20:41,144
Wouldn't you, Scarlett?

2957
03:20:42,581 --> 03:20:43,809
Well, answer me.

2958
03:20:43,882 --> 03:20:44,906
Wouldn't you?

2959
03:20:44,983 --> 03:20:47,213
Will you please go now
and leave me alone?

2960
03:20:48,754 --> 03:20:51,552
Yes, I'm going.
That's what I came to tell you.

2961
03:20:52,090 --> 03:20:56,220
I'm going on a very extended trip
to London, and I'm leaving today.

2962
03:20:56,828 --> 03:20:58,489
And I'm taking Bonnie with me.

2963
03:20:58,563 --> 03:21:01,054
So you'll please
get her little duds packed right away.

2964
03:21:01,133 --> 03:21:03,658
You'll never take my child
out of this house.

2965
03:21:03,735 --> 03:21:05,600
She's my child, too, Scarlett.

2966
03:21:05,704 --> 03:21:07,262
I wouldn't leave her here...

2967
03:21:07,339 --> 03:21:10,536
with a mother who hasn't the decency
to consider her own reputation.

2968
03:21:10,609 --> 03:21:12,099
You're a fine one to talk.

2969
03:21:12,177 --> 03:21:14,077
You think I'll let her out of this house...

2970
03:21:14,146 --> 03:21:17,741
when you'll probably have her around
with people like that Belle?

2971
03:21:17,816 --> 03:21:20,182
If you were a man
I'd break your neck for that.

2972
03:21:20,452 --> 03:21:22,750
As it is, I'll thank you
to shut your stupid mouth.

2973
03:21:22,821 --> 03:21:25,790
As for you, giving yourself pious airs
about your motherhood...

2974
03:21:25,857 --> 03:21:27,791
Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.

2975
03:21:27,859 --> 03:21:31,090
Have her things packed and ready
for me in an hour, or I warn you...

2976
03:21:31,163 --> 03:21:35,065
I've always thought a good lashing with a
buggy whip would benefit you immensely.

2977
03:21:40,472 --> 03:21:42,064
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.

2978
03:21:42,707 --> 03:21:43,799
Hello, Uncle Rhett.

2979
03:21:43,875 --> 03:21:45,342
Hello, hello, Beau.

2980
03:21:45,410 --> 03:21:46,968
Daddy, Daddy.

2981
03:21:47,145 --> 03:21:50,603
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.

2982
03:21:50,682 --> 03:21:54,209
Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little Bonnie in.

2983
03:21:54,386 --> 03:21:56,684
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.

2984
03:21:59,724 --> 03:22:02,818
I'm going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland.

2985
03:22:03,862 --> 03:22:05,159
Where? Where?

2986
03:22:05,564 --> 03:22:09,159
I'm going to show you the Tower
of London, where the little princes were...

2987
03:22:09,467 --> 03:22:11,128
and London Bridge.

2988
03:22:11,469 --> 03:22:12,902
London Bridge!

2989
03:22:13,004 --> 03:22:14,801
Will it be falling down?

2990
03:22:16,208 --> 03:22:18,472
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.

2991
03:22:21,112 --> 03:22:23,239
Daddy, dark!

2992
03:22:24,616 --> 03:22:26,106
Dark!

2993
03:22:26,284 --> 03:22:28,275
Daddy! Dark!

2994
03:22:29,354 --> 03:22:32,084
It's all right.
Who put out that light? Nurse!

2995
03:22:32,157 --> 03:22:33,590
Daddy, dark!

2996
03:22:34,893 --> 03:22:35,985
Daddy, dark!

2997
03:22:36,061 --> 03:22:37,722
There. Yes, yes.

2998
03:22:38,296 --> 03:22:40,196
What's the matter with my Bonnie?

2999
03:22:40,265 --> 03:22:41,562
A bear.

3000
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,264
Oh, a bear? A big bear?

3001
03:22:44,736 --> 03:22:47,637
Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.

3002
03:22:47,739 --> 03:22:51,038
Well, I'll stay here and shoot him
if he comes back.

3003
03:23:06,258 --> 03:23:08,226
Good evening, Mr. Butler.

3004
03:23:11,096 --> 03:23:13,690
Haven't I told you never to leave her alone
in the dark?

3005
03:23:13,765 --> 03:23:17,861
If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often
afraid of the dark, but they get over it.

3006
03:23:17,936 --> 03:23:19,801
Just let her scream for a night or two.

3007
03:23:19,871 --> 03:23:23,602
Let her scream! Either you're a fool or
the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!

3008
03:23:23,675 --> 03:23:26,439
Of course, if you want her
to grow up nervous and cowardly.

3009
03:23:26,511 --> 03:23:27,569
Cowardly!

3010
03:23:27,646 --> 03:23:31,013
There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.
You're discharged!

3011
03:23:31,917 --> 03:23:33,077
As you say, sir.

3012
03:23:50,101 --> 03:23:51,591
Where is Mother?

3013
03:23:58,143 --> 03:24:00,270
Aren't you happy here in London with me?

3014
03:24:00,946 --> 03:24:03,437
I want to go home.

3015
03:24:15,627 --> 03:24:16,992
Miss Bonnie.

3016
03:24:17,295 --> 03:24:19,229
And Capt. Butler.

3017
03:24:19,497 --> 03:24:21,522
- Miss Scarlett.
- Hello, Mammy.

3018
03:24:21,599 --> 03:24:22,827
Honey child.

3019
03:24:24,235 --> 03:24:27,033
Miss Scarlett! They's back.
They's back, Miss Scarlett.

3020
03:24:27,205 --> 03:24:28,399
Bonnie.

3021
03:24:29,341 --> 03:24:31,241
Bonnie. Bonnie, baby.

3022
03:24:31,576 --> 03:24:32,873
Darling baby.

3023
03:24:32,944 --> 03:24:34,343
Are you glad to be home?

3024
03:24:34,412 --> 03:24:35,970
Daddy gave me a kitten.

3025
03:24:36,047 --> 03:24:39,312
- What a lovely kitten.
- London's a horrid place.

3026
03:24:39,851 --> 03:24:42,115
- Oh, my darling.
- Where's my pony?

3027
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:45,517
- I want to go out and see my pony.
- You go out and see your pony.

3028
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:56,558
Where's my pony?

3029
03:24:57,669 --> 03:24:59,398
I wanna go out and see my pony.

3030
03:25:00,138 --> 03:25:01,765
You run along with Mammy.

3031
03:25:01,840 --> 03:25:03,432
- Come on, honey child.
- Go with Mammy.

3032
03:25:03,508 --> 03:25:05,499
Mammy sure has missed you, honey.

3033
03:25:07,679 --> 03:25:09,112
Mrs. Butler, I believe.

3034
03:25:10,148 --> 03:25:11,638
Mammy said you'd come back.

3035
03:25:13,118 --> 03:25:14,608
But only to bring Bonnie.

3036
03:25:14,686 --> 03:25:18,087
Apparently any mother, even a bad one,
is better for a child than none.

3037
03:25:18,890 --> 03:25:20,653
You mean you're going away again?

3038
03:25:21,059 --> 03:25:22,617
What perception, Mrs. Butler.

3039
03:25:22,994 --> 03:25:24,086
Right away.

3040
03:25:24,229 --> 03:25:26,561
In fact, I left my bags at the station.

3041
03:25:28,400 --> 03:25:31,597
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?

3042
03:25:31,669 --> 03:25:34,433
Or can this wanness mean
you've been missing me?

3043
03:25:35,073 --> 03:25:36,631
If I'm pale, it's your fault.

3044
03:25:36,708 --> 03:25:39,734
Not because I've been missing you,
but because...

3045
03:25:43,448 --> 03:25:45,382
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.

3046
03:25:46,184 --> 03:25:48,448
It's because I'm going to have a baby.

3047
03:25:54,492 --> 03:25:55,516
Indeed?

3048
03:25:55,994 --> 03:25:57,757
And who's the happy father?

3049
03:25:58,563 --> 03:26:00,053
You know it's yours.

3050
03:26:00,131 --> 03:26:01,928
I don't want it any more than you do.

3051
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,161
No woman would want the child
of a cad like you.

3052
03:26:04,235 --> 03:26:06,931
I wish it were anybody's child but yours.

3053
03:26:08,907 --> 03:26:11,239
Well, cheer up.
Maybe you'll have an accident.

3054
03:26:25,857 --> 03:26:27,381
Is she better?

3055
03:26:31,596 --> 03:26:32,995
Has she asked for me?

3056
03:26:33,064 --> 03:26:35,157
Don't you understand? She's delirious.

3057
03:26:36,701 --> 03:26:38,498
Rhett.

3058
03:26:39,771 --> 03:26:41,398
I want Rhett.

3059
03:26:45,677 --> 03:26:49,078
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?

3060
03:26:49,147 --> 03:26:50,580
It's no use.

3061
03:26:51,850 --> 03:26:53,010
It's no use.

3062
03:27:15,173 --> 03:27:16,731
Dr. Meade's left.

3063
03:27:17,842 --> 03:27:19,173
Scarlett's dead!

3064
03:27:19,244 --> 03:27:20,973
Oh, no, she's much better.

3065
03:27:21,546 --> 03:27:22,877
Really, she is.

3066
03:27:39,597 --> 03:27:42,691
There, there, Capt. Butler.
You're beside yourself.

3067
03:27:42,767 --> 03:27:44,997
She'll very soon be well again,
I promise you.

3068
03:27:45,069 --> 03:27:48,038
No, you don't understand.
She never wanted this baby.

3069
03:27:48,239 --> 03:27:50,730
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby!

3070
03:27:50,808 --> 03:27:53,675
Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.
Not my children.

3071
03:27:54,078 --> 03:27:56,205
She told me she didn't want
any more children...

3072
03:27:56,281 --> 03:27:58,340
and I wanted to hurt her
because she'd hurt me.

3073
03:27:58,416 --> 03:27:59,713
I wanted to and I did.

3074
03:27:59,784 --> 03:28:02,776
Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fit.

3075
03:28:02,854 --> 03:28:05,823
I didn't know about this baby
until the other day when she fell.

3076
03:28:05,890 --> 03:28:08,882
If I'd known, I'd have come home
whether she wanted me or not!

3077
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:10,689
Well, of course you would.

3078
03:28:10,762 --> 03:28:14,562
And then when she told me,
there on the steps, what did I do?

3079
03:28:14,632 --> 03:28:17,430
What did I say? I laughed and I said...

3080
03:28:17,502 --> 03:28:20,665
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.

3081
03:28:20,805 --> 03:28:23,638
Oh, but I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.

3082
03:28:23,708 --> 03:28:27,303
She's never cared for me. I thought
I could make her care, but I couldn't.

3083
03:28:29,180 --> 03:28:30,841
You're so wrong.

3084
03:28:30,915 --> 03:28:34,248
Scarlett loves you a great deal,
much more than she knows.

3085
03:28:35,820 --> 03:28:37,788
If that were only true I could wait forever.

3086
03:28:37,855 --> 03:28:40,153
If she'd only forgive me,
forget this ever happened.

3087
03:28:40,225 --> 03:28:41,453
She will.

3088
03:28:41,593 --> 03:28:43,185
You must be patient.

3089
03:28:45,597 --> 03:28:47,292
Oh, no, it's not possible.

3090
03:28:47,365 --> 03:28:50,857
You don't understand.
If you only knew who she really loved...

3091
03:28:51,502 --> 03:28:53,436
you wouldn't believe it.

3092
03:28:56,374 --> 03:28:58,968
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.

3093
03:28:59,043 --> 03:29:01,876
No, Capt. Butler, I wouldn't believe it.

3094
03:29:03,615 --> 03:29:07,984
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well
and there can be other babies.

3095
03:29:08,286 --> 03:29:12,017
No, she couldn't even if she wanted to,
after what she's been through.

3096
03:29:12,090 --> 03:29:14,058
But of course she could.

3097
03:29:14,592 --> 03:29:15,991
I'm going to.

3098
03:29:18,930 --> 03:29:22,161
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.

3099
03:29:22,634 --> 03:29:25,694
Children are life-renewing itself,
Capt. Butler...

3100
03:29:25,770 --> 03:29:29,262
and when life does that,
danger seems very unimportant.

3101
03:29:32,377 --> 03:29:35,471
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.

3102
03:29:36,247 --> 03:29:39,182
I pray God things go well with you,
Miss Melly.

3103
03:29:39,350 --> 03:29:43,184
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.

3104
03:29:44,322 --> 03:29:46,313
From my heart, I thank you.

3105
03:29:53,064 --> 03:29:56,363
Miss Scarlett's feeling
a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.

3106
03:29:56,434 --> 03:29:57,901
Thank you, Mammy.

3107
03:30:05,109 --> 03:30:07,373
I've come to ask your forgiveness...

3108
03:30:07,445 --> 03:30:10,346
in the hope that we can give
our life together another chance.

3109
03:30:10,415 --> 03:30:12,007
Our life together?

3110
03:30:12,083 --> 03:30:14,483
When did we ever have a life together?

3111
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:17,181
Yes, you're right.

3112
03:30:17,655 --> 03:30:21,113
But I'm sure if we could only try again,
we could be happy.

3113
03:30:21,826 --> 03:30:24,556
What is there to make us happy now?

3114
03:30:25,029 --> 03:30:27,190
Well, there's Bonnie and...

3115
03:30:28,232 --> 03:30:30,223
and I love you, Scarlett.

3116
03:30:30,535 --> 03:30:32,298
When did you discover that?

3117
03:30:32,370 --> 03:30:36,306
I've always loved you, but you've never
given me a chance to show it.

3118
03:30:37,442 --> 03:30:39,876
Well, and just what do you want me to do?

3119
03:30:41,713 --> 03:30:44,341
To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.

3120
03:30:44,716 --> 03:30:45,876
We'll go away.

3121
03:30:45,950 --> 03:30:48,180
We'll take Bonnie
and have another honeymoon.

3122
03:30:48,252 --> 03:30:50,982
Give up the mill? Why?
It's making more money than ever.

3123
03:30:51,055 --> 03:30:52,989
Yes, I know, but we don't need it.

3124
03:30:53,057 --> 03:30:55,890
Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.

3125
03:30:55,960 --> 03:30:57,894
Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.

3126
03:30:57,962 --> 03:31:00,795
Always Melanie! If you'd think
a little more about me...

3127
03:31:00,865 --> 03:31:02,196
I am thinking of you...

3128
03:31:03,267 --> 03:31:05,064
and I'm thinking that...

3129
03:31:05,269 --> 03:31:08,500
well, maybe it's the mill
that's taking you away from me...

3130
03:31:08,806 --> 03:31:10,034
and from Bonnie.

3131
03:31:10,108 --> 03:31:13,100
I know what you're thinking.
Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.

3132
03:31:13,177 --> 03:31:14,872
You're the one taking her away from me.

3133
03:31:14,946 --> 03:31:16,072
But she loves you.

3134
03:31:16,147 --> 03:31:18,581
You've done everything
to make her love you, not me.

3135
03:31:18,649 --> 03:31:19,911
She's so spoiled now that...

3136
03:31:19,984 --> 03:31:21,451
Mommy! Daddy!

3137
03:31:21,719 --> 03:31:22,947
Watch me!

3138
03:31:23,221 --> 03:31:25,052
We're watching, darling.

3139
03:31:25,123 --> 03:31:27,091
You're mighty pretty, precious.

3140
03:31:27,158 --> 03:31:28,420
So are you.

3141
03:31:28,826 --> 03:31:31,454
I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.

3142
03:31:32,196 --> 03:31:34,892
I don't think you ought to do
much jumping yet, Bonnie.

3143
03:31:34,966 --> 03:31:37,298
Remember, you've just learned
to ride sidesaddle.

3144
03:31:37,368 --> 03:31:38,699
I will so jump!

3145
03:31:38,803 --> 03:31:41,636
I can jump better than ever
'cause I've grown...

3146
03:31:41,773 --> 03:31:43,365
and I've moved the bar higher.

3147
03:31:43,441 --> 03:31:45,238
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

3148
03:31:45,309 --> 03:31:49,405
No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,
don't cry and blame me.

3149
03:31:50,381 --> 03:31:51,871
Rhett, stop her!

3150
03:31:53,851 --> 03:31:54,977
Bonnie!

3151
03:31:55,787 --> 03:31:56,776
Bonnie!

3152
03:31:58,156 --> 03:31:59,646
Just like Pa.

3153
03:32:03,127 --> 03:32:04,617
Just like Pa!

3154
03:32:05,863 --> 03:32:06,955
Bonnie!

3155
03:32:15,540 --> 03:32:16,666
Bonnie!

3156
03:32:17,308 --> 03:32:18,468
Bonnie!

3157
03:32:35,126 --> 03:32:38,095
Lordsy, Miss Melly.
I sure is glad you've come.

3158
03:32:40,731 --> 03:32:43,632
This house won't seem
the same without Bonnie.

3159
03:32:43,701 --> 03:32:45,566
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?

3160
03:32:45,636 --> 03:32:48,469
Miss Melly, this here done
broke her heart...

3161
03:32:49,207 --> 03:32:51,801
but I didn't fetch you here
on Miss Scarlett's account.

3162
03:32:51,876 --> 03:32:56,074
What that child got to stand,
the good Lord give her strength to stand.

3163
03:32:57,648 --> 03:33:00,014
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

3164
03:33:03,488 --> 03:33:05,979
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.

3165
03:33:06,090 --> 03:33:07,523
No, Mammy, no.

3166
03:33:07,992 --> 03:33:11,928
I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.

3167
03:33:12,730 --> 03:33:15,130
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...

3168
03:33:15,199 --> 03:33:18,896
Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there
and shoot that poor pony...

3169
03:33:19,871 --> 03:33:22,897
and for a minute I think
he going to shoot hisself.

3170
03:33:22,974 --> 03:33:24,737
Oh, poor Capt. Butler.

3171
03:33:24,809 --> 03:33:29,542
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him
a murderer for teaching that child to jump.

3172
03:33:30,047 --> 03:33:32,811
She say, "You give me my baby
what you kill. "

3173
03:33:32,884 --> 03:33:36,615
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.

3174
03:33:37,154 --> 03:33:41,181
It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.

3175
03:33:41,692 --> 03:33:44,183
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

3176
03:33:46,964 --> 03:33:48,727
And then that night...

3177
03:33:49,767 --> 03:33:53,567
Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...

3178
03:33:54,205 --> 03:33:55,866
and he wouldn't even open the door...

3179
03:33:55,940 --> 03:33:58,170
when Miss Scarlett beat on it
and hollered to him.

3180
03:33:58,242 --> 03:34:00,506
And that's the way it's been
for two whole days.

3181
03:34:00,611 --> 03:34:01,805
Oh, Mammy.

3182
03:34:02,914 --> 03:34:06,406
And then this evening, Miss Scarlett,
she shout through the door...

3183
03:34:06,484 --> 03:34:08,748
and she say the funeral set
for tomorrow morning...

3184
03:34:08,819 --> 03:34:11,845
and he says, "You try that
and I kills you tomorrow.

3185
03:34:11,923 --> 03:34:14,892
"Do you think I's going to put my child...

3186
03:34:14,959 --> 03:34:17,223
"in the dark when she's so scared of it?"

3187
03:34:17,295 --> 03:34:19,991
Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.

3188
03:34:20,064 --> 03:34:23,727
Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.
He ain't going to let us bury that child.

3189
03:34:23,801 --> 03:34:25,792
You gotta help us, Miss Melly.

3190
03:34:25,970 --> 03:34:27,597
Oh, but I can't intrude.

3191
03:34:27,672 --> 03:34:29,936
If you can't help us, who can?

3192
03:34:30,007 --> 03:34:33,033
Mr. Rhett always set great store
by your opinion.

3193
03:34:35,079 --> 03:34:36,842
Please, Miss Melly.

3194
03:34:38,416 --> 03:34:40,316
I'll do what I can, Mammy.

3195
03:34:46,991 --> 03:34:49,425
Get away from that door,
and leave us alone.

3196
03:34:49,493 --> 03:34:51,518
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Capt. Butler.

3197
03:34:51,596 --> 03:34:53,188
Please let me in.

3198
03:34:53,264 --> 03:34:55,255
I've come to see Bonnie.

3199
03:35:16,220 --> 03:35:17,585
Oh, Lord...

3200
03:35:18,022 --> 03:35:21,048
please help Mr. Rhett
in this hour of his grief.

3201
03:35:33,004 --> 03:35:36,235
I want you to go and make
a good deal of strong coffee...

3202
03:35:36,307 --> 03:35:39,902
and bring it up to Capt. Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.

3203
03:35:40,378 --> 03:35:41,606
But...

3204
03:35:41,779 --> 03:35:45,078
Capt. Butler is quite willing
for the funeral to take place...

3205
03:35:45,149 --> 03:35:46,343
tomorrow morning.

3206
03:35:46,417 --> 03:35:51,150
Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights
on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.

3207
03:35:52,456 --> 03:35:54,083
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

3208
03:35:54,692 --> 03:35:55,818
Miss Melly!

3209
03:35:55,893 --> 03:35:57,554
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

3210
03:35:59,296 --> 03:36:01,264
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...

3211
03:36:01,966 --> 03:36:03,228
and try...

3212
03:36:03,300 --> 03:36:04,961
try to get me home.

3213
03:36:06,671 --> 03:36:08,229
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

3214
03:36:16,080 --> 03:36:18,480
Where is my mother going away to?

3215
03:36:18,649 --> 03:36:21,550
And why can't I go along, please?

3216
03:36:22,086 --> 03:36:25,419
We can't always go along, Beau,
much as we may want to.

3217
03:36:27,124 --> 03:36:29,319
You're going back to bed now.

3218
03:36:29,960 --> 03:36:33,157
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!

3219
03:36:33,898 --> 03:36:35,297
She hasn't your strength.

3220
03:36:35,366 --> 03:36:38,665
She's never had any strength.
She's never had anything but heart.

3221
03:36:39,170 --> 03:36:40,603
You knew that, too.

3222
03:36:40,671 --> 03:36:43,504
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.

3223
03:36:44,208 --> 03:36:46,233
It isn't really morning yet.

3224
03:36:52,483 --> 03:36:54,144
You may come in now, Scarlett.

3225
03:36:54,218 --> 03:36:55,776
Please let me see her!

3226
03:36:55,853 --> 03:36:59,482
I've been waiting here two whole days
and I've got to tell her...

3227
03:36:59,824 --> 03:37:01,451
that I was wrong about something.

3228
03:37:01,525 --> 03:37:04,551
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.

3229
03:37:08,132 --> 03:37:09,827
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.

3230
03:37:09,900 --> 03:37:12,698
I won't have you easing your conscience
telling her things...

3231
03:37:12,770 --> 03:37:15,136
that make no difference now.
You understand?

3232
03:37:30,087 --> 03:37:31,418
It's me, Melly.

3233
03:37:33,157 --> 03:37:34,556
Promise me?

3234
03:37:35,226 --> 03:37:36,215
Anything.

3235
03:37:37,495 --> 03:37:39,258
Look after my little son.

3236
03:37:40,664 --> 03:37:42,928
I gave him to you once before.

3237
03:37:44,034 --> 03:37:45,501
Remember?

3238
03:37:46,370 --> 03:37:47,997
The day he was born.

3239
03:37:48,372 --> 03:37:52,001
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.

3240
03:37:52,443 --> 03:37:53,740
Promise me...

3241
03:37:54,345 --> 03:37:55,437
college...

3242
03:37:55,513 --> 03:37:59,711
Yes, and Europe, and a pony,
whatever he wants. But...

3243
03:38:00,885 --> 03:38:02,409
Melly, do try...

3244
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:03,782
Ashley...

3245
03:38:05,556 --> 03:38:07,114
Ashley and you.

3246
03:38:09,360 --> 03:38:12,124
What about Ashley, Melly?

3247
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:15,826
Look after him for me.

3248
03:38:16,600 --> 03:38:18,192
Just as you...

3249
03:38:19,303 --> 03:38:22,397
looked after me for him.

3250
03:38:24,809 --> 03:38:26,367
I will, Melly.

3251
03:38:27,511 --> 03:38:29,206
Look after him...

3252
03:38:29,914 --> 03:38:32,747
but never let him know.

3253
03:38:42,893 --> 03:38:44,292
Good night.

3254
03:38:45,863 --> 03:38:47,160
Promise?

3255
03:38:48,532 --> 03:38:50,159
What else, Melly?

3256
03:38:51,001 --> 03:38:52,764
Capt. Butler...

3257
03:38:54,171 --> 03:38:55,638
be kind to him.

3258
03:38:56,340 --> 03:38:57,364
Rhett?

3259
03:38:58,209 --> 03:38:59,836
He loves you so.

3260
03:39:03,948 --> 03:39:05,279
Yes, Melly.

3261
03:39:08,285 --> 03:39:09,616
Goodbye.

3262
03:39:10,921 --> 03:39:12,183
Goodbye.

3263
03:39:28,239 --> 03:39:30,298
You ladies may come in now.

3264
03:39:35,713 --> 03:39:37,044
Ashley.

3265
03:39:37,915 --> 03:39:40,509
I don't know where the mate to this is.

3266
03:39:41,485 --> 03:39:43,578
She must have put it away.

3267
03:39:44,255 --> 03:39:45,654
Oh, stop it.

3268
03:39:46,223 --> 03:39:47,315
Hold me.

3269
03:39:47,725 --> 03:39:49,317
I'm so frightened.

3270
03:39:51,161 --> 03:39:52,788
I'm so frightened.

3271
03:39:57,735 --> 03:40:01,535
Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her, I can't.

3272
03:40:02,907 --> 03:40:04,807
Everything I ever had...

3273
03:40:04,875 --> 03:40:06,536
is going with her.

3274
03:40:07,578 --> 03:40:08,840
Oh, Ashley.

3275
03:40:10,347 --> 03:40:12,645
You really love her, don't you?

3276
03:40:13,450 --> 03:40:18,149
She's the only dream I ever had
that didn't die in the face of reality.

3277
03:40:18,956 --> 03:40:22,323
Dreams! Always dreams with you,
never common sense.

3278
03:40:22,393 --> 03:40:25,624
Oh, Scarlett!
If you knew what I've gone through!

3279
03:40:26,330 --> 03:40:30,426
Ashley, you should have told me years ago
that you loved her and not me...

3280
03:40:30,501 --> 03:40:33,436
and not left me dangling
with your talk of honor.

3281
03:40:33,837 --> 03:40:37,034
But you had to wait till now,
now when Melly's dying...

3282
03:40:37,675 --> 03:40:41,042
to show me that I could never mean
any more to you than...

3283
03:40:41,111 --> 03:40:43,807
than this Watling woman does to Rhett.

3284
03:40:45,816 --> 03:40:48,216
And I've loved something that...

3285
03:40:48,319 --> 03:40:50,378
that doesn't really exist.

3286
03:40:52,890 --> 03:40:54,118
Somehow...

3287
03:40:55,459 --> 03:40:56,824
I don't care.

3288
03:40:58,362 --> 03:41:00,057
Somehow it doesn't matter.

3289
03:41:02,199 --> 03:41:04,633
It doesn't matter one bit.

3290
03:41:08,939 --> 03:41:10,804
Ashley, forgive me.

3291
03:41:11,175 --> 03:41:14,076
Don't cry.
She mustn't see you've been crying.

3292
03:41:14,611 --> 03:41:15,873
Ashley!

3293
03:41:19,283 --> 03:41:20,580
Melly!

3294
03:41:22,453 --> 03:41:23,784
Melly!

3295
03:41:28,225 --> 03:41:30,216
Rhett, Rhett!

3296
03:41:33,664 --> 03:41:35,461
Rhett, where are you?

3297
03:41:39,536 --> 03:41:40,969
Rhett, wait for me.

3298
03:41:46,043 --> 03:41:47,510
Rhett, wait for me!

3299
03:42:14,838 --> 03:42:15,998
Rhett.

3300
03:42:19,176 --> 03:42:20,268
Come in.

3301
03:42:28,285 --> 03:42:29,547
Rhett...

3302
03:42:30,020 --> 03:42:31,578
Melanie, she's...

3303
03:42:35,459 --> 03:42:36,619
Well, God rest her.

3304
03:42:37,394 --> 03:42:40,522
She was the only completely kind person
I ever knew.

3305
03:42:41,265 --> 03:42:42,596
A great lady.

3306
03:42:43,033 --> 03:42:44,694
A very great lady.

3307
03:42:47,071 --> 03:42:50,472
So she's dead.
That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?

3308
03:42:51,308 --> 03:42:55,039
Oh, how can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really!

3309
03:42:56,513 --> 03:42:58,174
No, I don't know that I do.

3310
03:42:58,248 --> 03:43:01,775
But at least it's to your credit
that you could appreciate her at the end.

3311
03:43:01,852 --> 03:43:05,481
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.

3312
03:43:06,290 --> 03:43:08,121
Why, her last words were about you.

3313
03:43:09,460 --> 03:43:10,859
What did she say?

3314
03:43:10,928 --> 03:43:12,088
She said:

3315
03:43:12,362 --> 03:43:15,354
"Be kind to Capt. Butler. He loves you so. "

3316
03:43:21,238 --> 03:43:22,398
Did she say anything else?

3317
03:43:22,473 --> 03:43:23,963
She said...

3318
03:43:24,408 --> 03:43:27,070
She asked me to look after Ashley, too.

3319
03:43:29,313 --> 03:43:32,749
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?

3320
03:43:34,785 --> 03:43:36,412
What do you mean?

3321
03:43:38,722 --> 03:43:40,485
What are you doing?

3322
03:43:40,557 --> 03:43:42,388
I'm leaving you, my dear.

3323
03:43:42,459 --> 03:43:46,327
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

3324
03:43:49,399 --> 03:43:50,957
Oh, no!

3325
03:43:51,702 --> 03:43:53,932
No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!

3326
03:43:54,004 --> 03:43:57,132
I don't want a divorce.
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...

3327
03:43:57,274 --> 03:43:59,834
when I knew I loved you,
I ran home to tell you.

3328
03:43:59,910 --> 03:44:01,810
Oh, darling, darling...

3329
03:44:01,979 --> 03:44:03,571
Please don't go on with this.

3330
03:44:03,647 --> 03:44:07,276
Leave us some dignity to remember
out of our marriage. Spare us this last.

3331
03:44:07,351 --> 03:44:08,477
This last?

3332
03:44:08,852 --> 03:44:10,547
Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.

3333
03:44:10,621 --> 03:44:14,489
I must have loved you for years, only I was
such a stupid fool I didn't know it.

3334
03:44:14,558 --> 03:44:16,890
Please believe me. You must care.

3335
03:44:17,427 --> 03:44:19,122
Melly said you did.

3336
03:44:19,329 --> 03:44:21,854
I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?

3337
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:25,161
I never really loved Ashley.

3338
03:44:25,802 --> 03:44:29,397
You certainly gave a good imitation of it,
up till this morning.

3339
03:44:30,340 --> 03:44:32,570
No, Scarlett. I tried everything.

3340
03:44:32,943 --> 03:44:35,969
If you'd only met me halfway,
even when I came back from London.

3341
03:44:36,046 --> 03:44:39,709
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

3342
03:44:39,816 --> 03:44:43,047
And then, when you were sick
and it was all my fault...

3343
03:44:43,120 --> 03:44:45,953
I hoped against hope
that you'd call for me, but you didn't.

3344
03:44:46,023 --> 03:44:50,323
I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,
but I didn't think you wanted me.

3345
03:44:51,828 --> 03:44:55,855
It seems we've been at cross-purposes,
doesn't it? But it's no use now.

3346
03:44:56,867 --> 03:45:00,496
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.

3347
03:45:00,571 --> 03:45:02,300
I liked to think that Bonnie was you.

3348
03:45:02,372 --> 03:45:06,172
A little girl again, before the war
and poverty had done things to you.

3349
03:45:06,877 --> 03:45:11,405
She was so like you, and I could pet her
and spoil her as I wanted to spoil you.

3350
03:45:13,450 --> 03:45:15,816
But when she went, she took everything.

3351
03:45:15,886 --> 03:45:17,046
Oh, Rhett!

3352
03:45:17,521 --> 03:45:19,352
Rhett, please don't say that.

3353
03:45:19,423 --> 03:45:22,586
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.

3354
03:45:24,361 --> 03:45:26,761
My darling, you're such a child.

3355
03:45:26,930 --> 03:45:30,957
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.

3356
03:45:33,637 --> 03:45:35,935
Here, take my handkerchief.

3357
03:45:36,206 --> 03:45:40,199
Never at any crisis of your life
have I known you to have a handkerchief.

3358
03:45:44,581 --> 03:45:47,209
Rhett, where are you going?

3359
03:45:47,284 --> 03:45:49,616
I'm going to Charleston.
Back where I belong.

3360
03:45:49,686 --> 03:45:52,052
Please. Please take me with you.

3361
03:45:52,689 --> 03:45:55,214
No. I'm through with everything here.

3362
03:45:56,026 --> 03:45:57,550
I want peace.

3363
03:45:57,694 --> 03:46:02,028
I want to see if somewhere there isn't
something left in life of charm and grace.

3364
03:46:02,766 --> 03:46:06,930
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- No. I only know that I love you.

3365
03:46:07,004 --> 03:46:08,631
That's your misfortune.

3366
03:46:08,705 --> 03:46:09,967
Oh, Rhett.

3367
03:46:15,212 --> 03:46:16,304
Rhett!

3368
03:46:22,586 --> 03:46:23,678
Rhett!

3369
03:46:23,787 --> 03:46:26,756
If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?

3370
03:46:28,025 --> 03:46:30,687
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

3371
03:46:44,241 --> 03:46:46,675
Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!

3372
03:46:47,544 --> 03:46:50,138
There must be some way
to bring him back.

3373
03:46:52,883 --> 03:46:56,080
I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do!

3374
03:46:57,854 --> 03:47:00,049
I'll think about it tomorrow.

3375
03:47:14,338 --> 03:47:16,397
But I must think about it.

3376
03:47:17,207 --> 03:47:18,970
I must think about it.

3377
03:47:20,043 --> 03:47:21,704
What is there to do?

3378
03:47:22,879 --> 03:47:24,904
What is there that matters?

3379
03:47:28,085 --> 03:47:30,280
<i>Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...</i>

3380
03:47:30,354 --> 03:47:34,450
<i>that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?
Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>

3381
03:47:34,825 --> 03:47:36,918
<i>It's the only thing that lasts.</i>

3382
03:47:37,160 --> 03:47:40,823
<i>Something you love better than me,
though you may not know it. Tara.</i>

3383
03:47:41,031 --> 03:47:44,660
<i>It's this from which you get your strength.
The red earth of Tara.</i>

3384
03:47:44,735 --> 03:47:48,569
<i>Why, land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.</i>

3385
03:47:48,638 --> 03:47:51,835
<i>Something you love better than me,
though you may not know it. Tara.</i>

3386
03:47:51,908 --> 03:47:54,672
<i>From which you get your strength.
The red earth of Tara.</i>

3387
03:47:54,745 --> 03:47:56,474
<i>Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>

3388
03:47:56,546 --> 03:47:57,979
<i>Something you love better than me.</i>

3389
03:47:58,048 --> 03:47:59,276
<i>The red earth of Tara.</i>

3390
03:47:59,349 --> 03:48:00,976
<i>- Tara!
- Tara!</i>

3391
03:48:04,588 --> 03:48:05,748
Tara!

3392
03:48:06,890 --> 03:48:08,050
Home!

3393
03:48:09,259 --> 03:48:10,783
I'll go home!

3394
03:48:11,795 --> 03:48:14,423
And I'll think of some way to get him back.

3395
03:48:15,065 --> 03:48:16,430
After all...

3396
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:19,594
tomorrow is another day.
