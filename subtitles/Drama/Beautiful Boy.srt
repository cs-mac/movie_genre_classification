1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,510
BEAUTIFUL BOY (2010)

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,760
- (wind howling)
- Man: Who's that?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Who's that jumping
on my camera?

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,320
- Who's that?
- (boy chattering)

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,720
- Peek a boo, I see you.
- Man: Hello.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,720
- Man: Oh no, it was switched off.
- No. Really?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,320
Man:
I don't know.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,280
How can you see me through that?

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,800
- Man: How?
- Oh, can I see?

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,080
- Can you see him?
- Boy: Wait.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,880
- Can you see us?
- Boy: Wait. No.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
Boy's voice: "As the boy and girl
ran out from their station wagon,

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,200
the beach was happy.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,560
It was happy to have
their small footprints upon it.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,400
It was happy to have holes dug
with plastic shovels.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,280
It was even happy
to have paper wrappers

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,600
blowing about after they'd gone.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,280
But the beach knew
that there would no longer

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,240
be this to look forward to.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,800
No more careless play,

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,040
only lonely snowfalls to mark
the beginnings of an endless winter."

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
Woman:
Whoa! Nice kick.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,760
Boy's voice: "The beach
loved the boy and the girl,

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,160
though it had no way
of telling them.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
And it knew that this was
their last time together.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,760
Things would be different
from now on.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,440
They didn't know if they
would be better or worse,

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,800
but for certain
things would change."

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,520
(bell rings)

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,880
(tapping)

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,840
Man:
Hey, chief. Bill.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,600
We're doing the thing now...
Carl's baby shower.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,120
Right. Right.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
(over phone)
Hey, it's Sam.

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,040
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
- (beeps)
- Woman: Hi.

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
I haven't heard
from you for a while,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,120
so I'm just calling
to see how things are.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm sure you're crammed
with exams.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Um, okay, call me
when you get a chance.

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,560
It's Mom, by the way.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
- Oh, hi. Cooper?
- Kate, hi. Cooper Stearns.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,480
Hi. Pleased to meet you.
How are you?

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,800
Good.
Can I get you anything?

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,880
- A coffee?
- No no, thanks. I'm good.

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,640
I can't do caffeine in the afternoon
or I won't be able to sleep all night.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Oh God, I live on the stuff.
It's how I got this thing finished.

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Oh my goodness.
Congratulations!

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
Well, don't congratulate me
until you've read it.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,520
Well, I'm just the spellchecker,
but I'm sure it's wonderful.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
It's a big deal getting published.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,360
It's not Simon & Schuster,
but my mom's real proud.

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,320
I bet she is.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,640
Bill: So her dad put all the different
essential fluids in the trunk

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
in plastic soda bottles...

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,320
coolant in a Coke bottle,
oil in Mountain Dew

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,680
and wiper fluid in Sprite...
you know, like that.

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,320
- Don't tell me she drank it.
- No no, but one day she's...

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,040
she's driving around
and the car overheats.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
So, you know,
she opens the hood,

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,800
and she looks at it
like a seasoned mechanic,

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,760
and she says, "I think
it's a little low on Dr. Pepper."

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
(laughter)

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,640
(over phone)
Hey, it's Sam.

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,880
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,240
- (beeps)
- Kate: Hi, hon. It's Mom again.

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,720
Let's go somewhere this summer...
a little family vacay.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
It's been forever since we did it.

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,720
Anyway, love you.

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,840
Call me later. Bye.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,320
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Hey.

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,000
- Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,240
- How's Nikki doing?
- She's in a funk.

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,400
- Trying to lose her freshman 15.
- Oh no.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,400
- How's Sammy?
- He's good.

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,560
- I just left him a message.
- Oh please.

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,320
I told Nikki if she doesn't
start taking my calls,

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,920
she's gonna have to pay
her own phone bill.

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Thank you.

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,760
Ooh, the steaks are beautiful,
by the way.

81
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,760
On sale... $3.99 a pound.

82
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Ah, it might rain tomorrow.

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,120
Kate:
What?

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,040
Bill:
It might rain.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,360
Kate: Hey, how's your steak?
Is it too well done?

86
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,280
No, it's good.

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,600
- Did Carl like the baby blanket?
- Uh, yeah yeah.

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,080
Good.

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,600
So I think I found a place.

90
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm gonna call about it tomorrow.

91
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,680
Wait, don't put that in there.
You need to rinse it cleaner.

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
Well, then what's the point?
We should just wash them all by hand.

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,600
It's the way things are done.

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
- I thought we decided to wait.
- Uh, I don't know.

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,120
I just thought maybe I should
put a deposit down.

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,360
That was the whole point
of the family vacation, right?

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
We're gonna spend
some time together

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,720
away from everything,
figure stuff out.

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
- I know, I know.
- Well, is that not the plan anymore?

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,120
- Let me know.
- No, I didn't say I was moving out.

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,400
I just... look, forget it.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,280
It just looked like
a good place, that's all.

103
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,040
No no no, if you don't want to go
on this vacation, I understand.

104
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
- Just say so.
- No, I didn't say that.

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,240
- Honestly, I can just...
- I did not say that.

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,760
- Okay, what did you say?
- L... nothing.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,880
I don't know.

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,640
I just think you're putting
a lot of pressure on one vacation.

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,040
Bill:
I'm going to bed.

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,760
Okay.

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,800
Thanks.
So what about Miami?

112
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,320
We're not really
the beach type, are we?

113
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah, anyway.

114
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,720
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
(phone rings)

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Ah!

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,320
- Hi, stranger.
- Hey.

118
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Where you been?

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,320
- You must be studying like crazy.
- Bill: Hello?

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,760
Kate: It's Sammy.
Hey, since I have you both

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,240
on the phone, can we please figure out
where we're going for vacation?

122
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,000
- I thought you said Miami.
- Kate: No.

123
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,640
I wanted us all to decide together.

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
Bill: Oh, I don't care.
You two pick.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,080
- Whatever's fine.
- Kate: Fine.

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,240
Fine, I'll book Miami.

127
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll book it tonight.

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,720
Bill: So how are you doing, Sam?
You got enough money?

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,680
Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,120
Car holding up?

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah. Car's good.

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,560
Good good.

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,640
Okay, well, I'm gonna
get some shut-eye.

134
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
Don't study too hard.

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,360
All right. Bye, Dad.

136
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,240
You sound a little tired.
Are you getting enough sleep?

137
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
No, not really,

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,400
but I'm gonna... I'm gonna
go to bed here in a minute.

139
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
I have an early class
in the morning, so...

140
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,600
Okay.

141
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,360
But listen, it'll get easier.
College is an adjustment.

142
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,640
At least you have
a lot of company.

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,680
All your friends are going through
the same thing, believe me.

144
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Hey, guess what.

145
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,400
I ran into Nikki's mom.
She said she gained a lot of weight.

146
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,240
Have you seen her lately?

147
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,480
Hon?

148
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,320
Did you know that snowflakes
always have six sides?

149
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,040
Uh, I thought they were all different.
Isn't that what they always say?

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,560
Yeah, but they always
have six sides.

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,360
It's, um, something to do
with the... the positive

152
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,120
and the negative charges
in a water molecule.

153
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't really understand it.

154
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
You know, even though
supposedly they're all different,

155
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,160
you know every single
one of them,

156
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,000
you can still count on all of them
having six sides.

157
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,760
Yeah.

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,520
You should think about studying
meteorology or chemistry

159
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,200
instead of English lit or something.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,600
It sounds like you like
that sort of stuff.

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,320
Yeah, maybe.

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Look, um, I gotta go.

163
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,240
Okay.

164
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,760
Study hard.

165
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,600
Bye, Mom.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,520
Bye, honey.

167
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,920
(phone beeps)

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Announcer on TV:
Today on "Inside and Out"...

169
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
Man on TV: I can teach you
how to eat all your favorite foods...

170
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,840
- all the foods...
- 'Night.

171
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Man on TV: A new way to speed up
your metabolism really dramatically

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,840
and you can reduce your waistline
every single week.

173
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,280
Woman on TV:
I'm eating chocolate,

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm eating pasta
with cream sauce,

175
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm eating pancakes
and I lost 55 lbs.

176
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,960
(ballad playing)

177
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,440
(door opens, closes)

178
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,400
#Forget I need to breathe #

179
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,000
#And I wish you belonged to me,
but it's too late... #

180
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,120
(sighs)

181
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
(quiet chatter)

182
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,640
(music continues)

183
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,080
Bonnie:
Kate! Kate!

184
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
Kate!

185
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,640
(phone clicks)

186
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
Newscaster: We're waiting to get
more details on the victims

187
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,640
as there has been a conflicting number
of fatalities reported so far...

188
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,600
mostly students, but at least
three faculty members

189
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,120
are among the 17 people
known dead.

190
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,840
We're still trying
to get information on...

191
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Newscaster #2: They are now saying
21 are confirmed dead.

192
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,560
Oh my God. Damn it, Nikki,
answer the phone.

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Newscaster #2: And we hope
this number doesn't get any larger.

194
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,600
(over phone)
Hey, it's Sam.

195
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,920
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

196
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,160
- (beeps)
- Hi... hi, Sammy, it's Mom.

197
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,880
Call me back as soon as you can,
all right? Love you.

198
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,160
It's okay, it's fine.
They're fine.

199
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,440
Bonnie:
I'm just gonna go home.

200
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,000
- Maybe she'll call the home phone.
- (keypad beeping)

201
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
(over phone)
Hey, it's Sam.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Newscaster #2:in the wake
of what is now being called

203
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,960
one of the deadliest
campus shootings in history.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
Newscaster #3:
...university dorm building

205
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
and later stepped
into morning classes

206
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,560
and opened fire
on students and faculty.

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
- It's still not known whether...
- (car turns off)

208
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,040
I can't get him on his cell,
but he never answers that thing, right?

209
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,640
Everyone's probably trying to call.
The towers are jammed.

210
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,760
We should just go
down there right now.

211
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,040
I got through to someone
in the dean's office.

212
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,160
The campus is completely
locked down.

213
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,720
- There's nothing we can do there.
- So we just wait?

214
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,440
- What do we...
- I'm sure it's fine.

215
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, God, he said he had
an early class this morning.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,040
He's fine. He's fine.
I promise. Okay?

217
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,880
- (phone rings)
- Wait. Sammy?

218
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,800
No, hi.
Have you heard anything?

219
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
I know. Me neither.

220
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,200
Newscaster #2: None of the victims'
names are being released at this time

221
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
out of respect for the families.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,840
However, students will be
holding a vigil

223
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,520
in honor of the deceased tonight.

224
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Armed police are still

225
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,800
- arriving at the scene.
- (doorbell rings)

226
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,160
Students are being told
to stay in lockdown in the dorms...

227
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,400
- Are you Mrs. Carroll?
- (sobs) Yes.

228
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

229
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,480
No. He's dead.

230
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,240
- He's dead.
- Yes, ma'am.

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,840
No, he's not.
No, he's not.

232
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,680
- Can we come in?
- I knew... I knew...

233
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,440
Ma'am, I'm afraid there's more.

234
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,360
At 7:15 this morning,

235
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,040
your son Sam walked
into a university building

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,960
- with two loaded weapons and...
- What?

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
...opened fire
on the students that...

238
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,440
- What?
- Ma'am, I know this is difficult,

239
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,160
but I have some questions
I need to ask you.

240
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Liar!

241
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,600
No, Bill.

242
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,160
No.

243
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,840
Agent:
Did he say anything unusual?

244
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,240
No. He seemed... he seemed
completely normal.

245
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,800
We were planning a vacation.

246
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,600
(officer whispering)

247
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,520
When do we get to, uh,
see the body?

248
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,520
Lt'll be a couple of days.

249
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,280
But I have to warn you...

250
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,680
he died from a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head,

251
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,040
so he's pretty unrecognizable.

252
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,760
I'll give you two a moment.

253
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,600
They said he was
unrecognizable, right?

254
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,720
How can they be sure
it's Sammy?

255
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
It's not him.

256
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,880
It's not him.

257
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,200
I can't remember which books
go on which shelves.

258
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,520
I don't know.

259
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,600
He's gonna be so upset.

260
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,920
(crying)

261
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
Oh God.

262
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,320
(groaning)

263
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,200
(crying)

264
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,240
(phone ringing)

265
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
Hello?

266
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,320
Speaking.

267
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,160
Sorry, uh, we have no comment.

268
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,080
(phone ringing)

269
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,880
(chatter)

270
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,840
(phone continues ringing)

271
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
Why aren't you answering that?

272
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,680
There are all these
news vans outside.

273
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
What?

274
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,960
They must have released his name.

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,080
Kate: We just lost our son.
What do they want from us?

276
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
Bill:
We're news.

277
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
- (phone ringing)
- Ignore it.

278
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,480
We should go upstairs.
They'll start peeking in the windows.

279
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,760
Are they just gonna stay
out there all day waiting?

280
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,840
Come on. Come on.

281
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,600
Newscaster on TV: Is known
beyond the shooter's identity.

282
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,000
Students from his dorm only say
that he was quiet and kept to himself.

283
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,720
We go now to 7 News
reporter Michael Call live

284
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,600
outside the shooter's
childhood home.

285
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,160
Bill:
Turn that off.

286
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,360
Someone could see
the light from outside.

287
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,360
They'll just start
ringing the bell again

288
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,760
if they find out we're home.

289
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,680
Kate:
Are they still there?

290
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,360
The last one's finally leaving.

291
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
But they'll probably
be back in the morning.

292
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,280
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

293
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,320
- You redid the kitchen, huh?
- Yeah, a couple months ago.

294
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,400
- Bill: It's nice.
- You don't have to wait on us really.

295
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,840
It's nothing.

296
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,600
Woman: I've put some
fresh towels in the bathroom.

297
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,080
Thanks.

298
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,080
This looks good.

299
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,840
- Is Dylan asleep?
- Yeah.

300
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,520
You'll see him tomorrow.

301
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
Delicious.
What'd you marinate this in?

302
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,080
Oh, it's just some bottled stuff
I got at the supermarket.

303
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,440
(sniffles)

304
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,320
(sighs)

305
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
I just can't believe it.

307
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,360
Was he okay?

308
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I mean before, you know?

309
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,360
Bill:
We thought so.

310
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
We... we didn't see him much.

311
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,480
The first year of college
is always hard.

312
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,480
Being away from home
alone, I guess.

313
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,880
- Yeah, of course.
- Woman: Was he depressed?

314
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,800
Was he doing drugs?

315
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,320
- Trish.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

316
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
Hey, did I tell you that Mom
bought a new car?

317
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
What kind?

318
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,080
He was a little quieter
than usual, that's all.

319
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,240
Which side do you want?

320
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,640
Uh, it doesn't matter.
You pick.

321
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,560
Your brother's doing
a nice job on the house.

322
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,880
This is probably worth twice
what they paid by now.

323
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,160
Did you call work and tell them
you won't be in for a while?

324
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
No.

325
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
They're gonna be staked out
at your office too.

326
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,160
(distant dog barking)

327
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,880
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

328
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,720
And uh...
(clears throat)

329
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,800
Thanks, I mean for...

330
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,280
Oh no. Hey, come on,
you're family.

331
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,080
If you need anything,
you know, just ask.

332
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,160
Morning.
(clears throat)

333
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,840
There she is.
How'd you sleep?

334
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,160
Uh, well, thank you.

335
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,000
Good morning there, Dylan.
How you doing?

336
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Man: Trish taught him to read
the nutritional labels.

337
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,360
Trish:
And that backfired.

338
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,920
Now all he wants to eat are the ones
with 13g of sugar per serving.

339
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,840
Oh my goodness.
And you let him, huh?

340
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,000
Not always.

341
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,800
Can I make you any breakfast?

342
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,040
Oh no, thank you.
Just some coffee please.

343
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,160
I got it. I got it.

344
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
- That looks good.
- Yeah.

345
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,440
Here you go.

346
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Come on, buddy.
You're done.

347
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Only 15 minutes.
Then we get ready for school.

348
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,160
- (TV turns on)
- Mommy, Sammy's on TV!

349
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,920
This was completely
in your power to avoid today.

350
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,280
Except you only leave me
one option.

351
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,560
Oh my God.

352
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,560
And now you all have blood
on your hands.

353
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
You vandalized my heart.

354
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,960
Come on, sweetie.
Let's get ready for school.

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,920
- Dylan: But it's not 15 minutes yet.
- Man: Shh.

356
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,480
Sam:
Maybe now you'll listen to me.

357
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,040
- Okay, mister, time for bed.
- But I'm not done.

358
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,560
- Yes, you are.
- No!

359
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,080
- Trish: Dylan, let's go. Come on.
- Buddy.

360
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
He is stubborn.

361
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,320
Sammy was like that too
at his age.

362
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,760
We need to issue a statement.

363
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,720
What for?

364
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
It's the right thing to do.

365
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,600
You know, l... I just
mean something simple

366
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,200
just expressing our remorse
and sadness.

367
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,680
Kate:
Remorse?

368
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,760
If we don't give the victims'
families something,

369
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,360
they're gonna think we... we don't
feel bad about what Sammy did.

370
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Kate?

371
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
(water running)

372
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,960
Do you use bleach in your whites?

374
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,760
Uh yeah, I think.

375
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,360
Katie, you know that he didn't mean
that you don't feel bad.

376
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,680
It's just that
you can't wait too long.

377
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,480
- I know.
- People aren't thinking straight

378
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,880
and you gotta give them something
so they know that you're on their side.

379
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Eric, I know.

380
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,680
Okay.

381
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
(sighs)

382
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,400
We are deeply sorry
for the devastation

383
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,120
our son has caused.

384
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Like all the victims' parents,

385
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,480
we are shocked
and utterly heartbroken.

386
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
Please allow us our privacy

387
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,320
as we mourn the loss
of our own son

388
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,680
and try to find
the strength to move on

389
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
from this horrible,
inexplicable tragedy.

390
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,520
Do you mind if I go?

391
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,680
Sure.

392
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,240
That's okay, I've got it.

393
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,240
(sighs)

394
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,240
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

395
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,080
Thinking about taking a walk.

396
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,360
(distant children playing)

397
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,040
Kate: It's good to be
out of the house.

398
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,720
Bill: Yeah, Trish and your brother
are being great,

399
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,640
but after a while,
I just want them to...

400
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't know... ignore me.

401
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,560
Kate: Mm.
(inhales)

402
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,280
Mm, do you smell the jasmine?
(sniffs)

403
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,720
- Smell it?
- (sniffs) No.

404
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,360
It's that sweet, flowery thing.
You don't smell that?

405
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,000
(chuckles)
I thought that was you...

406
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,320
your shampoo or your lotion
or something.

407
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,040
Kate:
Nah.

408
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,600
(door closes)

409
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
Bill: Trish gave us some Ambien
in case we need it.

410
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,040
Did we do something?

411
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
L... I mean, how could he do it?
Did we do something?

412
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,800
- Did we not do something?
- No.

413
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,200
No. We gave him everything
he could want.

414
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
But he was...
he was such a quiet kid.

415
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,160
He was lonely.

416
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,840
He never played with
the neighbor kids.

417
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,920
We should have
known that there...

418
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,360
Why does it have to be
our fault? Huh?

419
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
We did the best we could.

420
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,800
- Come on, let's go to sleep.
- I don't want to go to sleep.

421
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,400
- I want to talk about this.
- What is there to talk about?

422
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,880
You were a terrific mother.
We... we didn't do anything wrong.

423
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,360
Okay?

424
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,720
Well, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

425
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,360
Okay, goodnight.

426
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,520
I was thinking maybe
I'd go back to work tomorrow.

427
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,440
Okay.

428
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,320
I might swing by the house,
get some mail,

429
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,280
make sure everything's okay.

430
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,360
Bonnie said the reporters
are still there.

431
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,120
Fine, I won't go.

432
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,200
I didn't say that.
You can do whatever you want.

433
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,840
You're not gonna be able to live there
after all this, you know.

434
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,440
Maybe we should start
talking to realtors.

435
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,160
(sizzling)

436
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,480
- Morning, Trish.
- Morning.

437
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,800
- Can I help?
- Oh no, I'm good.

438
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,280
Do you want me to get
Dylan up for school?

439
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,200
- Oh, he's up.
- Oh.

440
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,640
Maybe I can help him
get dressed then.

441
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,080
Eric's doing that right now.

442
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,560
- Please let me do something.
- Oh.

443
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,520
- You can make Dylan's lunch.
- Great.

444
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,480
Hey, did you ever notice
your fridge doors were uneven?

445
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,240
See, this one's a little lower
than the other.

446
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,320
I'll have Eric take a look at that.

447
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,680
- Bill: Hey, Harry. It's Bill.
- Harry over phone: Bill!

448
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,480
Jesus, buddy, how are you doing?
How's Kate?

449
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,960
Fine. Uh, fine.

450
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,680
She's tough.

451
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,960
So l... I was thinking
things must be piling up

452
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,920
- pretty high there without me, huh?
- Don't even worry about it.

453
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,360
I talked to HR and got you
four weeks of paid leave.

454
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
I figured you could use the time.

455
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,440
Oh well, you know,
I don't mind coming in,

456
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
making sure, you know,
nothing's falling through the cracks.

457
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Don't you worry about us, Billy boy.
You just take care of yourself.

458
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,120
And if there's anything
I can do, you let me know.

459
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,120
Uh sure, okay.

460
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,080
Thanks. Bye.

461
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,960
I thought you were
going to work today.

462
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,960
Nope.

463
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,160
Good. You can go
to the cemetery with me.

464
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,560
Yeah, I'm just gonna
go out for a bit first.

465
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,200
You can stop right up here.

466
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,240
This is good.

467
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,480
Thank you.
Keep the change.

468
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,760
Eric: I want you to eat
just a little bit more, buddy.

469
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,720
Nice!

470
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,040
Eric:
Billy, is that you?

471
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,680
- Trish: You got a workout in.
- Sit down, man.

472
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,920
Your wife made a feast.

473
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,920
Kate: Maybe you should
take a shower first.

474
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,120
Yeah, I think I will.

475
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,720
Kate:
Oh, sit sit. I got it.

476
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,680
Dylan, would you like
some pie and ice cream, sir?

477
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,600
- Yes, please.
- I want you to eat one more.

478
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,240
One more, one more
before you get ice cream.

479
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,760
Okay.

480
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,840
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

481
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,280
(sighs)

482
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
Woman on TV:
...in your bathroom.

483
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,080
It cuts through
the nasty ring around the...

484
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,560
- (channel changes)
- (laughter)

485
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,280
- (channel changes)
- And I know some of you

486
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,960
are back home thinking,
"Well, the parents are victims too."

487
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,920
No, they're not.
They raised this kid.

488
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,920
And I don't care
if he's a legal adult or not.

489
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,280
It's the parents who are
ultimately responsible.

490
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,040
And we should find them,
whatever rock they're hiding under,

491
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,360
so the grieving parents
can take a crack at 'em.

492
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,280
But here's the real question, folks:

493
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Do they have any other kids
running around

494
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,160
that I need to worry about?

495
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,240
Because after their track record
with this little bugger,

496
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,120
I don't really want to meet
the rest of the family.

497
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,720
And I sure as hell
don't want the little psycho

498
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,240
going to school
with one of my kids.

499
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,040
- (Bill grunting)
- (racket striking ball)

500
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,400
Hey, I'm still using that.

501
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,280
Dude, we've been waiting
like a hour already.

502
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,760
- Man, come on.
- Dude, I'm still using it!

503
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,920
All right. Whatever.

504
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,880
Come on.

505
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,400
Hey.

506
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,120
Boy:
Oh! Oh!

507
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,520
You know I'm blocking it though.

508
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,840
- (ball thumps)
- Ooh! Ooh ho!

509
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,000
(sighs)

510
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,360
(ringing)

511
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
(over phone)
Hey, it's Sam.

512
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,120
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

513
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,600
(beeps)

514
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,960
Hi. It's Dad.

515
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,880
I know you're not gonna
get this, but I just...

516
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,560
I wish you could have told me
something was wrong.

517
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,360
You know,
that's what I'm here for.

518
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,080
Well, uh...

519
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,000
I just wanted to hear
your voice was all.

520
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,680
Bye.

521
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Man:
Please be seated.

522
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,520
Our prayers today go out
to the family and friends

523
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,040
of the victims
of this terrible tragedy,

524
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,120
especially our own Patty Larson
who lost her youngest, Jillian.

525
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,160
There will be a memorial service
tomorrow at noon.

526
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,760
All are welcome to attend.

527
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,920
Today we look at Luke 6:37...

528
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,880
"Do not judge
and you will not be judged.

529
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
Do not condemn
and you will not be condemned.

530
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,040
Forgive and you will be forgiven."

531
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,800
Eric: You gotta stay on me
for eight seconds.

532
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,640
All right, are you ready?
(imitates bell)

533
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,880
(imitating horse)

534
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,760
Okay, you're choking Daddy.
You're choking Daddy.

535
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,360
Ding ding ding ding ding.
Yeehaw!

536
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,720
Then you gotta throw
your hat up in the air.

537
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,160
- You gotta throw your hat in the air.
- (laughing)

538
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
You gotta throw
your hat up in the air.

539
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,760
Kate:
Okay. There you go.

540
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
That's right.

541
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,640
- Bill: Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

542
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,720
Kate:
That wasn't so hard, was it?

543
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,840
Is Sammy bad?

544
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,120
Uh, no.

545
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,440
He...

546
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,960
well, sometimes good people
do bad things by mistake.

547
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,640
- Why?
- Hey, partner.

548
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,520
Come on, it's time for bed.
Hmm?

549
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,520
One, two, three!

550
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
Get some sleep.

551
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,520
- You wanna?
- Yeah.

552
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,000
- Goodnight, buddy.
- Kate: Okay.

553
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,600
Do you want a song or a story?

554
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,360
- A song.
- Okay.

555
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Um...

556
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,400
this is one that Sammy really liked
when he was your age.

557
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,400
#It's all right,
you can go to sleep #

558
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,760
#Finally still and laughing #

559
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,280
#So the world
won't make you weep #

560
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,800
#Dreaming until
the sun is calling #

561
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,200
#And the day will lift
the sorrow #

562
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,680
#And slow your mind
from thinking #

563
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,240
#While the man in the moon
is winking #

564
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,800
#"I love you..." #

565
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,040
(sighs)

566
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,880
#It's all right #

567
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,360
#You can close your eyes #

568
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,760
#I'm never gone #

569
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,920
#The night is falling #

570
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,640
#And the moon
will pull us through #

571
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,960
#Starlight is almost twinkling #

572
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,920
#While the sun is slowly sinking #

573
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,440
#Into you. #

574
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,080
So when does
this grace period end?

575
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah, I know
it's an unusual case, but...

576
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
no, don't transfer me ag... oh.

577
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,240
- Who is it?
- It's the bank.

578
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm trying to figure out when we can
start paying off his loans.

579
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,000
That's what you're
worried about now?

580
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
Who cares when
his student loans are due?

581
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,040
I care. This stuff
needs to be cleaned up...

582
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,720
credit card bills, his Facebook account,
vacation deposit.

583
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,200
Tell me you're not trying to put our
finances in order before we split up.

584
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,040
No, of course not.
Yes yes.

585
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,320
- I'm trying to call about my son's...
- No, don't ignore me.

586
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,400
- Don't ignore me!
- I'm not!

587
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,640
It just took me 20 minutes to get
the right person on the phone.

588
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,360
I cannot believe
you are being so insensitive!

589
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,560
What am I being, Kate?

590
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,720
We have to try to start
moving forward.

591
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't want to get
a surprise in the mail

592
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,560
a year from now and have
to relive this over again.

593
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,120
Right, so we're just going to erase
his memory, erase our son's memory.

594
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,320
- Is that it?
- Trish: We're back.

595
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,480
Yeah, that's what I want to do.
Can I have the phone?

596
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,400
- Hi there.
- Dylan: Look what I got!

597
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,640
Oh, my goodness.
Look at you.

598
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,360
Trish:
He got two gold stars.

599
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,280
Oh, you are such a smart guy.

600
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,440
Trish: All right, baby,
go wash your hands.

601
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,440
(cell phone chiming)

602
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,320
Automated voice:
You have one unheard message.

603
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,400
Hey, Kate, it's Coop.
Uh, Coop... Cooper Stearns.

604
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm totally not calling to rush you
about the book, not remotely.

605
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,000
I was just, you know, wondering
how you were holding up.

606
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,360
Trying to convert me, huh?

607
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,280
The mission of addicts
and religious fanatics.

608
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,840
I haven't been
sleeping much anyway, so...

609
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,520
So, uh, sorry about
everything that's...

610
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,280
I mean, uh... God.

611
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,240
For a writer you have
quite a way with words.

612
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,760
It's a... it's a talent.

613
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,160
So did he ever give any reason?

614
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,280
Did you ever get a sense of why?

615
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,880
No.

616
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,480
I guess as much as we want one,

617
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,360
maybe sometimes
there just isn't an explanation.

618
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,480
Right.

619
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,360
Anyway, I know
you're eager to see this.

620
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,640
God, when I called, I totally
wasn't trying to rush you or...

621
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,360
No, please. I was grateful
for something to do, really.

622
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,000
Well, thanks for finishing so quickly.

623
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,480
- Wow.
- Oh, no no no.

624
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,840
- That bad?
- No, don't worry about it.

625
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,040
It's not as bad as it looks.
L... I like a red pen, I guess.

626
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,600
It was good, the story.

627
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,120
Not that my opinion matters much.

628
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,840
- I'm just the...
- The spellchecker.

629
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

630
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,680
- Yeah.
- But thanks.

631
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,200
- Um...
- I should probably get going.

632
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,480
Oh, okay. Yeah.

633
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,200
Um, well, it was nice
working with you.

634
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,480
- You too.
- And if I ever write a second book...

635
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,080
- When you write a second book.
...you'll be the first to read it,

636
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,000
- you and your red pen.
- Take care.

637
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
I picked up some cute little carrots
for Dylan's lunch tomorrow.

638
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,360
Thanks. He doesn't...
he doesn't like raw carrots.

639
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,200
Well, you have to force kids
at that age to eat healthy stuff.

640
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,520
- I mean, Sammy...
- He just doesn't like them.

641
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,200
Okay.

642
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,400
Trish:
Is he asleep?

643
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,360
You know,
he's been telling everyone

644
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,280
his cousin's a TV star.

645
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,920
It's not, but it's almost
kind of funny.

646
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,960
No, it's a problem.

647
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,680
He was playing
shoot 'em up today.

648
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,600
All boys play shoot 'em up.
He's on a cowboy kick.

649
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,120
And your sister is all over him
like every minute.

650
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,080
Do you know she fixed
the fridge doors

651
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,920
because they were uneven?

652
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,160
Dylan sees Bill sleeping
on the couch.

653
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,760
She's playing supermom.

654
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,200
I mean she's everywhere,

655
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,160
doing everything
like this is her house.

656
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,360
For Christ's sakes,
they are not strangers.

657
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
He was part of our family too.

658
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,320
She's my only sister
and she lost her son.

659
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,040
Stop being so selfish.

660
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,720
Just cut her some goddamn slack.

661
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,480
(running footsteps)

662
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,600
Dylan:
No no no!

663
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,440
Hey. How was Sunday school?

664
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,440
- What happened?
- Some kids were picking on him.

665
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,520
They said he was going to hell,
just like his cousin.

666
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,800
- Excuse me. Here you go.
- Thank you.

667
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
This looks good, babe.

668
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,160
Hey, I just got off the phone
with Roger.

669
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,240
- Who's Roger?
- He's Bill's old college roommate.

670
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,240
He just got back from Europe
and we're gonna put him out for a while.

671
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,840
- What? No.
- Bill: Yeah, he's been bugging me.

672
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,040
- We owe him a visit.
- Trish: It's up to you.

673
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,440
I mean, you're more than welcome
to stay as long as you want.

674
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,600
Bill:
You want to try going home?

675
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,240
Kate:
No.

676
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,400
Bill:
So where do you want to go?

677
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,480
Kate:
I don't know.

678
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,480
(door opens)

679
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,040
- Girl: Daddy, customer.
- Okay.

680
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,720
Newscaster: A man
we still know very little about.

681
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,800
His motives are known
only by speculation...

682
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,240
He keeps watching
that scary boy on TV.

683
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,400
...no real explanation before he took
his own life and the lives...

684
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,960
Doesn't matter how many times
they show that kid going off,

685
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,480
he still freaks me out, you know?

686
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,200
He's like Charles Manson crazy.

687
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,200
- Can I, uh, get a room?
- Yeah.

688
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,920
Which bed do you want?

689
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,240
It doesn't matter.

690
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,040
Well, do you want to be
closer to the bathroom

691
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,520
or farther away from the AC?

692
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,720
It doesn't matter.
Please, pick one.

693
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,800
- You talk to Bonnie?
- No.

694
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,360
Bet the mail's piled up
pretty high by now.

695
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,760
TV's broken.

696
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,200
And I know it's far away,
but we can always go

697
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,320
and stay at my stepmom's.

698
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,240
Kate:
I just want to stay here.

699
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,160
(sighs)

700
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,920
- Should we grab some dinner?
- I just want to lie here.

701
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,800
Okay.

702
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,000
The seven of clubs is missing.

703
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,920
Come on, we should go
and eat something.

704
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,400
(groans)

705
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,720
Come on.

706
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,080
(chatter)

707
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,760
I'll get some menus.

708
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,880
(crying)

709
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,480
(sobbing)

710
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,440
(people murmuring)

711
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,920
Woman:
That lady's crying.

712
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,120
Sorry.

713
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,960
Sorry.

714
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,040
Sorry. Sorry.

715
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,440
I'm sorry.

716
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,400
I'm sorry.

717
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,720
- I'm sorr...
- Shh.

718
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,040
I'm so sorry.

719
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,720
We weren't the best parents
in the world,

720
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,040
but we weren't
the worst either, right?

721
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,440
Right.

722
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,560
I mean, there are
worse parents out there.

723
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,520
But their kids didn't...

724
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,360
Why did he...?

725
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,520
I don't know.

726
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,640
The very best the vending
world has to offer.

727
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,040
Dinner is served.

728
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,640
And dessert.

729
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,600
- Wow.
- (chuckles)

730
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,400
- Mm.
- Whoa whoa.

731
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,600
Come on, come on.
Let's eat.

732
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,080
And you know what?

733
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,800
For once I am gonna do
the cooking for you.

734
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:25,040
It's a very very old family recipe

735
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,280
handed down through
the generations

736
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,800
- from my old Grandma Winnie.
- (chuckles)

737
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,120
Have I told you about
Grandma Winnie?

738
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,800
- No.
- Oh, she was a very wise old woman.

739
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,640
And this was her favorite dish.

740
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,920
I hope you like.

741
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,200
- Ew.
- (laughs) Come on.

742
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,160
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,080
- Mm.
- Mm-mm.

744
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,560
No? No?

745
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,440
Grandma Winnie
couldn't cook for shit.

746
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,520
- Not so much.
- No.

747
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,920
Okay, well, for the second
course we have... ah.

748
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,280
- Ah, Funyuns.
- Funyuns.

749
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,240
- They're both fun and...
- And onions.

750
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,040
And onions, that's right.

751
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,920
Well, you know what?
You can have those.

752
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,200
I'm gonna go for the Lance
Fresh Toastchee crackers.

753
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,480
Not "cheese," "chee."

754
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,640
- (bag pops)
- Whoa!

755
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,040
Ooh, wrong end.

756
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,520
Mmm.

757
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,400
- Mmm.
- Not bad.

758
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,640
(laughing)

759
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,280
Mm, it's a little dry.

760
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,400
- You're so weird.
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,560
More.

762
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,200
Thank you.

763
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,280
- Bon apptit.
- Mm.

764
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,200
I don't know why I never
let Sammy eat junk food.

765
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,600
- It's really quite nutritious.
- Plus it's darned tasty.

766
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,280
Mm-hmm.
Cheers to that.

767
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,760
Ah!

768
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,080
Oh, and you know the best part?

769
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,600
- Hmm?
- (laughing)

770
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,760
No dishes to rinse.

771
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,600
No, but all the crumbs in the bed.

772
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,880
Oh God!
No crumbs in the bed!

773
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,280
- Stop it. Stop it.
- No crumbs in the bed.

774
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,280
Oh, that's so gross.

775
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,880
- (laughing)
- What time is it?

776
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,160
- Who cares?
- So what do you wanna do now?

777
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,160
- Let's play cards.
- I thought you said one was missing.

778
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Five-card draw.
Nothing's wild.

779
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,000
Right. And what are we betting?

780
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,680
What are we, 16 again?

781
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,440
- (grunts)
- I fold.

782
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,120
Oh.

783
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,040
(giggles)

784
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,520
- You're stuck.
- Help! My head.

785
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,840
(indistinct conversation)

786
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,920
(Kate laughs)

787
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,400
Kate's voice:
What day is today?

788
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,680
Bill's voice:
I have no idea.

789
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,240
You know we can't go on
like this forever.

790
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,360
I know.

791
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,400
But we can do it for a little longer.

792
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,160
Yeah.

793
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,920
You want me to come with you?

794
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,800
I'm just gonna make sure
everything's okay,

795
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,240
grab some clothes and come back.

796
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,960
- The bills can wait, you know.
- I'll be quick.

797
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,440
I'll let Bonnie know, so she doesn't
accidentally call the cops on you.

798
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,160
Bye.

799
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,480
Yeah.

800
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,920
(loud thumps)

801
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,000
(objects clatter)

802
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,160
(clattering continues)

803
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,000
(rustling, clattering)

804
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,200
Dude, he's got an award
for perfect attendance.

805
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,920
(laughs)
Yeah.

806
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,200
Nice.

807
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,640
What are you doing in here?

808
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,880
Uh...

809
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,720
What are you doing
in my son's room?

810
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,400
I'm sorry. L...
I didn't know you'd be here.

811
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,320
What are you doing
in my son's room?!

812
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,360
I can't breathe.

813
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,000
- You fucking psycho!
- (glass breaks)

814
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,960
Ah!

815
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Kate:
Bill?

816
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,240
Yeah. I'm back.

817
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:41,080
- Did you see Bonnie?
- No.

818
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,320
I feel overdressed.

819
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,720
Good. Look at you.
You changed your shirt.

820
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,680
The other one
was getting a little ripe.

821
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,920
Yeah.

822
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,600
- What happened to your hand?
- Oh, nothing.

823
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,080
I just... I cut it
on a piece of glass.

824
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,520
- It's fine.
- Are you sure? It looks bad.

825
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah, it's fine.
It's fine.

826
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,520
Oh good, you got me
some new clothes.

827
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,920
I'm sick of wearing the same thing.

828
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,200
Junk mail.

829
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,520
And what is this?

830
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,520
Would someone be looking
for a rematch?

831
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,480
What?

832
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,320
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah yeah.

833
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,680
I'm just tired, you know?

834
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,600
Yeah.

835
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,960
(DVD tray clicks)

836
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,840
Oh my God, Bill.

837
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,040
- Mom and Dad...
- Oh my God.

838
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,000
Oh my God.

839
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,480
...l'm sorry.

840
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,400
Please don't hate me.

841
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,400
Kate: Oh.

842
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,440
Bill: No, I don't... I don't
want to see it again.

843
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,720
No, but... but it's Sammy.
It's our Sammy.

844
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,240
- No, it's not. It's not him.
- Of course it is.

845
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,120
That's the real him,

846
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,680
not what those awful
television stations keep playing.

847
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,640
- This is him.
- No, it's not. It's not.

848
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,840
Well, it was him
until they changed him.

849
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,680
- They made him into that.
- No no no. It happened...

850
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,640
it happened way before
he got to college.

851
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:07,400
And l... I don't know how,
but we did it.

852
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,520
We messed him up.
We, uh...

853
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,440
maybe we didn't
give him any hope

854
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,840
or, you know, we didn't exactly
show him how to be happy.

855
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,720
- How can you say that?
- He wasn't well.

856
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,040
He was depressed and...
and irrational

857
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,160
and angry.

858
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,480
Well, everyone gets
depressed and angry,

859
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,360
but that's still no explanation.

860
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,840
We don't know why
he did what he did.

861
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,320
And I seem to be the only one
that cares about asking why.

862
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,200
You keep asking why because...

863
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,200
because you're looking
for someone to tell us

864
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,840
that we're not responsible.

865
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,840
And you keep avoiding it because
you assume we are responsible.

866
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,960
Because he... he did it, Kate.
He did it.

867
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,360
He walked into
those classrooms and...

868
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,360
and he actually shot
all those people...

869
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,320
- his teachers, his friends!
- No, I'm not listening to this.

870
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,000
- All right? He's a murderer!
- Shut up!

871
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,080
- He's a murderer and it's our fault!
- Shut up!

872
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,400
You should be defending him.
You're his father.

873
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,160
Well, there is no defense
for what he did!

874
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,720
(sobbing)
I don't want to hear this anymore.

875
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,720
I don't even know who you are!

876
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,200
That's right,
you don't know who I am.

877
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,480
You never did.
You never even tried to.

878
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,200
You don't know me and you sure as hell
didn't know your own son!

879
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,120
Do you want to know
whose fault it is?

880
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,880
It's your fault!

881
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,400
If you weren't such
an emotionally absent

882
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,120
clich of a father,
this wouldn't have happened.

883
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,520
- He... he would be happy.
- So what, you're putting it all on me?

884
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,160
He wasn't happy
because you picked at every...

885
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,120
at every flaw he had,
every mistake.

886
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,800
No no.
At least he knew I cared.

887
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,280
- You and your red pen!
- I was there every time he was sick.

888
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,440
I was the one worried when he didn't
come home for dinner on time.

889
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,080
- And I didn't worry. I didn't worry.
- No! No!

890
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,000
I was the one who checked
his homework.

891
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,800
I was the one who planned
the birthday parties.

892
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,000
I was the one who picked
all of the Christmas gifts.

893
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,960
You... you picked at him.

894
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,560
You picked and picked until he...
till he exploded!

895
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,000
(sobbing)
L... I did the best I could,

896
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,560
but I was by myself.

897
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,480
And where were you?
You were at work.

898
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,920
You were at work.
You put a roof over his head.

899
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,640
But what... where were you?

900
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,880
Where were you?

901
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,800
Yeah.

902
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,440
Go ahead.
Go ahead, leave.

903
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,360
You've been wanting to
for the last 10 years anyway.

904
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,280
Yeah, because I couldn't bear
to be with you!

905
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,560
I wanted to be anywhere else,
but I was... I was stuck.

906
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,200
No, you weren't.
You were not.

907
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,200
You're a big boy.
You could've left anytime.

908
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,920
I was stuck because of Sam!

909
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,600
I stayed because of...
because of him.

910
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,840
And look what...
look what he turned into! Huh?

911
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,960
- Look! Look!
- No! No!

912
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,400
I wish to God we hadn't had him!

913
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,880
- I wish we hadn't fucking had him!
- Don't say it.

914
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,240
Don't say it, please.

915
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,040
- I wish we hadn't had him.
- Oh my... (sobbing)

916
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,000
(crying)

917
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,080
Maybe that's the reason why.

918
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,920
- (ball thuds)
- Kate's voice: Whoa! Nice kick.

919
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,680
(young Sam giggling)

920
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,400
Bill:
Harry. Hey, it's Bill.

921
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,000
- Billy. How are you doing?
- Good.

922
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:09,040
Look, I was wondering
if you wanted to get a drink.

923
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:13,680
- Harry: Uh, sure.
- How about today?

924
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,200
Hey, Billy, sorry I'm late.
Traffic was terrible.

925
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,840
Have a seat.
Let me get you a cold one.

926
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,760
I can't stay long, but...

927
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,520
- So how are you doing?
- Great.

928
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,520
- And Kate?
- Great...

929
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,040
you know, considering.

930
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,440
- Here you are, sweetie.
- Thank you.

931
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,920
To be honest,
we're not together anymore.

932
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,520
- You're kidding.
- I'm getting my own place.

933
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,360
Don't you think you should just sleep
on a friend's couch for a while?

934
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,160
Try to straighten things out?

935
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,000
I don't have any friends.

936
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,360
Well, I sure hope
you two work it out.

937
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,160
So what can I do for you?

938
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,840
I'm ready to go back to work.

939
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,360
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

940
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,080
What did you do to your wrist?

941
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,000
Oh uh, it's nothing.

942
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,040
So what do you...
what do you think?

943
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,440
- Bill...
- I need to do something.

944
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,440
I'm going crazy.

945
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,160
Harry, please.

946
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,200
Look, I gotta get going.

947
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,560
All right, come in next week.

948
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,680
I'll see you Monday?

949
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,840
Thanks.

950
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,760
(footsteps retreating)

951
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,560
(music playing over PA)

952
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,680
Excuse me.

953
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,520
Excuse me.

954
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,240
Thank you.

955
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,080
Kate?

956
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,040
I thought that was you.

957
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,160
Hi. What are you doing here?

958
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,800
I was jonesing
for some Coco Pandas.

959
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,560
Goes with your
quadruple espresso, I guess.

960
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,880
Absolutely.
The sugar-caffeine diet.

961
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,320
Um, can I buy you a cup?

962
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,360
It's... it's not afternoon yet.

963
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,560
Let me give you a hand there.

964
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,480
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

965
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,240
Should I talk about it?
Should I avoid it completely?

966
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,920
Pretend it didn't happen?
I just... no one knew how to act.

967
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,480
Jeez, even your family?

968
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,760
L... I don't know,
I bet all that tiptoeing around

969
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,560
- would get to you after a while.
- No, it's not their fault.

970
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,600
I can't say I'd react
any differently if I was them.

971
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,440
- Can you hand me those, please?
- Was I a total idiot that time?

972
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,000
- Just like a complete, moronic...
- No.

973
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,360
- (laughs) I was.
- Yeah, a little bit.

974
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,440
But you were really sweet.
Thanks for that.

975
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,600
- You want to stay for dinner?
- Um...

976
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,280
Nothing fancy, but...

977
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,000
- Sure, I'd like that.
- Okay.

978
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,720
We haven't had a real dinner
in this house

979
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,200
where we actually
sat down and ate

980
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,960
since Sammy was like
a sophomore in high school, so...

981
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,560
Well, I'm happy
to bring back the tradition.

982
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,000
And it's really good.

983
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,280
I'm not sure I've ever had
mac and cheese

984
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,920
that didn't come out
of a little blue box.

985
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,040
It was his favorite.

986
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,880
Did he have a lot of friends?

987
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,800
Mm, mm-mm.

988
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,680
Now and again,
but he was a really shy kid.

989
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,680
Yeah.

990
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,760
Every year we'd go
to this annual Christmas party...

991
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,400
at Dr. Ko's house.

992
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,440
He was a friend of mine.

993
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,960
And he had this tradition where
before the kids got their gifts,

994
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,160
they had to sing a song
in front of everyone.

995
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,640
- Oh God.
- I know. It was awful.

996
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,600
And Sammy
would never do it, right?

997
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,360
He would rather
go without a present

998
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,000
than actually get up in front
of all those people, let alone sing.

999
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,480
Yeah.

1000
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,880
Well, this one Christmas...
he was like nine...

1001
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,480
and all the kids were getting up,
little kids.

1002
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,480
They were getting up and singing
and getting applause

1003
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,720
and getting their present and...
I don't know.

1004
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,640
Bill said just to leave him alone.

1005
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,360
But I don't know...
I guess I was embarrassed.

1006
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,240
I just wanted him to,
you know, do it.

1007
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,080
You know?
I wanted him to just get up and...

1008
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,800
And?

1009
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,520
Then he threw a tantrum
and I yelled at him.

1010
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,840
And then I made him do it.

1011
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,080
(whispers)
I made him do it.

1012
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,040
So he started singing
"Jingle Bells"

1013
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,920
and he cried
the whole way through.

1014
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,640
And it was like a week
before he would talk to me again.

1015
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,160
Well, I hope at least
the present was good.

1016
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,720
No, a chemistry set.

1017
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,560
He never even opened it.

1018
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,760
- Um...
- (sighs)

1019
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,720
- I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

1020
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,680
- (groans)
- No.

1021
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,560
(groans)

1022
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,880
- So tell me about your book.
- (both laugh)

1023
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,040
- What's your next book about?
- Oh, l... I don't know.

1024
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,640
I just have an idea
I'm batting around in my head.

1025
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,440
Can't you just tell me?

1026
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,480
No, I can't.
It's... it's awful.

1027
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,880
Come on, tell me.

1028
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,600
It's just really
the beginning of an idea.

1029
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,400
I don't have it
all worked out yet, so...

1030
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,000
But the second I'm done,
you'll be the first to read it.

1031
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,280
Finished, you mean.

1032
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,320
Steaks are done,
people are finished.

1033
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,960
That's why you'll be
the first to read it.

1034
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,440
Right.

1035
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,800
Restroom?

1036
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,840
Down the hall, to the left.

1037
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,360
Hey, do you want some
apple pie and ice cream?

1038
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,840
Cooper: Yeah. You know
I can't turn down sugar.

1039
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,040
(sighs)

1040
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,160
What are you doing?

1041
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,880
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just, um...

1042
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,720
You didn't tell me
Sammy wrote stories.

1043
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,440
You were doing research.

1044
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,200
It... okay, I was...

1045
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,800
I just wanted to see
who Sammy was a little bit better.

1046
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,720
Stop. It's okay.
Just stop.

1047
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,240
I want to show them
that he was human,

1048
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,200
that he really wasn't any different
from anybody else.

1049
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,720
It's okay. Please.

1050
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,160
Everyone is capable of that kind
of rage, okay? Everyone.

1051
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,880
It's... it's no one's fault
what happened...

1052
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,720
not yours, not your husband's.

1053
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,880
That's all I'm trying to say.

1054
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,440
Can you please leave?

1055
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,760
Okay.

1056
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,480
(doorbell rings)

1057
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,560
I'm sorry.

1058
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,600
How's Nikki?

1059
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,120
Eh, she's getting back to normal.

1060
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,080
She lost 3 lbs.

1061
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,400
We're selling the house, you know,
trying to make it presentable.

1062
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,680
- I'll miss you.
- (chuckles)

1063
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,640
- Bill's not here helping you?
- No.

1064
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,560
That's too bad.

1065
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,520
There just aren't a lot of people
out there who can really understand

1066
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,480
what you're going through,
you know?

1067
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,400
- Bill, hi.
- Hey, Bill.

1068
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,360
(people whispering)

1069
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,800
(soft chatter)

1070
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,720
- Man: You killed it.
- Man #2: Thanks, buddy.

1071
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,120
(people whispering)

1072
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,440
(sighs)

1073
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,680
What is it, huh?
What are you looking at?

1074
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Enjoying the show?

1075
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,240
What, can't wait to get home,
tell everybody about the killer's dad?

1076
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,840
Huh?
Tell them all he's crazy too?

1077
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,040
"Must be where the kid got it from"?

1078
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,640
- Hey hey hey, what's going on?
- No one can mind

1079
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,320
their own fucking business,
that's what's going on.

1080
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,400
- All right. Come on, folks, let's go.
- They keep staring at me.

1081
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,120
They're just concerned.
They're your friends.

1082
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,080
Bullshit. All I want to do is my job
and they won't leave me alone.

1083
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,600
- Bill, maybe you came back too soon.
- No, it's them.

1084
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,760
They're gawking at me
like I'm in a fishbowl.

1085
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,120
How am I supposed...

1086
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,000
Maybe you should take a few more
weeks off, see somebody.

1087
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,080
I don't need to see anyone.

1088
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,600
I'm... I'm fine.

1089
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,720
- I just want to be left alone.
- Bill. Bill.

1090
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,480
It's not a suggestion.

1091
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,760
Well, then fuck you!

1092
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,000
- Girl: Hurry up. Come on.
- Girl #2: I'm coming.

1093
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,120
Yeah yeah yeah.

1094
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,040
(girls laughing, chatting)

1095
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,840
(soft chatter)

1096
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,760
- Girl: Wow. Isn't that wild?
- (girl #2 laughs)

1097
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,640
Oh my God.

1098
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,680
I'm gonna settle up.

1099
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,920
Your last night?

1100
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,640
You going back home?

1101
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,840
By the way, some reporters
came sniffing around.

1102
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:02,400
L... I told 'em I'd never
seen you before.

1103
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,960
Thanks.

1104
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,440
I'm scared he got
all that rage from me.

1105
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,440
You know, he...

1106
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,800
he called us the night before.

1107
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,920
And I keep... I keep replaying it
over and over again in my head,

1108
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,080
trying to figure it out,
you know?

1109
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,240
Why? Why did he call?

1110
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,480
What did he want to say?

1111
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,080
He must have been
asking for help, right?

1112
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,320
He must have wanted us
to stop him.

1113
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,000
What did he say?

1114
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,760
I don't... I don't know.

1115
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,160
I hung up and went to bed.

1116
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,760
And then the next morning...

1117
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,760
Wow.

1118
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,200
What could you have
said anyway, you know?

1119
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,800
Yeah.

1120
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,040
(spits)

1121
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,400
(breathing heavily)

1122
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,440
(groans)

1123
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,880
You really have left
a mess behind, haven't you?

1124
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,040
But what do they say?

1125
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,520
God doesn't give you
more than you can handle.

1126
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,280
Not so true, is it?

1127
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,160
(phone ringing)

1128
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,160
Bill over phone:
Hi, we're not home right now,

1129
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,440
but if you leave a message
with your number,

1130
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,720
we'll get back to you
as soon as we can. Thanks.

1131
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,320
(phone ringing)

1132
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,920
He came in to check out,
but that was a couple of days ago.

1133
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,520
He hasn't come out since
and he won't let housekeeping in.

1134
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,520
I feel sorry for him, you know.

1135
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,400
I just don't know what to do.

1136
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,000
(knocking)

1137
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,160
- You're his wife, right?
- Yeah.

1138
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,960
I'm fine.
Just leave me alone.

1139
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,600
- Bill, it's me.
- Katie?

1140
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,040
Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.

1141
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,640
- (Bill crying)
- Oh, God, look at you.

1142
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,240
Oh, angel.

1143
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,640
It's okay. It's okay.

1144
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,000
- I did love him.
- Oh, I know.

1145
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,240
I know. I know.

1146
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,120
Shh.

1147
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,360
It's time to go home.

1148
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,320
Okay?

1149
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,440
Okay?
It's time to go home, okay?

1150
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,600
Come on, sweetie.

1151
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,800
I know. I know.

1152
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,520
I've got you. I've got you.

1153
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,120
Come on.

1154
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,440
(Bill sobbing)

1155
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,600
Sam's voice:
"As the boy and the girl ran out

1156
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,440
from their station wagon,
the beach was happy.

1157
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,240
It was happy to have
their small footprints upon it...

1158
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,160
happy to have holes dug
with plastic shovels.

1159
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,040
It was even happy
to have paper wrappers

1160
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,960
blowing about after they'd gone.

1161
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,120
But the beach knew
that there would no longer

1162
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,080
be this to look forward to.

1163
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,920
There'd be
no more careless play...

1164
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,640
only lonely snowfalls to mark
the beginning of an endless winter.

1165
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:41,480
The beach loved the boy and the girl,
though it had no way of telling them

1166
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,880
and it knew that this was
their last time together.

1167
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,400
Things would be different
from now on."

1168
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,720
Will you sleep with me, please?

1169
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,640
Please, don't leave.

1170
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,360
I won't. I won't.

1171
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:35,280
Sam's voice: "And it didn't know
if they would be better or worse,

1172
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,600
but for certain
things would change."

1173
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,600
(folk music playing)

1174
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,400
#This is love #

1175
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,440
#Following the dream #

1176
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:33,160
#Making things happen #

1177
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,760
#It is hard #

1178
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,160
#And not all it seems sometimes #

1179
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,720
#When we both won't give in #

1180
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,120
#Oh, I'm held by your anger #

1181
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,800
#And I'm held
by your fisted hands #

1182
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,120
#And so it goes,
and so it goes #

1183
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,080
#And we begin again #

1184
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,080
#Then we lie awake shaking #

1185
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,960
#We lie awake breaking #

1186
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,760
#And a little bit dies #

1187
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,000
#In the end #

1188
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,680
#Now we are still #

1189
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,840
#And I want you near me #

1190
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,680
#Even with words
we can never take back #

1191
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,200
#We are always outspoken,
we're wiser when broken #

1192
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,880
#And we're able to laugh #

1193
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,320
#'Cause this is us
with cracks in the road #

1194
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:40,600
#Lonely, causing
our journey to bend #

1195
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,160
#We haven't lost #

1196
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,680
#Something that we can't
find again #

1197
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,520
#And we lie awake breaking #

1198
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,520
#We lie awake aching #

1199
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,360
#We lie awake making love #

1200
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,440
#In the end #

1201
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,080
#Yeah, we lie awake breaking #

1202
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,400
#We lie awake aching #

1203
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:12,160
#We lie awake
making love again #

1204
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,160
#This is love #

1205
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,480
#This is us. #

1206
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,640
(piano music playing)

1207
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:42,000
#It's all right,
you can go to sleep #

1208
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,880
#Finally still and laughing #

1209
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:52,280
#So the world
don't make you weep #

1210
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:56,440
#Dreaming until #

1211
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,880
#The sun is calling #

1212
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,000
#The day will lift the sorrow #

1213
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,320
#Slow your mind from thinking #

1214
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:16,560
#While the man in the moon
is winking "I love you" #

1215
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:23,920
#The night is falling #

1216
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:28,920
#The moon will pull us through #

1217
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:33,280
#So slow your mind
from thinking #

1218
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:40,640
#While the man in the moon
is winking "I love you" #

1219
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:49,600
#It's all right,
you can close your eyes #

1220
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,520
#I'm never gone. #
