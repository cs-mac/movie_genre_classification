2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,330
Have you seen my boy?

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,329
Not much further! Hurry up!

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,930
Let me help you!

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,050
Let's go!

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,999
The dead bodies in the south transept,
the injured in the north!

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,209
Dead in the south transept.

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,569
The worse the injury,
the closer to the high alter!

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,690
I'm coming, I'm coming.

10
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,809
What's your name?

11
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,930
Clear the way for Lord Roland.

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,400
Thank you for saving him.

13
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,490
You're a brave man.

14
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,130
It was an honour, My Lady.

15
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,930
-May I examine him?
-Certainly not.

16
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,809
It's either me or Brother Joseph.

17
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,450
His skull is open to the brain.

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,090
Help me turn him over onto his side.

19
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,130
I don't see him anywhere.

20
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,089
What colours was he wearing?
Do you remember?

21
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,850
It's my da.

22
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:18,169
It's my da.

23
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,329
Da?

24
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,239
Dad!

25
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,810
You should have put dung
into the Earl's wound

26
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,850
before closing it, cousin.

27
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,049
It draws out the disease.

28
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,410
Even Oxford doesn't sanction that any more.

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,649
You'd know that if you had studied medicine.

30
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,810
Well, I studied theology,

31
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,089
a higher calling than your diabolic medicine.

32
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,609
What's needed, cousin, is less theology
and more of the healing arts.

33
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,049
Do you need more evidence of God's wrath?

34
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,929
The bridge collapsed
because he is displeased.

35
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,010
The bridge collapsed
because it's old and inadequate.

36
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,810
Yes, by God's will.

37
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,450
The punishment is upon Kingsbridge
for becoming a haven

38
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,929
for witches, whores, and filth.

39
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,320
Well, you would know, cousin.

40
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,649
There, Father.

41
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:52,570
Yesterday the French all but sank
an English trader by ramming her.

42
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,690
Our sailors escaped death
only by grace of the captain's skills.

43
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:01,130
Sire, this is an act of war.

44
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,769
Is war declared?

45
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,690
No.

46
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,849
No, no, it is not.

47
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,849
Grandmother says that we must invade
Calais and march on Paris.

48
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,250
I think I rather agree.

49
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,329
Do you even know where Calais is?

50
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,039
Of course I do.

51
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,250
There's Calais.

52
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,050
And there's Paris.

53
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,810
Sire, that is an omen!

54
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,409
I have been given a sign!

55
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,729
As son of Isabella of France,

56
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,690
grandson of Phillip IV of France,
heir of the House of Capet,

57
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,529
I am the lawful, God-given King of France!

58
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,490
The blockade of England shall be ended.

59
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,880
And let no man stand between me
and my rightful throne!

60
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:38,729
Once again, the English flag
will fly on both sides

61
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,729
of the British Sea!

62
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,130
God save the King!

63
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,930
God save the King!

64
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,690
God save the King!

65
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,529
God save the King!

66
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,409
God save the King!

67
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,130
God save the King!

68
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,010
Still no change?

69
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:19,250
Neither for the worse, nor better.

70
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,409
I have no way of telling how it bodes.

71
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,120
It means God has not made up his mind yet.

72
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,690
I'm so sorry about what they did to Mattie.

73
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,010
Thank you.

74
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,000
I so admired you at her trial.

75
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,089
You had the courage to speak out
and I did not.

76
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,610
We need strong women like you
in the Church.

77
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,170
Me in the Church?

78
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,690
Women today are either nun, wife, or whore.

79
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,930
The nun is by far the freest.

80
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,329
How are you?

81
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,889
Tired.

82
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,570
I just wish Mattie was here.

83
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,889
I can't believe in a church
that would kill Mattie.

84
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,969
There was nothing holy about that,
it was evil.

85
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,519
I agree.

86
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,649
The one person that could have helped us.

87
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,200
I've only learned a fraction of everything
she knew.

88
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,119
No, no, no. Caris, that's not true.
You're working miracles here.

89
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,450
Am I?

90
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,609
It's chaos.

91
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,650
We can't just leave people
strewn across the cathedral floor.

92
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,729
We need a place to put
the sick and the injured.

93
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,209
Well, when this is over we'll build one.

94
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,530
I wouldn't even know where to start.

95
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,530
I said "we."

96
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:59,609
And is that because of your faith in my work,

97
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,969
or how you feel about me?

98
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,530
Both.

99
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,290
Thank you.

100
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,369
You've given me something to think about.

101
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,800
You mean the building, or me?

102
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,050
Both.

103
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,770
I thought you were an angel.

104
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,930
Scarcely that.

105
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:03,969
You look so lovely.

106
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:10,969
I was just dreaming about the time
I first set eyes on you.

107
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,770
The most beautiful woman in Kingsbridge.

108
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,650
And you were the handsomest man.

109
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,050
Were?

110
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,129
Are!

111
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,410
And ever shall be.

112
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,050
How long before we wed?

113
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,489
You're awake.

114
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,930
You're awake!

115
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,329
Praise God! I've been praying for you daily.

116
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,209
Margery,

117
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,280
I've just had the strangest dream.

118
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,959
<i>A stone bridge?</i>

119
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,209
-Yes.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

120
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,329
We have debated this before.

121
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,209
Yes, but Brother, with no bridge

122
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,690
there would be no tolls,
no pilgrims, no merchants,

123
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,410
and consequently no money.

124
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,129
You'll be bankrupt within the year.

125
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,890
Edmund, Edmund, where is your faith?

126
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,489
God will provide.

127
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:16,089
He took down the bridge,
so obviously we don't need one.

128
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:19,609
I trust in him and so should you.

129
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,570
Come, Brother Theodoric.

130
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,849
What a fool. Blind in more ways than one.

131
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,570
God help us if he's elected Prior.

132
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,890
Well, who else is running against him?

133
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:35,450
Well, no one, and that's the problem.
We really need to find an alternative.

134
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,979
But I can't really take those, so if you...

135
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,400
Brother Thomas...

136
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,410
You must know that you're the best man...

137
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,930
The only man suitable for
the position of Prior.

138
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:03,329
Thank you, Brother Matthias. You flatter me.

139
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,890
Well, don't you want to be Prior?

140
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,920
I came here to find peace.

141
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:19,440
I fear that if I stand,
and perhaps worse, if I won,

142
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,969
that that peace might elude me.

143
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,009
Well, never forget for some it is a calling.

144
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,609
You said I'd be Prior.

145
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,489
Brother Carlus is running
and all the older monks will vote for him.

146
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:55,969
You can't worry about Carlus.
He's easily taken care of.

147
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,119
Who's running against him?

148
00:12:57,219 --> 00:13:00,089
Brother Thomas announced
his candidacy last night.

149
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,290
Brother Thomas?

150
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,690
He's popular with the younger monks,
which leaves me without support.

151
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,640
He arrived here as a knight
with an arrow through his arm.

152
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,170
The man has a history. Unearth it.

153
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,160
No less than Queen Isabella
sponsored Sir Thomas Langley.

154
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,009
So?

155
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,920
He was stationed at Berkeley Castle
where the King was murdered,

156
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,079
and arrived here shortly afterward
injured and seeking refuge.

157
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,329
You think he was involved in
the King's death.

158
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,650
Inquire of him. Measure his answers.

159
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,009
<i>Be careful what you say.</i>

160
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,680
My dear Brother Thomas, I'm merely asking...

161
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,290
No, you're not. You're insinuating
that I am somehow involved.

162
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:15,089
No, no, not at all!

163
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,209
Not at all, I'm just pointing out

164
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,170
that since you were stationed
at Berkeley Castle,

165
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,290
where the King was murdered,

166
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,009
it might appear by innuendo
that you were somehow embroiled.

167
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,969
Of course I wasn't.

168
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,089
Of course you weren't.

169
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,170
But you understand, naturally, a knight
who mysteriously arrives here injured,

170
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,930
seeking refuge,

171
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,359
and sponsored by the Queen no less?

172
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,329
Some of our fellow monks
will want to ask you questions.

173
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,479
Why?

174
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:49,640
Why now?

175
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,530
Well, because you are standing
for Prior now.

176
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:02,489
And once they know of your past,
there's sure to be a simple inquiry.

177
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,009
What?

178
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,249
I think it's time for your instruction.
We'll find some more privacy.

179
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,489
This way.

180
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,879
No one will disturb us in here.

181
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,729
Do you think your father suspects?

182
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,170
What, that I'm fucking his fiancée?

183
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,890
I won't tell if you don't.

184
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,249
<i>And until the lords successor
can be appointed,</i>

185
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,249
<i>your inheritance cannot be approved.</i>

186
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:19,329
My da's dead and I'm his only child.

187
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:20,650
What's to approve?

188
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,650
How will you pay workers?

189
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:24,810
Thirty acres is more
than one man can manage.

190
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,719
It's not 30 acres! It's only 20 he has to work.

191
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,170
One third of the land is always kept fallow.

192
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,530
It is not your business, woman.

193
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:36,050
An inheritance from father to son?
That's everyone's business!

194
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,450
She's right, Nate. What do you say to that?

195
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,089
The new lord will have the final decision
once he's appointed.

196
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,650
But that could take months.

197
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,770
I'll miss ploughing and sowing by then.

198
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,209
If you can prove that you can farm the land
before the new lord takes office,

199
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,690
that should work in your favour.

200
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,079
Next!

201
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,290
Who the hell is she?

202
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,769
I met her at the Fair.

203
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:06,769
Gwenda?

204
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,400
Thanks.

205
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,890
That's all right. You deserve it.

206
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,090
Get someone to help you plough
and you'll finish it in no time.

207
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,569
Everything I had was lost
in the bridge collapse.

208
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,130
I'll farm it myself.

209
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,809
I'll help.

210
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,930
No, you've done more than enough.
I'm grateful.

211
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,809
Wulfric!

212
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,930
Morning.

213
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,130
You're wasting your time, Gwenda.

214
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:07,249
You're wasting yours. Where's your oxen?

215
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,209
I don't have any.

216
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,410
Then you'll have to do.

217
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,239
I can't pay you, Gwenda. I've got no money.

218
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,009
You'll find another way to pay me.
Come on, you pull, I'll push.

219
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,330
Come on!

220
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,769
Where's your home?

221
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,330
Don't have one.

222
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,370
Why not?

223
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,450
My father was a mercenary in
the Queen's army so we moved around.

224
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,809
I would like to have a home someday.

225
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,489
And all that goes with it.

226
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,249
Who was that girl I saw you with?

227
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,850
Annet.

228
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,729
We're to marry come autumn.

229
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,249
Well, why isn't she here to help?

230
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,890
Annet in the fields?

231
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,769
Doesn't she love you?

232
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:57,650
Yeah, of course she does.

233
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,729
Do you love her?

234
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,529
Well, I've known her since forever, now.

235
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,969
Her father and mine, they were partners.

236
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,650
So now it's my duty to husband her.

237
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,009
Well, anyway, that's not what I asked.

238
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,850
Of course I love her.

239
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,160
Good.

240
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,170
I'm glad for you, Wulfric.

241
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:40,759
Kingsbridge needs an inn
dedicated exclusively to nursing the sick.

242
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,080
A hospice.

243
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,529
I've never heard of such a thing.

244
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,249
With the bridge collapse, it made me realise
how much we need one here.

245
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,769
God willing we never have
a catastrophe like that again.

246
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,009
No, but pilgrims
will always come here to be cured.

247
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,289
Imagine if they could find care
as well as miracles.

248
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,690
And you'd build it here?

249
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,289
The convent owns this land, doesn't it?

250
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,969
Who would run it?

251
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,049
I would.
With your blessing of course, Mother.

252
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,209
As one of us.

253
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,209
Well, no, as a laywoman.
I've decided to take over Mattie's work.

254
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,930
I understand.

255
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,009
Not everyone is called to God.

256
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:22,529
A hospice for the sick, on our land,
run by someone outside of our order.

257
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,719
It raises a complex set of questions.

258
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,130
I will have to think about it.

259
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:37,100
I said, "What's good for the goose
is good for the gander."

260
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,519
He said,
"It is neither a goose nor a gander.

261
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,569
"It is a common duck."

262
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,489
And I said,
"Even though I've got a hole in the head,

263
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,090
"I can still see clearer than you."

264
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:53,850
I hope you are enjoying the meal, Sir Roland.

265
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,410
Yes, thank you. It's quite adequate.

266
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:56,850
I'm so glad.

267
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,120
After the wedding tomorrow,
the monks are to elect a new Prior.

268
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,370
Yes.

269
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,360
Well, the candidates are Carlus,

270
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,569
he's blind and set in his ways, and myself.

271
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:15,170
I would be so grateful for your support.

272
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,930
I thought there was a third candidate also?

273
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:21,009
No, no, Brother Thomas has withdrawn.

274
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,400
It seems he had a change of heart.

275
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,249
And why should I support you?

276
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,209
Well, because, if I may be so bold,

277
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,930
I wish to return Kingsbridge to its days of
glory when Prior Philip ruled.

278
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,610
And how would you do that?

279
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,650
By suppressing temptation.

280
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,360
I'll build a wall separating monks from nuns.

281
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,890
Whores will be hanged.
And virgins will have their heads covered.

282
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:48,729
Not all temptation is female.

283
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,009
No, but the source of it is, Mother Eve.

284
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,650
All power must reside with men,

285
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,799
and in Kingsbridge with holy men.

286
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,120
Like you?

287
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,529
Well...

288
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,249
You're even more of a cunt as an adult
than you were as a child.

289
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,489
Carlus may be blind, but he's not a prude.

290
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,330
My son, the Bishop,
will ratify no one but him.

291
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,450
You hear me, Richard?

292
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,330
Yes, father. Whatever you say.

293
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,769
Now if you will excuse me,

294
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,930
it's been a long day
and I must still recite my evening prayers.

295
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,850
-Goodnight, brother.
-Goodnight, William, Philippa.

296
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,049
Sleep well, Lady Margery.

297
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,969
You have much joy to look forward to.

298
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,680
On our wedding night.

299
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,650
The loving cup.

300
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,080
To us.

301
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,170
So remember, 55 paces down the aisle

302
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,819
and three steps up at the altar.

303
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,529
Are you certain
you don't want me to guide you tomorrow?

304
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,850
My blindness cannot be seen
as a hindrance, Brother Saul.

305
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,569
Not if I'm to be Prior.

306
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:10,600
So 55 paces to the altar
and then three steps up?

307
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,529
-Three.
-Three steps up.

308
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,219
-That's right. We're nearly there.
-Good.

309
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,640
And stop. The first one is the wooden one.

310
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:22,809
-Up.
-One. Two. Three.

311
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,009
Service. And...

312
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,489
One. Two. Three.

313
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,969
Good. Shall we count them on the way back?

314
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:35,170
Right.

315
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,130
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

316
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:43,930
Twenty-nine. 30. 31. 32. 33.

317
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,610
Yes?

318
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,890
Your Eminence,
I have something urgent to tell you.

319
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:46,330
Well, can't this wait till morning?
I'm in the middle of prayer.

320
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,170
I'm afraid it can't.

321
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,729
I'm here to say that I will be the next Prior.

322
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,289
Weren't you listening?
My father doesn't approve.

323
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,410
Goodnight, Brother.

324
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,650
Your father doesn't make the decision.

325
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:11,049
The monks elect. And you ratify.

326
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,690
You will support me, won't you, Bishop?

327
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,420
After your father's wedding tomorrow.

328
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,170
Thank you.

329
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,319
What did that blind idiot
think he was playing at?

330
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,890
He's turned our wedding
into a sacrilegious carnival.

331
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,090
-Calm yourself, dear.
-How can I calm myself?

332
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,610
I feel like my head was cracked,
not the statue's.

333
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,209
Yes, what is it?

334
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:42,690
Brother Carlus took his fall
as a sign from God, Father.

335
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,450
He's withdrawn his candidacy for Prior.

336
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,370
Which leaves us with who? Godwyn?

337
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,600
I've come to believe, Father,
that Godwyn may be our best choice.

338
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,170
Godwyn?

339
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,529
Christ on the cross.

340
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,009
Those in favour of Brother Godwyn.

341
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,930
I duly declare
that Brother Godwyn has been elected Prior.

342
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,049
So you've all had a chance
to see Elfric's designs.

343
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,890
This is Merthin's.

344
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,890
Elfric's will cost 295 pounds.

345
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,209
Merthin's comes in at 307.

346
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,930
But Merthin's is twice as wide,
which is what is needed.

347
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,009
I thought only Guild members
were allowed to speak.

348
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,890
Yeah, who should listen to their wives.

349
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:02,569
Or their ex-wives.

350
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,690
Yes, I have a question.

351
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:09,890
Both designs have piers whose foundations
are set in the river.

352
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:11,039
How will you build underwater?

353
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,450
Simple. Drop rubble into the river
until the pile is visible above water.

354
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,729
Build your pier on that.

355
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:20,360
And eventually the river will wash it away.
I'd build a cofferdam.

356
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,640
Cofferdam?

357
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,999
It's an Italian invention.

358
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,130
Two rings of wooden stakes,
one inside the other, driven into the riverbed.

359
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:29,090
And you pour mortar into the gap
between the rings,

360
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,319
making it water tight.

361
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,529
Then remove the water
to expose the riverbed

362
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,170
and build your mortared stone foundation.

363
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:36,559
Foreigners telling us how to build?

364
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,690
Whoever he listens to, I'll build it cheaper.

365
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,410
It'll be a matter of cost, surely!

366
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:43,890
Well, I'll charge for my workers,
but not for myself.

367
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,049
Instead, I'll accept a deed to the Leper Island.

368
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,410
Unless Elfric works for free,
he can't beat that.

369
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,209
Elfric?

370
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,489
-Merthin has my vote.
-And mine, too!

371
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,090
Seems clear to me. I vote for Merthin!

372
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,049
Congratulations. You deserve it.

373
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,249
Thank you, Edmund.

374
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,289
It's about time
Elfric had some competition in this town.

375
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,569
We'll have to work out a schedule
and a distribution of funds, but...

376
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:26,319
We can talk about that tomorrow.

377
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,890
-Evening, daughter.
-Father.

378
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:39,840
Thank you for supporting me.

379
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:42,650
I'm happy for you.

380
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,769
And are you happy?

381
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,330
What will it take to win you, Caris?

382
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,330
I know that you care for me as I care for you.

383
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,850
So what more is there?

384
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:07,170
Tell me.

385
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,239
Please.

386
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:12,650
How do I win you?

387
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,729
Feel my heart.

388
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,930
And know you already have me.

389
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:30,039
Merthin!

390
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,170
Merthin, there you are.

391
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,130
Come on!

392
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,249
We're gonna go to the inn to celebrate.
Come on!

393
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,850
Well done, boy!

394
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,529
My friends, a jewel toast firstly to Margery,

395
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,450
who through her beauty
can evoke a virility in a man

396
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,930
with half a century behind him.

397
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:17,809
And of course to our unborn child.

398
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,809
-Unborn child.
-Unborn child.

399
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,930
-Not too embarrassing?
-No.

400
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,580
There's a messenger, My Lord,
from Her Majesty the Queen.

401
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,769
What does she want?

402
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:37,809
She wants you, My Lord.

403
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,809
Therefore, until further notice,

404
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,729
all rates of taxation will be doubled.

405
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:54,930
Sir Roland? This troubles you?

406
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,729
No, Your Highness.

407
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,569
But I sense you are dismayed by this.
Please, enlighten your Queen.

408
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:07,730
We have embarked upon
an expensive rebuilding of our bridge.

409
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:11,770
And I fear that these new taxes will be trying.

410
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,410
Trying?

411
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,879
You think I should care about a bridge
when we have a war with France?

412
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,330
I do not defend a bridge built for vanity.

413
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:26,890
But in this case the very existence of
Kingsbridge depends upon it.

414
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,250
And the country's very existence
depends on this war!

415
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,129
Kingsbridge can wither and die for all I care.
I will have my taxes!

416
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,609
<i>Absolument, mon</i> Queen.

417
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,250
Father, why does Grandmother
hate Kingsbridge so much?

418
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,689
We can only guess.

419
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:50,330
Take as many men as you see fit.

420
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:53,960
Ride to Kingsbridge,
stop the bridge building immediately.

421
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,569
But it's not crown land, My Lord.

422
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,850
It belongs to the Priory. What's my authority?

423
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,450
Authority?

424
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,689
The Queen just ordered me
and now I'm ordering you.

425
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:08,210
Are you questioning my authority or hers?

426
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,730
-Are you clear?
-Yes.

427
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,649
Well, get on with it.

428
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,009
We need to build two cofferdams
between the shore

429
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,609
and this side of the island.

430
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,969
-One here. And one here.
-Will do, Merthin.

431
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,210
Greetings, brother.

432
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,969
What brings you back to Kingsbridge?

433
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:48,330
-Who's in charge here?
-Well, I am.

434
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:57,009
I've got orders from the Queen.
This work must stop.

435
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,450
That's enough! Go home!
There's no bridge to be built!

436
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,330
-Go home.
-By what right?

437
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,129
Ralph, you know this is Priory land.
This has no validity.

438
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:09,919
Don't make me repeat myself, brother.
These are the orders of our Queen.

439
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,930
Well, then I'll appeal.

440
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,930
The only court of appeal is Westminster,
under her son's jurisdiction.

441
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:19,850
Ralph, you know that this town
can't survive without a bridge.

442
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,410
That's enough! I said stop!
By order of the Queen!

443
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,129
Fuck the Queen.

444
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:28,850
-What did you say?
-Ralph.

445
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,129
I said, "Fuck the Queen." She's French.

446
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,810
-Ralph, no. Ralph, no.
-Why should I obey her?

447
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:39,040
I've got a family to feed!

448
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:40,689
She's a war to win.

449
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,969
-Your father would be ashamed.
-That's enough!

450
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,569
Fucking traitor.

451
00:36:58,379 --> 00:36:59,489
Ralph!

452
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:03,480
What's wrong with you?

453
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:08,290
You'd have your own brother
be called a traitor?

454
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,410
Whose side are you on?

455
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:14,609
Mine.

456
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,009
All of you, go home.

457
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,649
Quite right. You shouldn't...

458
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,330
The bridge has stopped.

459
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:55,129
Now there's a man
who knows how to take an order.

460
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,529
Wulfric! Wulfric!

461
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,450
Sir Roland has appointed
the new Lord of Wigleigh.

462
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,969
He'll hear your case tomorrow!

463
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:54,089
Thank you.

464
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,810
I'm your new Lord of Wigleigh.

465
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:07,890
You come before me, I'm told,
to appeal your inheritance.

466
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,040
Which is denied.

467
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,009
Next!

468
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,569
This is my land!

469
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,080
This is my family's land!

470
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:43,410
This is my land.

471
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:55,850
You can appeal.

472
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:58,399
To who?

473
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,689
Who's going to listen to me?

474
00:40:04,259 --> 00:40:05,569
She left me.

475
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,450
Annet.

476
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,649
No land, no wedding.

477
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,080
She didn't love you.

478
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,399
Yeah, well, I loved her!

479
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,609
Just go home, Gwenda.

480
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,450
It's all been a bloody waste.

481
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,210
My home is here now.

482
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:21,000
What's going on?

483
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,370
You took Wulfric's land away from him.
Give it back!

484
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:29,520
Fuck off.

485
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,100
-Are you his woman?
-Yes.

486
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,250
And you want me to give him his land?

487
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,250
Yes. That is what I want.

488
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,169
Then fuck me for it.

489
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,330
No. It's a sin.

490
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,129
Thirty acres for a quick fuck.
That's a good deal.

491
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,850
-Take off your dress.
-No.

492
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,730
Suit yourself.

493
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,759
Do you have a Bible?

494
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,239
Why?

495
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:24,410
Because I want you to swear.

496
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,370
If I do what you say,
you will give him his land.

497
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,569
I swear by this holy book.

498
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:38,569
I'll give Wulfric what he wants.

499
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,529
If you do the same for me.

500
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,810
Now strip.

501
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,810
How Richard is a bishop I do not know.
He disgusts me.

502
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,009
Stooping to such desires.

503
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:18,370
A bishop giving in to earthly desires?
How you shock me.

504
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,770
Fucking his own father's wife?
It's an abomination.

505
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:25,649
Did I mishear? Of whom are we talking?

506
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,169
Bishop Richard.

507
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,930
And who is he fucking?

508
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,009
Lady Margery. Roland's wife!

509
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,009
I doubt the child she's expecting is even his.

510
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,410
And Roland has no idea?

511
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,770
Oh, my God, Mother,
he'd kill her if he learned of it.

512
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:45,489
I imagine he would.

513
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,620
<i>My dear Earl Roland, I have
learnt some very distressing news.</i>

514
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,850
Wait!

515
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:16,200
Where's the deed to the land? Where is it?

516
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,600
The land has been forfeited.
I've given it to George Perkin.

517
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:21,609
You swore on the Bible you'd give it back!

518
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:23,730
No, I didn't.

519
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:25,689
You swore!

520
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,529
You swore!

521
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,450
You swore.

522
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,969
Good evening, My Lord.

523
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,770
Margery.

524
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,930
Come. Let me look at you.

525
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,649
So beautiful. And so ripe.

526
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,810
He will be a handsome child, My Lord.

527
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,839
You think he will look like me?

528
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,770
I'm sure of it.

529
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,529
And which of my sons
do you think he'll favour?

530
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,839
My Lord?

531
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:25,810
Richard, I would guess.

532
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,730
Don't you think?

533
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,810
Since he's the one you've been fucking.

534
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,129
My Lord, I would never...

535
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:40,210
Do you take me for a fool?

536
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:43,210
An old fool?

537
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,730
My Lord, who told you this?

538
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,770
I've scarcely looked at him.

539
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,330
I love you.

540
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,689
And I loved you, Margery.

541
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,890
With all my heart.

542
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,330
You fucking whore!

543
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:10,129
Come on. Come on!

544
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,689
I wouldn't! I love you!

545
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:14,370
Get out of my house.

546
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:16,930
Get out!

547
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:18,439
Come on!

548
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,600
Get out!

548
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:28,723
