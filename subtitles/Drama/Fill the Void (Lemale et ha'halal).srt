1
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,637
That's not him.

2
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,509
Mr. Shtreicher? It's Rivka Mendelman.
We can't find him.

3
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,740
Yes.

4
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,867
Thank you. All the best.

5
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,236
He's in the dairy section.

6
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:49,842
He looks just like his father.

7
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:04,633
You'll have to do a lot of laundry.
Doesn't he have a tissue?

8
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:15,432
Shira.

9
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,770
What do you say?

10
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,900
This is it, Esther. It's happening.

11
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:54,408
- When did you meet?
- We didn't, but I feel that he is the one.

12
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,769
I'm so excited. I want to scream.

13
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:00,739
- Screaming isn't modest, sweetie.
- I won't scream, I just feel like it.

14
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,205
Scream to God.

15
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,135
- Tell me what to say.
- When is the date?

16
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,535
Monday.

17
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,903
First of all, stay calm.

18
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:13,703
He shouldn't notice that you feel
like screaming. And second....

19
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:17,572
Esther....

20
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,305
Do you need anything?

21
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,070
Should I go get Yochay?

22
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,234
It's over.

23
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,103
Let's go home.

24
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:48,405
I recommend that you prepare
a list of topics.

25
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:50,236
If there's quiet...

26
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,878
...talk about the kindergarten
and he'll talk about the yeshiva.

27
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,842
Mother,
where are the keys to the safe?

28
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:06,077
- Let me know how much you're taking out.
- Three thousand.

29
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,141
- Hi, Dad!
- Happy Purim, sweetie.

30
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,970
Mom is in the living room.

31
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,005
Happy Purim!

32
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,575
There are so many people outside.

33
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,865
My darling.

34
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,033
Get ready. It's about to start.

35
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:36,768
Happy Purim, everyone.
Ten people will come in each time.

36
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,437
Happy Purim!

37
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,501
Happy Purim! How may I help?

38
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:20,569
I'm married with 10 children.
Four pairs of twins and two little boys.

39
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:25,136
- I'm starting to marry them off.
- Congratulations!

40
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,605
- Are they all healthy and well?
- Thank God.

41
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,709
How many boys and how many girls?

42
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,232
All boys.

43
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:43,635
I don't know how to do it.

44
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,833
Two children each year.

45
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,509
Next year, two more.

46
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,503
- Happy Purim.
- Thank you very much.

47
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,506
Thank you very much.

48
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,142
Happy Purim.

49
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:03,103
Cheers.

50
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,937
- I'm getting married.
- Congratulations.

51
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,904
Congratulations!

52
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:13,108
I'm an orphan, but I work
as a teacher in the heder.

53
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,640
I'd like to buy her some jewelry.

54
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,140
Gladly. Happy Purim.

55
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,603
Thank you.

56
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,242
Happy Purim.

57
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,000
- What's up?
- Hey, Frieda.

58
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,267
I've got some news.

59
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,942
I'm a bride.

60
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,607
I'm a bride.

61
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,504
I'm a bride, Shira.

62
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,506
- What?
- Yes.

63
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,576
- Who are you marrying?
- Yosef Goodman. From New York.

64
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:51,903
His father is the Rabbi's third cousin.

65
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,901
- I'm a bride.
- I can't believe it!

66
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,911
I told you, didn't I?
How long have you known?

67
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,669
They landed yesterday.
We met from 7:00 to 10:15.

68
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,308
What's he like?

69
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,898
I don't know.

70
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,703
- What do you mean?
- He's all right.

71
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:25,041
Mother, can you come out, please?

72
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:35,875
Frieda...

73
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,470
...may you be next.

74
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,965
Amen.

75
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,335
- I don't deserve you.
- Yochay.

76
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,835
- I don't say it enough.
- You say it every Purim.

77
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:57,466
Why do I say it only on Purim,
my wife?

78
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:01,739
- You are everything to me.
- Stop it, you're drunk.

79
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,932
You are my Torah.

80
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,606
I love you.

81
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:34,805
She's sick.

82
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,199
I didn't know that
when we got married.

83
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,966
What's wrong with her?

84
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,470
She's mentally ill.

85
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,201
May I have another drink?

86
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,536
It's too much to take.

87
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:07,839
I'm falling apart.

88
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,944
Redemption comes in the blink
of an eye. Happy Purim.

89
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,906
Mr. Shtreicher, happy Purim.
What can I do for you?

90
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:21,841
Cheers.

91
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,806
- Thank God....
- It's not enough.

92
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:33,241
Go to Goldberg, tell him I sent you.

93
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,474
Where were we?

94
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:49,434
We found a match for Frenkel's orphan
but there isn't a penny left.

95
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:51,466
It's shocking.

96
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:54,701
Whatever you could give
would be fantastic.

97
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:57,408
Happy Purim.

98
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,837
A word of wisdom?

99
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:07,272
How's Shira's match
with the Millers coming along?

100
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:10,036
Not now. We'll talk later.

101
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:13,367
Rabbi Aharon, never delay a match.

102
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:16,669
We'll talk. Happy Purim.

103
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:18,637
Cheers!

104
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,705
Close the window.

105
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,068
Esther?

106
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,975
Esther, are you all right?

107
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:09,333
Esther, can you hear me?
Answer me.

108
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,502
Esther, what's going on?

109
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,371
- What's wrong?
- Esther's not answering.

110
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,505
Esther?

111
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,968
- She's not answering?
- Esther!

112
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:31,836
Break the door!

113
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:36,601
She's not answering.

114
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:41,875
- She's unconscious!
- Call an ambulance!

115
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,305
- Aharon, is she breathing?
- Let me through!

116
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:46,841
- What's the number?
- 101 !

117
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,305
- Hold the door open.
- Dear Lord....

118
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,334
I need an ambulance....

119
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,999
My sister....
She's nine months pregnant....

120
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:20,578
May the Lord console you
within Zion and Jerusalem...

121
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,335
...and may you know no more sorrow.

122
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,975
Amen.

123
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,308
This is a temporary separation.

124
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,172
That's what consoled me
when my wife passed away.

125
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:17,702
You're a widower?

126
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,808
For nine years now.

127
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,177
May the Lord console you
within Zion and Jerusalem...

128
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,708
- ...and may you know no more sorrow.
- Amen.

129
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:52,871
<i>If I forget you
O Jerusalem</i>

130
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:59,372
<i>May my right hand forget her skill</i>

131
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:06,572
<i>If I forget you
O Jerusalem</i>

132
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,710
<i>Let my tongue cleave
To the foot of my mouth</i>

133
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:19,279
<i>If I do not exalt Jerusalem</i>

134
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:22,468
<i>Above my chief joy</i>

135
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:27,339
May the Lord console you
within Zion and Jerusalem...

136
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,033
...and may you know
no more sorrow.

137
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,476
Amen.

138
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,337
We have to hurry,
we've got an hour at the grave...

139
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,271
...and then the circumcision.

140
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:56,333
May the Lord console you.

141
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,134
Amen.

142
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:00,070
You too.

143
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:40,068
Hear, O Israel, the Lord is God,
the Lord is one!

144
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:50,037
The Lord is king,
the Lord shall reign forever.

145
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:59,943
Save us, Lord!

146
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:08,540
Give us strength, Lord!

147
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,474
Our God and God of our fathers...

148
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,543
...preserve this child for his father
and mother, his father...

149
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:19,074
...and his name in Israel shall be...

150
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,470
...Mordechay, son of Yochay.

151
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,303
May the father rejoice in his newborn.

152
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,807
May his mother in heaven be glad
with the fruit of her womb...

153
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,637
...as it is written:
May she who bore you rejoice.

154
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:36,937
As it is said: I passed by you
and saw you weltering in your blood...

155
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:42,478
...and I said to you:
You shall live through your blood.

156
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:47,706
May he grow up to Torah
and Hupa and good deeds.

157
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:51,939
How can I help?

158
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,667
How do I cope with the panic?

159
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,606
- What about Shira?
- Not now.

160
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,006
Never delay decisions in this matter.

161
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,700
Seal the deal now and have
the wedding in a year.

162
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:17,739
We'll give it some time.

163
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,176
It's Yochay's mother.

164
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:27,138
- How are you, Shira?
- Okay.

165
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,669
Welcome.

166
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:34,398
Good to see you.

167
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,167
Mordechay.

168
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:56,504
No, it's Grandma.

169
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,069
Mordechay.

170
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:09,339
- The child needs--
- Mordechay has everything he needs.

171
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,505
Rivka, how long will you wait?

172
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,176
A year?

173
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:20,674
It's not something you or I can decide.

174
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:23,365
It's Yochay's decision.

175
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,204
I can't believe Yochay's already
thinking of getting married.

176
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,601
It's sinking in...

177
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:32,538
...slowly.

178
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,635
Oh, God.

179
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,676
It's tearing me apart, Rivka.

180
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,508
They brought it up two weeks
after she died.

181
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,200
Then it was irrelevant...

182
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,343
...but now....

183
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,373
Who is she?

184
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:57,610
She was widowed six months ago.

185
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:00,038
She has two little children...

186
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:04,669
...and she speaks Hebrew.

187
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,900
Where is she from?

188
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,339
Belgium.

189
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,303
You're not taking the baby to Belgium.

190
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,136
I'm not doing anything.

191
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:23,037
I'm just suggesting it to Yochay.

192
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,937
He's the only one to decide.

193
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,301
You're killing me.

194
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,441
What do you want me to do?

195
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:38,509
God, have mercy.

196
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,109
You can't not offer it to Yochay.

197
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,574
Tell me what to do.

198
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,573
Have mercy.

199
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:01,802
Come in.

200
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:09,936
- How are you, Yochay?
- Tired.

201
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:11,836
Where's Mordechay?

202
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,009
In the yard with Shira.

203
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:23,102
Mr. Shtreicher...

204
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:25,173
...this is Rivka Mendelman.

205
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,267
Little by little.

206
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,642
Mr. Shtreicher,
please check something...

207
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,139
...regarding my daughter, Shira.

208
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,702
Yes?

209
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,135
Yes, Mr. Shtreicher? What is it?

210
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,435
The answer is no.

211
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,032
There's nothing to think about.

212
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,468
I can't talk right now.

213
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,603
Thank you anyway.

214
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:24,502
All the best.

215
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,968
Is everything okay?

216
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:50,109
Amen.

217
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:06,004
You're like a son to me.
I'll get right to the point.

218
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,938
How do you feel
about getting married?

219
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,901
I'm planning to, right now.

220
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:18,333
You're not a 19-year-old yeshiva boy.
Think about Mordechay.

221
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:20,965
It won't bother you if I get married?

222
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:24,838
The only things that matter
are you and the child.

223
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:32,669
I didn't get an interesting offer yet.

224
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:37,408
Why not Shira?

225
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,442
Is that your idea?

226
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,841
Where'd you come up with that?

227
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,009
It feels right.

228
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,569
- She's a baby.
- She's 18.

229
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:03,836
Who could be better for Mordechay?

230
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,168
It's not enough.

231
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:10,365
Is it better to marry a stranger--?

232
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,373
You are pressuring me.

233
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:23,636
- Does she know about this?
- Nobody knows about it.

234
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:27,901
My son is here.

235
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:31,567
- I have to feel comfortable coming here.
- Of course.

236
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:55,033
Enough, sweetie.

237
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,173
Congratulations.

238
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:55,801
What do you think?

239
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:57,908
Congratulations.

240
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:04,940
You can tell he's happy.

241
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:06,802
How can you tell?

242
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,833
What's with you?

243
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,508
Nothing.

244
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,809
Congratulations.

245
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:35,135
- May you get married next.
- Amen.

246
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,769
I'm so glad you came.

247
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,309
All the bachelors are stupid.

248
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:56,832
True.

249
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:02,305
How is it that none of them
has grabbed a diamond like you?

250
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,236
They don't think I'm a diamond.

251
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,966
Congratulations.

252
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,305
May you get married next.

253
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:25,637
You think I haven't got a life
because I'm not getting married?

254
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:29,303
I never got married.

255
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,301
Then why do you cover your hair?

256
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:38,208
The Rabbi said that this way
people won't ask questions.

257
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,243
Handsome boy!

258
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:29,142
- We have to decide now with Pinchas.
- Patience, Shira'le.

259
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:34,702
I've had it, Aunt. If we stall,
the Millers will move on.

260
00:32:34,908 --> 00:32:37,638
You're panicking.
Get ahold of yourself.

261
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:39,605
I don't have the patience to wait.

262
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,834
- You're marrying him soon.
- Amen.

263
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:47,808
I almost got married once.

264
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,600
To whom?

265
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:51,639
His name was Nachman.

266
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:55,743
He didn't mind my arms.
He himself dragged a leg.

267
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,875
- So what happened?
- I didn't like him.

268
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:10,069
Hello. Are your father or mother home?

269
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:13,744
- They're both here.
- Mr. Shtreicher, what brings you here?

270
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,841
- Is your husband here?
- He's on his way to synagogue.

271
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,737
- Mr. Shtreicher, I didn't have time to--
- Welcome.

272
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,965
Hello, Aharon.

273
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,607
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

274
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,166
The match with Shira....

275
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,843
Believe me, it'll sink in.

276
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:51,375
It's a madhouse. I don't want it.

277
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,505
May you have only good news.

278
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:08,842
I wouldn't consider this if I didn't
think they'd be good for each other.

279
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,271
It won't bring Esther back.

280
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:18,406
You think I don't know that?

281
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:20,542
Then let it go.

282
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:22,607
I can't.

283
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:25,642
It's crazy.

284
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,007
I really am losing my mind.

285
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:35,476
Lose your mind, I'm here.

286
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:41,204
It will be the end of me
if he moves to Belgium.

287
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:44,536
- But she doesn't want this.
- How do you know?

288
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,505
Isn't it obvious?

289
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:49,832
No.

290
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:58,369
I can't picture
an empty house right now.

291
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,975
We have to ask Shira.

292
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:02,972
Please.

293
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:05,143
It's pointless.

294
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:08,004
Shira, what's wrong with Yochay?

295
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,508
Shira, nobody is forcing you
to do anything. It's your decision.

296
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:15,234
You don't have to decide now.

297
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,205
- You can say no right now.
- No.

298
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,432
You're pushing her.

299
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:21,907
- Look at the girl for God's sake.
- Think about it for a moment.

300
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,699
He's Esther's husband, it's wrong.

301
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:27,706
We spoke to Yochay, he agreed.

302
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:33,143
Enough, I think we got the message.

303
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:38,140
Why aren't you marrying me off
to Pinchas Miller?

304
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:45,367
They called it off.

305
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:49,308
What?

306
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,976
They decided to call it off.

307
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:55,507
Why?

308
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:59,270
They are blind, Shira'le.
They don't know you.

309
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:26,407
Shira!

310
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:20,205
Where are you headed?

311
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:24,940
To the kindergarten.

312
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,303
Get in.

313
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:33,675
I was so sorry to hear
about your sister.

314
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:36,707
We were abroad when it happened.

315
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,603
How do you feel?

316
00:39:40,408 --> 00:39:42,808
How is your mother doing?

317
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,600
Not that great.

318
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,741
I'm so sorry.

319
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,636
I'm willing to meet with Yochay.

320
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:23,267
What for?

321
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:29,067
Maybe all this is happening
so that I marry him.

322
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:31,139
What is happening?

323
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:34,037
The Millers don't want me.

324
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,833
We are not pressuring you.

325
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:39,636
Yochay is a good man,
but it's your decision.

326
00:41:39,841 --> 00:41:41,832
I know, it's just....

327
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,509
I won't make a decision now.

328
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:50,471
No problem. We'll arrange it.

329
00:43:02,974 --> 00:43:08,173
Esther once told me that if anything
happens to her, I should marry Yochay.

330
00:44:42,908 --> 00:44:45,138
I don't know how to begin.

331
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:01,801
I think it's best if we're honest.

332
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:05,007
What's confusing you?

333
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,005
I'm not confused.

334
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,473
Okay.

335
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:18,672
How's that possible?

336
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:22,333
I don't know.

337
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:25,375
Does it scare you to be confused?

338
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:27,576
Doesn't it scare you?

339
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,434
It made me realize something.

340
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:39,337
What?

341
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:53,836
That we can get married.

342
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,375
I'm Esther's little sister.

343
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,601
You're not so little anymore.

344
00:46:32,508 --> 00:46:34,373
You're pretty.

345
00:46:35,808 --> 00:46:37,173
What?

346
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,635
Why do you say that?

347
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:50,944
What, that you're pretty
or that you're not so little?

348
00:47:13,475 --> 00:47:15,773
Is that a good enough reason?

349
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:23,135
You want more reasons?

350
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,706
Okay.

351
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:31,603
I think you'll be a great mother
to Mordechay.

352
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:51,505
I don't know how I know this,
but I know we'll be good together.

353
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:09,266
But Esther would have wanted you
to marry Frieda.

354
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:26,710
Esther would have wanted me
to marry Frieda?

355
00:48:27,642 --> 00:48:29,337
Yes.

356
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:39,072
Says who?

357
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:40,265
Esther.

358
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:45,300
- That's what Esther--
- Esther is gone.

359
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:57,335
Why did you let me say
all the things I said?

360
00:49:00,008 --> 00:49:03,808
I don't know. I didn't mean to.

361
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:07,273
- I should have known--
- You're so cruel.

362
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,667
Out of respect, you tell your parents
it won't work out.

363
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,570
What happened?

364
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,601
He wants to marry me.

365
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,275
What did you tell him?

366
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:22,333
That Frieda is more suitable for him.

367
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:26,769
That Frieda is more suitable?

368
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:39,377
You sat here and told him
that Frieda is more suitable?

369
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,468
Why did you say that?

370
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,935
This is unheard of.

371
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,506
Would you please pour me
a glass of water?

372
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:17,735
How dare you, Aunt?

373
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,799
How dare you put Shira
in this situation?

374
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:25,104
The girl sat with him and played
matchmaker. It's unheard of.

375
00:51:25,275 --> 00:51:28,608
Do you have any idea how hurt
Yochay felt? How dare you?

376
00:51:28,774 --> 00:51:32,335
- But she doesn't want to marry him.
- You have no right to interfere!

377
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:35,807
Listen. Aside from having
the baby near you...

378
00:51:35,974 --> 00:51:38,465
...what other reason
do you have for this match?

379
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:40,734
- Yochay is a wonderful man.
- He's older.

380
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:44,105
He's bringing a baby with him.
Shira is just a child.

381
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:46,674
You have crossed all the lines.

382
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:50,503
Let her marry someone her own age,
to grow up with her husband.

383
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:52,973
You leave Shira alone, you hear me?

384
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:55,370
Stay away from her.

385
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:57,169
What if I won't?

386
00:52:02,408 --> 00:52:07,277
I don't want to say things I'll regret.

387
00:52:36,874 --> 00:52:39,138
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

388
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:42,766
I want to go to the Rabbi's gathering,
can I leave Mordechay here?

389
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:44,670
Of course, but first come in.

390
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:47,071
- I'll be late--
- I said, come in.

391
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:01,999
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

392
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,772
I'm on my way to the gathering,
I brought Mordechay.

393
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:10,908
I'll join you.

394
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:13,736
- Shira, get him a plate.
- I already ate.

395
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,876
- Some dessert?
- No, thanks.

396
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:16,775
Aharon should be here any minute.

397
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,869
What is it you wanted
to talk to us about?

398
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:34,008
I understand you know about
the offer from Belgium.

399
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:35,731
I do.

400
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:42,402
We're going to Belgium.

401
00:54:52,008 --> 00:54:56,138
- Have you met the woman?
- I've known her since childhood.

402
00:54:58,774 --> 00:55:00,401
What's she like?

403
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:05,272
I can't remember.

404
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:24,341
Marry Frieda.

405
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:29,908
- I can't.
- Why not?

406
00:55:32,908 --> 00:55:34,671
I don't know.

407
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:41,876
Tell me, how am I going to survive this?

408
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,473
Only with a miracle.

409
00:55:51,475 --> 00:55:54,876
What a terrible tragedy
has happened to us, Yochay.

410
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:04,303
Pray for me to have
the strength to survive this.

411
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,434
I'm sorry.

412
00:57:00,575 --> 00:57:01,974
About what?

413
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:08,106
About what happened.

414
00:57:09,508 --> 00:57:12,705
I know what happened to me,
but tell me what happened to you.

415
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:18,639
I hurt you.

416
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,104
Very much.

417
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,805
And you, Shira?

418
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:31,771
Nothing.

419
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:37,141
Are you sure?

420
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:43,965
You're too close.

421
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:54,936
I could have been closer.

422
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:22,442
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

423
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:30,077
Mom, what happened?

424
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,109
That's it.

425
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:34,969
They're moving to Belgium.

426
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:37,905
- It can't be.
- Is it cold in here?

427
00:58:38,075 --> 00:58:40,100
- No.
- Give me the sweater.

428
00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:46,337
He can't go.

429
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:48,476
He has no choice.

430
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:03,703
I'll marry him.

431
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,171
- Enough, Shira.
- I'm serious!

432
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,138
- Enough.
- I'm serious!

433
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:09,365
Enough.

434
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:10,941
- I'll marry him.
- Enough.

435
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:13,575
- How many times must I say it?
- Come in.

436
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:22,434
Everything okay?

437
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,610
Have a seat, Frieda.

438
00:59:24,808 --> 00:59:27,368
- We have to go to the doctor.
- Sit, Frieda.

439
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,177
It's time to put the cards on the table.

440
00:59:42,974 --> 00:59:45,374
You can never know
what tomorrow will bring...

441
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:48,807
...and we've been putting
this matter off for too long.

442
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:54,044
We all know that this
is a great opportunity for all sides...

443
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:56,470
...if Frieda marries Yochay.

444
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,772
Frieda is too close to Esther.

445
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:02,374
Yochay said it himself,
I suggested it myself.

446
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,635
Shira is closer.

447
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:07,935
What are you doing, Aunt?
Have you no mercy?

448
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:10,132
Good manners
don't get you married.

449
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:12,276
Yochay and Frieda
have to get married!

450
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,499
- Says who?
- Says me!

451
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:15,608
But he doesn't want her!

452
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,599
Frieda.

453
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,102
- Frieda, wait!
- Leave me alone!

454
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:34,709
I can't stand the humiliation
anymore, I'm only human.

455
01:00:34,874 --> 01:00:36,842
You're right, you don't deserve this.

456
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,236
So respect my wishes
and leave me alone.

457
01:00:54,175 --> 01:00:56,700
What's up?

458
01:00:56,941 --> 01:00:59,000
Father and Yochay are meeting.

459
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:34,804
Shira'le, sit over there.

460
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:58,936
In memory of Esther Goldberg

461
01:02:26,774 --> 01:02:29,299
Why do you want to marry me?

462
01:02:30,908 --> 01:02:33,536
For the same reasons you're willing to.

463
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:39,435
Do you want to ask me anything?

464
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:42,305
I can't think of anything.

465
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:54,834
Maybe you would like to ask me?

466
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:01,272
Why do you want to marry me?

467
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:04,239
- I already said why.
- You said nothing.

468
01:03:04,774 --> 01:03:07,208
What do you want me to say?

469
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,876
Whatever comes to your mind.

470
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:17,435
It's the right thing to do.

471
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:21,567
Like you said, I will be
a good mother to Mordechay.

472
01:03:21,741 --> 01:03:24,904
- I don't believe you.
- What's not to believe?

473
01:03:26,408 --> 01:03:28,968
Mom could be by his side.

474
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,335
Stop disappearing.

475
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:41,001
How old were you
when you married Esther?

476
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:43,004
Twenty-two.

477
01:03:48,141 --> 01:03:49,938
Was it pleasant?

478
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:53,035
When everything was new?

479
01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:58,269
Were you excited to marry the most
beautiful woman in the world?

480
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,702
Answer me.

481
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:12,433
How wonderful was it
to get married for the first time?

482
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:22,041
Because I'm giving that up.

483
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:30,706
And how is your wife?

484
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:33,569
It's tough but she is strong.

485
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:37,769
There's only one consolation...

486
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:41,432
...in times of such agony...

487
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:44,042
...we feel the Almighty much closer.

488
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:47,108
- May the Lord give us strength.
- Amen.

489
01:04:49,941 --> 01:04:53,138
May the Rabbi excuse me,
but the old lady is here again.

490
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:56,037
She insists upon
seeing the Rabbi right now.

491
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:59,608
The lady will have to wait.
I will see her shortly.

492
01:05:03,674 --> 01:05:05,835
- How are you, Yochay?
- Bless the Lord.

493
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,100
And Mordechay?

494
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:09,502
A healthy baby.

495
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:16,639
What is the matter, Aharon?

496
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:21,238
Yochay and my daughter Shira
would like to be married.

497
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:27,570
The old lady is screaming.

498
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:31,335
Send her in.

499
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,606
How can I help you?

500
01:05:38,808 --> 01:05:41,470
Perhaps you can help me, Rabbi.

501
01:05:41,674 --> 01:05:45,610
Nobody wants to help me,
not even the synagogue manager.

502
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:50,006
I need to buy a new oven
and I don't know what to buy.

503
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:54,137
Doesn't the lady have
anyone to help her?

504
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:55,603
No.

505
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:00,242
No children, neighbors?

506
01:06:00,974 --> 01:06:02,942
No one.

507
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:06,672
It has five flames...

508
01:06:06,874 --> 01:06:10,469
...and two separate compartments.

509
01:06:11,508 --> 01:06:14,033
The lady can see for herself.

510
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:18,842
Isn't it a little too low?

511
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:22,602
Low? You think it's too low?

512
01:06:23,641 --> 01:06:26,474
My old oven was higher than this.

513
01:06:26,674 --> 01:06:29,370
Maybe it can be made higher.

514
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,903
It seems low.

515
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:52,237
How does the girl feel
about this match?

516
01:06:58,874 --> 01:07:01,342
It is not a matter of feelings.

517
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:06,310
It is only a matter of feelings.

518
01:07:11,408 --> 01:07:15,310
A deed must be done, and I want
to do it to everyone's satisfaction.

519
01:07:20,808 --> 01:07:22,639
Oh, Shira'le....

520
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,372
Shira'le, Shira'le.

521
01:07:38,508 --> 01:07:41,170
Rabbi Nachman of Breslev says...

522
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:47,044
...that blessed be he who says
one word of truth to the Almighty...

523
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:48,936
...his entire life.

524
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:15,768
Enough already.

525
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:15,033
I haven't got the strength, Father.

526
01:09:15,275 --> 01:09:17,573
Give me the strength to get up.

527
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:21,268
I can't go on like this.

528
01:09:21,475 --> 01:09:25,036
I can't do this by myself.
You must help me get up.

529
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:30,106
Stop me from feeling, Father.

530
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:32,902
I can't handle this pain, I'm bursting.

531
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:34,804
Have mercy on me.

532
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:38,034
Let me get up. Give me strength.

533
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:40,709
Give me strength.

534
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:44,166
Give me strength.

535
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:47,567
Give me strength.

536
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:03,908
Help me.

537
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,976
I can't go on like this, alone.

538
01:10:07,175 --> 01:10:09,370
Come here.

539
01:10:26,475 --> 01:10:28,773
I'm not mad at you, Shira.

540
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:33,936
It doesn't feel that way.

541
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,505
You're right.

542
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:51,671
Tell me what to do.

543
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:57,439
You don't have to do a thing.

544
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:15,805
- Frieda's getting married!
- What?

545
01:11:16,008 --> 01:11:17,942
Frieda's getting married!

546
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,267
What is going on?

547
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,466
- Frieda's getting married!
- To whom?

548
01:11:21,674 --> 01:11:24,040
- You'll never believe this.
- What?

549
01:11:24,275 --> 01:11:26,266
You'll never believe this.

550
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:31,374
Who's the groom?

551
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:33,803
Mr. Shtreicher.

552
01:11:34,008 --> 01:11:35,737
How did that happen?

553
01:11:35,908 --> 01:11:37,967
Come, they're getting engaged
right now.

554
01:11:38,508 --> 01:11:40,772
Mr. Shtreicher?

555
01:11:40,974 --> 01:11:43,636
Congratulations!

556
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:20,932
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

557
01:12:21,874 --> 01:12:23,341
Is this real?

558
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:25,476
As real as it can get.

559
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,574
I can't believe this is happening.

560
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:41,909
So you play the accordion?

561
01:12:42,141 --> 01:12:44,109
Yes.

562
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:46,503
Why the accordion?

563
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,142
It was my grandmother's.

564
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:51,809
Do you like it?

565
01:12:52,008 --> 01:12:54,704
I can't play any other instrument.

566
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:59,665
I have no rhythm.

567
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:03,338
Sorry.

568
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:05,703
What kind of a girl are you looking for?

569
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:09,973
Someone like me, energetic,
someone who manages things.

570
01:13:10,175 --> 01:13:13,474
- Someone who can run things.
- Sorry.

571
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,439
What kind of home
do you want to have?

572
01:13:26,141 --> 01:13:27,836
A real home.

573
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:35,135
I don't want to lie.

574
01:13:43,341 --> 01:13:45,707
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

575
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,109
Good night. Good luck.

576
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:06,375
If only I were able to read the signs.

577
01:15:07,741 --> 01:15:13,145
I can't understand
what they're trying to tell me.

578
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:21,471
You're drunk.

579
01:15:26,874 --> 01:15:28,967
What do you want, Shira?

580
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,401
You should know
that the Lord loves you.

581
01:16:04,874 --> 01:16:06,808
It doesn't feel that way.

582
01:16:08,075 --> 01:16:10,942
- That's not like you.
- What's not like me?

583
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:16,938
Self-pity.

584
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:27,306
- Go to sleep, little girl.
- I'm not a little girl.

585
01:16:27,508 --> 01:16:28,975
Prove it.

586
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:33,375
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

587
01:16:34,108 --> 01:16:36,008
- Something real.
- I have nothing to--

588
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,767
- You don't want to say it.
- I don't know what--

589
01:16:37,974 --> 01:16:39,032
What are you so afraid of?

590
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,232
- Nothing.
- Yes, you are.

591
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:41,466
- Am not.
- You are.

592
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:43,905
- You can't tell me--
- Enough already, say it!

593
01:16:44,075 --> 01:16:46,976
- I'm afraid of dying.
- Why would you die?

594
01:16:47,175 --> 01:16:49,143
Because I'm evil.

595
01:16:51,008 --> 01:16:52,498
Shira....

596
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,300
You don't know me.

597
01:16:54,508 --> 01:16:56,169
Look at me.

598
01:16:58,508 --> 01:17:00,373
You are not.

599
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:38,004
Shira, daughter of
Rivka Mendelman

600
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:46,239
Miss Mendelman,
what can we do for you?

601
01:17:47,808 --> 01:17:50,777
Can you pass a note to the Rabbi?

602
01:17:50,974 --> 01:17:52,703
If you hurry up.

603
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,342
I have to go to the evening service.

604
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:41,671
- Hello, Yochay.
- I'll be back later.

605
01:18:43,141 --> 01:18:45,473
- Rabbi.
- Hello, Yochay.

606
01:18:45,674 --> 01:18:48,040
- How are you?
- Bless the Lord.

607
01:18:50,974 --> 01:18:53,101
Come in. Aharon?

608
01:18:54,008 --> 01:18:56,772
Come in. Aharon!

609
01:18:56,974 --> 01:18:59,966
- Rabbi.
- Hello, Aharon. How are you?

610
01:19:00,175 --> 01:19:02,837
Fine, and you? Come in.

611
01:19:03,008 --> 01:19:04,771
You too, come on.

612
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,941
Congratulations!

613
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:09,669
Congratulations!

614
01:21:23,408 --> 01:21:24,568
Congratulations!

615
01:21:24,741 --> 01:21:31,738
<i>If I forget you
O Jerusalem</i>

616
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:37,305
<i>May my right hand forget her skill</i>

617
01:21:37,508 --> 01:21:44,505
<i>If I forget you
O Jerusalem</i>

618
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:51,006
<i>Let my tongue cleave
To the roof of my mouth</i>

619
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,605
Congratulations, Shira.

620
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:56,139
Congratulations.

621
01:21:57,075 --> 01:21:59,339
You look so beautiful.

622
01:22:03,308 --> 01:22:04,969
Bless me.

623
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:30,675
We'll be happy.

624
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:12,137
Did I tell you today that I love you?

625
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:13,933
My beautiful girl.

626
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:30,565
My sweetheart.
