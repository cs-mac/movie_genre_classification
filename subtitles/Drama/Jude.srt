1
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:15,360
Come on. Come get some bread.

2
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:17,856
Don't you want any?

3
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,380
Come on.

4
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:30,861
Come on.

5
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,485
Here you go.

6
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:41,985
Go on. Here you go.

7
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:46,934
So! You've been giving them
permission to eat, have you?

8
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,290
My seed, eh?!

9
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,461
You've gone up in the world.
Is that it?

10
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:58,345
Is that what you think?
I'll give you something to think about!

11
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:02,310
Now, get out with you!

12
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:51,556
You've only been gone an hour.

13
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,689
- What's he done?
- Nothing.

14
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,501
Did he hit you?

15
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,803
Shame on you for letting him.
His father was my father's journeyman.

16
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,109
Keep in.

17
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,424
Mr Fawley!

18
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:46,855
- Should I take this off?
- For five seconds.

19
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,016
Right, stay still everyone.

20
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,526
Come on, if you're coming, then.

21
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:24,333
- Have you finished your work?
- Yeah.

22
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,127
Good boy.

23
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,677
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.

24
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:49,039
You look sad, Jude. Are
you sorry I'm going?

25
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,589
- Yeah.
- So am I.

26
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:58,555
- Where are you going, sir?
- Christminster.

27
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,349
Why do you have to go?

28
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,814
Do you know what a university is?
A university degree?

29
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,792
Do you see it, over there?

30
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,631
That's Christminster.

31
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:24,472
If you want to do anything in life, Jude,
that's where you have to go.

32
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,979
even if it means giving up
everything else for a while.

33
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,528
You have to read your books
while your friends are out playing.

34
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,536
Get out of bed early in
the morning when it's freezing cold.

35
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:44,754
Study every chance you get.
One day it'll all pay off, I promise you.

36
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,347
Once you're there,
everything's open to you.

37
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,180
You can become anything you want.

38
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:54,177
You can choose your future.

39
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,749
- Dinner!
- Come on.

40
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,127
Hurry up, Jude.

41
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,701
- Staying to eat with us today, Jude? - No.
- Thank you.

42
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,864
Look at that Jude. Have a piece
of this cheese, you'll love it.

43
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:36,700
- Who've you got waiting then?  Chip off
the old block, eh? Is she a looker?

44
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,172
(Reading in Ancient Greek)

45
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,469
"Swiftly she rose
from the grey sea like a mist."

46
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:10,103
"My child, why do you weep?"

47
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,517
Here's the poet.

48
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,068
- Thank you very much.
- I didn't throw it.

49
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,411
Nor me. I didn't throw it, I tell you.
I don't even like the look of him.

50
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,623
- None of you threw it.
- What's wrong with him?

51
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:53,096
- I think he's quite nice.
- He's all right. He's just standing there.

52
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:58,605
- Oh, look. You've scared him off now.
- He's shy.

53
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,731
I bet you think I threw it.

54
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,109
No.

55
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,863
Well I did.

56
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,910
But don't tell anyone.

57
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:14,749
My name's Arabella.

58
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,912
My father's a pig breeder.

59
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:20,132
We were washing innards
for black pudding.

60
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:26,434
- What?
- Nothing.

61
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:32,403
I don't work Sundays. You can see me then.

62
00:09:55,357 --> 00:10:00,322
- Did you catch anything?  - No. I
should've thrown something else at him.

63
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:15,634
(Reading in Latin)

64
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,082
- Now all you do is read?
- Yes.

65
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,335
Nothing else?

66
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:38,886
- What do you read?
- Latin, some Greek.

67
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:42,417
I've read two books of
the Iliad, Thucydides, Hesiod,

68
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,320
some of the Greek testament.
- Hoity-toity!

69
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,778
Well I need to to if I'm gonna
get into Christminster.

70
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,656
Christminster?

71
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,995
Yes. I'm going to be a scholar.

72
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:59,294
- Maybe even a professor one day.
- My, my.

73
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:03,801
- Have you ever seen me climb a tree?
- No.

74
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,140
I've got something to show you, Jude.

75
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:48,691
Where are you?

76
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,458
Get up, Abby.

77
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:01,052
Why?

78
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:02,772
I want to kiss you.

79
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,151
Kiss me like this.

80
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:11,287
Be careful I'm hatching an egg.

81
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,839
I carry it with me everywhere.
It'll hatch in three days.

82
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,021
Why do you do that?

83
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:31,560
It's natural for a woman
to bring a live thing into the world.

84
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,695
Jude?

85
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,744
Yes.

86
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:30,890
It's late.

87
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:57,242
To the bride and the groom!

88
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,925
We'll send that to Aunt Drusilla.

89
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,971
Aunt Drusilla.

90
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,580
- What should we call her?
- Rosie's pig.

91
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,501
- What about Jemima Spot?
- Do you like that?

92
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:05,569
It isn't your own?

93
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,281
So?

94
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,077
What?

95
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,251
- You've got enough of your own.
- It's very fashionable in London.

96
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,630
Do you care what
people think in London?

97
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,593
Don't you like it?

98
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,430
- No.
- Then I won't wear it.

99
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,989
Leave it on.

100
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:42,756
I want to see us. You can close your eyes
if you like and pretend it's dark.

101
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,392
Jude.

102
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,441
Ask me nicely.

103
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:59,073
- Ask you what?
- What you want me to do.

104
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,577
- I don't know.
- What?!

105
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,042
We'll just have to make it up.

106
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:56,082
He's never going to get here.

107
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:00,256
He's probably bloody drunk.

108
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,854
We'll just have to do it ourselves.

109
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:19,538
- Be careful with those.
- Then find somewhere else for them.

110
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,958
This table is for the lard.

111
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,370
Right, move her.

112
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,389
- Where do you want it?
- On this side.

113
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:17,841
Thank God it's dead.

114
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,599
What's God got to do with pig killing?

115
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:27,812
It's a bit late to be looking
 at other women.

116
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,553
I won't feel sorry for you.

117
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,560
You should have listened to me.
Fawleys are not cut out for marriage.

118
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,776
- I didn't have a choice.
- You had no brains.

119
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:50,492
- She's five months gone and not even a bump.
- Please don't say that.

120
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,050
Shall I get your room ready?

121
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:06,267
No, I'd better go.

122
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:09,119
(ARABELLA) "Dear Jude, I've decided
to leave, and I won't be back.

123
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:11,539
"I know you think
I tricked you into marrying me,

124
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,046
"but I swear
I really believed I was pregnant.

125
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:18,050
"I'm going to Australia to start again.

126
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,847
"Perhaps now you'll be free
to go to Christminster

127
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,183
"and become a university man.

128
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,396
"Good luck."

129
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,496
 Can I help you?

130
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:30,682
.. then there's your back-to- back houses,

131
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:34,273
your grubby children
hanging off scaffolding.

132
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:37,319
It's the same city.

133
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:42,202
Maybe a five-minute walk
from Church Street to "Scum Street".

134
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:45,754
Why don't we go over?

135
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:49,756
Why don't we go over and
knock on their doors?

136
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:57,811
Because they've convinced us this is
the way it is. No change. Why change?

137
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,606
They've won the argument.

138
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:05,156
They educate their kind
to win the argument.

139
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:17,385
I'm looking for Jude Fawley.
I believe he works here.

140
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:20,764
- You'll find him around the corner, miss.
- Thank you.

141
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:35,873
Jude Fawley? I'm your
cousin, Sue Bridehead.

142
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:38,460
Aunt Drusilla wrote and told me
you were in Christminster.

143
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,804
- Hello.
- Hello.

144
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:49,561
Don't take this wrongly,
you don't look like cousins to me.

145
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:50,932
Why is that?

146
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,652
Because you're pretty and fine,
and Jude he's got a stone for a face.

147
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:58,326
- A big nose is a sign of nobility.
- Shut up Tinker.

148
00:24:58,576 --> 00:25:01,067
They have the same noses...

149
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:03,018
...look at them.

150
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,047
One each, right in the middle
of their faces.

151
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,971
- Tell me some more about my cousin.
- He's a scholar, a true scholar.

152
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:13,558
- He's a sinner.
- Why is that?

153
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,355
- What was the last one called?
- Oh, you mean Vicky.

154
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:20,153
- No, Florence,
- The one before Elspeth.

155
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:24,911
- Mm...nice, isn't it?
- Oh, lovely.

156
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:29,209
Nothing up the sleeve, right?

157
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:41,446
Oh, yes! Now, that is good, that is good.

158
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:30,025
Jude. Jude!

159
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:32,563
Jude!

160
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,071
Not there, it's bad luck.
They used to burn martyrs there.

161
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,888
- Are you superstitious, Jude?
- No.

162
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:52,010
Nor am I, but I think
it's better to be safe, don't you?

163
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,014
- Where are we going?

164
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,604
Somewhere living, away
from this university.

165
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:01,544
- But it's wonderful here.
- It's all stone.

166
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:04,686
You're talking about the buildings,
I'm talking about the scholars.

167
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,710
I was talking about the scholars, too.

168
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,195
Finish it.

169
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:46,091
- How much are these two, please?
- Ten shillings.

170
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:50,448
- You're not going to buy them?
- Why not?

171
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:55,456
- Would you like me to wrap them up?
- No, thank you.

172
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:02,375
Why have you wrapped them up?

173
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,790
Because I don't want to give my
landlady an unecessary heart attack.

174
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,920
You're being rather confrontational

175
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,825
No, I was just wondering why
you bother going to church at all.

176
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:15,939
Because a part of me is still
a superstitious, backward country girl.

177
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,345
You mean, like me?

178
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,869
I didn't know you were a girl.

179
00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:40,269
Do I irritate you?

180
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:42,908
No.

181
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:48,701
even when I'm trying to prove
how much cleverer than you I am?

182
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,329
You are.

183
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,419
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

184
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:59,426
Because it's not the sort of thing
you should admit to.

185
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:01,721
Why not, if it's true?

186
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:26,193
Say something.

187
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:28,976
I enjoy listening to you.

188
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:32,089
Catullus.

189
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,089
(Reading in Latin)

190
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:55,727
"God, like the man who sits at her side

191
00:29:55,978 --> 00:30:02,322
"Who watches and catches the laughter
which softly tears me to tatters

192
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:09,250
"Nothing is left of me
each time I see her."

193
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:33,406
Beautiful

194
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,230
What does the law say
about marrying your cousin?

195
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:51,117
It's not about that. Says nothing
about falling in love with them.

196
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,439
- Is that so?
- Quite common, I hear.

197
00:30:54,692 --> 00:31:00,366
- What do you think, Jude?
- You two are cousins, you tell me.

198
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:14,389
- Sue?
- How do you know?

199
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:20,984
- You've got a woman's hands.
- You'll have to do better than that.

200
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,708
- "Pruples" doesn't count.
- You've been following me?

201
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,463
I came to say goodbye.

202
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:37,554
Aren't you going to
introduce me to your friend?

203
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,129
It's Wilkes.

204
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,868
How do you do, Mr Wilkes?

205
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,653
Why are you leaving?

206
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:48,677
I had a row with my landlady.

207
00:31:48,904 --> 00:31:51,810
She found one of my statues
and threw it on the floor...

208
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,748
and stamped on it and ground
the head to pieces with her heel.

209
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,708
She made sure I lost my job as well

210
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:00,373
Where will you go?

211
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:03,929
I don't know. I'm going
to teach somewhere.

212
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:09,104
- You can teach here in Christminster.
- Everyone in this city is a teacher, Jude.

213
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:12,708
I've got a friend who can help.
Mr Phillotson.

214
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,904
I was his pupil in Marygreen.

215
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:17,367
Don't worry about me.

216
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:20,080
I was going to look him up, anyway.
There's no harm in asking.

217
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,918
Why do you want me to stay?

218
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,756
Because we've only just met.

219
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:40,865
Yes?

220
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,410
- Mr Phillotson?
- Yes.

221
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,668
My name is Jude Fawley.
I was your pupil in Marygreen.

222
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:52,131
Yes, of course you were.

223
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,776
- Are you an old pupil too?
- No, this is my cousin, Sue Bridehead.

224
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,903
Hello.

225
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,099
Mr Phillotson, you once
showed me Christminster,

226
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,620
the same day you left Marygreen.

227
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:08,742
I came here because of you, sir,
to become a university man.

228
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:10,796
Through here.

229
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:14,794
I gave up the idea of
university a long time ago.

230
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:19,718
Other dreams have replaced it.
I'm very happy as a schoolmaster.

231
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:25,845
Here we are.

232
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:32,864
Sue's been looking for work as a teacher.

233
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,655
You've already had some
experience haven't you?

234
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:38,079
No.

235
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:41,044
Is it very hard to find work?

236
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:43,551
I'm thinking of applying
to a training college.

237
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:44,800
That's always a good idea.

238
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:48,181
What I need for this school
is a second-year transfer.

239
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,128
- What about an apprentice?
- Jude!

240
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:55,073
Are you serious about
being a teacher, Sue?

241
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:56,444
Yes, of course.

242
00:33:56,694 --> 00:33:59,833
I'm sure it will be useful
for both of you.

243
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:04,292
- I can't afford to pay you very much.
- That doesn't matter.

244
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,038
All right, then.

245
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,553
(PHILLOTSON) One times seven?
(PUPILS) Seven.

246
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:14,474
- Two times seven?
- 14.

247
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:17,646
- Three times seven?
- 21.

248
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:20,985
- Four times seven?
- 28.

249
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,831
- Bye, Miss.
- Bye.

250
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:36,240
Mount of Olives.

251
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,264
Mount Moriah.

252
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,309
The Valley of Jehoshaphat.

253
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:44,397
The City of Zion.

254
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:50,031
Calvary. All names
at the very root of our history.

255
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:53,512
You see this is an exact model
of the City of Jerusalem...

256
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:56,710
as it was at the time of
our Lord, Jesus Christ.

257
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:00,966
And they took Jesus through
these hot, dusty, narrow streets...

258
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:04,840
Doesn't anyone know what Jerusalem looked like
at the time of Christ? I'm sure that man doesn't.

259
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:08,646
Of course he does. The model is copied
from the best conjectural maps.

260
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:11,900
Why Jerusalem?
Why not Athens or Rome or Alexandria?

261
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,218
Because of what Jerusalem
means to us as Christians.

262
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:17,842
Surely you must see that?

263
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:23,587
- Why are you so sceptical?
- I'm not, I was just pointing out that...

264
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:25,131
Jude!

265
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,220
- What a surprise!
- No, it isn't. You knew I'd be here.

266
00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:32,268
- You've been watching me all the time.
- Mr Phillotson.

267
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:36,565
Jude. Your cousin is such a clever girl
she criticises all this unmercifully.

268
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:40,397
Please don't call me a clever girl,
Mr Phillotson. There are too many
of us about these days.

269
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,979
- I didn't mean anything, Sue.
- I know you didn't.

270
00:35:43,003 --> 00:35:45,503
Come on, Jude, I think
we've had enough of Jerusalem.

271
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:52,592
This accusation, written:
"This is Jesus, the king of the Jews."

272
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:57,893
- He wanted to impress you.
- Not a very clever way to go about it.

273
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,647
He can't be clever. He's fond of you.

274
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,254
Well, I'm fond of him, too.

275
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:04,819
It doesn't mean I go
around patronising him.

276
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,751
I don't feel at all guilty.

277
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,334
(Reading Ancient Greek)

278
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,857
"Tell me, Muse, a man, many ways

279
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:33,909
"who wandered far and wide
after he sacked the holy city of Troy."

280
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:42,507
- Will you kiss it for luck?
- No.

281
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:55,527
A letter for the Dean of Admissions.

282
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,274
They took it.

283
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,796
Want a hat, Jude?

284
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,307
- What's the problem?
- It's raining.

285
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:19,776
- It's what?
- Thought you were the intelligent one.

286
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,307
Sue!

287
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:07,243
"Sir, I have read your letter
with interest,

288
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:10,832
"and judging from your description
of yourself as a working man,

289
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,877
"I think you have
a much better chance of success in life

290
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:18,428
"by sticking to your own trade
than by adopting any other course.

291
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:21,691
"Yours sincerely,
the Dean of Admissions."

292
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:31,698
I don't give a damn for any provost,
ward, principal or bloody Master of Arts.

293
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:35,988
All I know is I'd lick them on their own
ground if they'd just give me the chance.

294
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,784
It's always said there's more to be
learned outside the book, than in.

295
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,717
- Aye, but can you say the Creed in Latin?
- Yes, I can, I definitely can.

296
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,179
Excuse me. Quiet, please, quiet!

297
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:51,774
The gentleman in the corner is to rehearse
the articles of his belief in the Latin tongue

298
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:54,234
for the edification of this company.

299
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:55,699
Thank you.

300
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:57,723
Here's your chance.

301
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:12,515
Credo in unum Deum, Patrem,

302

Crucifixus etiam pro nobis:

305
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,543
et sepultus est.

306
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:34,300
Et resurrexit tertia die,
secundum Scripturas.

307
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:38,433
Et in Spiritum Sanctum,
Dominum

308
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:43,565
et vivificantem,
qui ex Patre Filo que procedit.

309
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:53,165
You bloody fools.

310
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:58,215
Which one of you knows
if I said it right or not?

311
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:16,160
It might be The Ratcatcher's Daughter
in double Dutch for all you know.

312
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:01,454
Sue!

313
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,078
Sue!

314
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:09,998
Jude...?

315
00:42:10,247 --> 00:42:12,084
I've been drinking, Sue.

316
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:15,342
Will you let me in?

317
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,966
All right.

318
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,975
- I can do it.
- Jude.

319
00:42:27,602 --> 00:42:30,581
You'll learn more than
they can ever teach you.

320
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:36,625
I'm sure this is the last
thing you want to hear,

321
00:42:36,676 --> 00:42:40,509
but you don't need a double first from
Christminster to do some good in the world.

322
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:46,056
- You should try to eat something.
- He's too old for you.

323
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:54,554
I'll bring you breakfast
in the morning.

324
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:33,775
Out of work already?

325
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:39,300
Hello, Aunt.

326
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:01,511
Don't you make a fool of
yourself over her, Jude.

327
00:45:04,325 --> 00:45:08,248
Marrying that woman Arabella was
the worst thing you ever did, until now.

328
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:09,792
Don't say that.

329
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:13,632
Your parents couldn't live together
and nor could Sue's.

330
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:17,888
They made each other's lives a living hell
and left you two as good as orphans.

331
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:28,113
- They were a different generation.
- With the same curse over your heads.

332
00:45:28,364 --> 00:45:32,371
- The Fawleys are not meant for marrying.
- That's an old wives' tale.

333
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:35,883
Since when did you stop
believing in them?

334
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,629
(SUE) "Dearest Jude,
I'm writing to you from Melchester,

335
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:31,592
"where Mr Phillotson and I
have both moved.

336
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:36,015
"He is teaching at a new school
and I am studying at a training college.

337
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:40,064
"The rules here are strict beyond belief
and our visiting hours are limited,

338
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:42,953
"but I'd love to see you again."

339
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,345
Your hands are rough, Jude.

340
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:03,102
So would yours be
if they held a mallet and chisel all day.

341
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:06,232
I like them, they are noble hands.

342
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:10,789
What's wrong?

343
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:15,204
It'll take me a while to
get used to you again.

344
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:32,065
- I come here to forget Melchester.
- So where are we?

345
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:37,574
France, Australia, Spain,
Canada, Timbuktu.

346
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:41,247
- Is it that bad at the training school?
- Yes.

347
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,295
It's only another year.

348
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:50,002
Mr Phillotson thinks he can get me
a good job when I've finished.

349
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:52,514
- How is he?
- He's been such a help.

350
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:55,311
I'm sure he has.

351
00:47:55,979 --> 00:47:58,274
- Are you being silly?
- No.

352
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:02,782
Jude?

353
00:48:03,031 --> 00:48:07,448
I didn't realise he took a
long-term interest in your future.

354
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:11,046
- He's a friend.
- I'm sure he doesn't see it that way.

355
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:15,928
- An old man like him?
- He isn't that old.

356
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:18,182
You said so yourself.

357
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:28,657
- What's the matter?
- I wish you'd be more open with me.

358
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,915
All right, he asked me to marry him.

359
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:38,131
- What did you say?
- I said I'd think about it.

360
00:48:40,552 --> 00:48:43,807
I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't
have asked you to visit.

361
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:46,978
I'm not visiting, I've moved to Melchester.

362
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,143
Jude!

363
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:09,816
Jude!

364
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:16,794
Let me in.

365
00:49:21,277 --> 00:49:24,781
They locked me up for being out with you, so I
jumped out of the window, climbed over a fence

366
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:27,503
crossed the deepest river in England,
and here I am.

367
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,224
I can't get warm.

368
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:40,650
- I'll borrow some clothes from the landlady.
- Don't do that, for God's sake!

369
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,444
Then you'll have to wear some of mine.

370
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:49,308
How about this?

371
00:49:49,432 --> 00:49:51,432
It might be a bit small.

372
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:56,676
I'll wait outside.

373
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:39,287
- I brought you some brandy.
- No glass?

374
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:44,921
- Some in the cupboard. I'd have to clean them.
- Don't worry, I'll drink it like a man.

375
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:52,724
- What will they say at the school?
- I don't care.

376
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:57,775
- I'll go back as soon as they're dry.
- It's late.

377
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:01,896
You could stay here tonight.

378
00:51:13,676 --> 00:51:15,804
I wish I could get warm.

379
00:51:24,776 --> 00:51:27,824
- Thank you, Jude.
- For what?

380
00:51:28,074 --> 00:51:30,160
For being here.

381
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:34,293
- I'm glad you came to me.
- There's no one else.

382
00:51:39,301 --> 00:51:42,138
I should let you sleep.

383
00:51:42,388 --> 00:51:44,350
Yes.

384
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,315
I couldn't sleep.

385
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:56,496
Why are you looking at me like that?

386
00:51:56,745 --> 00:51:59,380
- Does it frighten you?
- No.

387
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,804
 I'm not afraid of any man.

388
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:05,301
Why not?

389
00:52:06,177 --> 00:52:09,850
Because no man will touch a woman
unless she invites him to.

390
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:16,986
Until she says with a look or a smile,
"Come on", he's always afraid.

391
00:52:19,032 --> 00:52:22,246
If you never say it or look it,
he'll never come.

392
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,919
You're the timid sex.

393
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,764
Shall I try again...

394
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:38,196
.. to close my eyes and fall asleep?

395
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:24,839
Good morning, Jude.

396
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:26,391
Morning.

397
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:29,813
- Can I talk?
- Yes.

398
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:35,624
This is about her running
away from the school?

399
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:37,485
And coming to you that night.

400
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,810
There have been rumours.

401
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,044
She's been expelled
from school because of them.

402
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:51,057
- That isn't fair.
- Jude.

403
00:53:51,306 --> 00:53:56,190
I want to be able to defend her against
any scandal I need to know what happened.

404
00:53:57,775 --> 00:54:00,004
Nothing happened.

405
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:03,994
- Is that the truth?
- So help me God.

406
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,205
She stayed with me,

407
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,329
but as a cousin.

408
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,145
Then we must both help her now.

409
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,952
- Hello.
- Hello.

410
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:39,774
- Did you go to the school?
- Yes.

411
00:54:41,298 --> 00:54:43,698
They won't take me back.

412
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:47,942
They think you and I
are having some kind of affair.

413
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:52,365
They even suggested I marry you
for the sake of my reputation.

414
00:54:57,123 --> 00:55:00,725
- I saw Mr Phillotson today.
He said he'd help.

415
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,631
I don't want his help.

416
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,263
He was anxious. He
cares for you very much.

417
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,142
I know.

418
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:21,812
I've never told you about my past.

419
00:55:21,936 --> 00:55:24,436
Go on, then, tell me about it.

420
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:30,070
I'm married, Sue.

421
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:34,097
I haven't seen her for years,

422
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:37,621
but I'm still married.

423
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,636
Why are you telling me this?

424
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,557
Because it's the only obstacle.

425
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:53,419
Obstacle to what?

426
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:56,543
I don't love you!
I don't want to be your wife!

427
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:43,219
You are our closest mutual friend, Jude.

428
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,723
We thought you ought to
be the first to know.

429
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:49,730
Richard asked me to marry
him, and I said yes.

430
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,652
That's wonderful. Congratulations.
I'm very happy for you.

431
00:56:53,903 --> 00:56:55,739
So are we.

432
00:56:55,988 --> 00:57:00,204
- When did you decide?
- I've been asking Sue for months now.

433
00:57:00,454 --> 00:57:02,865
But this time it was her idea.

434
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:06,963
- I know it's the right decision.
- Jude helped me make up my mind.

435
00:57:07,214 --> 00:57:12,430
I know. I hope my cousin will make you
very happy, Mr Phillotson.

436
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:16,861
Jude, I have something to ask you.

437
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:20,483
Will you give me away?
I have no other family here.

438
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:27,451
Of course I'll give you away.

439
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,704
With all my heart.

440
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:50,652
Are you ready with that yet?
Hurry it up, then.

441
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:08,813
You're "father", you know.

442
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:17,008
That's what they call
the man who gives you away.

443
00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:27,916
Was it like this
when you were married?

444
00:59:41,441 --> 00:59:43,141
Can I get you a drink, sir?

445
00:59:43,241 --> 00:59:45,990
Thanks, Arabella. I'll
have a pint and a whisky.

446
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,699
Aren't you supposed to
be a Christminster don?

447
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,746
Aren't you supposed to be in Australia?

448
00:59:50,997 --> 00:59:52,900
Change, Arabella.

449
00:59:57,256 --> 00:59:59,518
He's on the house.

450
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:03,556
- Who's that, Bella?
- That's, oh that's just my husband.

451
01:00:03,807 --> 01:00:05,810
Can I have a pint now, please?

452
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,358
Cheers!

453
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:56,552
You know how I said I was pregnant
when we got married?

454
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,681
Jude?

455
01:01:01,894 --> 01:01:03,479
Jude...?

456
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,462
I met someone in Sydney.

457
01:01:24,008 --> 01:01:26,262
I didn't tell him about us.

458
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,986
It wasn't as nice as our wedding.

459
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:59,358
She'll find me lying here
as still as Lazarus.

460
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,866
And then I'll suddenly open my eyes.

461
01:03:06,285 --> 01:03:10,207
Sue Bridehead, you little fool

462
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,836
I'll say it straight out.

463
01:03:13,795 --> 01:03:20,597
You'll regret this marriage as much as
that ox of a cousin of yours regretted his.

464
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:32,365
Are you crying for me...
or for your precious Sue?

465
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:35,095
You ninny.

466
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:05,288
"Lord, have mercy upon us.

467
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:09,044
"Lord, have mercy upon us.

468
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:14,041
"Almighty God, with whom do live the
spirits of them that depart, enter the Lord,

469
01:04:14,844 --> 01:04:17,394
"with whom the souls
of the faithful after...

470
01:04:17,494 --> 01:04:20,101
they are delivered from
the burden of the flesh

471
01:04:20,352 --> 01:04:25,817
"are in joy and felicity. We give thee
a hearty thanks, for it has pleased thee

472
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:30,701
"to delver this, our sister,
out of the miseries of this sinful world.

473
01:04:30,952 --> 01:04:35,041
"Beseechingly, that it may please thee
of thy gracious goodness.

474
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:38,480
"Shortly to accomplish the
number of thine elect...

475
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,215
and to hasten thy kingdom,

476
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:45,306
"that we, with all those that are departed
in the true faith, thy holy name,

477
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:48,585
"may have our perfect
consummation and bliss,

478
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:50,105
both in body and soul

479
01:04:50,355 --> 01:04:55,905
"in thy eternal and everlasting glory,
through Jesus Christ, our Lord."

480
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:07,789
- How long are you staying?
- Just tonight. I have to go back tomorrow.

481
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:14,546
I wish I'd seen her before she died.

482
01:05:14,646 --> 01:05:17,144
She was looking forward
to seeing you, too.

483
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:19,248
What did she say?

484
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:22,944
That we both made bad
husbands and wives.

485
01:06:15,772 --> 01:06:18,192
It shouldn't be allowed to set those traps.

486
01:06:19,236 --> 01:06:22,532
- Did it wake you?
- I was already awake.

487
01:06:22,782 --> 01:06:25,494
- Why?
- I was thinking.

488
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,675
About what?

489
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:31,421
I don't know.

490
01:06:57,959 --> 01:07:01,798
(SUE) "Dearest Jude, I should never
have written this letter,

491
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,345
"and I beg you not to reply.

492
01:07:04,595 --> 01:07:07,557
"Richard and I are husband and wife.

493
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:10,144
"Nothing can change that...

494
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:12,773
"not your frustration,

495
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,568
"nor my regret.

496
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,073
"Please try to forget me."

497
01:08:18,036 --> 01:08:20,914
- Jude?
- How do you know?

498
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:24,629
You've got man's hands.

499
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:51,080
Did you get my letter?

500
01:08:51,804 --> 01:08:54,304
Yes, but I never opened it.

501
01:08:56,968 --> 01:09:00,306
Don't worry, I haven't moved
to Shaston this time.

502
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:06,707
- You say it like you've given up with me.
- Do you blame me?

503
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,072
I'm here, aren't I?

504
01:09:14,285 --> 01:09:17,206
Promise me you'll
never stop trying, Jude.

505
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:23,633
- That must sound terrible.
- Yes, it does.

506
01:09:26,846 --> 01:09:29,100
So, will you promise me that?

507
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,148
I can't help myself.

508
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:34,808
Jude?

509
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:39,364
- Sue didn't tell me you were coming.
- I didn't know.

510
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:43,871
That's a wonderful surprise for both of us.
How long are you staying?

511
01:09:44,956 --> 01:09:46,917
My train leaves in an hour.

512
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:49,755
Sue's hardly had a chance to see you.

513
01:09:53,968 --> 01:09:56,956
Maybe you can persuade Jude to stay.

514
01:10:11,453 --> 01:10:14,059
How is the school at Marygreen?

515
01:10:14,383 --> 01:10:16,083
The same.

516
01:10:25,892 --> 01:10:28,436
Still the one classroom?

517
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:33,236
Same desks.

518
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:11,417
- Everything all right, Jude?
- Yes.

519
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:15,547
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.

520
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:39,750
Sue?

521
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:54,355
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with me, Jude?

522
01:11:54,605 --> 01:11:56,149
Not a thing.

523
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:23,189
"When I do count the
clock that tells the time

524
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,865
"and see the brave day's sun
and hideous night. When I behold...

525
01:12:43,511 --> 01:12:47,308
".. and the summer's green
all girded up in sheaves,

526
01:12:47,559 --> 01:12:50,688
"borne on the bier
with white and bristly beard."

527
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:58,282
I have a wife I love, who not only
doesn't love me, but I disgust her.

528
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:01,579
And this morning

529
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:07,378
she asked me if she
could leave to live with you.

530
01:13:11,259 --> 01:13:16,142
- I won't oppose it if that's what you want.
- Well it is.

531
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:27,451
I always noticed something extraordinary
between the two of you.

532
01:13:27,701 --> 01:13:31,396
I kept telling myself it was because you
were cousins, but it's more than that.

533
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:37,549
Sometimes I think you are
one person split in two.

534
01:13:41,888 --> 01:13:45,894
You knew all along
she'd made a mistake marrying me.

535
01:13:46,144 --> 01:13:50,609
- Yes.
- But you did nothing to stop us.

536
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,454
No.

537
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:58,538
Nor did I.

538
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:29,920
I'll check when I get back home
to see if you've forgotten anything.

539
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,029
I don't think I have, thank you.

540
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:38,597
- What time's your train, Jude?
- Leaves in five minutes.

541
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:46,467
Goodbye, Richard.

542
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,375
Bye.

543
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:32,202
Yes!

544
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:30,858
Jude!

545
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:32,282
Jude!

546
01:16:33,609 --> 01:16:36,079
I brought your dinner.

547
01:17:15,037 --> 01:17:19,451
Domestic laws should take into account
different temperaments.  - For example.

548
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,172
I may want to live with a man,
but only as a friend.

549
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:26,219
- And how may that be fair on the man?
- Because there are no precedents.

550
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:28,923
- His pride is hurt.
- But you want to marry someone you love.

551
01:17:28,973 --> 01:17:32,577
Why do people have to be told to
love each other by someone else?
That's all marriage is.

552
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:36,852
- It's a government stamp. A licence to love.
- But if we could, would you want to get married?

553
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:41,157
I'd run a mile if you had a piece of paper
that forced me to love you.

554
01:17:43,828 --> 01:17:45,715
Oh, please!

555
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:47,939
That's not fair.

556
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:52,758
- Drink up.
- Oh, another go. Another go.

557
01:17:53,008 --> 01:17:55,495
Drink up, drink up, drink up.

558
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,348
Ugh!

559
01:17:57,766 --> 01:18:00,018
You love it, you liar.

560
01:18:23,296 --> 01:18:24,624
What?

561
01:18:24,674 --> 01:18:27,136
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me like that.

562
01:18:27,686 --> 01:18:30,357
- It's just affections.
- Does it pull you to something else?

563
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:34,154
Something else? What something else?

564
01:18:34,404 --> 01:18:37,617
I think neither of us know
the meaning of it.

565
01:18:45,078 --> 01:18:46,652
I'm sorry.

566
01:18:46,676 --> 01:18:50,276
It's just that I want everything
to be perfect between us.

567
01:18:54,592 --> 01:18:56,819
I'm not ready, Jude.

568
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,905
Do you understand?

569
01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:04,429
I'll try.

570
01:19:14,897 --> 01:19:16,549
What are you writing?

571
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,911
Whatever his wife wants.

572
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,741
- Tea.
- Thanks.

573
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:24,345
"Here lies my husband Peter Porter, age 51.

574
01:19:24,395 --> 01:19:29,652
"He tormented me, he cheated on me
and he spent all our food money on beer."

575
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:32,906
- He's dead, Sue.
- He can't hear me.

576
01:19:38,457 --> 01:19:41,292
Tell him I'll have his
headstone ready in an hour.

577
01:20:23,848 --> 01:20:25,559
Arabella?

578
01:20:27,854 --> 01:20:30,817
Sorry to come here, Jude.
I didn't want to.

579
01:20:31,068 --> 01:20:34,739
- I'm in trouble. I need to talk to you.
- What's wrong?

580
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:42,711
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.
Can we talk somewhere else?

581
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,008
- All right.
- I'm staying at the King's Head.

582
01:21:04,451 --> 01:21:08,657
- It was Arabella. She wants to talk with me.
- Can't she talk outside?

583
01:21:08,707 --> 01:21:12,338
- She wants me to go to a hotel
- That's convenient.

584
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:17,053
- Sue, I have to help her.
- Why? She's not your wife.

585
01:21:18,722 --> 01:21:21,142
She's going to give you
what you want.

586
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:27,818
Can't you see what she's doing?
She wants you back.

587
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:30,530
But do you want me?

588
01:21:31,966 --> 01:21:33,661
Yes.

589
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,279
Close your eyes.

590
01:21:51,436 --> 01:21:54,525
- You don't have to do this.
- I want to.

591
01:21:54,775 --> 01:21:58,906
But you have to help me. I don't know
what I'm doing. I only pretend.

592
01:21:59,156 --> 01:22:02,661
- Do I talk too much?
- No.

593
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:05,624
- I'm doing it all wrong, aren't I?
- No.

594
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:08,379
- I'm intellectualising.
- You're not.

595
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:11,299
Kiss me before I start talking again.

596
01:22:59,412 --> 01:23:02,124
You look pleased with yourself.

597
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:06,881
I'm cooking you bacon
and sausage and eggs.

598
01:23:07,131 --> 01:23:08,629
Why?

599
01:23:08,953 --> 01:23:11,453
Because you think you deserve it.

600
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:18,899
There's a letter for you on the table.

601
01:23:26,076 --> 01:23:29,582
- Aren't you going to open it?
- I'll read it later.

602
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:32,585
Jude, I know who it's from.

603
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,564
(ARABELLA) "Dearest Jude,
I'm writing with this news

604
01:23:46,815 --> 01:23:50,195
"because I never got the chance
to tell you face to face.

605
01:23:50,446 --> 01:23:54,995
"There was a boy born of our marriage
eight months after I left you.

606
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:58,499
"So far, the boy has been
with my parents in Sydney but

607
01:23:58,749 --> 01:24:02,797
"they can no longer afford to keep him,
and nor can I.

608
01:24:03,047 --> 01:24:05,718
"I named him after you."

609
01:24:32,549 --> 01:24:34,134
Are you Jude Fawley?

610
01:24:34,385 --> 01:24:35,804
Yes, sir.

611
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:40,519
This is your father. My name's Sue.
It's nice to meet you.

612
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:43,564
- How was your journey?
- Fine, thank you.

613
01:24:43,857 --> 01:24:46,686
- Can I carry this?
- Yes.

614
01:24:55,792 --> 01:24:58,629
(SUE) What Arabella says is true.

615
01:24:58,879 --> 01:25:00,785
He's yours.

616
01:25:01,409 --> 01:25:03,909
I can see you in him.

617
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:08,936
But the other half is her.

618
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:26,988
- You'll protect me, won't you?
- If I can.

619
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:36,810
Can you believe your eyes?
Is the world really as it seems?

620
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:40,485
I can see some of you smiling,
that's there certainty that nothing...

621
01:25:40,585 --> 01:25:43,662
can surprise you any more.
You've seen it all.

622
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:47,310
Well tonight, I'll surprise you.

623
01:25:48,578 --> 01:25:50,581
I'll show you wonders.

624
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:56,547
I'll show you a world you've only glimpsed
in your darkest dreams.

625
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:06,563
Out of thin air, the terrors come!

626
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,740
(MIDWIFE) Come on now,
not much longer now.

627
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:49,835
You all right?

628
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:58,883
It's nothing to be frightened of.
Come here.

629
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:29,810
- No, baby, don't cry.
- Juey, can you help me, please?

630
01:27:30,061 --> 01:27:32,564
Can you help me? Hold baby for me.

631
01:27:33,607 --> 01:27:35,443
Support her head.

632
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:40,243
Look, I've got the baby.

633
01:27:40,492 --> 01:27:42,454
Be careful

634
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:17,305
Morning.

635
01:28:33,362 --> 01:28:36,533
Jude, can I have a word?

636
01:28:38,286 --> 01:28:43,294
- Who are they?
- Daddy's going to talk to them.

637
01:28:43,545 --> 01:28:45,831
The work is going fine,
Mr. Willis.

638
01:28:45,881 --> 01:28:50,263
Jude, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to get
someone else to finish it for you.

639
01:28:50,513 --> 01:28:51,513
Why?

640
01:28:51,613 --> 01:28:54,527
There's some of the parishioners
have complained.

641
01:28:56,021 --> 01:29:00,444
- About what?
- You never told us you weren't married.

642
01:29:00,694 --> 01:29:04,315
I never realised that was a
necessary qualification for a stonemason.

643
01:29:04,366 --> 01:29:07,438
I'll pay you for the week's work,
of course.

644
01:29:11,752 --> 01:29:14,297
I'm sorry, Jude.

645
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:37,583
Six shillings. Yes, madam, seven shillings.
Is she going to get them?

646
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:39,736
Yes, she is, seven shillings.
Thank you, madam.

647
01:29:39,887 --> 01:29:45,085
Right, we've got this rabbit now.
Couple of nice rabbits. Black and white.
But you can take the skin off, they look the same.

648
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,514
Goes very, very nice with
Sunday lunch for someone.

649
01:29:47,764 --> 01:29:52,187
Come on. Four pence, five pence.
Seven pence to the gentleman out there.

650
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:55,830
It's going to be like this
everywhere we go...

651
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,405
as soon as people find
out we're not married.

652
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:03,746
We'll move on.

653
01:30:05,497 --> 01:30:08,669
We move somewhere
where nobody knows us.

654
01:30:09,922 --> 01:30:14,595
If they find out, we move on again,
and again and again...

655
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,686
as long as it takes
for the world to change.

656
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:23,654
We've done nothing wrong, Sue.

657
01:30:24,678 --> 01:30:27,478
You're the one who taught me that.

658
01:31:16,285 --> 01:31:17,847
Juey.

659
01:31:19,148 --> 01:31:21,693
- Juey!
- Juey!

660
01:31:23,404 --> 01:31:25,909
Take care of your sister.

661
01:31:40,847 --> 01:31:44,561
How do you do, Mrs Fawley.
Arabella Wilkinson.

662
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,276
You look sick, Jude.

663
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,300
 Thank you.

664
01:31:49,526 --> 01:31:52,822
There's even gables and little windows.
How very sweet.

665
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:56,161
Still harping on about Christminster.

666
01:31:57,330 --> 01:32:00,961
- How are you?
- All right.

667
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:04,674
My husband died, left me everything.

668
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:10,266
- What would you like?
- Oh, I think I'll have a whole college.

669
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:13,970
Which was the college
that refused you, Jude?

670
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,107
Well I shan't have that one.

671
01:32:19,069 --> 01:32:22,075
You were such a proud man, Jude.

672
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:43,189
Jude.

673
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,234
Hello.

674
01:32:47,946 --> 01:32:50,618
- Don't you recognise your ma, then?
- Yeah.

675
01:32:52,578 --> 01:32:55,951
I bought you some cake.
Would you like some?

676
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:57,243
No, thank you.

677
01:32:57,293 --> 01:33:01,633
- I think your little sister would like some.
- She's too small.

678
01:33:03,469 --> 01:33:06,390
But you are big, though.
How old are you now?

679
01:33:07,475 --> 01:33:08,936
Eight.

680
01:33:09,186 --> 01:33:12,065
Eight years, three months
and six days.

681
01:33:12,315 --> 01:33:14,569
I remember exactly.

682
01:33:16,071 --> 01:33:18,074
Eight was my favourite age.

683
01:33:18,324 --> 01:33:21,244
- I bet you want to be nine, though?
- Yeah.

684
01:33:23,457 --> 01:33:26,836
- Hey, are you married yet?
- No.

685
01:33:29,716 --> 01:33:32,845
- Be all right if I kiss you, then?
- Yeah.

686
01:33:37,228 --> 01:33:39,564
You're a good boy, Jude.

687
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:00,929
What is it?

688
01:34:02,973 --> 01:34:05,852
I want to go back to Christminster.

689
01:34:07,187 --> 01:34:09,737
Because Arabella hurt your pride?

690
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:12,161
Because I still have some.

691
01:34:18,246 --> 01:34:24,047
(JUDE) * The crow flew over the bush
The crow flew over the bush

692
01:34:24,296 --> 01:34:26,961
# The crow flew over the bush #

693
01:34:27,685 --> 01:34:29,885
What do you think he saw?

694
01:34:49,501 --> 01:34:53,965
- Guess who?
- I know that voice anywhere. Uncle Joe.

695
01:34:54,216 --> 01:34:56,723
Jim! Take your tail up.
Over here.

696
01:34:56,723 --> 01:35:00,366
I've found the tutor of St Slum's
College, Christminster.

697
01:35:01,059 --> 01:35:05,390
Hey, hey! Can you still say
the Apostle's Creed in Latin, Jude.

698
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:09,071
"Credo in unum Deum,
Patrem omnipotentem."

699
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,699
Look at you, Jude.
What have you been doing with yourself?

700
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:13,953
He's got himself more mouths to feed.

701
01:35:14,203 --> 01:35:17,000
- You remember my friends, don't you?
- Yes, of course.

702
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,585
So cousins do get married.

703
01:35:19,837 --> 01:35:23,551
- My eldest, little Jude.
- Oh, what's wrong with you, little man?

704
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,438
- He's tired.
- Nothing.

705
01:35:41,494 --> 01:35:44,749
We've been looking out for you
in the parade every year.

706
01:35:44,999 --> 01:35:47,795
Never thought we'd
find you in the crowd.

707
01:35:49,047 --> 01:35:50,841
Things turned out differently.

708
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,057
- No regrets, I hope?
- Some.

709
01:35:56,308 --> 01:35:59,353
Difficult question for any man to answer.

710
01:35:59,604 --> 01:36:01,634
To follow his dreams no matter what, or...

711
01:36:01,734 --> 01:36:04,110
give in slowly and let
life lead him where it will

712
01:36:04,944 --> 01:36:07,416
And which are you?

713
01:36:07,823 --> 01:36:09,826
I don't know.

714
01:36:18,632 --> 01:36:23,055
When I first came here to Christminster,
I had a neat stock of fixed opinions.

715
01:36:24,224 --> 01:36:26,960
Now the further I get,
the less sure I am of anything.

716
01:36:27,353 --> 01:36:29,189
Hear, hear.

717
01:36:31,067 --> 01:36:34,864
"Who knoweth what is good
for man in this life?

718
01:36:35,115 --> 01:36:39,287
"And who can tell a man
what shall be after him under the sun?"

719
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:57,690
- We're looking for somewhere to stay.
- We don't take children.

720
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:04,198
- We're looking for somewhere to stay.
- No, I'm sorry. No room.

721
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:11,585
- We're looking for somewhere to stay.
- How many children are there?

722
01:37:11,835 --> 01:37:13,880
Two children and a baby.

723
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:17,635
- I have got a room.
- Thank you, thank you.

724
01:37:18,344 --> 01:37:20,138
Juey, Lizzy, come up.

725
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,049
I'll look for work in the morning.

726
01:37:36,188 --> 01:37:38,951
- How did they know?
- She asked me if we were husband and wife.

727
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,670
- And you said we weren't?
- I couldn't lie.  - Sue!

728
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:45,026
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I won't hide it from anyone.

729
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:50,291
It's open.

730
01:37:52,061 --> 01:37:55,316
I'm sorry, my husband is a bit unhappy
about the little ones staying.

731
01:37:55,566 --> 01:37:58,737
- We can't leave now, not in this rain.
- I know, I said that to him.

732
01:37:58,988 --> 01:38:01,741
- Staying one night is fine.
- But we agreed a week.

733
01:38:01,992 --> 01:38:06,039
Thank you very much. We'll look for
new lodgings first thing in the morning.

734
01:38:09,253 --> 01:38:12,924
- Why do you give in?
- What difference does it make?

735
01:38:13,175 --> 01:38:15,638
Sshhh, nearly done.

736
01:38:25,069 --> 01:38:27,280
I love this place.

737
01:38:29,074 --> 01:38:32,621
even though I know
it looks down on people like me.

738
01:38:32,872 --> 01:38:34,844
The self-taught,

739
01:38:35,068 --> 01:38:36,868
too-determined.

740
01:38:40,675 --> 01:38:45,015
It takes two or three generations to do
what I tried to do in one.

741
01:38:47,018 --> 01:38:50,431
You're still Joseph,
the dreamer of dreams.

742
01:38:56,573 --> 01:38:59,160
And the tragic Don Quixote.

743
01:39:05,001 --> 01:39:07,588
Sometimes you're a St Stephen...

744
01:39:10,092 --> 01:39:14,056
who sees Heaven open up,
even as they're stoning him.

745
01:39:17,229 --> 01:39:19,682
(JUEY) <i>I can't sleep.</i>

746
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:28,746
- Come and sleep with us.
- Is it because of me we have to leave?

747
01:39:32,209 --> 01:39:34,042
No, Juey...

748
01:39:34,566 --> 01:39:37,166
because there's too many of us.

749
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:40,674
There's not enough room.

750
01:39:40,798 --> 01:39:42,798
Go to bed now.

751
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:49,442
Go to bed. Go to bed!

752
01:39:52,322 --> 01:39:54,533
I'll go and talk to him.

753
01:40:10,265 --> 01:40:14,271
- What are you doing?
- Watching them sleep.

754
01:40:23,494 --> 01:40:26,372
They love you very much, Juey.

755
01:40:27,832 --> 01:40:29,878
You're their older brother.

756
01:40:31,506 --> 01:40:34,550
If they see you upset, they get upset, too.

757
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:37,096
You have to be strong for them.

758
01:40:40,059 --> 01:40:44,398
If there's too many children in the world,
why do people have more?

759
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:50,825
I don't know.

760
01:40:51,075 --> 01:40:54,371
Because they love each other,

761
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:57,084
or because they don't think.

762
01:40:58,336 --> 01:41:00,506
It just happens that way.

763
01:41:04,553 --> 01:41:07,682
Mum said there were too many of us.

764
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,355
She didn't mean you.

765
01:41:12,272 --> 01:41:14,862
There aren't enough of you.

766
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:20,493
Are you ready for bed?

767
01:41:23,498 --> 01:41:25,459
Come on.

768
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:39,313
Good night, son.

769
01:42:25,464 --> 01:42:31,223
I'd like to buy myself a dress with flowers,
flounces and ribbons. And I need a hat.

770
01:42:31,474 --> 01:42:34,186
- Of course you do.
- With exotic flowers growing out of it.

771
01:42:36,647 --> 01:42:41,488
Oh, Jude. We could buy...
We could buy clothes.

772
01:42:41,738 --> 01:42:43,866
We could buy anything we wanted, really.

773
01:42:47,956 --> 01:42:50,292
- Juey in school
- We could.

774
01:42:50,543 --> 01:42:53,505
- Can I tell him?
- Yes, you tell him.

775
01:42:53,755 --> 01:42:55,758
I'll tell him. I'll tell him!

776
01:43:05,815 --> 01:43:08,861
Sshh, they must be asleep.

777
01:43:15,288 --> 01:43:17,458
What is it?

778
01:46:11,256 --> 01:46:17,599
"For we are made as a spectacle unto
the world, and unto angels and to men.

779
01:46:18,391 --> 01:46:22,939
"even to this present hour we both hunger
and thirst, and are naked and are buffeted,

780
01:46:23,191 --> 01:46:25,486
"and have no certain dwelling place.

781
01:46:26,612 --> 01:46:31,577
"Being reviled, we bless.
Being persecuted, we suffer it.

782
01:46:31,827 --> 01:46:34,206
"Being defamed, we entreat.

783
01:46:34,456 --> 01:46:37,836
"We are made as the filth
of the world, and...

784
01:46:37,936 --> 01:46:41,466
are the offscouring of
all things unto this day.

785
01:46:43,094 --> 01:46:48,936
"I write not these things to shame you,
but, as my beloved sons, to warn you."

786
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:06,796
Shall we go?

787
01:47:08,507 --> 01:47:12,003
- Sue?
- I want to be with my children.

788
01:47:15,183 --> 01:47:17,645
I'll wait for you by the gates.

789
01:47:39,636 --> 01:47:41,898
I should have kept him myself.

790
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:46,020
None of this would have ever happened.

791
01:47:47,397 --> 01:47:49,901
If I had come back to you...

792
01:47:50,151 --> 01:47:51,945
If...

793
01:47:52,613 --> 01:47:55,492
- If...
- Arabella, please.

794
01:47:56,912 --> 01:47:58,915
I thought about it.

795
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:02,295
- Do you ever?
- No.

796
01:48:08,136 --> 01:48:10,723
It wasn't your fault, Jude.

797
01:48:23,159 --> 01:48:25,633
Why won't you look at me?

798
01:48:25,857 --> 01:48:28,157
Because it's wrong.

799
01:48:31,086 --> 01:48:33,506
We have to be punished.

800
01:48:36,678 --> 01:48:39,198
Haven't we been punished enough?

801
01:48:40,892 --> 01:48:42,895
Our love is wrong.

802
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,526
That's why the children died.

803
01:48:47,902 --> 01:48:50,240
We defied him, and now
he's punishing us.

804
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,368
- Who?
- God.

805
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:56,166
God has nothing to do with it.
You of all people know that.

806
01:48:56,416 --> 01:48:57,434
I was wrong.

807
01:48:57,534 --> 01:49:00,839
And now you can see clearly,
in this state?

808
01:49:01,089 --> 01:49:04,720
- I'm trying to explain things.
- There's nothing to explain.

809
01:49:07,682 --> 01:49:11,480
- It was an accident.
- It was judgement.

810
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,783
On what?

811
01:49:14,234 --> 01:49:16,654
Why do you talk like this?

812
01:49:20,243 --> 01:49:22,245
We've done nothing wrong.

813
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:29,214
"We are made a spectacle unto the world,
and unto angels and to men."

814
01:49:44,237 --> 01:49:46,030
Sue.

815
01:49:48,118 --> 01:49:52,833
- Sue, where are you going?
- Your child killed mine.

816
01:49:56,004 --> 01:49:58,675
- Your child killed my babies.
- Sue, please.

817
01:49:59,969 --> 01:50:03,348
How can I look at you?
How can I live with you?

818
01:51:49,795 --> 01:51:53,427
Do you believe in God?
You think so, yes.

819
01:52:18,356 --> 01:52:23,404
How many times have you missed
a church service in your life? Why?

820
01:52:36,657 --> 01:52:39,177
What are you reading at the moment?

821
01:53:54,439 --> 01:53:58,028
- What do you want with me?
- Come home.

822
01:54:00,822 --> 01:54:03,372
You don't know my badness.

823
01:54:03,396 --> 01:54:05,396
Yes, I do.

824
01:54:07,608 --> 01:54:12,532
You make me hate Christianity and God
and whatever has reduced you to this state.

825
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:18,598
- It's right that I suffer.
- It's wrong.

826
01:54:18,849 --> 01:54:21,553
That a woman like you
should give up her mind, degrade herself...

827
01:54:21,603 --> 01:54:23,607
Don't talk to me like that!

828
01:54:28,154 --> 01:54:30,742
- I'm sorry.
- Doesn't matter.

829
01:54:33,337 --> 01:54:35,290
- You have to listen to me.
- Come home.

830
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,443
No, I can't.

831
01:54:38,904 --> 01:54:42,493
- It's all right, Jude. I know what to do.
- We'll talk in the morning.

832
01:54:43,903 --> 01:54:46,483
I have to go back
to Richard in the morning.

833
01:54:48,384 --> 01:54:50,136
You go, too.

834
01:54:50,761 --> 01:54:54,770
Write to Arabella, ask her to...
- They mean nothing to us.

835
01:54:54,819 --> 01:54:57,524
- We're still married.
- No, you and I are married!

836
01:54:57,574 --> 01:55:02,205
But not in Heaven, not in this church!
I married Richard in a church, Jude.

837
01:55:02,456 --> 01:55:06,837
- I want to go back to him.
- Do you care for him? Do you love him?

838
01:55:08,698 --> 01:55:11,919
- I'll learn to love him.
- No. How can you, Sue? You love me.

839
01:55:11,969 --> 01:55:14,641
You love me, Sue!

840
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:17,645
Say it, Sue.

841
01:55:19,855 --> 01:55:24,696
Say it. Say it. Say it.

842
01:55:24,947 --> 01:55:27,367
I don't love you any more.

843
01:55:33,384 --> 01:55:35,847
I'll pray for us, Jude.

844
01:55:36,931 --> 01:55:39,018
Not for me.

845
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:22,054
How are you?

846
01:57:22,078 --> 01:57:23,778
All right.

847
01:57:24,433 --> 01:57:26,646
You look well

848
01:57:27,070 --> 01:57:28,570
Do I?

849
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:37,092
- Where are you living now?
- Quite far.

850
01:57:38,804 --> 01:57:41,933
- You won't tell me where?
- You wouldn't know it.

851
01:57:44,003 --> 01:57:47,299
- I'd better go.
- I'll follow you.  - No.

852
01:57:47,649 --> 01:57:50,446
I won't stop trying, I promised you that.

853
01:57:50,696 --> 01:57:53,116
- Jude.
- Do you love me?

854
01:57:54,744 --> 01:57:56,747
Do you still love me?

855
01:57:59,459 --> 01:58:03,465
I won't come again, if that's what
you want, but I need to know.

856
01:58:03,715 --> 01:58:06,385
You've always known.

857
01:58:07,512 --> 01:58:09,390
Sue, come with me.

858
01:58:11,685 --> 01:58:13,688
No, Jude.

859
01:58:53,455 --> 01:58:58,421
We are man and wife,
if ever two people were on this earth!
