1
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,692
Excellent feast!

2
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:51,157
Soon we will retire
to the royal bedchamber.

3
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,900
But first...

4
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,703
As I have been victorious
in this weekend battle...

5
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,082
I wish to be amused.
Bring me my fool!

6
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:13,095
Good evening, your Majesty.
It's great to be back here at the palace.

7
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:16,933
You know what the palace is:
it's 24 living rooms and a dungeon.

8
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:22,897
But seriously,
I love the King

9
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,149
He's one of the strongest men
here, isn't he?

10
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,611
He's the only one amongst us
that can swim the moat length twice.

11
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,492
I know you're out there.
I can hear you breathing.

12
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,662
But seriouly ladies and germs,
I want to say that...

13
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,164
that plague is really something, isn't it?

14
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,458
doesn't everything look black?

15
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,587
Coz it's a black plague.

16
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,923
Save it up and let me hear it
at the end, big.

17
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:53,136
I love the new exercise
his Majesty does to keep in shape.

18
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:55,763
It's called "taxing peasants".

19
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:02,186
Seriously,
the best thing of ...

20
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,899
I can't stand it any longer!
He's not funny!

21
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:10,444
I've cut men in a half
for making jokes as bad as those.

22
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,531
Bring me a fool that's funny!

23
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,367
the feast is over.

24
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,536
Not funny.

25
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:23,833
I do a couple of impressions
that you might like, you know...

26
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,545
I'm one of the few guys that can do
the King of France. Not his voice, his walk.

27
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,882
If you haven't noticed
the funny motions when he walks...

28
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:34,427
going a little bit to the side.
Got a kind of...

29
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,473
Don't everybody burst
into spontaneous applause, on this.

30
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,786
Madame, I beg your puberty.

31
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,998
Beg it not, for thou hast thrown
the royal rubies and emeralds on floor.

32
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,335
I think we'll pick it up, and we spin it
and fain well on my fain.

33
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:09,670
- Thy pin.
- Yes, extend thy fane, madame.

34
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:13,257
And I, therefore,
on the knock of your hands. Perfect.

35
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:15,092
Didst I feel right?

36
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:19,597
or just I feel that thy two hands
werest upon my royal body?

37
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,474
Madame, not I , surely...

38
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:25,394
would never lay my hands on the royal tomatoes
in mixed company.

39
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,648
Hark on me, if my husband, the King,
and my son, the doctor...

40
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,775
walketh near upon these private paths...

41
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,277
and heareth what thy sayst
about copping a feel...

42
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,363
thy life would not be worth
a black nickle.

43
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,324
But, madame, so beautiful do they lay,
they're one on either side.

44
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,035
Either side? This way they were made,
fool. Away from me!

45
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,294
I fell on my bells.

46
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,422
T.V. ...

47
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,925
or not T.V. ?

48
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,928
That is the congestion.

49
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:01,597
Con-sumption be done about it?

50
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,559
Of cough, of cough.

51
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,769
Oh Jesus!

52
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:09,105
My jokes grow stale.

53
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:12,400
I would my life take
for a bare bodkin.

54
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,862
If only I could see
the Queen's bare bodkin...

55
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,823
or anybody's bare bodkin,
for that matter.

56
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,118
Or a bodkin
with little clothes on, even.

57
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,453
I'm so melon-choly.

58
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:27,206
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz
are dead.

59
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,375
their tailor shop is closed.

60
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,502
Felix?

61
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,504
Who calls my name?

62
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:38,468
No one knows I'm here,
not even my service!

63
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,598
I am the ghost of thy father.

64
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,058
My father.

65
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:48,769
You, who died in childbirth.

66
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:51,647
I can't rest...

67
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,860
unless thee makest it
with the Queen.

68
00:07:55,943 --> 00:08:00,239
But she is a Queen,
and I a baseborn fool.

69
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:02,492
I can't screw
above my station.

70
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:06,204
You must know, my son...

71
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,372
that thy uncle...

72
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,458
my father...

73
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,002
put hemlock in my ear.

74
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,172
Why?

75
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,925
Don't ask me why.

76
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,719
He does that with everybody

77
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:25,598
whenever he sees an ear...

78
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:29,227
he likes to put hemlock in it.

79
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:32,146
Oh, father!

80
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:35,817
See the sorcerer, my son.

81
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,986
The sorcerer!

82
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,493
He's gone.

83
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:49,914
Do I dare sleep with the Queen?
Will she sleep with me?

84
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:53,709
Although she sleeps with the King
and he wears leotards.

85
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,545
The sorcerer.

86
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:59,715
Ah, an aphrodisiac.

87
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:05,763
Do you want a soft one...

88
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,765
a strong one...

89
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:10,101
Or one that will... mmmh?

90
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:14,355
I'd like anything I can get
without prescription.

91
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:20,111
This, placed softly...

92
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,114
in the Queen's drink...

93
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,783
will make her blood boil.

94
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:29,245
Her passion unbridled...

95
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,247
lustful.

96
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,083
- In other words ...
- The hots for me.

97
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:38,087
Exactly.

98
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,214
But be cautious.

99
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:44,719
For if his Majesty
should get wind of thy intent...

100
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,430
He will cut off
your legs...

101
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,891
your arms...

102
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,310
and your head.

103
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,646
Right,
five out of six is not bad.

104
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,565
Now, go.

105
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,444
I think your eggs are done.

106
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:12,330
- Halt. Who goes there?
- I'm just the fool.

107
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:14,582
What business have you
in the royal chambers?

108
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:17,543
I'm just bringing her Majesty
her orange juice.

109
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:20,254
But why you?
Where is her usual servant?

110
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,500
He lies ill on the kitchen floor with a pox,

111
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,260
a terrible pox all over his socks.

112
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:28,805
- Get the enter.
- Yes, I'll get in hands, immediately.

113
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,767
Did you like the way
I fooled these guys?

114
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:49,158
Fool, what doest thy in my chamber?

115
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,955
Madame, I felt if upon a chance you might like a drink.
A nice soothing potion.

116
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,624
Well I do confess a thirst.
Bring it to me.

117
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,628
Yes. Wouldst grab some of this potion
before the fizz goes out.

118
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,506
- Isn't it wonderful?
- It bubbleth greatly.

119
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,883
Bolt some down, my lady.

120
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:08,594
- Cheerst.
- And roebuck.

121
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:18,187
It go down bubblest,
but it's fine.

122
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,315
Take it away.

123
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:27,488
Well, I have to go back now
to the dungeon...

124
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,824
to get the deposit
on the goblet.

125
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,036
Wait. Fool, come here.

126
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,874
I have on me this extraordinary warmth...

127
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:41,961
that is flowing through my veins,
it makes me wish... nay, longst...

128
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:46,382
that you run a mark over my entire body
and make love to me now.

129
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:49,385
- Ravage me and take me now, take me.
- It will be a pleasure.

130
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:51,262
- Take me now to the bed.
- To the bed?

131
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,723
- And make love to me now.
- Yes, to the bed.

132
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,850
- Lead me there, fool.
- Yes, I am.

133
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,227
For this passion groweth within me.

134
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:01,189
- Come quickly.
- I cannot walk fast, fool.

135
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,650
- The passion is so big.
- To the bed.

136
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,320
- Take me to the bed.
- Over here.

137
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:11,365
The potion will be
under the pillow.

138
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,952
So in case you lose your hot,
we can refurbish it.

139
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,414
Come round thy hands upon my body.

140
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,875
I shall,
I shall remind your brakes.

141
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:26,297
Nay, I need this feel
of naked flesh against flesh.

142
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,092
I'm all out of naked flesh
but would the velvet do?

143
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,678
- Now! Kiss me quick!
- Yes, where is your quick?

144
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,766
- Canst undress me now?
- I am kissing my own arm.

145
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,895
Yes. Up quickly,
and I will remove the royal dress.

146
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,694
Pullst not upon me.

147
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:53,783
On my feet, fool.
This is not mockery, this is not games.

148
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,206
At last!

149
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,583
What is this?
Heavy underwear.

150
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,337
'Tis the chastity belt
that the jealous King hath fastened on me...

151
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,508
that no man but him
shalst havest the goods of the body.

152
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,927
That's a bad a break for all of us
here at the palace.

153
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:16,931
Wait, wait here. I will go.

154
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:21,811
Here. Now, with most grievous dispatch...

155
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:25,148
I will open the latch
and get through her snatch.

156
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,697
This key is too big
for that lock.

157
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,792
Sorry about that.

158
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,465
I must think of something quickly,
because before you note...

159
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,468
the Renaissance will be here
and we'll all be painting.

160
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,349
- Her Majesty wishes to borrow this.
- What?

161
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,270
Yes, she has some food
stuck between her teeth,

162
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:03,800
and I need to pull it down.

163
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:07,148
Forgive me.

164
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,705
This I wanna call "beaver shooting".

165
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,505
Pick this lock.

166
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:37,553
There!

167
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,555
Done.

168
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,892
- So now I am yours.
- At last, the portals of ecstasy.

169
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,894
You have the portals of ecstasy,
haven't you?

170
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:49,023
Be prepared, his Majesty has this day been awake
from his nap by a loud banging.

171
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:52,860
Be prepared, his Majesty has this day been awake
from his nap by a loud banging.

172
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:56,531
- He will clip thee in twin.
- Yes, clip me in twin.

173
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:59,492
Twin over here and the other twin
on the other side of the room.

174
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:01,494
On his chopping bock.

175
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:05,998
Yes, I do not look good in twin.
My suits are all made for a full person.

176
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,209
Then I shall not have this passion fulfilled.

177
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:12,380
Quickly, lock up the thing
that you have there.

178
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:15,508
Lock the royal box.
Quickly, before...

179
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:19,095
- Help me, help me.
- I'm helping, but...

180
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:20,680
Just done.

181
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:24,433
Perfect. Closed solid.
More solid than any...

182
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,936
My hand is caught
in the chastity belt.

183
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,231
I always keep my hand
in the cookie jars.

184
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,275
The King,
what shallst we do?

185
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:33,442
The King?

186
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,073
Yes. Quickly,
comest into the dress immediately.

187
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:43,244
My Queen!
Where is my Queen?

188
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,955
Very casual,
as though nothing had happened.

189
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,086
Oh my Queen! A noise,
dreadful pounding did awaken me...

190
00:15:52,128 --> 00:15:54,464
making my mood most foul.

191
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:57,091
My Lord,
you did startle me.

192
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:01,179
Hi Milord. Be a good King, wouldst thou,
and bring me a drink of water.

193
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:05,099
The fool haveth mean his jest most graceful
details in thine absence.

194
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:08,394
Haha Milord, tickling
the royal funny bones, so to speak.

195
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:11,939
Ay, because you see 'tis most lonely
when thou nappest.

196
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,608
Ay Milord,
for me too.

197
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,776
I still...

198
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,654
don't think he is funny.

199
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:21,199
I got some new ones
for you, Milord:

200
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:24,911
what's black and white, black and white,
black and white?

201
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:27,413
A nun falling down for the stairs.

202
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,459
Come,
give me a kiss.

203
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:33,878
- Course Milord, stick out your tongue.
- Not you!

204
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:41,219
- I'm leaving.
- I will accompany thee to the door.

205
00:16:43,596 --> 00:16:45,473
At last.

206
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:48,184
At last we are alone.

207
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,311
Ay, my Lord.

208
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,355
My Lord, I would...

209
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:59,028
The key.
Where is it?

210
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,739
Ah, here it is.

211
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,596
You tickle me.

212
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,857
Hi, Milord.

213
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,402
Remember you said that if was ever in town
I should look up your wife?

214
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,908
I don't know what
everybody's so upset for.

215
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,452
I never humped her.

216
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:53,207
Just clean up my neck a little,
leave the top full.

217
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,259
Give me a good "ah".

218
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:49,055
In this side of my arm,
mostly at night.

219
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:53,226
I don't notice the impression in daytime,
but at night it bothers me.

220
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:55,853
I don't want to hurt you
but how far can you raise it?

221
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:59,065
Mr. Milos
would you come with me, please?

222
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:07,824
Come in, Mr. Milos.
sit down right over here.

223
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:11,160
I just want to get
some history first.

224
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:17,416
- Your name is...
- Stavros Milos.

225
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,419
- And your address?
- Armenia.

226
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:22,630
Armenia?
- I am from Armenia.

227
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:25,424
- I'm visiting my brother.
- I see.

228
00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:28,719
- Occupation?
- Shepherd.

229
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:32,265
- A shepherd?
- My whole family.

230
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:35,309
Except for my brother over here,
who is a rug salesman.

231
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:38,563
Have you had
any major illnesses?

232
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,565
None. Good.

233
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,528
So now,
what seems to be the trouble?

234
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,697
I'm in love with a sheep.

235
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,157
I beg your pardon?

236
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,952
I am in love with a sheep.

237
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,060
Ah... I see.

238
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:22,565
See, doctor. Up there in the mountains
where I tend my flocks...

239
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,942
it's so beautiful
under the starred skies...

240
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:28,196
and I am alone.
And sometimes I get so lonely.

241
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:32,575
And the hours pass,
and soon I desire a woman.

242
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:35,077
But doctor, there are no women.

243
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,580
I'm not married and...

244
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:41,209
Well, one night,
last summer...

245
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,544
I could stand it no longer.

246
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:46,964
My body needed to be satisfied.

247
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:50,927
- And... I saw her
- Who?

248
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,554
- Daisy.
- Sheep?

249
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:57,099
I took Daisy off
to a little cove...

250
00:20:57,183 --> 00:21:00,728
and there, under the Armenian sky,
we had sexual intercourse.

251
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:07,985
- With the sheep?
- Naturally.

252
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,992
Oh God!

253
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:18,663
It was the greatest lay
I ever had.

254
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:22,792
Mr. Milos, forgive me...

255
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:27,255
if I seemed all shocked.
I'm sorry.

256
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:30,716
Doctor, Mrs. Goldblatt is on the phone
about her rupture.

257
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,718
Later, later.

258
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,556
Mr. Milos...

259
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:40,309
Of course I'm happy
for the two of you...

260
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:44,063
but I do have
other patients.

261
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:47,500
And unless there is some...

262
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,444
specific way
that I could help you...

263
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:53,489
Doctor, please.
One minute.

264
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:56,367
See, the point is...

265
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,953
she no longer loves me.

266
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:00,955
That's why I'm here.

267
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:03,458
Because she's fallen out of love with me.

268
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,086
How can you tell that?

269
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,965
Oh, little things.
She is cold, indifferent.

270
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:15,011
Speak to her.
She'll listen to you.

271
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:16,679
Mr. Milos...

272
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:19,307
you are...

273
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:20,475
crazy.

274
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:22,977
I brought her all the day
from Armenia.

275
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:26,230
My brother says you are a great doctor.
You saved his life once.

276
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:30,193
You need a psychiatrist.
I am a medical doctor.

277
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,904
Speak to her, please.

278
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,615
I can't talk to a sheep.
Are you nuts?

279
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:37,617
She's outside,
in my brother's truck.

280
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,161
Would you get out of my office,
please?

281
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:42,413
I'm an MD!
I'm not a veterinarian!

282
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:43,915
I'll bring her in.

283
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:47,210
Don't bring any sheep in this office!
My mother just got finished paying for it!

284
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,254
Doctor, I am a simple man.
I'm no great man of wisdom.

285
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:52,840
- My brother says you are a great man.
- I'm not.

286
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:55,718
I'm just an ordinary GP,
that's all I am.

287
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,721
- I'll get her.
- No, Mr. Milos, what you don't understand.

288
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,223
It's not normal...

289
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:03,935
to experience mature love
for anything with four legs!

290
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,937
Wait till you meet her.

291
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,064
I can't believe that.

292
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:22,161
- I can't.
- This prescription isn't working.

293
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm sorry, I can't.
Would you sit down?

294
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:28,501
Would you sit down, Mrs...?
I can't, I'll talk...

295
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:33,464
Dr. Ross, this is Daisy.

296
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,550
Ah. Good.

297
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:39,637
Why don't you take her
right into my office.

298
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,392
You'll have to excuse me.
The sheep has...

299
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:46,435
strip throat.

300
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:53,317
Mr. Milos, I'm gonna have
to call the police.

301
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:57,613
Can we talk for a minute?
Mr. Milos, don't put that sheep on my desk, please.

302
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,408
You shouldn't do that.

303
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:04,036
- Isn't Daisy beautiful?
- Yes, she is beautiful.

304
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,498
Mr. Milos,
you are a very nice man.

305
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:09,500
I don't want to see
you get down to trouble.

306
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:13,296
what I don't think
you understand is that...

307
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:15,798
you have...

308
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:18,092
a psychiatric problem.

309
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:21,596
You really need to see a...

310
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:25,183
someone in
the psychiatry field.

311
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:27,393
I'm a medical doctor.

312
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:41,949
I know you didn't mean any harm...

313
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:44,535
bringing the sheep in here, but...

314
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:48,164
I have patients, you know?

315
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:50,166
Kidney problems and...

316
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:53,836
heart problems, and...

317
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,672
seeing a sheep just like that...

318
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:03,137
Hello, Daisy.

319
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,800
She is...

320
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,400
wonderful!

321
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,396
I'm doctor Ross.

322
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:15,608
Doug Ross.

323
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:38,381
I'd like to see
the two of you again...

324
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:42,885
but right now, you know
my office is jammed full.

325
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:45,304
Oh I knew you could help.

326
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:47,181
Thank you, doctor.

327
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:49,392
As a matter of fact...

328
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:51,894
if I could see Daisy alone...

329
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:54,188
maybe, you know...

330
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,691
Anything.
Anything.

331
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:08,161
- Darling, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

332
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:10,580
I'm just a little tired,
that's all.

333
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,000
Why don't you turn in early.

334
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,761
What're you doing?

335
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:28,264
Well, just nothing.

336
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:31,225
You're not doing just nothing.
You are fondling your landswool sweater.

337
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:37,732
I was not fondling
my landswool sweater.

338
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:39,984
What would I do
something like that for?

339
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,070
Well, God knows!

340
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:50,495
Doctor...

341
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:53,164
Mr. Milos brought in his sheep.

342
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,333
She's here?

343
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:01,964
Alright,
show her in.

344
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:24,987
Thank you.
You can go.

345
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,751
Hi...

346
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,796
darling.

347
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:46,425
I know this must all seem
very strange to you.

348
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:51,556
You're from the hills of Armenia,
and me from Jackson Heights.

349
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,516
And yet...

350
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,144
I think it could work...

351
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,354
if we gave it a chance.

352
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:08,489
A room, please.

353
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:18,332
Thank you very much.
Wait a second.

354
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:22,545
Here you are.

355
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,925
Do you want the "Do Not Disturb" sign
on the door?

356
00:28:28,926 --> 00:28:31,053
No, that's alright.

357
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,724
Ah alright, yes.
Thank you very much.

358
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,026
Room service?
This is Dr. Ross in room 525.

359
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:49,113
I would like to have
some chilled white Burgundy...

360
00:28:49,197 --> 00:28:52,200
a little caviar,
and some grass.

361
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:56,787
Oh,
just plain green grass.

362
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:01,083
That's 525.

363
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,752
Thank you.

364
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:11,594
Little Daisy.

365
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,515
Let's be gentle.

366
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:27,527
I'm... I can't.
I'm exhausted.

367
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:40,873
Boy...

368
00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:43,209
that was really something.

369
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:47,130
I never thought
it could be like this.

370
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:50,716
Never in my wildest imagination.

371
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:55,680
You're really something special.

372
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:59,100
I love our L-shaped room.

373
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:03,646
I'll never forget these afternoons
we have together.

374
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:09,819
I don't think I'd ever known
such peace and happiness in my life.

375
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,573
I hope you feel the same way.

376
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:32,425
Sorry, I'm sorry honey.
I was out when you phoned.

377
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:35,970
Emergency house call.
Mmmh you smell good.

378
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:39,724
Darling...

379
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:43,186
is it my imagination,
or do you always smell from lamb chops?

380
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:46,814
What do you mean, lamb chops?

381
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:49,650
What kind of silly thing is that
to say about lamb chops?

382
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:53,154
How could I possibly smell of lamb chops?
It's not logical.

383
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:56,365
What kind of cheap suit is this?

384
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,451
I'm set with these suits.

385
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:16,552
Ann! Wait a minute. I can explain.
We're just friends!

386
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:19,764
- How could you?
- This is Mrs. Bencourse.

387
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:21,849
One of my patients.

388
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:25,353
She thinks she's a sheep.
That's so.

389
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:27,396
It's nothing to it.

390
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:31,901
The defendant did commit
an adulterous act with a sheep.

391
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:36,739
It's most distasteful in view of the fact
the sheep was under 18 years old.

392
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:38,574
So what?

393
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:42,954
So Ann left me. So she's taken all my money,
all my savings.

394
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:45,915
My license has been revoked.

395
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:48,501
But I don't care.

396
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:52,255
If you are willing,
we'll get by somehow.

397
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:54,674
I'll get a job,
I don't know.

398
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:19,615
Don't be call me a waiter!
I'm a doctor!

399
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:22,493
Do you understand?
I am not a waiter! I am a doctor!

400
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:24,579
Don't call me a waiter!
I'm a doctor!

401
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,499
"Ah".
Say "ah".

402
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,671
Come here.
Break your legs apart.

403
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:36,382
Could you at least
not have eaten this morning?

404
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:39,302
It's not what I told.
What kind of a mess is that in there?

405
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:52,523
Daisy?
Honey?

406
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:59,113
"I have finally saved up
enough money...

407
00:32:59,155 --> 00:33:03,117
to come back to America
and take my Daisy home.

408
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:05,661
You did a terrible thing to me.

409
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:09,499
But now I've taken Daisy
to the mountains...

410
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,168
where you will never find her.

411
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,588
Stavros Milos."

412
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:40,256
Ho aspettato tanto questo momento.

413
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:45,720
Fabrizio, amore mio...

414
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:48,097
va' piano col mio imene.

415
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:50,683
Il tuo corpo è come una cattedrale.

416
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,562
Ora levati le mutande.

417
00:34:58,774 --> 00:35:01,027
Ti è piaciuto?

418
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,863
Si.

419
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:07,700
Non mi sembra
che ti sia divertita.

420
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:12,955
Sì, sei stato bravissimo.

421
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,418
Tu eri molto passiva,

422
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,962
come un salmone freddo.

423
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:25,468
Ma... ti è piaciuto?

424
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:29,222
A me?
È stato più divertente che ridere.

425
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:36,979
Forse la prossima volta
sarò più rilassata.

426
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:50,451
Marcello,
ne capisci di frigidezza?

427
00:35:53,496 --> 00:35:57,625
Tutto consiste nell'eccitare
la donna prima di possederla.

428
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,460
Quanto tempo?

429
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:02,046
Quindici minuti, mezz'ora.

430
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,965
E tua moglie?

431
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:06,134
Trenta secondi.

432
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:08,469
Fortunato!

433
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,181
Non dirmi che
tua moglie ha dei problemi!

434
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:15,184
No, non è così.

435
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:17,186
Ma tu la... la ecciti

436
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:19,730
prima di metterlo dentro?

437
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:23,025
Metterlo dentro... cosa?
Oh! No, no.

438
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:27,238
Non voglio parlare di Gina
come se fosse una puttana.

439
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:29,740
Da quanto tempo siete sposati?

440
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,034
Sei settimane.

441
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:36,998
Gioca con lei.
Accarezzala. Eccitala.

442
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,669
È sempre colpa dell'uomo. Ogni donna
può essere portata al godimento.

443
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:46,382
La settimana scorsa,
nel mezzo del...

444
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:49,635
Guardava la televisione!

445
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:53,055
Ma allora devi fare qualcosa di sbagliato!

446
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:57,518
Ogni donna ha... delle cose differenti.

447
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:02,315
Cerca di trovare le parti sensibili.

448
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:05,943
Suo padre me ne ha dato una pianta...

449
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:08,988
ma purtroppo...

450
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,706
Ora, girati.

451
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:21,501
Sì, girati.

452
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:25,296
Voglio dare uno sguardo
alla parte non vista.

453
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,427
Sì, eccitare...

454
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:33,429
Eccitare...

455
00:37:56,786 --> 00:38:00,790
Fabrizio, non c'è niente
che la Chiesa possa fare per te.

456
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:05,419
Se io potessi, e con molto piacere,
tenterei di fare arrivare tua moglie.

457
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:07,421
Ciò non è possibile.

458
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,757
E allora, tu tenta.
Almeno tu godrai!

459
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:12,718
E forse, un giorno,
anche lei godrà.

460
00:38:46,377 --> 00:38:49,505
Qui è il mio nuovo ufficio.

461
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:52,842
Cento persone lavoreranno per me.

462
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:55,178
Sì, sì...

463
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:58,389
Parlami della sua vita sessuale!

464
00:38:58,473 --> 00:39:00,641
Di tua moglie!

465
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:05,646
Lei geme, urla...

466
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,274
mi graffia la schiena!

467
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:11,068
Viene sei o sette volte!

468
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:14,530
È come una volpe in calore!

469
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:17,533
La mia giace sul letto
guardando il soffitto,

470
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:20,244
come morta!

471
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:23,289
Forse... l'hai piccolo?

472
00:39:24,373 --> 00:39:29,045
Piccolo? Come pane francese!

473
00:39:29,128 --> 00:39:31,881
Va bene. Allora non capisco.

474
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:44,060
Sei ancora depresso.

475
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,772
No. Sto bene.

476
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:54,278
No, tu ci pensi ancora.

477
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:57,698
Perché ti amo. Perché sei così bella!

478
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,159
E voglio che tu goda con me!

479
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:02,161
Ti prego...

480
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,429
Gina, cosa fai?

481
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:24,267
Prendimi. Dammelo.

482
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,769
- Qui?!
- Sì... sì!

483
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,653
- C'è gente tutto attorno!
- Non mi interessa.

484
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:41,534
Ci potrebbero scoprire!

485
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:44,954
Lo so, lo so... Prendimi!

486
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,958
Dammelo! Ora!

487
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,961
Mio Dio! Ora lo vuole!

488
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:26,621
La vita mi fa strani tiri.

489
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:31,042
Lei viene come un treno espresso.

490
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,754
La prossima notte, a letto,
stessa storia.

491
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:38,966
Amico mio, senti.

492
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:42,470
Io avverto una paura - d'essere scoperto.

493
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:48,142
Un po' come essere cattivi
d'intenzione, di fatto. Capisci?

494
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:52,021
Se hai bisogno tu...

495
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:57,443
Ascolta le mie parole.

496
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,988
Non c'è dubbio.

497
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:03,783
È una strana città.

498
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:18,297
Hai visto Fabrizio?

499
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,931
Fabrizio, ricorda quello che ti dico.

500
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:30,893
Sarai scoperto!
È pericoloso! Non lo fare!

501
00:42:30,977 --> 00:42:35,898
La settimana scorsa siamo stati
quasi scoperti.

502
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,401
In chiesa,
nel confessionale.

503
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:41,445
Ho ancora
i crampi alle gambe.

504
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,952
Fermati,
prima che sia troppo tardi.

505
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:20,338
Ma che sta facendo?

506
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:25,169
Ma questa è una cosa da pazzi!

507
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,552
- Chi è? Che succede?
- Lo stava facendo sotto la tavola!

508
00:43:30,286 --> 00:43:33,164
Sei arrabbiato con me?

509
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,501
Ti amo. Perlomeno sappiamo
che non sei frigida.

510
00:43:38,795 --> 00:43:41,589
Tu sei un marito meraviglioso.

511
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:46,135
Andiamo a dormire.

512
00:43:46,177 --> 00:43:48,137
Perché?

513
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:52,141
Non ti ricordi?
Domani andremo al Vaticano!

514
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:40,982
Do we have to jump there that early?
Where is it written we have to do it?

515
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:44,610
Oh Sam, it's Julie's fiance's birthday.
D'you wanna be late?

516
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:48,531
Listen, Tess,
I haven't been feeling well lately.

517
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:50,825
Oh come on, darling.
It's just psychosomatic.

518
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:53,411
A tension headache, by you,
is psychosomatic?

519
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:56,205
All of a sudden
you become a psychiatrist?

520
00:44:56,289 --> 00:44:58,207
Stop complaining, Sam.

521
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,085
It's Alvin's parents,
so it's an obligation.

522
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:03,754
Look Sam, I don't like them
any more than you do.

523
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:06,674
Or should I say
they send their looks down on us, huh?

524
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:10,219
Listen, I heard that, and you know what?
I think you're both a little paranoid.

525
00:45:10,303 --> 00:45:14,765
Alvin's parents are lovely people.
They like both of you very much.

526
00:45:19,979 --> 00:45:25,234
That's what I call a lawn.
Nice clipped, not like by us, overgrown.

527
00:45:25,276 --> 00:45:27,737
- Who is your gardener?
- Ey, me.

528
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,072
- You are the gardener?
- You're not.

529
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,868
- Sam, did you see the roses?
- I grow them.

530
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:02,188
- Excuse me.
- So heavenly.

531
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:04,524
- Where're you going, Sam?
- The bathroom.

532
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,109
It's upstairs.
First door to the left.

533
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:29,757
Yes, we prefer Bermuda
to Puerto Rico.

534
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:31,300
It's much nicer.

535
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:39,142
Of course, I like...

536
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:41,727
I enjoy wearing a formal garment
once in a while...

537
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:43,938
but when I'm on vacation...

538
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,566
I like to relax,
wear slags...

539
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:50,611
or little skirts, or blouses
and sweet little hats.

540
00:46:50,695 --> 00:46:54,282
Your husband and I
had quite a talk.

541
00:46:54,323 --> 00:46:57,952
He's a very gentle man,
and very interesting.

542
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:07,503
I'd love to.
I've never seen wood carving.

543
00:47:07,587 --> 00:47:12,216
Well, I mean, African heads,
and we pick them up in...

544
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,551
Bimini.

545
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:17,555
We got them for steal.
You won't believe the price we paid for them.

546
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:20,808
You want wood carvings?
I'll show you wood carvings. Tell 'em

547
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,686
You seriously must see these.
They are absolutely magnificent.

548
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,383
- George!
- Yes, dear?

549
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:57,428
They're on the top shelf in the closet,
I just remembered.

550
00:47:57,512 --> 00:47:59,680
The closet or the bureau?

551
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:02,058
Top shelf in the closet,
I just remembered.

552
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:04,185
Top shelf? Right.

553
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:41,472
You know, Bimini is a free port
and we got a marvelous buy on...

554
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:48,896
From Bimini, the Bahamas.

555
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:50,940
Beautiful, huh?

556
00:48:50,982 --> 00:48:53,025
- Yes.
- Look at the details.

557
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:55,278
- Very interesting.
- I'd like your husband to see these.

558
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:56,946
Thief! Purse snatcher!

559
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:01,617
Help! Help!

560
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:11,502
- We will send somebody for you.
- What happened?

561
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:17,133
You know? I'm wondering
what could be taking Sam so long.

562
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:20,303
- Would you excuse me just for a second?
- Certainly.

563
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:22,472
Are you alright, lady?

564
00:49:22,555 --> 00:49:25,475
Nothing, it's just
another crime in the street.

565
00:49:25,558 --> 00:49:28,769
An every-day happening,
and just happened to me.

566
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:32,148
- You're very lucky.
- Lucky? Well, don't know.

567
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:35,860
- Oh sure, I could have been dead, haha!!
- Absolutely right.

568
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:39,530
- Did you have any valuables in your purse?
- No, I don't think so.

569
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:42,158
You're probably wondering
why I wear...

570
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:46,871
I got a cold, it's gripping.
I don't feel good altogether.

571
00:49:46,954 --> 00:49:49,707
These young people today.
Are you sure you're right?

572
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:52,960
What can you do?
It's the society we're living in.

573
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:54,796
Don't make a fuzz.

574
00:49:56,547 --> 00:49:58,841
Sam, what did you do?
Fall in?

575
00:50:03,137 --> 00:50:05,056
Are you sure you're right?

576
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:10,853
All right, all right.
Who's the lady whose purse was snatched?

577
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:15,024
It's perfectly ok, officer.
I forgive the little rascal.

578
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:17,235
I'm sorry,
but I have to fill a report.

579
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:21,030
I don't want to press charges.
Really, silly.

580
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,332
- What's happening outside, Alvin?
- There's a crowd, and police.

581
00:50:31,415 --> 00:50:33,501
- Police?
- Exciting!

582
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:36,504
Me too.
I follow fire engines.

583
00:50:36,546 --> 00:50:38,005
Let's look.

584
00:50:47,014 --> 00:50:48,975
Name?

585
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:51,185
Jasmine.

586
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:53,479
Jasmine Glitz.

587
00:50:53,563 --> 00:50:57,233
- That's a very unusual name.
- Oh, you're sweet.

588
00:50:57,316 --> 00:50:58,985
What seems to be the trouble,
officer?

589
00:50:59,068 --> 00:51:01,529
It's nothing to be alarmed about.
It's just routine purse snatching.

590
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:03,239
Purse...

591
00:51:03,322 --> 00:51:05,908
I'm sorry, lady.
I'm very sorry.

592
00:51:05,992 --> 00:51:09,454
- If I lose my baby...
- Baby? Why don't you come in and lie down?

593
00:51:09,537 --> 00:51:12,039
- I'm three months' pregnant.
- I'm sorry.

594
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:14,917
My gynecologist told me
to avoid excitement.

595
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:20,548
- Please, come inside, let me...
- No, no.

596
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:24,927
Oh! My god!
She's my husband!

597
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:27,346
Sam! Sam Waterman?

598
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,558
Yes! Sam Waterman!
Yes, I am a man!

599
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,102
Look! Pull!

600
00:51:33,144 --> 00:51:35,897
George! Look!
Zip me up! Zip me now!

601
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:37,773
Yes, look at this.

602
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:40,693
And this.

603
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,287
Sam, you should have told me,
that's so.

604
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,289
I would have understood.

605
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:56,751
It's not the kind of thing
that's easy to talk about.

606
00:51:56,793 --> 00:52:00,421
Sam, we've been married for years.

607
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:03,716
I love you, you love me.

608
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,135
You could have come to me, and say:

609
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:10,473
"Tess, I have a diseased mind.

610
00:52:10,556 --> 00:52:12,975
I'm a sick individual.

611
00:52:13,017 --> 00:52:16,354
I need help.
I need treatment.

612
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:18,439
I'm perverted.

613
00:52:18,481 --> 00:52:22,985
I'm unfit to function
with normal, decent people."

614
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:26,322
- I would have understood.
- Thanks dear.

615
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:30,868
Tess, I'm gonna see Dr. Fillmore
next week.

616
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:33,121
- I'm glad.
- You're wonderful.

617
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:42,004
The look on their faces
when the police removed your hat...!

618
00:52:51,848 --> 00:52:55,309
Brought to you by Lancer's,
the hair-conditioner for men.

619
00:52:56,227 --> 00:52:58,354
You still use the same old stuff
in your hair, huh?

620
00:52:58,437 --> 00:53:00,064
Yes. Why?

621
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:01,732
Try this.

622
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:06,154
- Lancer's, really?
- Go ahead.

623
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,367
Hey, this is great.
No grease or oil.

624
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:14,036
That's right. Grooms and conditions
at the same time.

625
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,831
It smells great too.

626
00:53:16,914 --> 00:53:19,917
Lancer: the conditioner
that grooms and conditions.

627
00:53:28,926 --> 00:53:33,264
Lancer. For that better groom look.
A product of K Pharmaceuticals.

628
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:42,565
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

629
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:46,277
The most cordial welcome, once again,
to "What's My Perversion?"

630
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,821
Panel members,
you're all looking splendid this evening.

631
00:53:48,905 --> 00:53:52,700
Pamela and Tony, so beautiful,
and Regis and Robert Q., so handsome.

632
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:56,412
We have some very interesting
guests with us this evening...

633
00:53:56,496 --> 00:53:58,748
and I think we should get right
to them this moment.

634
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:02,585
So, first guest,
will you sign in, please.

635
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:12,220
Bernard...

636
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:13,888
Jaffe.

637
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,770
Jaffe, would you sit down, sir?

638
00:54:20,812 --> 00:54:23,815
A pleasure to have you with us here on
"What Is My Perversion?"

639
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:26,442
- I think you know the rules of our game.
- Yes I do.

640
00:54:26,526 --> 00:54:29,779
You'll get 5$ every time the panel
comes up with a "no" answer.

641
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:32,281
And to start the game going,
would you be kind enough to...

642
00:54:32,365 --> 00:54:35,076
whisper in my ear
what your perversion is.

643
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:38,121
And while you're doing that
we'll all at the studio and the home audience...

644
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:41,707
know exactly what your perversion is.

645
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:48,422
Good, alright
panel members.

646
00:54:48,464 --> 00:54:51,676
Studio audience, the home audience knows
what his perversion is.

647
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:54,595
- We start the questioning with Robert Q. Lewis.
- Thank you, Jack.

648
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:57,765
Mr. Jaffe: is this one of those
nice perversions...

649
00:54:57,849 --> 00:55:01,018
that any guy might indulge in?

650
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:03,646
Anybody can do it.
I'm sure you could.

651
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:06,524
- It's just a matter of wanting to.
- I see. Thank you.

652
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:11,737
Is this one of the perversions
that might best be performed in the home...

653
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:14,490
- or could you just do it anywhere?
- Not necessarily...

654
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:18,035
I think that'll get a "no" answer
and 5$ to you, Mr. Jaffe.

655
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,456
And we turn the question over
to Pamela Mason.

656
00:55:21,497 --> 00:55:24,667
Is it something that is
done with the hands?

657
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,794
- Can you help me with that?
- Yes.

658
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:31,174
I would think that would not necessarily
have to play a part in the procedure.

659
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:35,261
And we give you a "no" answer on that,
and it's 10$ for you, Mr. Jaffe.

660
00:55:35,344 --> 00:55:37,054
And Regis Philbin is up next.

661
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:39,223
When you're doing your perversion...

662
00:55:39,307 --> 00:55:42,518
Do you have any need for...
for props?

663
00:55:42,602 --> 00:55:43,936
Props?

664
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,565
- You know, whips or leather boots.
- Oh, no.

665
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:52,653
No no, that's definitively not necessary.
15$, Regis Philbin. And now Tony Holt.

666
00:55:52,737 --> 00:55:56,199
Mr. Jaffe, would a telescope
or a pair of binoculars...

667
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:58,868
be helpful to you in any time?

668
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:00,870
It would have to be
pointed...

669
00:56:00,953 --> 00:56:03,331
in the right direction.

670
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,833
But I think we have to object
to say that...

671
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:09,212
it would not be helpful to you,
but rather to somebody else.

672
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:12,757
And in that respect, I think
we must give you a "no" answer, Tony.

673
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,009
- Robert Q. Lewis.
- Are you...

674
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:18,554
I'll take a wild guess.
Are you a rapist?

675
00:56:19,388 --> 00:56:21,307
- Hardly.
- No.

676
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,852
Not at all.
25$, and Pamela Mason.

677
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:26,521
I'll pass to Regis.

678
00:56:26,562 --> 00:56:28,856
Is it self-contained?

679
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:33,569
Yes,
I carry it with me at all times.

680
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:36,531
I'm gonna take a guess,
I think I have it.

681
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:39,450
- What is it?
- Do you molest children?

682
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:41,744
No, I'm afraid
you're all at the wrong track.

683
00:56:41,828 --> 00:56:44,247
Would you like to tell them
exactly what your perversion is?

684
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,290
You already have your 50$.

685
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:51,129
- Yes. I like to expose myself
on subways.

686
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:53,422
Sorry, panel members.

687
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:56,926
And now,
the winner of this week's contest.

688
00:56:57,009 --> 00:57:00,429
As you know, each week we'll give you at home
an opportunity to play our game with us.

689
00:57:00,513 --> 00:57:04,308
We ask you to write and tell us
exactly what your perversion is.

690
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:07,228
We select the most interesting letter,
the contestant is flown in...

691
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:11,732
and we give that contestant a chance
to act out his fantasy here on the program.

692
00:57:11,816 --> 00:57:14,819
And now, it's with a great deal of pleasure
that I present this week's winner.

693
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:16,821
Ladies, gentlemen
and members of the panel...

694
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:21,117
here from of Muncie, Indiana, is our winner,
rabbi Chaim Baumel.

695
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:30,918
Well, congratulations to you,
Chaim Baumel.

696
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,754
Excuse me.
It's not Chaim.

697
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:35,590
It's not Caim.

698
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:38,634
- It's pronounced "Jaim".
- Jaim.

699
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:40,303
Very good.

700
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:43,139
I understand that, in addition to being
a very distinguished clergy...

701
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:46,309
you have a very, very fascinating fetish.

702
00:57:46,392 --> 00:57:49,812
- You mean a hang-up.
- Yes.

703
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:53,483
Yes. Silk stockings.

704
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:56,319
- Silk stockings?
- I love silk stockings.

705
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:59,489
To touch them, to hug them...

706
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:03,951
Now, you wrote in your letter
that what you'd like is to be...

707
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,454
tied up.

708
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:10,333
For this we need the help
of one of the members of the panel.

709
00:58:10,374 --> 00:58:13,795
How about someone to tie him up?
Regis Philbin, would you?

710
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:17,548
Excuse me.
Must be a girl.

711
00:58:17,632 --> 00:58:20,218
A girl. Alright,
we certainly have two lovely girls.

712
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:23,429
Pamela, would you do the honors
and tie up the rabbi?

713
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:25,848
- I would love to.
- Rabbi?

714
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:33,731
Now Pamela is going to tie
the rabbi Baumel...

715
00:58:33,815 --> 00:58:37,193
according to the wishes
as expressed in his letter.

716
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:41,322
I haven't had a lot of experience,
rabbi, but I think I can manage.

717
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:44,909
If you have any special instruction,
please let me know.

718
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:48,704
If any special area
that you'd like to have tied.

719
00:58:48,788 --> 00:58:50,706
Not too tight.

720
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:55,837
Good. And now a model
from the Lucy Jones modelling agency...

721
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,216
is going to pretend that she is
rabbi Baumel's governess...

722
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:03,010
and she's going to
spank the rabbi.

723
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:08,182
- You've been a naughty rabbi.
- While at the same time...

724
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:11,185
Not too hard. I have to be
in the synagogue tomorrow.

725
00:59:11,227 --> 00:59:15,857
Mrs. Baumel, the rabbi's wife,
who we've flown in from Indiana...

726
00:59:15,898 --> 00:59:18,234
will sit at the rabbi's feet...

727
00:59:18,276 --> 00:59:20,987
and eat pork.

728
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,698
You've been bad.
Naughty rabbi!

729
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:26,200
Now, don't you do that again.

730
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:28,035
Bad!

731
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:29,500
Naughty, naughty!

732
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:32,707
Well, here it is, America.

733
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:36,377
Another lucky winner
gets to act out his fantasy.

734
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:41,174
Now this is Jack Barry saying goodbye,
and good luck from myself and the panel.

735
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:46,095
And see you next week
on "What's My Perversion?"

736
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:21,422
Give me 50 cents with regular.

737
01:00:32,892 --> 01:00:35,812
Excuse me. My car broke down
about 2 miles down the road.

738
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:38,397
- Would you please send somebody to get it?
-Sure, madam. Right away.

739
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:39,732
Thank you very much.

740
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:42,318
How far is
Dr. Bernardo's house?

741
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:44,278
About 7 miles.

742
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,613
Damn it.

743
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:47,281
- Miss?
- Yeah?

744
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:50,451
Did I hear you say that
you're going to Dr. Bernardo's house?

745
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:52,912
Yeah, would you like a lift?
'Coz I'm going there now.

746
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:54,372
Jee, that'd be swell.

747
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:55,373
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

748
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:56,791
Good, come on.

749
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:02,922
Are you a friend of Dr. Bernardo?

750
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:06,676
Not exactly a friend. I'm gonna be working
with him, helping with his experiments.

751
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:09,220
Are you studying
sexual phenomenons too?

752
01:01:09,303 --> 01:01:12,682
Yes. I was a biology major
in school.

753
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:15,560
I've really been looking forward to
working with the doctor, you know.

754
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:17,812
He's a great hero of mine.

755
01:01:17,895 --> 01:01:20,481
I don't know if you know this or not,
but he was the first man...

756
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:23,276
that ever measured the sound waves
produced by an erection.

757
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,653
- Yes, I know.
- Do you?

758
01:01:26,654 --> 01:01:30,032
Yes, I'm a reporter for The Globe.
I'm going to interview Dr. Bernardo...

759
01:01:30,074 --> 01:01:32,618
for a story
on our Sunday supplement.

760
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:34,745
A reporter, huh?

761
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:36,539
You're kinda cute.

762
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:38,875
Yeah, but mind if you just
watch the road, huh?

763
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:42,628
- What's your name?
- Helen Lacey.

764
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:45,256
- What's yours?
- Victor.

765
01:01:45,339 --> 01:01:47,133
Victor Shackelpopolous.

766
01:02:43,773 --> 01:02:45,608
Is Dr. Bernardo here?

767
01:02:46,734 --> 01:02:48,611
I think he wants us to come in.

768
01:02:52,448 --> 01:02:53,991
The doctor's expecting us.

769
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:01,874
Look at this place!

770
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,459
Yes, it's really great.

771
01:03:03,543 --> 01:03:05,294
The decorator's still living?

772
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:06,754
It's chilly!

773
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:12,093
So what do you think?
Is Dr. Bernardo here or what?

774
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:14,220
I am Dr. Bernardo.

775
01:03:17,598 --> 01:03:19,809
You must be Victor...

776
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:21,435
and Miss Lacey.

777
01:03:22,854 --> 01:03:26,983
Igor, I thought I told you
to keep to your room.

778
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:36,951
Forgive me.

779
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:39,495
Usually he keeps
to his room.

780
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:42,915
I know there's a big problem
with domestics nowadays.

781
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,000
Come.

782
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,253
Shall we have dinner?

783
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:52,508
I understand you're famous
for your potato package.

784
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:55,511
Dr. Bernardo, you don't know
how excited I am to be here.

785
01:03:55,595 --> 01:03:57,680
I've waited so long
to meet you.

786
01:03:57,763 --> 01:04:01,184
I'm really looking forward to helping
you with your experiments.

787
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,895
I don't know if you read
my latest book...

788
01:04:03,978 --> 01:04:06,939
"Advanced Sexual Positions -
How To Achieve Them Without Laughing"...

789
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:08,983
but it's getting
to be a classic.

790
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,818
I'm familiar with it.

791
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:15,490
I think it's wonderful how you, men of science,
have finally gotten around to sex.

792
01:04:15,531 --> 01:04:20,203
All the girls at The Globe are so pleased
with your work on "Respiration During Orgasm".

793
01:04:20,286 --> 01:04:22,663
A mere trifle compared
to my real work.

794
01:04:22,705 --> 01:04:24,832
Doctor, I read a statement
you made that...

795
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:29,629
you felt that the average length
of the man's penis should be 19 inches.

796
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:31,631
Doesn't it seem a little long?

797
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:34,050
Long?

798
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:37,386
My friend, I'm making discoveries
you wouldn't dream of.

799
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:40,556
Yes I know, but 19 inches,
I mean...

800
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,184
- That's...
- Does that sound mad?

801
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,855
That's what they call me
at Masters and Johnson's clinic: mad.

802
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:51,609
Because I had visions of exploration
in sexual areas...

803
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:54,153
undreamed of
by less of human beings.

804
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:59,450
It was I who first discovered
how to make a man impotent by hiding his hat.

805
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:02,411
I was the first one
to explain the connection...

806
01:05:02,453 --> 01:05:05,748
between excessive masturbation
and entering politics.

807
01:05:05,832 --> 01:05:11,087
It was I who first said that
clitoral orgasm should not be only for women.

808
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:14,259
They laughed at me, ridiculed me.
They said I was mad.

809
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,300
Haha, but I showed them!

810
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:19,262
They threw me out
of Masters and Johnson.

811
01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:22,098
No severance pay.
And I had it coming,

812
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:23,558
but I showed them!

813
01:05:27,603 --> 01:05:29,063
We're having dessert?

814
01:05:31,023 --> 01:05:34,861
Oh, come. I want
to show you my laboratory.

815
01:05:34,862 --> 01:05:35,862
Igor!

816
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:41,909
Clean up this table.
And hurry!

817
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:47,623
You must forgive Igor.

818
01:05:47,707 --> 01:05:51,252
It was part of an experiment of mine
that backfired.

819
01:05:51,335 --> 01:05:55,923
Using an electrical generator,
I gave him a 4 hour orgasm.

820
01:05:55,965 --> 01:05:59,260
He had fun,
but he turned out like this.

821
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:06,225
Posture, posture.

822
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:12,774
Here is it.

823
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:15,943
Here is where I'm discovering
new facts about sex...

824
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:18,529
that sure will make me
a great man one day.

825
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,719
Dr. Bernardo,
what is all this?

826
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:44,305
Come this way and see.

827
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,110
Here I'm studying the premature
ejaculation in a hippopotamus.

828
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,113
How often does that problem
come up with the hippo?

829
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:05,493
Here I'm forcing a man to have
intercourse with a large rye bread.

830
01:07:05,535 --> 01:07:07,495
They're getting on famously.

831
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:11,791
Here, I'm going to take
the brain of a lesbian...

832
01:07:11,874 --> 01:07:16,337
and put it into the body of a man
who works for the telephone company.

833
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:18,965
But why? What good will this do anybody?

834
01:07:19,048 --> 01:07:22,176
It'll show those fools
who call me mad. Come.

835
01:07:24,887 --> 01:07:27,014
But, doctor, this is immoral.

836
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:30,977
Bullshit. Human mind is capable
of many strange things. Look.

837
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,647
Each day, to the past year,
I give her nothing but silicone.

838
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,649
She used to be flat-chested.

839
01:07:36,732 --> 01:07:39,360
Give me another year,
and watch up.

840
01:07:45,408 --> 01:07:46,784
You are insane.

841
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:49,954
That's what they said
at Masters and Johnson.

842
01:07:50,037 --> 01:07:53,583
And all because I built
a 400 foot diaphragm.

843
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:59,380
Birth control
for an entire nation at once!

844
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:06,929
You, you will be the subject
of my newest experiment.

845
01:08:07,013 --> 01:08:08,222
Me?

846
01:08:08,306 --> 01:08:10,600
Yes. Look here.

847
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:16,105
In here I have 20 scouts.

848
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:19,859
I want to measure your respiration
when they bang you.

849
01:08:19,942 --> 01:08:21,694
No!

850
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,910
Get away from her.

851
01:08:28,951 --> 01:08:31,705
Why don't you let her
relax and enjoy it?

852
01:08:31,789 --> 01:08:35,374
You shoot this girl,
and I'll sue you for mad practice.

853
01:08:40,004 --> 01:08:42,256
Victor, do something!

854
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:44,425
Keep your legs crossed.

855
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:05,715
Now we owe them a dinner.

856
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:11,012
What's wrong, Victor?

857
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:14,265
I think the battery is dead,
we're out of gas, oil, and water.

858
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:23,608
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

859
01:10:25,651 --> 01:10:28,696
- What was that?
- That sounded like Igor!

860
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,156
Victor! Look!

861
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:34,619
God!

862
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:36,579
A gigantic tit!

863
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:41,042
Oh Victor,
what are we gonna do?

864
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:44,587
What you're gonna do, I'm going home
to get my catcher's mitt.

865
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:47,465
Look, it looks angry.
The nipple is getting erect!

866
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:48,841
Oh Victor!
Come on, let's go!

867
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:52,053
Not so quickly.
They're all boys in my family.

868
01:11:09,695 --> 01:11:11,697
Sheriff, I wanna report
on a escaped tit.

869
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:12,740
A what?

870
01:11:12,824 --> 01:11:16,911
It's already killed two people,
Dr. Bernardo and his assistant.

871
01:11:16,994 --> 01:11:19,247
- A tremendous tit.
- Have you been drinking?

872
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:21,249
Listen, we don't have time
to argue here.

873
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:25,378
While we're standing here, the countryside
is being ravaged by a colossal boob.

874
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:33,136
You've got the most beautiful brests.

875
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:37,140
There's something wrong with the radio.

876
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:40,518
- Don't worry.
- Look, it's something wrong with the radio.

877
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:41,853
See?

878
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:46,482
Oh, my God!

879
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:49,068
Jesus Christ!

880
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,449
Run!

881
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:10,131
Be on the lookout
for a large female breast.

882
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:12,633
It's about 4,000
with an X cup.

883
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:15,636
About a 4,000 with an X cup.

884
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:16,971
Let's go.

885
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:20,975
"Everybody Needs Milk"

886
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:31,778
We're too late.
He's dead.

887
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,864
Yeah I know. The cream slowed him up
and the milk killed him.

888
01:12:34,947 --> 01:12:37,241
We're up against a very clever tit.

889
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:38,826
It shoots half and half.

890
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,622
Victor, what are we gonna do
to stop this fiendish tit?

891
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:46,417
I got an idea, but I have to get
my hands on some camouflage.

892
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:48,419
You can get all the camouflage you need!

893
01:12:48,503 --> 01:12:50,671
Oh Victor, please don't do
anything dangerous.

894
01:12:50,713 --> 01:12:53,841
No worry.
I know how to handle tits.

895
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:05,830
Victor! I'm so proud of you.
You did it!

896
01:14:06,914 --> 01:14:09,083
I was so worried.
Were you scared?

897
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,252
Are you kidding? Do I look like
the kind of guy who gets scared?

898
01:14:11,294 --> 01:14:13,337
Oh I was. I thought you were
gonna get nursed to death.

899
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:16,382
Well, everything is all secure now.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

900
01:14:16,466 --> 01:14:20,386
But one thing bothers me though.
That's a single, you sure that was a single?

901
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:23,806
- That was a single, yeah.
- Yeah, well see, they usually travel in pairs.

902
01:14:23,848 --> 01:14:26,601
- No, you don't have to worry about this.
- Well I've never seen one by itself.

903
01:14:26,642 --> 01:14:28,728
I mean... two? yes.
But not just one.

904
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:30,750
So what we're gonna do,
we're gonna take a nipple print...

905
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:32,900
just so we'll have a deal of occasion on this, see?

906
01:14:33,024 --> 01:14:37,487
Now, I think we'll put her
on probation for maybe 90 days...

907
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:42,074
and then take her down to the orphanage, because
there's a lot of hungry babies down there.

908
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:44,494
So, you both
take care of yourselves now.

909
01:14:46,746 --> 01:14:51,042
You were so magnificent up there.
I knew then that I wanted you.

910
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,961
Well, I don't wanna say
anything about this, Helen...

911
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:57,048
I kinda had a personal
stake in this case.

912
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,841
You know, I'd never told
anyone this before,

913
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:03,012
but when I was a little child,
I was breast-fed with false tits.

914
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:06,933
The truth is that I've learned
one thing from this whole situation.

915
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:11,187
When it comes to sex, there are certain things
that should always be left unknown.

916
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,107
And with my luck,
they probably will be.

917
01:15:37,839 --> 01:15:39,382
Brain room.

918
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:41,342
Come in, motor function 12.

919
01:15:41,384 --> 01:15:42,468
Check.

920
01:15:43,845 --> 01:15:45,763
His leg itches.

921
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:51,018
Scratch the left leg.

922
01:15:51,102 --> 01:15:53,020
Leg has been scratched.

923
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:56,566
There's a joke coming in 4-1.

924
01:15:56,649 --> 01:15:58,359
Prepare response for incoming joke.

925
01:15:58,401 --> 01:16:00,236
Joke response, 18.2.

926
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:02,613
- Smile, please.
- He is smiling.

927
01:16:02,697 --> 01:16:04,282
Brain to stomach,
brain to stomach.

928
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:06,576
Stomach to brain. Over.

929
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,494
- Food coming down.
- What kind?

930
01:16:08,578 --> 01:16:11,539
- Fettuccini.
- Jesus Christ!

931
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:14,584
- Italian food coming down!
- Again?

932
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:16,002
Italian food!

933
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:22,967
Stomach proceeding
with breakdown fettuccini.

934
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,678
This is mission control!
Mission control!

935
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:27,680
Please stand by the systems' check.

936
01:16:28,598 --> 01:16:30,558
Well, what do you think?

937
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,560
No, thanks.

938
01:16:32,602 --> 01:16:34,312
Think we're gonna have intercourse tonight?

939
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:37,398
I'm very optimistic.
Dinner date is very good.

940
01:16:37,482 --> 01:16:39,317
- Have you seen her?
- No, I haven't had the chance.

941
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,861
I had a busy day.

942
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:43,946
She's lovely.
You should take a look.

943
01:16:46,365 --> 01:16:48,326
Brain to eyes,
brain to eyes. Coming!

944
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:49,869
Eyes to brain. Over.

945
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:53,122
Approach on the dinner date.
I want to check out something, please.

946
01:16:53,206 --> 01:16:55,041
- You want the whole body?
- Yes, please.

947
01:17:01,464 --> 01:17:03,382
Hey! It would be a shame to lose this one.

948
01:17:03,466 --> 01:17:04,801
Huh!

949
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:08,387
Any indication yet?

950
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:12,350
Brain to ears, brain to ears.
Can you throw some voice up here?

951
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,603
Yes. For me,...

952
01:17:15,645 --> 01:17:19,774
Norman Mailer has exactly
that same sort of relevance,

953
01:17:19,816 --> 01:17:22,610
that affirmative-negative duality...

954
01:17:22,652 --> 01:17:26,531
that only Proust or Flaubert
could achieve.

955
01:17:26,614 --> 01:17:29,242
I don't know whether we're gonna make it or not.
It doesn't look too good.

956
01:17:29,325 --> 01:17:32,036
I'm graduate from
New York University.

957
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,704
We're gonna make it.

958
01:17:33,788 --> 01:17:35,206
I'm worried.

959
01:17:35,998 --> 01:17:38,626
- For a possible failure, huh?
- Yes.

960
01:17:39,377 --> 01:17:41,295
Anyone can have a fiasco
now and then...

961
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:45,007
but few in a row could be
too a serious loss of confidence.

962
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:48,427
Well you can see what it's doing
to moral around here already.

963
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:50,096
Don't worry.

964
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:51,639
We're gonna bring this off.

965
01:17:51,681 --> 01:17:55,560
My place or your place? To me,
it doesn't matter where we're doing it.

966
01:17:55,643 --> 01:17:57,395
Hey, why do you look so scared?

967
01:17:57,478 --> 01:17:59,900
God, damn it!
Who placed this scared expression?

968
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,700
Come on!

969
01:18:02,066 --> 01:18:05,528
- Anybody pressed "frightened"?
- No way. Must be a short circuit somewhere.

970
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:07,280
It's all we need now.

971
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:11,784
Mission control!
Prepare for launching!

972
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,000
Prepare for launching!

973
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,163
It looks like we're gonna do it.

974
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:16,956
Attention, sperm.

975
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,375
Stand by.

976
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:21,919
Well, here we go again.

977
01:18:22,003 --> 01:18:25,381
- You think we'll get out this time?
- I hope it's not another false alarm.

978
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:27,800
They're having trouble
down in engineering.

979
01:18:27,884 --> 01:18:29,552
They say it was all mental.

980
01:18:30,511 --> 01:18:32,305
You're treading on my tail.

981
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:33,681
Sorry.

982
01:18:33,723 --> 01:18:37,268
Well, heart factors are all balanced.
We could use a little more adrenaline.

983
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:40,354
This is the adrenal gland.
We are pumping away here.

984
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:43,191
Oh my God, Sydney.
Can't you wait?

985
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:45,526
Do you want to do it right here
in the parking lot?

986
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,904
Signal the voice to
answer the affirmative.

987
01:18:47,987 --> 01:18:49,288
All the systems on the alert.

988
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,800
We're gonna try to bull her
right there in the car.

989
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,121
Ears! Quickly! Ears!

990
01:18:57,205 --> 01:19:00,792
I made it in cars before,
but always in hardtops.

991
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:03,753
- Prepared for launching.
- Brain on to sexual organs.

992
01:19:03,795 --> 01:19:06,214
- Proceed with the erection.
- It's stuck!

993
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:08,007
Let's go, boys!

994
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:12,762
Come on, get it up, fellas!
Push! All together!

995
01:19:16,265 --> 01:19:18,017
Roll out the tongue.

996
01:19:22,688 --> 01:19:25,483
Here comes the kiss.
Hang on!

997
01:19:30,613 --> 01:19:32,281
Activate pleasure center.

998
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,789
Could we please have an erection?
What the hell is going on down there?

999
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:42,375
I know you can do it,
boys. Hold on!

1000
01:19:45,586 --> 01:19:48,965
What's wrong with you?
Don't keep there stop.

1001
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:51,968
What's the matter,
Sydney?

1002
01:19:52,051 --> 01:19:53,845
Mantain hands on breasts.

1003
01:19:53,928 --> 01:19:55,805
Yes, sir. And we're having
trouble with respiration.

1004
01:19:55,888 --> 01:19:58,099
We're way over
the limit down here.

1005
01:19:58,182 --> 01:20:01,185
If you're not getting an erection,
something's wrong.

1006
01:20:01,269 --> 01:20:03,521
Proceed with the erection.
All the systems, go.

1007
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:08,025
Let's go, boys! All together!
We gotta get it up.

1008
01:20:08,109 --> 01:20:10,361
What the hell is going on down here?

1009
01:20:10,445 --> 01:20:11,863
I need an erection!

1010
01:20:11,946 --> 01:20:14,782
We need more help from the brain.

1011
01:20:14,824 --> 01:20:17,410
Have you checked if there's
some problem in the stomach?

1012
01:20:17,493 --> 01:20:20,705
Fettuccini is moving on nicely.

1013
01:20:20,788 --> 01:20:24,000
A couple of injuries
from the veal scallopini though.

1014
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:27,295
I am not laughing, Sydney.
Honestly.

1015
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:30,548
Now kiss me.

1016
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,509
We have an erection of 45 degrees.

1017
01:20:33,593 --> 01:20:36,554
- Shall we attempt penetration?
- Prepare for penetration.

1018
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:42,935
Well, this looks like it!

1019
01:20:43,019 --> 01:20:44,812
I just wonder what it's like out there?

1020
01:20:44,854 --> 01:20:47,398
It's like they told us
in training school. It's an ovum.

1021
01:20:47,482 --> 01:20:49,901
I'm scared.
I don't want to go.

1022
01:20:49,984 --> 01:20:52,862
But this is what
all this training was for.

1023
01:20:52,945 --> 01:20:55,740
But who knows what
it's gonna be like out there.

1024
01:20:55,823 --> 01:20:57,658
You saw slides in class.

1025
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:01,704
Yeah, but you hear strange stories,
you know...

1026
01:21:01,788 --> 01:21:04,499
like... like there's
this pill these women take...

1027
01:21:04,582 --> 01:21:08,544
or sometimes these guys are slammed
their heads up against a wall of hard rubber...

1028
01:21:08,628 --> 01:21:10,546
Oh that's nonsense.

1029
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:14,175
Or what if it's a homosexual encounter.

1030
01:21:14,258 --> 01:21:16,636
Look, this is no time
to doubt our Mission.

1031
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:19,096
You took an oath
when you entered sperm training school...

1032
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,849
to fertilize an ovum
or die trying.

1033
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:24,602
I'm scared!
I don't want to go out there.

1034
01:21:24,685 --> 01:21:27,939
We're too low to attempt penetration!
The man can't hold!

1035
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:29,148
We gotta hold!

1036
01:21:29,232 --> 01:21:31,734
We need more stimulation
from the pleasure center.

1037
01:21:31,818 --> 01:21:34,946
Organ room to Brain control.
Re-stimulate pleasure center!

1038
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:38,449
- Prepare to stroke her thighs.
- We're on her thighs, and stroking!

1039
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:40,701
Attention, mouth.
Attention, mouth.

1040
01:21:40,743 --> 01:21:42,620
Please blow in her ear.

1041
01:21:42,703 --> 01:21:45,289
The erection is 45 grades,
and holding fast.

1042
01:21:45,373 --> 01:21:48,960
Re-adjust mouth. We're missing
her ear and blowing into her nose

1043
01:21:49,043 --> 01:21:51,838
- Attempt penetration.
- Fellas!

1044
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:55,007
That's not gonna work.
The angle is bad.

1045
01:21:55,091 --> 01:21:58,886
Hey, we're gonna make babies!

1046
01:22:12,775 --> 01:22:14,819
This is Mission control.
Penetrate!

1047
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:16,529
We can't! It's no use!

1048
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:19,157
Hold tight, men!
We're losing it!

1049
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,956
What am I doing here?

1050
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,791
What am I doing here?

1051
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:32,587
It's bending!
Let's get it up, boys!

1052
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:34,172
Alright! Hold!

1053
01:22:34,255 --> 01:22:36,507
It's no use.
We're losing it.

1054
01:22:36,591 --> 01:22:38,634
Start preparing an alibi
to save face.

1055
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:42,972
We found him interfering with
the machinery in the cerebral cortex...

1056
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:44,515
Turning up the guilt reflex.

1057
01:22:44,599 --> 01:22:47,310
It's a lie!
I never touched anything.

1058
01:22:47,393 --> 01:22:50,146
- It's a lie, sir.
- I work in the conscience room.

1059
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:53,316
We found the conscience tied to a chair.
He knocked him out.

1060
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:55,067
Is this true?

1061
01:22:55,151 --> 01:22:56,944
And what if it is?

1062
01:22:56,986 --> 01:22:59,113
Don't you think you should
be ashamed of this?

1063
01:22:59,197 --> 01:23:02,325
Sexual relation unmarried people?

1064
01:23:02,408 --> 01:23:04,327
To take an innocent woman...

1065
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:08,873
and assault her in a brutal,
sadistic, ungodlike manner, it's...

1066
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,833
blasphemy!

1067
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:12,210
Lock him up!

1068
01:23:13,836 --> 01:23:17,298
- Sabotage is over.
- Blasphemy!

1069
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,717
It's blasphemy!

1070
01:23:19,801 --> 01:23:22,345
Full steam ahead!

1071
01:23:24,764 --> 01:23:26,307
Here we go again.

1072
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:29,685
I'm not going out there,
I'm not gonna get shot out of that thing!

1073
01:23:29,769 --> 01:23:32,730
What if it's masturbating?
I might end up in the ceiling!

1074
01:23:34,482 --> 01:23:35,858
Get hold of yourself.

1075
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,611
Fellas, it's dark out there.

1076
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:43,241
I'm due with my parents for dinner.

1077
01:24:15,481 --> 01:24:17,692
We're inside!
We're making it!

1078
01:24:20,486 --> 01:24:23,865
Head memory, think of baseball players
to keep sperm from launching.

1079
01:24:39,213 --> 01:24:41,966
Cannot hold it any longer.
Prepare to release the sperm.

1080
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:44,177
Willie Mays.
Joe Namath. Mickey Mantle.

1081
01:24:49,599 --> 01:24:52,643
See you guys in the ovary!

1082
01:24:52,727 --> 01:24:54,270
Give me an egg!

1083
01:24:55,438 --> 01:24:57,648
Well, at least he is Jewish.

1084
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:27,428
Listen, everybody.

1085
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:29,597
Can I have your attention.
This is Mission control.

1086
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:34,352
I just wanna congratulate
everybody on a fine job, well done.

1087
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:36,187
And I mean that, sincerely.

1088
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,523
It was hectic, but we brought it through.

1089
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:43,611
- She was worth it.
- Yes she was.

1090
01:25:43,653 --> 01:25:45,029
I'll drink to that.

1091
01:25:47,782 --> 01:25:50,201
That was great, Sydney.

1092
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:55,081
Let's do it one more time.

1093
01:25:55,164 --> 01:25:57,917
Hey!
Everybody, stand by!

1094
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,836
Here we go again.

1095
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:05,091
Attention all hands.

1096
01:26:05,174 --> 01:26:07,135
Stand by.

1097
01:26:07,218 --> 01:26:09,095
- Give me a fatigue reading.
- Four and a half.

1098
01:26:09,178 --> 01:26:13,015
Fatigue reading, four and a half.
Looks good. We're going for the second.

1099
01:26:13,057 --> 01:26:16,394
Attention, gonads.
We're going for record.
