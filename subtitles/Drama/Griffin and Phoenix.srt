1
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:56,532
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:56,567 --> 00:01:00,947
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:04,909
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow,
maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:07,829
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:10,748
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:14,085
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:17,005
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:22,392
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:25,972
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,439
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:32,228
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,731
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,337
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,701
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:44,289
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:50,163
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:54,924
"Don't kill Cedric. "

18
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,253
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,258
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum. "

20
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:05,178
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:08,514
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,808
She dead?

23
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,484
Is she dead?

24
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:15,605
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,663
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:35,798
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,962
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:41,255
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:33,391
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,511
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:42,210
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,840
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,760
They might come back.

34
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:54,479
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:58,685
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,726
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,697
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:08,069
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:11,406
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,325
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,627
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:22,875
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:34,345
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,639
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:39,055
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,436
Is that you?

47
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:47,692
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,612
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,323
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,370
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:02,915
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,009
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:10,632
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,891
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:17,305
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:32,911
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:38,055
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,164
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,423
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,629
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,305
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,302
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,516
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,981
Justice.

65
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,370
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,759
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:45,335
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,915
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:54,302
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,882
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:03,096
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,598
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:06,814
But the letter said...

74
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:09,978
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,445
...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,025
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,483
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,907
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:32,292
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:24,218
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,764
Come on.

82
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:08,846
In you go, son.

83
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,557
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,399
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:17,188
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:20,942
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,078
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:29,701
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:33,211
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:36,547
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:41,587
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,844
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,849
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:59,731
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:05,153
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:07,238
Yeah.

97
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:14,294
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,334
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:22,253
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,215
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,987
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:44,567
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:47,904
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,326
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:59,582
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:02,502
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:06,881
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,175
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,477
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,640
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:18,942
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:22,313
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,155
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,214
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,238
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:33,592
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:36,911
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:37,919
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:41,916
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,253
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:49,424
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,474
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,637
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:56,896
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:56,931 --> 00:14:01,102
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it
out. - Lf you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:04,230
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:08,401
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:10,695
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,328
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:15,039
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:18,202
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,670
He's as good as.

133
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,547
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:25,258
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:28,421
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.

136
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:30,524
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,618
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,642
About your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,597
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:39,439
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,524
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,818
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:46,773
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:52,403
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,366
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:59,042
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:02,205
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,499
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,758
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:09,504
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,423
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,386
Sirius.

153
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,858
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:27,647
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:31,818
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:36,197
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:49,544
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:56,009
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:59,345
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,770
Why?

161
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:02,855
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,497
No one in their right mind
could believe that...

163
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,104
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,232
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,986
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,662
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,999
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:25,204
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,750
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:34,797
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:38,099
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:43,035
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,936
He's been recruiting heavily,
and we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:52,523
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,320
We believe...

176
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,822
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:01,491
Sirius.

178
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,164
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,049
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:15,220
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:18,348
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:22,762
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:36,699
Harry.

184
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,993
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:42,573
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:53,174
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:56,129
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:15,106
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:21,362
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:26,367
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:09,014
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,246
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:16,000
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:40,817
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:44,535
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,950
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:57,048
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:01,045
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,339
In five minutes.

200
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,392
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:20,648
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:23,359
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:33,369
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:37,244
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,085
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,962
Yes?

207
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:46,507
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,844
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,857
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:58,985
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,774
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,110
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

213
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:08,838
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:11,532
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,251
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:18,831
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,507
...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:26,130
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:29,641
The charges?

220
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:32,387
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

221
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,229
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:38,017
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:41,267
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:44,447
...in the presence of a Muggle. "

225
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:47,992
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:51,572
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:54,701
...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:58,211
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:58,246 --> 00:22:01,165
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,510
Dementors?

231
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:07,630
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,681
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:13,261
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

234
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:15,520
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:18,231
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:22,645
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,233
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:32,447
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:38,911
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,464
What did they look like?

241
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:48,547
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:53,613
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:57,263
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:03,067
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:03,102 --> 00:23:06,613
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:11,861
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:15,823
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:17,665
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,245
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:26,216
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

251
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:31,256
Dementors are, after all,
under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:36,226
And it's so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:40,431
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:43,316
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:47,730
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:51,276
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:55,238
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

258
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:58,470
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:01,286
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:08,550
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:13,172
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,718
He is not back.

263
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:24,642
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:27,318
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:31,941
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:35,034
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

267
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:38,406
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:41,951
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

269
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:53,838
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:07,602
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:23,868
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,665
Professor.

273
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:44,097
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:47,225
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:57,860
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

276
00:25:57,895 --> 00:26:01,197
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,916
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:07,453
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,295
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,961
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:23,303
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:25,144
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:28,099
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:31,853
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,730
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:35,363
Neville's parents.

287
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:39,777
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

288
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:44,157
It's been 14 years.

289
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:49,162
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:53,124 --> 00:26:56,461
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:02,091
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:08,104
You keep it.

293
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:13,144
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:16,689
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:19,400
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,694
I love you.

297
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:24,162
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:24,197 --> 00:27:26,491
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:28,576
Bye.

300
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:13,204
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,837
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:18,835
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

303
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:25,300
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,428
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:30,930
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,749
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:54,078
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:08,676
What is it?

309
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:14,098
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:17,226
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,938
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:35,787
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:40,583
I can see them too.

314
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,545
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:51,427
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:56,224
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:02,272
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,191
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:08,111
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,289
Hungry.

321
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:16,035
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:20,623
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,804
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:38,523
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,686
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:45,144
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,568
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:52,947
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:56,249
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:56,284 --> 00:31:00,663
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:06,502
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

332
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,814
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:25,314
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,902
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:33,995
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,452
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:42,163
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:47,550
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:52,633
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:55,892
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:55,927 --> 00:32:01,557
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:07,065
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

343
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:13,236
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

344
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:16,955
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,080
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:34,924
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,929
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:42,397
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:32:42,432 --> 00:32:46,603
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:07,630
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:10,376
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:13,087
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:16,215
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

354
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,934
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:23,514
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:24,939
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:27,025
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,361
I guess you should read the Prophet, then,
like your stupid mother.

359
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:34,150
- Don't talk about my mother. - I'll have
a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:36,618
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:39,989
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,283
Yeah. I do.

363
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,203
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

364
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:56,638
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:59,974
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:04,389
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:12,522
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

368
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,926
Harry.

369
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:59,444
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:03,406
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:20,298
Good morning, children.

372
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:27,180
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,856
O- W-Ls.

374
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:34,652
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:37,989
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:43,863
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

377
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:54,082
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,341
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

379
00:35:56,376 --> 00:36:00,129
...you will be following
a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:36:00,164 --> 00:36:03,466
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:07,011
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:08,645
Using spells?

383
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,642
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:15,526
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:20,775
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,025
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,240
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,835
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,790
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

390
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:37,840
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,552
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

392
00:36:40,587 --> 00:36:43,506
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

393
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,557
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:48,928
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

395
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:52,682
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,905
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,539
You have been told...

398
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:14,961
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

399
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:20,418
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:22,051
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,588
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

402
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:27,091
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

403
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:29,385
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,384
Enough!

405
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:33,313
Enough.

406
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:38,353
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:04,212
Come in.

408
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,511
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:13,388
Sit.

410
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:24,440
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:26,491
No, not with your quill.

412
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:30,488
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

413
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:36,953
Now...

414
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:42,835
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies. "

415
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:47,554
How many times?

416
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:52,802
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

417
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:56,243
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,224
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,985
Yes?

420
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:01,621
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:05,374
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:08,711
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:12,048
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:17,887
Go on.

425
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,940
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:30,573
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:34,988
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:36,829
Care for another?

429
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,575
- I'm not asking you to write all of it
for me. - Please.

430
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,121
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:44,963
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:48,925
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,756
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:40:58,344 --> 00:41:00,847
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:02,932
Nothing.

436
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:06,060
The other hand.

437
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,988
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:12,317
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

439
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:14,837
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,287
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

441
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:21,909
- Lf the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:26,671
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:30,460
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

444
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:33,796
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

445
00:41:34,213 --> 00:41:36,925
You don't understand.

446
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,512
Then help us to.

447
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:57,952
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:41:57,987 --> 00:41:59,829
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:05,078
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:12,377
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:16,547
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

452
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:52,834
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:42:54,919 --> 00:43:00,133
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:05,138
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:08,683
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:18,658
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:43:18,693 --> 00:43:24,532
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

458
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:29,120
Different.

459
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:34,090
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:38,296
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

461
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:42,467
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

462
00:43:42,502 --> 00:43:44,726
My mum.

463
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:49,766
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:53,311
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

465
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:55,935
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,489
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:43:58,524 --> 00:44:03,572
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

468
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:09,369
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:15,103
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,
and you fought him...

470
00:44:15,138 --> 00:44:18,336
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

471
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:22,715
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

472
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,801
I don't think that's true.

473
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:29,806
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:32,273
What do you mean?

475
00:44:32,308 --> 00:44:34,567
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

476
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:38,356
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

477
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:41,693
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:44,821
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:07,135
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:11,723
Harry.

481
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:14,642
Can I join you?

482
00:45:16,102 --> 00:45:19,126
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:22,949
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

484
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:26,738
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:28,580
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:45:28,615 --> 00:45:32,785
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

487
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,210
...Minerva.

488
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:39,042
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

489
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:41,718
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:45,298
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:48,426
...and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:50,268
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:55,934
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:45:57,185 --> 00:45:59,479
Disloyalty.

495
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:04,692
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

496
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:08,863
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

497
00:46:19,707 --> 00:46:22,105
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,469
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:46:24,504 --> 00:46:27,632
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:32,845
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:39,519
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:49,077
Just one question, dear.

503
00:46:49,112 --> 00:46:53,908
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

504
00:46:59,956 --> 00:47:05,378
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:07,637
Yes.

506
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:11,009
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:47:11,634 --> 00:47:14,554
Obviously.

508
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:50,423
Could you please predict something
for me?

509
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,343
I'm sorry?

510
00:47:57,931 --> 00:48:00,850
Move those mouths.

511
00:48:06,272 --> 00:48:10,026
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,290
Pity.

513
00:48:17,325 --> 00:48:19,827
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

514
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:23,598
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:27,335
You are in grave danger.

516
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:30,672
Lovely.

517
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,871
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:48:42,906 --> 00:48:45,478
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:18,428
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,973
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:49:23,224 --> 00:49:25,727
You can't do this.

522
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:29,480
Actually, I can.

523
00:49:37,614 --> 00:49:39,247
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:42,410
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

525
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,704
There...

526
00:49:58,051 --> 00:50:03,264
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,601
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,686
Thank you.

529
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:13,448
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

530
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:16,819
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

531
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:20,121
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:50:20,156 --> 00:50:23,910
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:27,664
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:30,792
For now.

535
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:38,925
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,593
Professor.

537
00:50:41,844 --> 00:50:43,478
Professor?

538
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:46,432
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:49,143
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:50:59,153 --> 00:51:01,829
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:51:01,864 --> 00:51:07,287
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:09,337
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:51:09,372 --> 00:51:14,377
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:51:14,412 --> 00:51:17,418
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

545
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:20,920
...that these disappearances
are the work...

546
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:24,387
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:26,490
Harry.

548
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:28,558
Sirius.

549
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:31,442
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:51:31,477 --> 00:51:34,606
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,656
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:39,993
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:51:40,028 --> 00:51:44,407
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:51:44,442 --> 00:51:45,832
Combat?

555
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:48,995
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,420
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:54,834
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:58,553
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

559
00:51:58,588 --> 00:52:02,133
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:52:02,168 --> 00:52:05,678
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

561
00:52:05,713 --> 00:52:08,354
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

562
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:12,977
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:52:13,186 --> 00:52:16,105
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,312
Well, what can we do?

565
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:20,450
Someone's coming.

566
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:22,952
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:52:22,987 --> 00:52:28,618
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

568
00:52:39,462 --> 00:52:42,382
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:46,935
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

570
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:51,349
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

571
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:10,535
Harry.

572
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:22,005
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,221
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:28,052
Look on the bright side:
You can't be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:31,302
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:34,517
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:53:34,552 --> 00:53:37,228
Just a couple of people.

578
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:43,693
Lovely spot.

579
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:49,115
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,035
Matey, come back here.

581
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:01,384
Hi.

582
00:54:01,419 --> 00:54:04,339
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,215
We need a teacher.

584
00:54:07,258 --> 00:54:09,726
A proper teacher.

585
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:13,097
One who's had experience
defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:14,939
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:17,268
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

588
00:54:17,303 --> 00:54:19,371
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:21,882
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:24,359
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:28,738
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

592
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:34,994
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:54:35,029 --> 00:54:38,748
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:54:38,783 --> 00:54:42,085
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

595
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:46,881
Yes.

596
00:54:47,715 --> 00:54:49,140
I've seen it.

597
00:54:49,175 --> 00:54:51,886
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

598
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:56,266
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,690
It's true.

600
00:54:57,725 --> 00:55:01,062
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:55:01,896 --> 00:55:04,816
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:06,658
Wait.

603
00:55:06,693 --> 00:55:11,489
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:55:11,524 --> 00:55:15,208
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

605
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:19,205
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,376
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:55:25,253 --> 00:55:30,675
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

608
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:34,637
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:36,688
But out there...

610
00:55:36,723 --> 00:55:40,581
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

611
00:55:40,616 --> 00:55:44,439
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

612
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:49,027
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:00,705
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:56:00,914 --> 00:56:03,172
That's why we need your help.

615
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:06,753
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

616
00:56:08,212 --> 00:56:10,089
...Voldemort...

617
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,303
He's really back.

618
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:38,868
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

619
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:40,293
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:43,039
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:45,715
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,044
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,886
Who cares?

624
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:54,926
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

625
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:57,810
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

626
00:56:57,845 --> 00:57:01,808
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

627
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:03,685
What's that?

628
00:57:04,727 --> 00:57:08,064
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

629
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:13,277
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

630
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:16,371
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:20,368
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,870
Will do, Harry.

633
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:35,174
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:39,137
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

635
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:42,265
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,679
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:22,896
The what?

638
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:25,607
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

639
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:29,187
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:31,898
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:36,277
So say you really needed the toilet...

642
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:41,873
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

643
00:58:41,908 --> 00:58:47,330
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

644
00:58:57,757 --> 00:58:59,842
Expelliarmus.

645
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,064
I'm hopeless.

646
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:10,478
You're just flourishing your wand too much.
Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:13,189 --> 00:59:17,360
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

648
00:59:17,395 --> 00:59:20,662
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:59:20,697 --> 00:59:24,659
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,161
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:42,802
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

652
00:59:42,837 --> 00:59:45,270
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:59:45,305 --> 00:59:49,475
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:59:55,315 --> 00:59:57,400
Stupefy!

655
01:00:01,571 --> 01:00:06,576
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
01:00:11,372 --> 01:00:13,875
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,586
Thanks, Ronald.

658
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:21,382
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,302
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
01:00:24,337 --> 01:00:27,013
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
01:00:33,478 --> 01:00:35,355
Stupefy.

662
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,827
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:48,076
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

664
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:52,872
It was completely intentional.

665
01:01:17,897 --> 01:01:21,442
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

666
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:27,699
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

667
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:30,201
Expelliarmus.

668
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:34,372
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:37,917
Great.

670
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:40,837
A little higher.

671
01:01:48,553 --> 01:01:52,098
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:12,744
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
01:02:13,786 --> 01:02:17,332
Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial
Squad for extra credit...

674
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,251
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

675
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:22,545
Diminuendo.

676
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:32,347
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,606
Believing in yourself.

678
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:36,935
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,568
Think of it this way.

680
01:02:38,603 --> 01:02:42,878
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

681
01:02:42,913 --> 01:02:47,153
...as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

682
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:50,698
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,585
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:03:04,254 --> 01:03:06,130
Expelliarmus.

685
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:10,301
Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:15,306 --> 01:03:17,183
Reducto.

687
01:03:30,113 --> 01:03:33,241
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,160
Expelliarmus.

689
01:03:39,497 --> 01:03:42,208
Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:49,507
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,809
So that's it for this lesson.

692
01:03:52,844 --> 01:03:56,598
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

693
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:59,726
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

694
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:03,688
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

695
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,527
Well done, mate.

696
01:04:09,562 --> 01:04:11,613
Thanks.

697
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:19,746
See you after Christmas.

698
01:04:28,504 --> 01:04:31,215
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:35,178
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:39,140
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,851
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:04:41,886 --> 01:04:43,693
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:46,439
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:04:46,474 --> 01:04:49,115
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:52,070
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

706
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:55,198
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

707
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:10,421
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:13,341
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:05:13,549 --> 01:05:16,886
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:25,436
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:29,190
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

712
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:32,527
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:35,446
He was really good.

714
01:05:35,655 --> 01:05:38,992
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:05:42,745 --> 01:05:45,248
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:49,419
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

717
01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:00,263
Mistletoe.

718
01:06:03,182 --> 01:06:05,685
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:06:06,102 --> 01:06:08,396
What are Nargles?

720
01:06:08,605 --> 01:06:10,898
No idea.

721
01:06:32,378 --> 01:06:35,089
Well, how was it?

722
01:06:35,298 --> 01:06:37,348
Wet.

723
01:06:37,383 --> 01:06:39,469
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:06:39,504 --> 01:06:41,728
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:45,099
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:49,652
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

727
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:52,398
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

728
01:06:53,233 --> 01:06:56,778
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

729
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:04,250
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:07,622
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:10,924
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:15,338
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:20,308
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

734
01:07:20,343 --> 01:07:24,097
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...
