1
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,230
...Kamchatka.

2
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,350
<i>In the beginning there was</i>
<i>a cell, nothing else.</i>

3
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,110
<i>That cell split into two, those</i>
<i>two into others, and so on.</i>

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,280
<i>Some cells became plants,</i>
<i>others bugs...</i>

5
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,050
<i>... others animals...</i>

6
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,220
<i>... and others us.</i>

7
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,160
<i>What they never explain</i>
<i>is what happens next...</i>

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,170
<i>... between the moment</i>
<i>the cells become a person...</i>

9
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,300
<i>... and that person</i>
<i>climbs the Himalayas...</i>

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,070
<i>... discovers a vaccine...</i>

11
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,440
<i>... or becomes a famous</i>
<i>escapist like Houdini.</i>

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,240
<i>That is a real mystery.</i>

13
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,750
<i>No textbook mentions this.</i>
<i>No teacher does.</i>

14
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,580
<i>But my dad did so.</i>
<i>Once.</i>

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,520
<i>The last time I saw him.</i>

16
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,020
<i>My story, like all stories,</i>
<i>begins with a cell...</i>

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,560
<i>... but ends in Kamchatka.</i>

18
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,990
<i>Life,</i>
<i>the supreme mystery.</i>

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>The energy which induces</i>
<i>cells to join together...</i>

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,700
Fall, 1976.
<i>... and form tissues...</i>

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Days after
Argentina's military coup

22
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,780
"o".

23
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,420
It's got to have a vowel!

24
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,950
Look at all the "a's"!

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,790
"F"?

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,990
"T"?

27
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,770
Mum!

28
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,310
Ok, go.
I'll be outside.

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,350
- When are you coming?
- After English.

30
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,980
- My mum's making escalopes.
- Yes!!

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,130
ABRACADABRA

32
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,130
Bertuccio's mum's
making escalopes.

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,330
- You're an invader!
- Here.

34
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,430
Wow!
The latest edition!

35
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,660
Yes, just out.

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,110
- Where are we going?
- To a friend's house.

37
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,220
You took me out of
school just for that?

38
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,410
We'll be back soon,
okay?

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,150
It's Thursday, remember.

40
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,350
I've got English, then
I'm going to Bertuccio's.

41
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,190
- Not today.
- Why not?

42
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,800
- We can't.
- Why not?

43
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,130
- Because we're going on a trip.
- Aren't we going...

44
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,860
...to your friends'? - We'll
drop in and set off from there.

45
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,210
I don't want to go there.

46
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,470
What am I gonna do?
I'll get bored.

47
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,550
- So leave me here and pick me
up later from Bertuccio's. - No.

48
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,160
I told you to leave me here
and pick me up later!

49
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,260
- Are you crazy or what?
- Leave me here!

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,590
- I won't!
- Why not?

51
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,360
- Because I say so!
- Keep going, madam.

52
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,410
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

53
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,250
<i>The invaders...</i>

54
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>Aliens coming</i>
<i>from a dying planet.</i>

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,160
<i>Destination: The Earth.</i>

56
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,530
<i>Purpose:</i>
<i>To dominate the world.</i>

57
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,300
<i>David Vincent has seen them.</i>

58
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,630
<i>For him it all started one night</i>
<i>on a Ionely country road...</i>

59
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,640
Let me watch, you, Shorty!

60
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,840
<i>... looking for a short-cut</i>
<i>he never found.</i>

61
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,640
<i>It began with a closed</i>
<i>deserted diner...</i>

62
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,920
<i>... and a man too exhausted</i>
<i>to continue his journey.</i>

63
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,820
<i>A spaceship from another</i>
<i>galaxy landed...</i>

64
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,730
I was in the laboratory...

65
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,530
...when I saw her waving at me,
'Your husband on the phone! '

66
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,970
I asked him what happened 'I'd
been trying to reach you at the...

67
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,040
...law office and nobody
would answer! ' He told me...

68
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,910
...some militars had searched the
office and kidnapped Roberto...

69
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,480
...his partner.

70
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,410
What's wrong, sweetie?
Do you want something?

71
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,680
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall.

72
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,850
- Do you want me to go
with you? - No.

73
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,100
I'd rather sleep
on the floor.

74
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,340
Little guy's kicking
the hell out of me.

75
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,980
This bed is going to hell!

76
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,950
Are you sleeping
there with mum?

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,260
So, tell me.
What happened today?

78
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,030
A girl saw the invaders
disintegrate a truck.

79
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,470
Then David Vincent
had to find the driver...

80
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,540
I saw that one,
about three times.

81
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,810
Your mum?
How was she?

82
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,050
The Rock!

83
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,680
She didn't let me go
to Bertuccio's.

84
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,250
- What happened to Roberto?
- What do you mean?

85
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,590
Don't goof around.

86
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,120
- Did mum tell you?
- They took him away, right?

87
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,990
But nothing'll
happen to him?

88
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,830
You'll get him out.
That's what lawyers are for.

89
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,130
But Roberto's a lawyer, too.

90
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,010
Do lawyers
get taken away, too?

91
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,510
- Nothing will happen to you,
right? - No.

92
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,380
Nothing.

93
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,850
You know what
we're gonna do?

94
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,590
Go away for a while,
till things calm down.

95
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,630
I got a house in the suburbs.

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,390
I've never been there, but I'm
told it's terrific! A pool...

97
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,800
...we can play soccer, you
name it! - Can Bertuccio come?

98
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,340
Do you think so?

99
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,410
I mean, if we invite him,
we get him into our mess, too.

100
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,910
You wouldn't want that.

101
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,170
Take the third left.

102
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,500
- Back to the city?
- Do it!

103
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,140
- We just came that way!
- Me, pilot. You, driver.

104
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,980
- My lion, I want my lion. - Once
mum drove into a gas station.

105
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,920
On the way out, she didn't
know if she had to go...

106
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,080
...right or left. - You're
not in the game, shut up!

107
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,630
- She's as disoriented as a
spinning top. - I want my lion!

108
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,160
- So we get out of here.
- Third left.

109
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,680
- Can I look, dad?
- Yes.

110
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,480
TEG

111
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,260
- Hey, look.
- He won't like it.

112
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,760
- Why not?
- It's hard plastic.

113
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,490
Little Guy's is a cuddly one.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Get the car keys from mum.

115
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,640
Not a word.
Hurry up!

116
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,290
There's a tree behind the house.
Leave it there, no one'll see it.

117
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,110
Come on, Little Guy.

118
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,980
- You know what a call for
action is? - What?

119
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,460
Like in movies when the soldier
warns of an Indian attack?

120
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,190
- Yes. - And the
Indians go: Ooh, ooh, ohh!

121
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,960
If mum or I call for action,
you must do this...

122
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,730
- Drop what you're doing...
- What if...

123
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,170
...we're drinking Nesquik?
...drop what you're doing...

124
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,140
...and come here running,
very, very, very fast.

125
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,680
So, what you do is this.
Listen carefully.

126
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,780
Yes.

127
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,750
- Find this stone...
- Yes.

128
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,480
Stretch out your arms, close
your eyes, lower your head...

129
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,990
...and wriggle through.

130
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,730
- Got it?
- Yes.

131
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,020
- Who wants to try first?
- Me!

132
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,360
Use your arms.
Watch out for your eyes.

133
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,030
When mum or I call
for action...

134
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,900
...find the stone
and wriggle through.

135
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,080
- That way's north. The way
we came. - Yes.

136
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,590
And that's south. It leads
straight to the village.

137
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,870
Be careful!
Don't you fall!

138
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,900
Who lived here before us?

139
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,760
Not a clue.

140
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,870
But somebody lent you
the house.

141
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,910
A friend of a friend
I don't know.

142
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,910
We forgot to bring coal.

143
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,980
Help me gather some
firewood.

144
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,190
HOCUS-POCUS

145
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,820
<i>Harry Houdini</i>
<i>was born in Budapest...</i>

146
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,630
<i>... on March 24, 1874.</i>

147
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,400
<i>He was an escapist,</i>
<i>not a magician, as believed.</i>

148
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,380
<i>An escapist can get out of</i>
<i>the most difficult situations.</i>

149
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,250
- Do you wanna play with me?
- Not even drunk...

150
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,360
...as a skunk!
- I haven't told you what at yet!

151
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,460
Ok, tell me.

152
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,200
You're the skunk, nerd!

153
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>To do his job, Houdini had to</i>
<i>be in perfect physical shape.</i>

154
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,270
<i>He ran several miles a day...</i>

155
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,970
<i>... and could stay under water</i>
<i>for four minutes. Four minutes!</i>

156
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,090
<i>Houdini offered rewards to</i>
<i>anyone who could lock him up.</i>

157
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,990
<i>Many accepted the challenge,</i>
<i>only to lose.</i>

158
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,530
<i>He always escaped!</i>

159
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,710
- Yummy!
- Try the chili sauce.

160
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,140
I made the Tabasco too,
but it's a bit hotter.

161
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,810
The amount of firewood I had
to use! It burns quicker than...

162
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,580
Chemical coals burn slower...

163
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,250
What's this?
The rule is...

164
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,620
...science at the table...
...is bad manners!

165
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,430
Can we get to the point?

166
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,790
We'll be staying here for a
while. We don't know...

167
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,560
...for how long yet.

168
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,070
And our stuff?
There's nothing here.

169
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,400
- It's boring!
- It's boring!

170
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,540
I may go by the house
soon and bring some stuff...

171
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,170
...or have someone do it.

172
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,610
No school for a time.

173
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,920
I must go to the lab. But dad'll
stay with you for a few days.

174
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,930
- Tell them about the names.
- Just a second.

175
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,860
Be careful around the pool,
it's dangerous.

176
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,490
I'll teach you to use the gas
and fill the tank...

177
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,870
...there's no running water.

178
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,570
Don't answer
or use the phone.

179
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,830
- It's forbidden.
- Why?

180
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,370
If your mum says so,
there's a reason, ok?

181
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,180
Right, from now on,
we change our names.

182
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,410
- Change them?
- No one must know we're here.

183
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,620
If anyone comes asking for us
or phones...

184
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,490
- They're not supposed
to answer! - Wait, wait...

185
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,460
You mean we'll have
other names?

186
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,290
- Yes.
- For ever?

187
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,330
For some time, we said.

188
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,530
Then what if I have a new
name and I phone Bertuccio?

189
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,440
He'll realize it's me,
he's not stupid.

190
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,370
Didn't I make myself clear?
No phone calls, I said.

191
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,450
Not even if your name's
"The Wizard of Oz".

192
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,890
From now on,
we're the Vincents.

193
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm David...

194
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,560
...and I'm an architect.

195
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,070
David Vincent,
the architect!

196
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,700
- What? What?
- Like in The Invaders.

197
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,080
Dad is David Vincent!

198
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,550
- Can I choose my name?
- Me too?

199
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,450
Harry.
I wanna be Harry.

200
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,360
Nobody's wearing what we
used to. We could only bring...

201
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,760
...what we had on. Me neither.
- I want MY pajamas.

202
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,750
What's wrong with
this lion that's so hard?

203
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,690
He's softening it up.

204
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,830
What happened?

205
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,630
Did you drink a lot of
coke last night?

206
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,260
- Don't say anything. - Ok, but you
have to promise me something.

207
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
What?

208
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,330
You won't drink anything...

209
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,380
...at night, nothing.

210
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,910
No soda water, no water,
coke, nothing.

211
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,810
Is it dead?

212
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,220
It's the one I saw before.

213
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,020
It must have drowned.

214
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,280
It can't drown!
It's a toad!

215
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,550
Toads breathe air.

216
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,190
Obviously, it got trapped.

217
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,800
Yucky creature.
Loot at the skin.

218
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,300
"...Houdini's first stage
name was Eric The Great."

219
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,150
Because his real name
wasn't Harry, see?

220
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,480
"At first, he was
assisted in his performance...

221
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,850
...by a co-worker from the
factory where he worked."

222
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,760
Because he was poor and
worked since he was a boy.

223
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,830
"But later, he turned to
his younger brother, Theo."

224
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,400
Turn it up, little guy.

225
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,410
I wanna watch The Saint!

226
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,950
<i>The Minister denied</i>
<i>categorically that anyone...</i>

227
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,550
<i>... on the list is being held by the</i>
<i>executive power, or in prison...</i>

228
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,090
They gotta whitewash
political prisoners.

229
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,860
- Who, me?
- Let me listen to it.

230
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,790
Tie me up, Little Guy.

231
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,460
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

232
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,410
<i>We're writing a new chapter</i>
<i>in Argentina's...</i>

233
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,610
<i>... economic history.</i>

234
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,410
Sure, a new chapter.

235
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,580
<i>We'll open our markets</i>
<i>to foreign trade...</i>

236
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,720
Is that okay?

237
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,880
Tighter.

238
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,190
<i>... leading to the freedom of</i>
<i>our productive forces...</i>

239
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,460
What will your productive
forces produce?

240
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,160
More misery.

241
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,300
Perfect.

242
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,910
- Okay?
- Yes.

243
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,810
<i>The President of Argentina,</i>
<i>General Jorge Rafael Videla...</i>

244
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,470
<i>... stated that the government will</i>
<i>beat the rebels at any cost...</i>

245
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,090
Hey, what are you doing?

246
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,490
- Whitewashing the prisoner!
- Go away!

247
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,930
Who am I?
I said, who am I?

248
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,600
- Vincent.
- I work for...?

249
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,650
A construction company.
Campbell & Co.

250
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,250
- What about mom?
- Housewife!

251
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,540
We met at...?

252
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,060
- At...
- University.

253
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,280
We studied together.

254
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,360
She quit when we married.
I told you a million times!

255
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,480
Come here.

256
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,380
Stand here.

257
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,450
Hold this hand firm,
move this one when you hit.

258
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,290
Watch your feet.
Wide apart, this way.

259
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,060
Look that way.

260
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,770
Make sure the wood holds
steady, about a meter away...

261
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,730
...so that it doesn't splinter
away. Okay? - Yes.

262
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,240
Let's see.

263
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,010
Again...

264
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,570
...further back...

265
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,210
...here, come on!

266
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,030
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

267
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,540
What's cooking,
good-looking?

268
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,610
- What's that?
- Trunks.

269
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,180
- Nice, eh?
- Yes.

270
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,120
Houdini used to be chained
inside and thrown into the sea.

271
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,990
Once he was at the
bottom of a swimming pool...

272
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,120
...for 90 minutes,
no oxygen tubes, nothing.

273
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,630
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Houdini, the magician?

274
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,700
He wasn't a magician! He was
an escapist. It's different.

275
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,740
- Sure. Where did you get this?
- I found it there.

276
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,400
Only a fool would
leave this.

277
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,340
Maybe this Pedro
left it for you...

278
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,180
- What? Really!
- When I grow up...

279
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,810
...I wanna be an escapist.

280
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,690
And be locked in there,
and thrown in the sea?

281
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,310
Really?

282
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,020
My little boy.

283
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,920
You know something?
A boy's coming to live with us.

284
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,460
A boy? Who?

285
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,590
- Just a boy.
- Are you gonna adopt him?

286
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,670
Don't be a fool!
It's just for a few days.

287
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,140
He needs someplace
to stay.

288
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,440
But you gotta help me
with the Little Guy.

289
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,380
Ok?
You know, changes upset him...

290
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,820
Poor thing. I know he's doing
his best, isn't he?

291
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,000
- Did he give you much
trouble today? - No.

292
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,730
So, what then?
Will you help me?

293
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,990
Will you?

294
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,370
You know what's important.

295
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,680
- What? - Knowing how long
it takes to unchain yourself.

296
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,710
When you know so,
you'll know how much...

297
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,480
...oxygen you need.
Because oxygen needs space.

298
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,090
If you don't give it space,
you'll suffocate.

299
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,390
So this way
they'll survive?

300
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,400
Some will.
The smart ones, for sure!

301
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,090
Back a bit, there.

302
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,690
There, hold it.

303
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,140
Don't let it go.

304
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,870
There we go.
Hold it.

305
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,390
Now let it go.

306
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,120
Ready.

307
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,420
- Why don't we use this? It's
easier. - But at night...

308
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,630
...when we're asleep,
or when we leave this place...

309
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,500
They gotta learn
to survive alone!

310
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,830
Here comes mom!
Here comes mom!

311
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,530
Stay with me.
She's with the boy.

312
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,340
Hi, mom!

313
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,680
Hi, sweetie.

314
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,410
Oh, I missed you so much.

315
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,080
- Have you played a lot today?
- Yes!

316
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,920
- This way, Lucas.
- Okay.

317
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,820
Where's your brother?

318
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,990
- Where's he? - I don't know,
somewhere around.

319
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,900
- Did you have your milk? Did
daddy make it for you? - Yes!

320
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,910
- He did?
- Yes!

321
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,970
Hello, love.

322
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,280
Fine.

323
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,480
- This is David, my husband.
- How's it going?

324
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,180
- Okay?
- Fine.

325
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,020
- Gorgeous place, you were
right. - Simon, our youngest son.

326
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,630
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to
meet you. - Nice to meet you.

327
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,560
And this is Harry.

328
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,930
Harry. Cool name.

329
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,000
He speaks, but I hypnotize
him when we have guests.

330
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,410
This is Lucas, boys. He's gonna
stay with us for a few days.

331
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,010
- Can we show Lucas around?
- Of course.

332
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,720
We gotta take it all down.

333
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,160
Come on!

334
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,500
SAINT'S BED

335
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,870
HARRY AND SIMON'S CLOSET
HARRY'S BED

336
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,470
Why take them down?

337
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,070
Because he's not a boy.
He's a guard, a cop!

338
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,180
What if he's an Invader?

339
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,840
Excuse me.

340
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,120
And the mattress?

341
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,290
We took it outside
to somersault.

342
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,460
- Lucas's gonna sleep here
with you. - I can sleep...

343
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,590
...in the living room. - No!
It's freezing to death there.

344
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,890
Put your things anywhere.

345
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,950
- Who's the cutest little boy
in the world? - Me!

346
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,030
I'd take you in my purse...

347
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,190
...if I could fit you in!
How much I love you!

348
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,800
Me toooo!

349
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,890
If you behave well,
very, very well...

350
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,800
...we're gonna go home and get...

351
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,170
...some stuff.

352
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,370
- My lion!
...please, mom!

353
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,280
- My TEG! - My pajamas,
my tiki-taka! - Stop it!

354
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,210
Only one thing each,
or it's gonna be too much.

355
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,650
- Don't be mean, mom.
- Alright, 2 things, 3 things.

356
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,250
- TEG, TEG! Please, bring
the TEG -Tiki-taka!

357
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,290
If you need anything,
ask Lucas, ok?

358
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,230
Lucas!!!

359
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,800
Come here.

360
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,570
- How long has he been wetting
the bed? - Two days.

361
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,300
But don't tell him
I told you.

362
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,740
Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

363
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,220
- I'm gonna call as many times
as I can. - But we can't answer!

364
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,720
3 rings and I hang up, twice.
On the third call you can answer.

365
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,420
- That's our secret code.
- Bye!

366
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,890
You pour the milk in this way.
See?

367
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,100
And stir, and stir.

368
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,000
It's lumpy. You can chew
the lumps like this.

369
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,230
- Chocolate!
- You can't have Nesquik.

370
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,940
You'll get tummy ache.

371
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,610
Oh, really?

372
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,550
Ask me to help you out, then.

373
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,320
I can make some for you.

374
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,990
Your name's not Lucas, is it?

375
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,030
No, it isn't.

376
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,670
Are you really Harry?

377
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,480
Newfoundland to N.Y., 3.

378
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,340
Brazil to Sahara, 3.

379
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,670
Again, Brazil to Sahara, 3.

380
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,260
- I take my own counters!
- Don't get pissed off. Hurry.

381
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,090
Iran to China with 3.

382
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,700
- Again?
- I'm winning.

383
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,270
Again, because I'm winning.

384
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,600
Iran to China with 3.

385
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,220
Again, with 3.
You... just 1.

386
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,160
<i>That's "TEG". The world</i>
<i>is divided into countries.</i>

387
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,990
<i>These are controlled</i>
<i>by armies.</i>

388
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,760
<i>Each army is a different color.</i>

389
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,360
<i>For example, right now I'm</i>
<i>the blue army.</i>

390
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:11,800
<i>The first one to control</i>
<i>30 countries wins.</i>

391
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,740
<i>But that's with</i>
<i>4 or 5 players.</i>

392
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,810
<i>With dad,</i>
<i>I play one to one.</i>

393
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,120
<i>To live or die.</i>
<i>And I always die.</i>

394
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,420
Taimir to Siberia with 3.

395
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,120
- Let him win sometime.
- Why? He'll win when he can!

396
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,970
Not again!

397
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,050
- Morning.
- Hi.

398
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,220
There's coffee in the fridge.

399
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,220
Mom makes gallons of coffee
and then reheats it.

400
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,300
- Thanks, I had some earlier when
your folks left. - Are they gone?

401
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,200
- Where?
- I don't know.

402
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,510
- What time are they coming
back? - They didn't say.

403
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,370
You know nothing!

404
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,620
Is this yours?

405
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,120
I know some magic, if you have
some cards I'll teach you tricks.

406
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,490
Card games are for kids.
And magic is stupid!

407
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,800
Houdini was an escapist,
not a magician.

408
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,840
What he did,
he did for real.

409
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,130
HOW LONG?

410
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,460
HE RAN SEVERAL MILES A DAY

411
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,880
HOUDINI HAD TO BE
IN PERFECT PHYSICAL SHAPE

412
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,090
HE COULD STAY UNDER
WATER FOR FOUR MINUTES

413
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,360
FOUR MINUTES!

414
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,510
Let us pray.

415
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,180
Lord, let's pray so that this
sacrament, received with joy...

416
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,880
...in commemoration
of St. Jerome...

417
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,180
...encourages the hearts
of the faithful.

418
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,020
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.

419
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,530
Now and forever.

420
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,760
Our help cometh
from the Lord.

421
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,030
Who created heaven and earth.

422
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,940
Let us stand.

423
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,750
In the name of the Father...

424
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,640
...and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

425
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,310
Amen.

426
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,620
Don't worry, they won't
be in the records.

427
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,380
There'll be a report card, but
no legal record or anything...

428
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,930
...that could reach
the Ministry.

429
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,260
Hey, don't be mad.

430
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,360
We don't want you
to get behind, that's all.

431
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,560
You've missed enough.

432
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,040
But if you catch up,
and when all this is over...

433
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,900
...you'll be back in the same
class at your old school.

434
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,740
Anyway, it's good to meet new
people, make new friends...

435
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,280
I don't need new friends.

436
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,410
I already have friends, but
you don't let me see them!

437
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,080
- Good morning.
- Good morning, father John.

438
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,310
Very kind of you.

439
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,620
I guess these clothes
are a donation.

440
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,410
But, if you decide
to claim for them...

441
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,480
...you can do it personally
at my office.

442
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm here to introduce
a new classmate.

443
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,170
This is not a Roman circus...

444
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,870
...so please
don't behave like lions.

445
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,440
This is Harold.

446
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,370
Welcome.

447
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,190
- Daddy, what's this?
- It's like a greeting.

448
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,730
Evening.
How's it going?

449
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,270
- Have you eaten?
- No, nothing.

450
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,770
Join us.

451
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,370
How was your first day?

452
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,780
I think I put my foot
in it.

453
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,890
Hello, God!

454
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,150
Bye, God!

455
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,830
- The teacher said I had
nice hair. - Of course you do.

456
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,250
You wanna dance?

457
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,460
Hey!

458
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,030
Hey, where are you going?
It's cold out.

459
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,380
Mom, come and join us.

460
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,190
Your breathing...

461
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,370
...must always be regular...

462
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,260
...always.

463
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,470
Regular.
Keep the pace!

464
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,780
Come on!

465
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,420
- What's this?
- Are you okay?

466
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,120
I don't know.

467
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,700
Yes. Fine.

468
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,830
The key is to resist.

469
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,330
The fastest never wins.

470
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,870
The one that holds on does!

471
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,610
- Where did you learn to run
this way? - The less you know...

472
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,610
...about me, the safer it'll be
for you. - At least...

473
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,580
...tell me if you always ran
like this or if you learned.

474
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,480
All good things are learned.

475
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,110
We know some things
since we're born.

476
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,350
- But you gotta learn to do
them well. - Really?

477
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,830
Thinking.
That's one.

478
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,330
- Swimming.
- Breathing.

479
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,830
Moving, walking, running...!

480
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,340
Feeling.

481
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,370
- Speaking.
- Laughing.

482
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,500
- Looking.
- Touching.

483
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,170
Playing.

484
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:47,710
Singing.

485
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,180
- Come join us!
- You're nuts!

486
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,210
Move it!

487
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,410
- State-owned or private?
- Sate-owned.

488
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,340
- Which area?
- Wrong question.

489
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,970
- City or suburbs?
- Neither.

490
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,210
- Where are you from?
- Wrong question.

491
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,920
- Come on, tell me.
- Okay, La Plata, but...

492
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,530
- You got a dad?
- Yes, I have.

493
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,790
- You got a mom?
- Yes, I have.

494
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,760
- Then, what are you doing
here? - Wrong question.

495
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,130
- You had an argument with
your parents and ran away? -No!

496
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,430
Then, what are you
doing here?

497
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,700
- I'm fighting to save the world.
- Come on!

498
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,670
See? You don't
believe the truth.

499
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,970
Your parents threw you
out after a fight?

500
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,050
No!

501
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,840
One leaves home after a fight
or to get married.

502
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,280
- That's old-fashioned! - That's
you! You think you're cool...

503
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,980
...'cause you have a girlfriend.
- Who told you?

504
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,850
I saw her!
I saw her!

505
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,190
- Where? - There's a photo in
your wallet and I saw her tits!

506
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,870
Oh, shit!

507
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,950
<i>Freedom, freedom...!</i>

508
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,680
- He's drunk, isn't he?
- Completely.

509
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,950
- What happened?
- What happened, love?

510
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:22,620
- He's pissed! - <i>We will</i>
<i>make Will Cadory to spit.</i>

511
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,700
- Well what? - <i>We will make</i>
<i>Will Cadory to spit.</i>

512
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,890
Who's Will Cadory?

513
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,160
<i>We will swear with Glory</i>
<i>to live!</i>

514
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,290
- Why are you back so early?
- You scared me.

515
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,690
You should be at work.

516
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,190
I was fired...

517
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,760
...from the lab.

518
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,930
- Do you want your milk?
- Yes.

519
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,730
Let me prepare it.

520
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,840
When I grow up,
I wanna be a saint.

521
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,380
I told you before, Simon
Templar isn't a real saint.

522
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,530
<i>What's this? Who are you?</i>
<i>Get out!</i>

523
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,660
<i>Let me go!</i>

524
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,640
<i>Let me go!</i>
<i>What will you do with us?</i>

525
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,790
<i>Don't waste your time.</i>

526
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,860
<i>Perhaps he won't return.</i>

527
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,060
<i>The ship needs him.</i>

528
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,090
Hello?

529
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,160
Hello?

530
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,620
Hello?

531
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,390
- Who is it?
- Some idiot.

532
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,990
How come you don't know the
name of any classmate?

533
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,690
- They're all stupid.
- No way!

534
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,360
- Is that too tight?
- Tighter.

535
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,100
- Tighter?
- Tighter.

536
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,560
- I'm making it tight.
- Perfect.

537
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,400
Perfect.

538
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,250
- I'll time you.
- Stay on that side!

539
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,470
- On the other side?
- But don't look, okay?

540
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:42,840
Let's see...

541
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,250
If it's a minute,
you're "Houdini".

542
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,560
If it's 2, you're "Averagini".
More than 3, you're "Louserini".

543
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,060
- Come on!
- Ready?

544
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,830
- Yes.
- Go, go!

545
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,660
Hey, if you shit on your pants,
you're out.

546
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,840
Don't you have any friends?

547
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,080
Of course I do.

548
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,780
When do you see them?

549
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,320
Never.

550
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,090
Don't you ever feel
like calling them?

551
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,660
What if you call them?
Would they tell you off?

552
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,740
No. Why?

553
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,100
I'm a fugitive and I don't
wanna put them in danger.

554
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,740
And the way things are...

555
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,540
You're my only friend, now.

556
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,380
You're all I've got.

557
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,910
Well, you and your family.

558
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,290
Come on! You're 30 seconds
away from losing.

559
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,090
Did you hear me?

560
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:06,900
Sit up. It was too
tight, you could say so!

561
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,440
Or do I have to teach you to
speak as well? Give me your hand.

562
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,840
That's it.

563
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,910
- Does it hurt?
- I can't feel anything.

564
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,910
Give me the other hand.

565
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,320
If it's too tight
it cuts off your bloodstream.

566
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,720
- Better? - What if
they don't come back?

567
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,590
Mom and Dad, what if
they don't come back?

568
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,040
- We got held up.
- Are the kids asleep?

569
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,470
- Did they eat okay?
- We had to avoid...

570
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,210
...the military check-out points.
- Harry was a bit sick.

571
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,520
I'm here, sweetie.

572
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,960
Call me if you need me.

573
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:09,760
I know you're awake, you know,
'cause I gave you birth.

574
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:17,440
Of all my scientific experiments,
which I did a lot...

575
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,840
...you're the one
that came out best.

576
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,680
I don't care if
I'm talking nonsense...

577
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,550
...or drooling your ear...

578
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:33,120
...or if I sound
like Bertuccio's mom.

579
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,930
My sweet,
my darling little boy...

580
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,690
Keep all the kisses.

581
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,400
I love you.

582
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,510
Dad didn't agree, as usual. But
I convinced him. So we leave...

583
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,610
...first thing Saturday
and return Sunday night.

584
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,390
Yes! We're going to
grandpa's birthday.

585
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,390
Yippee!
We're going!

586
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,090
- Can Lucas come? - I invited
him but he's got stuff to do.

587
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:21,870
- The oil's burning! - Get out
of my way, I'm in a hurry.

588
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,310
- Let me help.
- Okay, come here.

589
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,810
You gotta add some stock to
the egg to make it tastier.

590
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,750
- Where did you pick that up?
- Bertuccio's mom told me.

591
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,450
- She's a genius. - What a
concept of genius you've got!

592
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,790
So it's the same: Einstein,
Michelangelo and Bertuccio's...

593
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,620
...mother who is a fat ass!
- She's not fat. - Move...

594
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,130
She's always at home and
she helps with his homework!

595
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,960
Yes, but you never need help.

596
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,800
It's burning.

597
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,040
You finish frying them, okay?
Be careful with the oil.

598
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,410
Any problems,
ring Bertuccio's mom.

599
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,220
- Are you serious?
- No, just kidding. I was kidding!

600
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,690
- You gotta go?
- Yes.

601
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,220
- Where?
- A meeting at work.

602
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,060
- You were fired!
- They fired me from the lab.

603
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,390
But I still have
stuff to do.

604
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,990
- More important than us?
- No, never.

605
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,330
So stay here, then.

606
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:32,810
You can't ask me to do
something wrong. Not you.

607
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,190
You know, your dad's old now.

608
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,800
He won't be with you
much longer.

609
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,730
If he gets on your nerves,
take a deep breath...

610
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,800
...and count to ten.

611
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,510
Do you do that every night?

612
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,410
I wish she did.

613
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,010
But we hear you every night
going "Ah, ah, ah..."

614
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:19,250
Look at him. He's been
asleep the whole journey.

615
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,290
No, remember, he woke up in
La Plata asking about vaccines.

616
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:27,490
"Daddy, daddy, do you have to
be vaccinated to be a saint?"

617
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,960
Look what he did!

618
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,230
- I almost strangled him!
- Don't give him hell, he hasn't...

619
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,240
...wetted the bed today.

620
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,210
Well, I got up 3 times to take
him to pee but it was worth it.

621
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:43,140
- I got up once.
- And me twice more!

622
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:47,610
- I can't believe it. - That's why
he looks like a zombie. - Zombie!

623
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,940
Happy birthday, grandpa!

624
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:15,880
Thank you. I see you still
have that old heap!

625
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,950
With two boys, it's the best
car to have. Happy birthday.

626
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,120
Open it!
Open it!

627
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,790
Oh, my favorites!

628
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,620
- Mom, are they chocolate?
- No, they're real.

629
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,890
- Happy birthday, grandpa.
- More gifts! Let's see.

630
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,860
I don't know if you want to
please me or kill me?

631
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,030
Whisky and cigars!

632
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,530
You know when I last
saw you?

633
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,010
- When?
- 6 months and 12 days ago.

634
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,410
It's not your fault.

635
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,220
...8, 9, 10. And now?
Do I start again?

636
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,950
Take a deep breath.

637
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,720
First, second, third, fourth...

638
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,820
...and reverse.

639
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,330
Again, but harder.

640
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,760
- That's it, good.
- First...

641
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,300
...second, third...

642
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,460
...fourth... - Tell me,
your friend from China?

643
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,540
- Japan!
- China, Japan...

644
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,440
How is he doing?

645
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,670
- He changed school last year.
- Really?

646
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,940
What about... what's his name,
Bertutti?

647
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,180
- Bertuccio!
- Bertuccio.

648
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,260
How's Bertuccio doing?

649
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,820
Don't tell me he
also changed school!

650
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,920
- No, I did.
- Really?

651
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,970
To a religious school run by
a priest friend of dad's.

652
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,870
Since we've been going, my
brother wants to be a saint.

653
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,340
We live in the suburbs.

654
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,850
Mom was fired from the lab.
Dad had to shut down...

655
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,280
...his law office.
Some militars broke into it...

656
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:07,520
...and destroyed everything, they
seized Roberto, his partner.

657
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,750
Sometimes he works at home.

658
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,630
Before, he used to work in
pubs but there were...

659
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,230
...a lot of policemen around.

660
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,430
Promise me something.

661
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,530
Grandpa.

662
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,500
Grandpa.

663
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,410
- Yes.
- Don't fight.

664
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,920
Not this time.

665
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:57,240
If I'm not wrong,
there should be one here.

666
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,140
- What's that smell?
- Mothballs.

667
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,710
That's how things last for
so long. Here we go.

668
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,140
This one.
Let's see...

669
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,750
I knew it would fit.

670
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,250
This is all like it always
was, right?

671
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,290
I mean, when dad was a kid.

672
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,130
Just the same.

673
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,610
Why didn't you change it?

674
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,400
- Into a playroom!
- For me?

675
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,710
In a way, it is a playroom,
the way it is.

676
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,080
It's my time machine.

677
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,750
Whenever I come to dust,
I sit here and look around...

678
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,010
...and remember things.

679
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,020
You miss him, don't you?

680
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,730
You want to know if I go
around weeping like a fool?

681
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,100
No, I don't.

682
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,970
But I like to remember
the good old times.

683
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,810
We gotta find a reed...

684
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,780
...as thick as a finger,
more or less.

685
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,680
Hollow it, then you can use
it to breathe under water.

686
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:20,690
- This one? - No, as thick
as my finger not yours.

687
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,920
If not, you can't breathe!

688
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:30,060
- But there aren't any that thick.
- There are a lot, look.

689
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,830
All right.

690
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,040
Schools always need teachers.

691
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,480
That could be a temporary
solution, at least.

692
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,660
Try and convince him.
If I do...

693
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,920
...he won't listen. If his
dad does, hell's gonna burn.

694
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,860
You know how they are,
two of a kind.

695
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:03,100
Come in, love.

696
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,090
We're also to blame.

697
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,760
Why? 'Cause we taught him to
take love, but not to give it.

698
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:12,270
They love each other whether
fighting or playing tough.

699
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,070
You know what it's like
to live with 3 brutes.

700
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:18,610
But then, when they grow up
and can't fight any more...

701
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,710
Nothing will change. Someway,
they'll fight differently.

702
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,890
You won't be like that,
will you, dear?

703
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,360
The situation's tough, dad,
militars kill people every day.

704
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,430
We want to be together
as much as we can.

705
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,760
Is it so hard
to understand?

706
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:40,100
- Come on, pour.
- It'll hurt.

707
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,700
- You must see a doctor!
- Pour.

708
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,740
David Vincent is brave
and doesn't cry.

709
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,780
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

710
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,650
Poor bird, eh?

711
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,110
- Can I take one?
- Yes.

712
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,780
Here.
Then it's bath time, ok?

713
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,110
All right.

714
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,030
See you up there.

715
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,130
No, wait.
Hang it round your neck.

716
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,030
Like that.

717
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,160
- Press here, right?
- Yes. This one to shoot...

718
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,570
...and turn here
to wind the film.

719
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,770
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a photo.

720
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,610
No, don't, really.
I hate photos.

721
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,720
You can take one of all this,
or that duck...

722
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:06,880
- Who cares about the duck?
- Go on, take one, but not of me.

723
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:10,960
I always come out with
a stupid grin on my face...

724
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,760
...and you wonder, "What was
this guy thinking about?"

725
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,470
What are you
thinking about now?

726
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,500
That my son's a pain in the ass
taking photos...

727
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,740
...when I don't want.
- Come on, dad, tell me.

728
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:41,620
That we should've come here
more often.

729
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,860
And... why don't we stay?

730
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,790
Because we can't.

731
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,800
Look at me.

732
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,840
Hey, look at me.
Look at me now.

733
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,450
Look at me now.

734
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,380
We can't, son.

735
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,850
We can't.

736
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,350
We can't.

737
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,530
Do you understand?

738
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,690
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

739
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:55,090
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

740
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:58,930
<i>Happy birthday, dear Grandpa...</i>

741
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:02,310
<i>... happy birthday to you.</i>

742
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,040
Blow!

743
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,010
Bravo!

744
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,750
What a lot of smoke!

745
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,310
Move together for a photo.

746
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,580
Cheer up a bit, please.

747
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:23,130
- Grandpa's teaching me
to drive. - I wanna learn, too.

748
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:27,560
- Tell grandpa he's nuts.
- He told me you'd say that.

749
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:31,230
He also told me to tell you
that you learned to drive...

750
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,400
...when you were
younger than me.

751
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,700
That's better.

752
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:41,340
<i>Sleep, little baby...</i>

753
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:46,110
<i>... your mommy's in the field.</i>

754
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,950
Leave him, you big boy.
You'll wake him.

755
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,540
May I?

756
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:00,320
- Look, a shooting star!
- Where?

757
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:04,410
There. Didn't you see it?
It's gone now. It fell.

758
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,350
When your mom and dad
were engaged...

759
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,890
...we'd sit here after dinner,
looking at the sky.

760
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:15,860
There were lots of Russian and
US satellites and capsules then.

761
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,730
On a moonless night, you
could see them. We did once.

762
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:23,740
Mom and her satellite!
It was a shooting star!

763
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,640
- It was a red light!
- No! Red was the wine you had.

764
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,840
What's a shooting star?

765
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,620
If you stare at the sky
without blinking...

766
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,120
...you might see a star...

767
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,120
...come and go...

768
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,280
...at 1000 mph.

769
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:44,220
- Goodnight all.
- See you tomorrow.

770
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,030
- Come here, grandpa. - No,
you're going to make me fall.

771
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,800
Careful, be careful.

772
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,460
Who's gonna get me up now?

773
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:58,270
- He will, he's the strongest in
the family. - Stay there, grandpa.

774
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:01,640
If I get cold, not even a crane
will get me out of here!

775
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,580
They're called
shooting stars...

776
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,620
...but they are really meteorites
or bits of rock...

777
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,880
- No, no science, please!
- Sure?

778
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,610
- Yeah.
- I can't see anything.

779
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,590
You have to be patient.

780
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,220
If you see one,
you can make a wish.

781
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,890
- What have wishes to do with
stars? - Honestly I don't know...

782
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:24,200
...but they always come true.
I made one once, right here.

783
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,370
- And it came true.
- Really?

784
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,830
Whatever, but
I'm sure it was a satellite.

785
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,140
For God's sake, mom!

786
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,940
- Look, another one!
- Where?

787
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,640
There, look.

788
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,350
You're a liar, mom!

789
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,980
<i>Shooting stars are stones...</i>

790
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,620
<i>... that burn up when they</i>
<i>get close to the atmosphere.</i>

791
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,360
<i>Mom was right about that.</i>

792
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,460
<i>For some reason...</i>

793
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,630
<i>... they are directly</i>
<i>related to wishes.</i>

794
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,040
<i>Dad was right about this.</i>

795
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:10,510
<i>I watched and watched</i>
<i>till my eyes burnt...</i>

796
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,980
<i>... but I didn't see anything.</i>

797
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,610
<i>That must be why</i>
<i>my wish didn't come true.</i>

798
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,870
Lucas!

799
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,170
Lucas!

800
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,640
Lucas!

801
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,530
You're gonna knock me down.

802
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,970
What happened to the lights?

803
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,770
A local blackout.

804
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,440
What's up?

805
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,240
You got a minute?

806
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,110
Give your mom a hand
before it rains. Come on!

807
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,090
Dead toad!
Dead toad!

808
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,840
This isn't a hole.
It's an elevator.

809
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,450
We'll put it there so
it can go straight...

810
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,550
...to toads' heaven.

811
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:07,530
I'm gonna wash my hands.

812
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:25,850
I gotta go.

813
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,290
Now?
You'll get soaking wet!

814
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,950
- Your dad's taking me to
the station. - Can I go?

815
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:35,620
- No.
- Why not? It's just a second.

816
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,160
It's late.

817
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,860
I waited just to say goodbye.

818
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,000
I'm going, Harry,
this time for good.

819
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,470
- Do you really have to go?
- Yes.

820
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,430
Why?

821
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,310
Wrong question.

822
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,780
Is that it, then?

823
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,050
"Bye", I turn and leave?

824
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,650
- Aren't we friends?
- Friends?

825
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:16,530
What for? We'll never
see each other again.

826
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:26,070
- I left my orange T-shirt.
- Go get it yourself.

827
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,230
Lucas! Lucas!

828
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,990
If they ask, say I'm ill.

829
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:56,260
- Mom's gonna be mad.
- Say you don't know.

830
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,030
Say we went in together
and you didn't see me again.

831
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,570
Okay? Go on,
I'll meet you here.

832
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,210
Oh, I forgot.

833
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,610
Your comic.

834
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,720
<i>Three requirements...</i>

835
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,190
<i>... distinguish the professional</i>
<i>escapist from the amateur.</i>

836
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,000
<i>First, discipline.</i>

837
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:36,430
<i>The escapist knows</i>
<i>his task is a daily one...</i>

838
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:39,300
<i>... arduous and restless.</i>

839
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,670
A ticket to Buenos Aires.

840
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:48,080
<i>Second, concentration. The</i>
<i>escapist must distinguish...</i>

841
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,850
<i>... the important</i>
<i>from the superfluous.</i>

842
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:59,990
<i>The last requirement</i>
<i>is courage.</i>

843
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:06,330
<i>The escapist needs it...</i>

844
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:10,430
<i>... to see his task</i>
<i>through to the end.</i>

845
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,100
Good morning.

846
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:22,080
- Is Bertuccio in? - No, he's not
back. He's at his aunt's.

847
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,440
That's a pity.

848
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:28,750
- Tell him I called by.
- Of course, dear.

849
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,830
Can I come by another day?

850
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,860
Yes, but phone first.

851
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,340
<i>The Houdini book tells</i>
<i>a lot of things.</i>

852
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,440
<i>Where he was born,</i>
<i>who his parents where...</i>

853
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:55,010
<i>... how he became famous...</i>

854
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:58,250
<i>... what his most difficult</i>
<i>stunts were.</i>

855
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:12,570
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>it doesn't tell...</i>

856
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,170
<i>... is how he managed</i>
<i>to escape.</i>

857
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:23,350
He's coming!
Mom, Dad, he's coming!

858
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,020
Mom, Dad, he's here!

859
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:29,810
Mom, Dad, he's here!

860
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,550
My little boy,
my little boy.

861
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,440
<i>That night we had</i>
<i>a historic match.</i>

862
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,920
Spain to Great Britain with 3.

863
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,130
With 2.

864
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:55,100
<i>I immediately began</i>
<i>to beat my dad.</i>

865
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,340
<i>I was beating him by far.</i>

866
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,670
Brazil to Sahara with 3.

867
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:11,480
You move your counters,
I'll move mine, okay?

868
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,790
<i>At the crucial point...</i>

869
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,090
<i>... I controlled</i>
<i>forty-nine countries.</i>

870
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:21,420
<i>Forty-nine!</i>
<i>And he had only one.</i>

871
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,360
Siberia to Kamchatka with 3.

872
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:43,450
China to Kamchatka with 3.

873
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:00,930
Japan to Kamchatka with 3.

874
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,080
Wait!
I'm regrouping!

875
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,740
- May I explain?
- Shut up and play!

876
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:23,780
Add three.

877
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,420
Pass.

878
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:33,860
China to Kamchatka with 3.

879
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:51,450
<i>This went on for hours.</i>

880
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:54,420
<i>Kamchatka versus</i>
<i>the rest of the world.</i>

881
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,030
<i>But I couldn't beat him.</i>

882
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,160
Kamchatka to Siberia, 3.

883
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:53,920
<i>The following morning,</i>
<i>Dad called for action.</i>

884
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,610
Hurry up!

885
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:00,820
Take him!

886
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:26,200
Mom?
What's wrong with dad?

887
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,380
They also got Oscar.

888
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:14,080
What do we do now?

889
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,100
Can I go to the toilet?

890
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,040
Wait till dad finishes.

891
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,580
I can go with him,
he's finished.

892
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,900
- There you go.
- Go out.

893
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,940
- Are you there?
- Yes.

894
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,480
Did you see all the people
out there eating?

895
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,590
Do you think they were
also called for action?

896
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:31,100
Faster! Faster!

897
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,810
PEDRO '75.
HARRY '76.

898
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:27,160
I need to know they'll
be safe from all this shit.

899
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,100
Do you know what I fear?

900
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,470
No, what?

901
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,940
Never ever seeing them again.

902
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,680
- What would you like?
- Coffee and milk.

903
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,050
Grandma is so happy
about your coming!

904
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,890
And the Little Guy?

905
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,690
He's asleep in the car.

906
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:56,330
I think that if he wakes and
you're gone, he'll be scared.

907
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,270
He's with mom.

908
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,920
I love you.

909
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:03,440
I'll wait by the van.

910
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,470
Be a good boy.

911
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:05,590
I love you very much.

912
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:10,240
And never forget...

913
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:37,360
<i>The last time I saw him...</i>

914
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,160
<i>... my dad spoke of Kamchatka.</i>

915
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,820
<i>This time I understood.</i>

916
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,160
<i>Whenever I played...</i>

917
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,600
<i>... dad was with me.</i>

918
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:51,470
<i>When the game</i>
<i>got tough...</i>

919
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:54,980
<i>... I stayed with him</i>
<i>and survived.</i>

920
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:57,710
<i>Because Kamchatka...</i>

921
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,710
<i>... is the place to be</i>
<i>when you want to resist.</i>
