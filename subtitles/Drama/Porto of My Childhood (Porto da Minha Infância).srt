00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,199
A film by Manoel de Oliveira

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:12,040
OPORTO OF MY CHILDHOOD
"To my children"

3
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,373
Producer

4
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,533
Director and voice off

5
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:40,262
To recall moments from a distant past
is to travel out of time

6
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:45,867
Only each person's memory can do
this. It is what I shall try to do.

7
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:53,666
This is nothing more than the ghost
of the house where I was born.

8
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,025
A fatal ruin, a final vision,
with nothing surprising for anyone...

9
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:03,627
But to one for whom it was
the cradle in which he grew up,

10
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:06,712
where he became aware of himself
and of the world,

11
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:10,591
a painful longing
remains in his soul.

12
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:16,071
Oh, how many years ago
Did I depart in tears

13
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:19,827
From my cosy
Caring home

14
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:24,192
Twenty, Thirty?
Do I not even know when

15
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,149
My old nanny
You who are watching me

16
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,957
Sing me songs
So I may remember

17
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,719
I have been around the world
I have been around life

18
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:39,719
I only found cheating
Deception, sorrow

19
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:43,560
Oh! How disillusioned
Is the innocent soul

20
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:47,521
My old nanny
With your doleful voice

21
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:51,646
Sing me songs
To set me to sleep

22
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:57,917
In front of the proud house
there rose three leafy lindens,

23
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:03,205
the protectors of a beautiful
garden, the Eden of my boyhood.

24
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:08,522
My heart is broken
With bitterness

25
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:12,607
See what deep pain lies
In my misty gaze

26
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:16,483
Oh, had I never left
My narrow nest

27
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:20,491
My old nanny
Sing me songs

28
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:15,050
Sing me songs
To lull me to sleep

29
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:32,016
From high up at the windows
one enjoyed a vast view of the city.

30
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,369
God once gave me in
The down of the nest

31
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,852
Precious stones from stars
Gems of moonlight

32
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:43,771
See, I have been robbed of
Everything along the way

33
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:47,539
My old nanny
I am a wretched poor man

34
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:51,619
Sing me songs
To make me cry

35
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:57,784
Like once before
In the beloved lap

36
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:01,185
I am dying, dying
Let me rest!

37
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:04,819
Oh, how your little boy
Has changed

38
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,983
My old nanny
How he has changed

39
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:13,510
Sing him songs to sleep
To dream

40
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:18,063
Sing me songs, softly
So, so softly

41
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:22,193
Sad, so sad
Like the sea at night

42
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:25,951
Sing me songs to see
If I can manage

43
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:30,350
To make my soul sleep
Be at peace, at rest

44
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:34,188
When soon Death
Comes to take it from me

45
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,436
Once, a long time ago, there was
only one birth there, mine,

46
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,841
there was only one death there,
that of my father.

47
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:51,075
The years have passed
and the times have changed.

48
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:55,556
Everything has been taken,
everything has been forgotten.

49
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:00,244
It only remains alive
in my sad memory.

50
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:12,764
''Eu sou toureiro, toureador
Bandarilheiro, farpeador... ''

51
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:43,819
My parents had a season ticket
to the opera,

52
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:46,899
and had another box
at the Sá da Bandeira Theatre.

53
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,533
I remember this scene
from the operetta Miss Diabo,

54
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:55,971
by the distinguished Oporto authors
Arnaldo Leite and Carvalho Barbosa,

55
00:07:57,304 --> 00:08:01,503
just as I saw it
from box number 16.

56
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:34,828
Hands up!

57
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:39,428
- Hands up!
- And the step backwards...

58
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,509
I fell in like a duck!

59
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,432
Hands up!

60
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:49,879
Okay Madame!
You'd better point that away,

61
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,593
it might be loaded

62
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,676
and I don't want to march off
to the angels...

63
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,362
Would you like one, Madame?

64
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:35,764
Don't worry, Madame, this
won't kill anyone from a distance.

65
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,415
This is a real good smoke!

66
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:14,224
Put that thing away and
let me suck this beauty in peace.

67
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,458
That tool wasn't made
for lady's fingers...

68
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,346
Put that down!

69
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,141
Will you put it down or not?

70
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,783
Who lives here?

71
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:37,749
My father, the servants and me.

72
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:41,588
And the dog that almost
ruined my trousers...

73
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:45,706
What now?
Are you going to call the police?

74
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,471
No, I'm not.

75
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:52,393
In fact I thank you for coming.
I have finally seen a...

76
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:57,390
A thief? You can say it.
I don't stand on ceremony...

77
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:02,839
But, what's this?
Bravo, we have music!

78
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:17,197
- Do you play?
- I scratch a little. It's obligatory.

79
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,637
I was born in the Moorish Quarter.

80
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:32,080
Criminal hands
Sad rejected hands

81
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:35,483
Capricious
Desolate

82
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,770
Hands of hunger
And bitterness

83
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,490
Criminal hands
Sad rejected hands

84
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,682
Capricious
Desolate

85
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,894
Hands of hunger
And bitterness

86
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:55,204
Hands of Fado singers

87
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:59,092
Who never sought
A sweet kiss from you

88
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:04,653
Hands to whom I give
All my impure life

89
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:10,733
Chilly hands
Poor, frightened hands

90
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,095
Foreboding, aching hands
Now weary of suffering

91
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:20,019
Hands of wretchedness

92
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:24,058
That sob out a Fado song
On the guitar...

93
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:30,263
Hands that freeze
And that Death will forget

94
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:33,705
I remember the Hanging Tree,

95
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:37,304
which at the time existed
in the Cordoaria Gardens.

96
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:41,426
And I used to ask whether thieves
were also hanged there.

97
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,509
I never got an answer.

98
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:50,070
I was afraid. And in the
dark night, seized by fear,

99
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:54,582
I found security in hearing
the horse guard go by.

100
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:12,196
I don't know whether it was
to chase away my fear of thieves

101
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,313
or through a desire to travel
through the deserted streets at night,

102
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,230
I asked if we could take
the long way home.

103
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,151
My mother indulged me
in my whim,

104
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:27,079
and told the chauffeur to do so.

105
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,356
The chauffeur's name was...

106
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:35,523
Lamas.
The chauffeur was called Lamas.

107
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:38,924
Lamas, that's it!
His name was Lamas!

108
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:52,961
This is the street were
my long-gone house used to exist.

109
00:15:53,367 --> 00:16:00,286
It is named the 9th of July,
because, on the 9th of July 1832,

110
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,039
King Dom Pedro IV's troops
came along this street,

111
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,926
having disembarked on Mindelo
Beach on the previous day.

112
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:11,132
This is King Dom Pedro IV,
the Liberator,

113
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:14,327
who left his heart to Oporto,

114
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:17,726
the City that was the birthplace
of the Liberty of the Nation.

115
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:51,814
Almeida Garrett,
a poet and a liberal from Oporto,

116
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:57,022
disembarked with King Don Pedro's
troops. And he sang like this.

117
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:02,860
''When I dreamt, it was like this
That I saw it in my dream

118
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:05,265
''It was like this that the fleeting

119
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,504
''Image that I could never reach
Would flee from me

120
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,304
''Now that I am awake,
Now that I see it stare...

121
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:20,026
''What for? When it was vague,
An idea, a thought,

122
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:24,348
''An uncertain shine of star
In an immense firmament,

123
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:30,510
''A chimera, a vain dream
I dreamt, but I lived

124
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:37,715
''I knew not what pleasure was
But pain, I felt it not... ''

125
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,035
With my head pressed against the
glass of one of those windows,

126
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:48,241
looking at the city, I sometimes
thought of the beggars

127
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,321
who asked for alms
outside Sunday Mass,

128
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:55,877
and I saw myself with my hand
outstretched like them,

129
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,478
next to my mother.

130
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:08,481
And I saw myself as naturally as I
had seen the actors in the theatre.

131
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,479
I also heard of someone

132
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,407
who had fallen into disgrace
and wretchedness. And I thought...

133
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,761
What if a similar misfortune
befalls us?

134
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:26,645
I added a thousand
other possible misfortunes,

135
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:30,888
which clouded my mind
like breath on the glass.

136
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,370
And then I thought
that I could perhaps

137
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,256
work as an apprentice stonemason.

138
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:42,209
It was a tradition
passed down from father to son.

139
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,576
I liked to watch them work.

140
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,779
But could I do it? I still remember
the song they hummed,

141
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,252
when they were dragging
a large stone

142
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:57,734
and they moved it
with long iron poles,

143
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:04,819
two men on each side,
as if rowing rhythmically.

144
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,979
Stone... oh!
Stone... hey!

145
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:12,779
Stone... oh!
Stone... hey!

146
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:17,104
The profession
of these honest stonemasons,

147
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,982
as humble as it is noble.

148
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,823
In those days all the houses
were built of stone.

149
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,828
A beautiful tradition
that is now lost,

150
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:29,743
as can be seen
in the old houses and palaces,

151
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:34,791
and in what remains of
the old wall around the city.

152
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:43,874
As sweet-toothed as I was,
when they used to take me

153
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,829
to the confectioner's shops
in the afternoon,

154
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:49,236
I used to hide,
hoping to be left behind,

155
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,757
and to be able to enjoy
all those pastries.

156
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,076
The Confeitaria Oliveira
a cake-shop was my favourite

157
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:00,792
and was considered
to be the most chic.

158
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,633
But I wasn't attracted
by the luxury...

159
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,794
- It was the pastries!
- It was the pastries.

160
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:11,043
There were the ''babás''and others.

161
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:14,605
But the puff pastries
with egg-paste filling,

162
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,636
the ones they called ''cocós''
those were really good.

163
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,645
Those pastries are delicious!

164
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:38,930
But the cake-shop disappeared,
and the cakes went with it.

165
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,126
This is it today.

166
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,449
I'm just remembering
a curious episode I witnessed.

167
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,411
At that time the tradition was

168
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,891
At that time the tradition was

169
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:45,600
to have two exhibitions
at the Crystal Palace,

170
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:48,413
the Motor Show
and the Flower Show.

171
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:59,374
Because of their similarity
and being stopped at rest,

172
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:06,768
this is certainly the poets Fernando
Pessoa, on the left, and José Régio.

173
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:25,542
Another tradition
was the after-dinner stroll,

174
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,341
a back and forth
along the Avenida das Tilias,

175
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:32,144
where it was chic
for the society ladies

176
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:34,782
to show off their dresses
in the latest fashions.

177
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:41,779
There were some houses opposite
the Crystal Palace gardens.

178
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,068
In one of them, which belonged
to my uncle Casimiro,

179
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,061
I stayed along with brother,
his godson,

180
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:54,388
living with my cousins
while my parents travelled abroad.

181
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:59,353
- My cousins were...
- António and his sisters...

182
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:00,749
Virginia,

183
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:01,872
Alice,

184
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,031
Amélia,

185
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,231
Maria,

186
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,875
Guilhermina,

187
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,031
and Helena.

188
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,796
Of the three youngest ones,

189
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:11,432
the ones closest to my age,

190
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:13,989
the most romantic was Guilhermina,

191
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,431
and we were sweethearts.

192
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:35,483
At night I used to go upstairs
to meet her,

193
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:38,487
careful not to wake anyone.

194
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,043
These were
our very green years and,

195
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,606
with the innocence of children,
we would exchange a pure kiss...

196
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,605
Careful!

197
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:04,002
And immediately run off in fright
to our respective bedrooms,

198
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:10,771
carrying with us the delight of
that sweet and innocent adventure.

199
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,248
Time passed.
Guilhermina disappeared forever,

200
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:18,815
with tuberculosis, like her brother.
The houses are now different,

201
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:22,456
only the memory of the brief
encounter has remained.

202
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,776
And in this old Crystal Palace

203
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:31,892
they continued to have
a Motor Show every autumn.

204
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,736
We were in 1922,

205
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:47,816
the date of the
Lisbon-Rio Atlantic crossing

206
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:51,259
for the first time
in the history of aviation,

207
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:58,622
with the sextant of Gago Coutinho and
Sacadura Cabral flying this plane.

208
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,071
Somewhat later on

209
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:13,432
a branch of the Confeitaria Oliveira
opened here

210
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:16,236
in the Rua 31 de Janeiro,

211
00:26:16,476 --> 00:26:20,265
the date commemorating
the Oporto Movement,

212
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:25,428
the first attempt to set up
a republic in Portugal.

213
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,915
The shop window was protected
by a thick yellow metal rail,

214
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,751
against which certain bohemians
used to lean in the afternoon...

215
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:41,076
bohemians who were... raffinés.
- Raffinés... and a little pedantic!

216
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:45,761
Raffiné... was Joel,
with his monocle.

217
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,315
And Diogo, who always
came along in uniform

218
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:52,603
and acting like a lady-killer.

219
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:56,563
The youngest one, Chico,
had a certain blasé air.

220
00:26:57,008 --> 00:27:02,562
- Blasé... Very blasé...
- We nicknamed him ''Fantasias''.

221
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,769
Fantasias thought
it was of no interest

222
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:10,248
to carry on living
after the age of forty.

223
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:13,610
I think it is really inelegant
for a man to let himself grow old.

224
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:16,607
Longevity was shorter
in those days,

225
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:20,126
and forty was a ripe old age.

226
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,846
That's what you say,
but you don't know why you say it.

227
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:28,607
- Oh, yeah? I say what I feel.
- But you don't know what you feel.

228
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,337
And you do?

229
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,139
- I think there is a reason.
- You think so? Well explain it.

230
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:43,254
It's simple.
Men like women, don't they?

231
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:47,938
And women like men, don't they?

232
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:52,301
I think we've understood that!

233
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,902
Before there used
to be the androgen,

234
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:58,262
which included the masculine
and the feminine.

235
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,585
They were happy!

236
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,984
So? What do you mean by that?

237
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:09,660
That when they were together they
didn't have to look for each other.

238
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,430
How dull...

239
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:18,311
You think it's dull?
That's the way it was.

240
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,787
And from this union the masculine
came out on one side

241
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,910
and the feminine on the other.

242
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:27,749
That's where the expression
'soul mate' comes from.

243
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:30,676
Yes, I like the soul mate bit.

244
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,238
Well, what Fantasias wants
is to bring the two parts together...

245
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,150
That's what we all want!

246
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,269
Exactly.

247
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:49,274
And so, what Fantasias is afraid
of is that when he reaches forty

248
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:50,881
he will lose strength.

249
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:56,123
Lose his power
of attraction over women.

250
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:03,203
But has anyone ever heard you say
you would kill yourself at forty?

251
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:16,126
I don't have to...
I'll never get there...

252
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,644
Prettier and prettier!

253
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,450
It was extravagances like this that
attracted the younger boys like me.

254
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,443
They would tell tales of scandals...

255
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:26,925
Shocking things
that aroused our imagination.

256
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:31,414
Today's youth is rather different

257
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:35,566
and the metal rail on which
those bohemians used to lean

258
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,095
no longer exists.

259
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,255
Today, it is this.

260
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:56,179
I fell
into the bohemian lifestyle early.

261
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:01,134
I started frequenting nightclubs
here, at the Palace,

262
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:04,344
the largest and most popular one.

263
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,383
From the Palace we went on
to the Clube do Porto,

264
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:12,781
which was smaller and more refined.

265
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:18,308
Here there was the Primavera,
which was more popular,

266
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:24,103
and which always acted as a last
resort to find an available lady.

267
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:02,196
Have a seat.

268
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:16,958
Girl, come here. Have a seat.

269
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,956
- Get your paws off... rascal!
- Don't be coy, sit down here...

270
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:24,360
Will you let go
or do you want trouble?

271
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:21,050
Hello, sharp guy!
The lady whore has an owner!

272
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:26,886
- To each its own, my friend!
- Now you're talking!

273
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:43,407
- There goes the merchandise.
- It's a little difficult today.

274
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:51,770
Be careful.
This is full of pimps today.

275
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:54,976
So I see, so I see...
It's a little difficult today.

276
00:31:056,539 --> 00:31:58,291
Tell her to sit down here.

277
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,979
Sit down here with us...

278
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,337
I'm promised to another guy.

279
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:08,898
I've got to go...

280
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,773
Shame... A great shame!

281
00:32:13,704 --> 00:32:19,257
Some other night... When I come.
And you come too. Cutie...

282
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,709
Don't pay any attention
to these lads.

283
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:41,192
They just want free rides.

284
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,141
They're nice.

285
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:47,984
Nice?
But they won't give you anything!

286
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,709
It doesn't matter. They're nice.

287
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,875
What about me?

288
00:32:56,197 --> 00:33:00,510
You? My darling!
You give me great comfort.

289
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:19,964
- Cod.
- Squid.

290
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:22,916
Women pay no attention to us.

291
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:26,117
We have to become philosophers.

292
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,443
Women, always women.

293
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,959
An American woman
scandalizes feminist society

294
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:36,925
because she preaches
a return to the home

295
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:40,685
and to the minute details
of correct upbringing.

296
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,689
How to behave at table
and to say thank you.

297
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:48,372
Jesus never washed his hands
before eating,

298
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:52,931
which surely did not go unnoticed
by the highborn disciples.

299
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:56,125
It wouldn't be Peter, the fisherman,

300
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,527
who would notice
his Master's lack of etiquette.

301
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:04,889
The fact is that nowadays
women move in a difficult terrain,

302
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:08,051
having to opt for children
or a career.

303
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,373
They eat badly, do their hair
to appear on television,

304
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,176
and hardly look in the mirror
in order to look at their watches.

305
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:22,575
It is extraordinary how a watch
outdoes a pearl necklace.

306
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,778
In a few years women
will have to choose

307
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:44,539
between the kindergarten teacher,
the technician in a company,

308
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,948
workshop or laboratory,
and the geisha.

309
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,061
A geisha also needs
a university degree.

310
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:54,310
She knows about music and books,
she reads Espinosa,

311
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:58,906
consults the dictionary,
personally knows Valentino

312
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:02,672
and has an apartment
in Ille de France

313
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:05,272
with a view over the Bois de Bologne.

314
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:08,914
She does not go on cruises
to the Caribbean or to Tahiti,

315
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:12,557
she bets on the horses and,
above all,

316
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:17,398
she stopped playing golf
since it became a way

317
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,680
for the bourgeois to keep
their names and feet clean.

318
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:25,792
The geisha may be sixty years old
and be magnificent.

319
00:35:26,402 --> 00:35:29,282
She has many admirers
and very few lovers.

320
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,918
Men are proud of her,
confide their secrets in her,

321
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:39,118
and do not expect her to undress or
to cut up the meat on their plates.

322
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:42,445
The geisha
is a misdemeanour of democracy,

323
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:47,447
but without misdemeanours there is
no culture, so there you have it.

324
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,682
Other times I used to come here
with Adolfo Casais Monteiro,

325
00:35:55,011 --> 00:36:02,693
who I met before he had published
his poems, 'Confusao', in 1929,

326
00:36:04,374 --> 00:36:06,935
and his companion
Rodrigues de Freitas,

327
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:10,207
the author of the short story
'Meninos Milionários',

328
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:14,967
which would later inspire me
for my film 'Aniki-Bobó'.

329
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:18,697
This is where the Café Central
used to exist,

330
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:23,895
where I used to meet with Casais
and Freitas, university students,

331
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,421
and with others, some of whom
were students of fine arts,

332
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:31,456
like Boaventura Porfirio,

333
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:33,619
Camarinha, Augusto Gomes,

334
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:37,294
Alvarez, and the architect
Januário Godinho.

335
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:41,741
The group was more visionary
than political,

336
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,176
and was not welcomed
by the regime.

337
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:47,265
It also included philosophers
and poets,

338
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:51,303
with a natural propensity
towards ascending to the sublime.

339
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:55,986
From the Central we moved on
to the Café Majestic,

340
00:36:56,709 --> 00:37:00,226
a magnificent work of the
ornamentation of the twenties

341
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:02,906
by the architect Joao Queiróz.

342
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:10,466
The Café Majestic was fashionable
then, and is so again today,

343
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,754
now conserved just as is was
when it opened.

344
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:22,194
We used to get together
in this corner and,

345
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:25,271
on other occasions
and at other times of day,

346
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:28,798
I would come here on my own.
And here I withdrew

347
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,319
to write almost the whole plan
for a film, 'Gigantes Do Douro',

348
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:36,315
that I was stupidly
not allowed to make

349
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:39,561
because it showed the effort
carried out by workers

350
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:43,359
to transform the steep slopes
into terraces,

351
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,953
and afterwards planting
and cultivating the vines,

352
00:37:47,244 --> 00:37:51,366
up to the extracting of the precious
nectar that is our Port Wine.

353
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,645
Times that have now gone,

354
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:57,760
but which have left forgotten
a work that was unique,

355
00:37:58,048 --> 00:38:02,247
difficult and cruel,
and today is done by machines.

356
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,923
This was in 1934.

357
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:10,962
We ended up in the Café Palladium,

358
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:14,729
located on the ground floor
of this remarkable building,

359
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,370
the Grandes Armazéns Nascimento,

360
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:21,125
the work of the great architect
Marques da Silva.

361
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:24,296
Very late on certain nights,

362
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:29,009
we liked to wander through
the dark alleys of the old city.

363
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,819
Besides me there were Casais,

364
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:38,173
Rodrigues de Freitas
and António Silva.

365
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:46,174
We would stroll through the alleys,
giving free rein to our imagination.

366
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:53,025
Casais Monteiro, a humanist poet,

367
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:56,622
was arrested
and persecuted by the regime.

368
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:59,780
He ended up taking refuge
in Brazil.

369
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:01,821
The years went by

370
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:05,658
and his exile reminded me
of the figure of the Desterrado.

371
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,270
Soares dos Reis, the sculptor,
committed suicide,

372
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:12,582
when he felt insulted
by the accusation

373
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:16,382
that he had plagiarized Rodin's
The Thinker. An unjust accusation.

374
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:21,350
What the 'Desterrado' expresses
is longing.

375
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:26,869
And it seems to hold, in its hands
crossed and resting on its knees,

376
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:30,991
the deep sadness
coming down from its face.

377
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:35,231
Adolfo Casais Monteiro
died in exile.

378
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:37,635
His bitterness towards
his homeland

379
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:40,393
and the despondency
he received from Europe

380
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,477
were overshadowed
by hopefulness,

381
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,354
as is shown
in his long poem 'Europe',

382
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:50,199
broadcast by the BBC in London
in 1945.

383
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:54,403
''Europe, without future
Europe, morning to come

384
00:39:54,763 --> 00:40:00,443
Frontiers with no guard dogs
Gates left open

385
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:03,599
Europe without the suffering
Dragging their rags

386
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:05,923
Will you come one day?
Will there come the day

387
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:08,317
On which you are reborn purified?

388
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:13,565
Will you one day be
The common home

389
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:16,604
Of those who were born
On your devastated soil?

390
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:20,688
Will you rise, phoenix,
Out of the ashes

391
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:23,282
In which, false grandeur,
Burns

392
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:26,650
The glory that your peoples
Dreamt themselves

393
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,806
Each in wanting all of you?

394
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,294
Europe, future dream
If one day it ever comes!

395
00:40:41,498 --> 00:40:45,253
Europe who did not know
How to hear in the depth of time

396
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,415
The voice in darkness crying

397
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,773
That your grandeur was not
In only being prodigious of spirit

398
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,662
If avaricious of bread!

399
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:56,420
Your grandeur was made

400
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:00,013
By those who never asked
What race they served

401
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:03,541
Your glory was won
By hands that in freedom molded

402
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:08,302
Your unshackled body
In an ever to be achieved dream

403
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:13,023
Europe, oh world to create!
Europe, oh dream to come

404
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:16,220
Before descend to earth

405
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:19,302
The voices that have molded
Your ideal figure

406
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:22,110
Europe, unraised dream,

407
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:26,065
Until the day on which falls
Your spirit over the waters

408
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:30,187
Europe without the suffering
Dragging their rags

409
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:32,949
Will you come one day?
Will there come the day

410
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:35,264
On which you are reborn purified?

411
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:37,989
Will you one day
Be the common home

412
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,391
Of those who were born
On your devastated soil?

413
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:43,236
Will you rise, phoenix,
Out of the ashes

414
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,433
Of your divided body?

415
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:48,954
Europe, you will only come
When among nations

416
00:41:49,198 --> 00:41:51,759
Hate does not have
The last word

417
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,514
Hate is not guided
By the avaricious hand

418
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,070
The hand is not made bold

419
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,110
By the empty sound
Of the burying of the coffers

420
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:03,313
Digesting the blood of the flock

421
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:09,044
Of the flock killed in daylight
The man you dreamt, Europe

422
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:10,638
Be life!

423
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:16,679
Oh dead civilization!
No more your rotten blood!

424
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:20,722
Stiff, parched corpse,
To the grave, to the grave!

425
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:24,684
Yes to your new song!
Purified

426
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,682
Your name
Europe

427
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,761
The evil you were
Redeemed

428
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,081
The good you gave
Shared!

429
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:36,450
There goes the corpse adorned
In speeches

430
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:40,966
Blooming with wounds
With pus, with repulsion...

431
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:45,253
A corpse adorned by frontier wars

432
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,252
Fiction to serve
The dream of violence

433
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:53,766
Masks of ideal
Covering old rage

434
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:58,449
Go, corpse covered in crimes

435
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,735
For the restless gravediggers
Find the whole earth little

436
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:08,015
No blood is enough for them!

437
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:13,773
On the corpse your gravediggers
Dance their dance

438
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:21,216
Black foreboding crows
Suck your wretched blood

439
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:25,626
The more the blood
The more they dance

440
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:29,384
And you are carried
You perform

441
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:34,667
The steps of your
Funeral dance

442
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:39,022
But from the blood
You will be born

443
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:43,142
Or never again
Europe of the future!

444
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:46,864
And the hand to stop you
On the brink of the abyss

445
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:50,068
Will be born of the blood!

446
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:53,992
And the arms to defend
Your tomorrow

447
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:56,668
Will be born of the blood!

448
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,714
The blood will teach

449
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,874
Or a new, greater slavery

450
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:05,237
Will bring mourning
To your fields sown

451
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,591
With gallows and tyrants

452
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,391
You will cleanse of blood
Your tormented body

453
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:15,759
And, phoenix, you shall live''.

454
00:44:18,124 --> 00:44:21,640
Exiled like Casais,
under different circumstances

455
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:26,485
was Agostinho da Silva, another
illustrious figure from Oporto.

456
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:37,077
We would go down to the river
and hold discussions

457
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,561
like the crossed iron beams
held up the bridge.

458
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:44,208
Or we would remember
the 'Douro Faina Fluvial'.

459
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:44,947
This is where I wrote that film,

460
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,868
the first that I directed.

461
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:50,742
A passion that stole me from sport,

462
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:54,344
just as the latter stole me
from the bohemian life.

463
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:58,713
From passion to passion
I became the filmmaker I am today

464
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,910
and that I will be to the end.

465
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:05,827
In this house I wrote and imagined
many films that I could not direct.

466
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:10,675
In this garage,
which was the garage of my house,

467
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:15,393
turned with António Mendes
into an impromptu laboratory,

468
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,915
we developed most of the negative.

469
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,598
In order to save money
I did the editing by hand,

470
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,032
directly over the negative,

471
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:29,522
with these rolls around
the billiard table in the house

472
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:33,593
that saw the birth of both myself
and my first film.

473
00:46:34,244 --> 00:46:35,473
Thanks to the cinema,

474
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:38,638
we can see these bits
over and over again.

475
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:42,203
But only each person's memory
can recall things

476
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:45,326
that only we did live through.

477
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:50,440
And is doing so not the best way
of showing who we are?

478
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:53,888
But many of my memories,
in going back into the past,

479
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:56,810
have been lost and today
are entombed,

480
00:46:57,051 --> 00:46:59,647
just as this ruin has been
entombed...

481
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:03,682
Oh, how many years ago
Did I depart in tears

482
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,571
From my cosy, caring home

483
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:12,051
Twenty? Thirty?
Do I not even know when

484
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:16,569
My old nanny,
You who are watching me...

485
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:21,814
On other occasions
we would recall Paz dos Reis,

486
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,571
and would think about the
Camisaria Confiança shirt-makers,

487
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:29,699
in the Rua de Santa Catarina.

488
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:32,935
Saint Catherine,
patron saint of the seamstresses,

489
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,735
who were the unknowing performers
in the first Portuguese picture.

490
00:48:35,402 --> 00:48:39,759
In those days the showing of films
was improvised in sheds.

491
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:43,917
Only much later was there
the building of the first cinema,

492
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,714
the 'Cinema High-Life'.

493
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:50,639
A bell used to ring
to warn the audience,

494
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:53,237
''Ring-ring, ring-ring''.

495
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:56,605
When it stopped,
it meant that the film had started.

496
00:48:57,808 --> 00:49:02,440
During the film, when the bad guy
would hide behind the door,

497
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:06,685
there was always someone in the
stalls that would warn the hero,

498
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:10,771
shouting. ''Don't go in,
the guy's behind the door... ''

499
00:49:13,372 --> 00:49:16,889
Today it is this modern building,
the 'Cinema Batalha',

500
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,925
built on the site
of the former 'High-Life'.

501
00:49:21,656 --> 00:49:26,048
So the 'Batalha',
conserved by the City Council,

502
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:30,816
remains as the historical bastion
of the cinema here in Oporto.

503
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:35,608
And as we have turned to the
first page of Portuguese cinema,

504
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,450
let us work some magic

505
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:45,214
and have Paz dos Reis filming the
workers leaving their workplace,

506
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:49,373
at 'Oporto 2001,
European Capital of Culture.

507
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:57,501
The city is being renewed,

508
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:59,623
but no matter how much
it is changed

509
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:02,666
it will always be
my childhood Oporto

510
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:06,385
with a gold stream
running at its feet.

511
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:19,311
''Do you want to play with me?''

512
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:34,941
Like once before
In the beloved lap

513
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:38,309
I am dying, dying
Let me rest

514
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:41,864
Oh, how your little boy
Has changed

515
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:46,222
My old nanny
How he has changed

516
00:54:46,874 --> 00:54:50,550
Sing him songs to sleep
To dream

517
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:53,988
Sing me songs, softly
So, so softly

518
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:57,986
Sad, so sad
Like the sea at night

519
00:54:58,677 --> 00:55:02,513
Sing me songs to see
If I can manage

520
00:55:02,878 --> 00:55:07,158
To make my soul sleep
Be at peace, at rest

521
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,230
When soon Death
Comes to take it from me
