Cinema Service

2
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:27,609
and Unikorea presents

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,574
in association with
MBC Production

00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,663
a Miracin Korea production

THE TURNING GATE

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,433
Kyungsoo receives
a phone call from Sungwoo

7
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,756
Hello?

8
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,094
Is this Kim Kyungsoo?

9
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,763
Yes, who's this?

10
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,183
It's me.

11
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,811
Sungwoo,

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,229
How are you?

13
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,818
Oh, Sungwoo?

14
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,655
How long has it been!

15
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,533
You're hard to reach!

16
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,660
Guess you've been busy?

17
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,496
Good to hear from you.

18
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,249
Where are you, in Seoul?

19
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,628
I'm in Chuncheon.

20
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,673
I finally saw your film today!

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,383
Nice job!

22
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,428
You did?

23
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,099
Are you still writing?

24
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,351
Yeah.

25
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,687
My writer friends

26
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,939
and I saw your film on video.

27
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,941
They say you're great!

28
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,445
Few have seen my film.

29
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,780
I'm sitting next

30
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,616
to a big fan of yours!

31
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,535
A dance instructor!

32
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,287
Want to talk to her?.

33
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,831
Stop it...

34
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,794
Yeah.

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,506
Thanks... for calling.

36
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,509
Come visit me in Chuncheon.

37
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,553
We share some great memories.

38
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,306
I'll take good care of you.

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,808
So just come, okay?

40
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,229
Okay... Thanks.

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,567
I will go next time.
Really.

42
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,527
I'm not kidding.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,780
We have great people here
in Chuncheon!

44
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:27,748
Kyungsoo goes to the film company
and has a quarrel with the director

45
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,809
Hello?

46
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,645
It's me.

47
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,606
Why did you just leave?

48
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,318
I waited.

49
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,779
You came back out?

50
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,657
After how long?

51
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,368
I have... something

52
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,037
to apologize for.

53
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,041
We can't cast you in
my film this time.

54
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,630
So, it's final?

55
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,633
Yeah, I think so.

56
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,136
The company's already been

57
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,806
working on the casting.

58
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,395
Star quality is
important, after all.

59
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,483
They blame you
for the last film's failure.

60
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm sorry for keeping you
waiting for so long.

61
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,741
It's okay.

62
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,119
I didn't expect much.

63
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,332
I didn't feel you were
doing your best.

64
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,503
Anyway, can I shave now?

65
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,673
Shave?

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,009
Yes, of course.
Shave, as you wish.

67
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,677
Sorry about that.

68
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,264
Here.

69
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,724
Thanks.

70
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,084
I'm only getting my share.

71
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,211
What a sum to lose face over!

72
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,133
Aren't you aware
of the company's losses?

73
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,221
The company and staff are all
making sacrifices for my sake.

74
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,891
How could you take
a running guarantee?

75
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,062
I'm appalled.

76
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,606
How could you be
so thoughtless?

77
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,733
I'm suffering as much as you!

78
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,526
Who cares about the company!

79
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,737
They'll continue working with you!

80
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,906
I'm the one who's in a rut!

81
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,742
You're in no position to speak.

82
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm going away.
See you later.

83
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,934
Kyungsoo...

84
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:39,439
Even though it's difficult
to be a human being.

85
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,276
let's not turn into
monsters, okay?

86
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,409
Who do you think you are,
a film director?!

87
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,607
Kim Kyungsoo!

88
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,110
Sungwoo.

89
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,279
Amazing how quickly

90
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,780
you rushed over here.

91
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,990
Great to see you, too.

92
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,992
You've put on
so much weight!

93
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,493
Yeah?

94
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,328
Did you have lunch?

95
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,915
Yeah, it's been so long.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,209
Brings back memories.

97
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,753
You haven't changed.

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,338
How can you be the same?

99
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,383
What's there to change...?

100
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,261
Shouldn't you be busy?

101
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,015
I always get stage parts...

102
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,309
But I'm waiting
for something better.

103
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,770
It's film I really want to get into.

104
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,565
Let's go.
We'll talk on the way.

105
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,487
You've put on so much weight!

106
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,447
I'm trying to slim down,

107
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,241
but nothing seems to work.

108
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,163
Was I drunk
when I called yesterday?

109
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:22,125
No, I had something
on my mind.

110
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,587
I really wanted to see you.

111
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,589
Really?

112
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,382
Of course.

113
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,936
Tired?

114
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,648
Who are you living with?

115
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,607
Living alone?

116
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,360
No, with my cousin,

117
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,530
her husband and
their daughter.

118
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,990
The farm's my cousin's.

119
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,368
So, it isn't yours?

120
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,620
My cousin's been running it

121
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,706
since my father's death.

122
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,542
So, who owns the place?

123
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,210
It's mine...

124
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,589
but, it's really my cousin's.

125
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,342
I see.

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,428
That man, walking
in front of us...

127
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,471
Who?

128
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,848
Who is he?

129
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,725
My cousin's husband.

130
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,645
I see.

131
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,566
Tired?

132
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,942
No.

133
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,194
I feel great.

134
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,156
Good?

135
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,951
This is really good.

136
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,122
It's not your everyday
chicken gruel.

137
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,666
It's got everything in it.

138
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,754
I love chicken gruel,

139
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,506
but this is really good.

140
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,926
It's not any ordinary
chicken gruel.

141
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,514
Anyway, tomorrow morning,
you'll see.

142
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,849
Huh?

143
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,018
Wait and see.

144
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,895
Everything's in it.

145
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,689
What?

146
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,903
Guaranteed erection.

147
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,755
Sungwoo.

148
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,134
Finished eating?

149
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,137
Where's your husband?
We need a ride.

150
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,264
Do you need it now?

151
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,349
Yeah.

152
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,226
Thanks.

153
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,522
I really enjoyed your cooking...

154
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,941
I'd like to pay you for it.

155
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,693
Don't bother.

156
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,489
But it's from your diner...

157
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,741
Besides, I really enjoyed it.

158
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,660
Really, it's okay.

159
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,163
Sungwoo, tell him to drop it

160
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,748
okay?

161
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,377
What?

162
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,588
I just wanted to pay
for the meal.

163
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,715
Come in now.

164
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,516
This place is colder
than Seoul.

165
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,975
Yeah?

166
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,353
Not that much.

167
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,107
I'm dragging you out, huh?

168
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,650
Don't say that.

169
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,821
The air here is clearly
different from Seoul's.

170
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,883
Let's play!

171
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,553
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

172
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,643
Okay! You!

173
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,478
It's your turn!

174
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,063
Hey!

175
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,484
Drink up, or take it off.

176
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,740
Stop drinking. Let's play!

177
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,491
Drink up!

178
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,869
Goddamn it!

179
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,704
Wait.

180
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:32,625
New bottles coming!

181
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,671
Give me, whatever.

182
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,424
Give him a bottle!

183
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,308
You're such a sissy!

184
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,353
You damn alcoholic!

185
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,067
Why do you sway so much!

186
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,199
Can't you see I'm naked?

187
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,409
I've got to quit now, I'm serious.

188
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,876
Take your pants off!

189
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,504
Let's tickle him.

190
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,466
Let's take them off for him.

191
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,303
Get off of me!

192
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:37,190
Take off your pants!

193
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,656
Asshole!

194
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,953
Get off of me.

195
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,334
Why do you fucking
sway like that?

196
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,844
Game's over, now!

197
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,889
Get up!

198
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,352
Move.

199
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,527
Isn't that what
you want us to do?

200
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,330
Fuck!

201
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,625
Is this Kim Kyungsoo...?

202
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,460
Yes.

203
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,588
What's wrong?

204
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,757
Why didn't you answer?.

205
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,760
Where are you?

206
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,720
Why did you pay the bill?

207
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,514
I'm leaving for Seoul.

208
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,183
Seoul?

209
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,268
Why?

210
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,773
Where the hell are you?

211
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:46,611
You can't go
to Seoul at this hour!

212
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,740
How the hell will you get there?!

213
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,556
You asshole!

214
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,856
Do you realize
how happy I was to see you!

215
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,279
Kim Kyungsoo!

216
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,449
What's wrong with you!

217
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,125
Come here.

218
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,337
Come here!

219
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,395
Even though it's difficult
to be a human being,

220
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,773
let's not turn into monsters.

221
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:23,875
Myungsuk tells Kyungsoo
that she loves him

222
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,472
His name is Daengchil.

223
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,348
Daengchil?

224
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes.

225
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,060
What's your name?

226
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,187
Choi Heerah.

227
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,272
Who named you?

228
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,067
My grandfather did.

229
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,823
Who do you prefer,
your mommy or your daddy?

230
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,327
Both, mommy and daddy.

231
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,789
Come over here.

232
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,417
Is this a duck?

233
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,003
No, it's a goose.

234
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,838
-A goose?
-Yes.

235
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:17,178
A big goose, isn't it?

236
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,312
Let's go!

237
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,818
My God!

238
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,282
Are you all right?

239
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,993
Is she hurt?

240
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,411
It's okay.

241
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,414
She jammed her finger

242
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,666
Is it serious?

243
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,794
Don't cry.

244
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,837
Open the door!

245
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,505
I think she's really in pain.

246
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,135
Can you bear it?

247
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,682
It'll be okay.

248
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,501
You used to be
a playboy, right?

249
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,753
Never!

250
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,510
You meet this girl
who's far from your type,

251
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,638
and suddenly she becomes

252
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,224
a woman to you.

253
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,644
That girl's too young for you.

254
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,439
That's not what I mean.

255
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,611
Just that I once liked

256
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,655
a girl like that.

257
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,284
She looks like
a college freshman.

258
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,578
She seems to be
on her own.

259
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,831
Yeah, it appears so.

260
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,805
The water level

261
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,350
used to be much higher.

262
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,561
Hello.

263
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,605
What a surprise
to meet you here.

264
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,065
Why, hello.

265
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,149
How have you been?

266
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,567
What a coincidence.

267
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,652
Here sightseeing?

268
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,281
Are you going
to Chungpyung Temple?

269
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,741
Yes, and you?

270
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,992
Yes.

271
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,245
What a coincidence.

272
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,831
How do you do?

273
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,639
So does the Turning Gate
really turn?

274
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,557
No, it's just like any old gate,

275
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
there's not much to see.

276
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,645
Then why are we going there?

277
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,440
Just for the ferry ride.

278
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,443
Who are they?

279
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,738
Another time...

280
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,742
I'll tell you about the Turning Gate.

281
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,744
You know the
Chinese Emperor Taejong?

282
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,831
He had a daughter.

283
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,709
There was a young commoner

284
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,712
who became lovesick over her.

285
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,256
Enraged, the king beheaded
the commoner.

286
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:45,678
But this commoner

287
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,805
reincarnated into a snake.

288
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,349
which wrapped its body

289
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,728
around the princess.

290
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,564
She was on the verge
of death.

291
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,482
A Taoist priest told her

292
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,068
to seek Chungpyung
Temple in Korea.

293
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,529
She went there

294
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,489
and in front of the Chungpyung

295
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,991
Temple, she told the snake:

296
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,410
"I'll return with some food,

297
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,704
so wait for me here."

298
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,957
The princess went inside
and never came out.

299
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,753
So the snake went after her.

300
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,254
Suddenly, there was rain,

301
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,089
lightning and thunder.

302
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,342
Terrified, it ran away.

303
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,218
The gate from which the snake

304
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,596
turned back from was called

305
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,181
the Turning Gate.

306
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,859
Excuse me!

307
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,904
We're not going
to the temple.

308
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,155
See you another time.

309
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,823
I see, goodbye then.

310
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,116
Good day.

311
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,621
Who are they?

312
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,207
I'm not comfortable
with them.

313
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,710
They run a bag factory.

314
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,799
We've missed the Turning Gate.

315
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,095
You wanted to see it?
There's nothing much to see.

316
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,679
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,973
It's okay, I was just joking.

318
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,725
Too many drinks last night.

319
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,852
I'm not feeling well anyway.

320
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,979
Me neither.

321
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,941
It's the Turning Gate
that's turning us back.

322
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,409
Myungsuk.

323
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,576
Why, hello.

324
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,828
How have you been?

325
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,704
But we met the other day.

326
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,998
Are you coming
from Lake Soyang?

327
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,710
Hello.

328
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,879
Did you have lunch?

329
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,841
Not yet. What about you?

330
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,467
I'm on a diet.

331
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,052
I've put on so much weight.

332
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,595
You look fine to me.

333
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,766
No, I have a fat tummy.

334
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,892
Where is the studio?

335
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,869
It's shabby, but my teacher
is attached to this place.

336
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,620
Coffee?

337
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,789
I'd love some.

338
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,915
How about you?

339
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,917
Yes, please.

340
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,130
Would you like
to see me dance?

341
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,592
I'd love to.

342
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,551
Yes.

343
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,094
I'll show you then.

344
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,556
I really should be wearing a skirt.

345
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,768
This is modern dance.

346
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,705
This is traditional dance.

347
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,480
This is salsa.

348
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:47,795
Done?

349
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,214
That was great.

350
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,298
You're a good dancer.

351
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,216
Thank you.

352
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,685
Do you have a boyfriend?

353
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,938
A boyfriend?

354
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,108
It's been 5 years
since we broke up.

355
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,653
No one else since?

356
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,573
He...

357
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,783
I guess it was too hard for me.

358
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,333
At first, his innocence
attracted me.

359
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,295
But gradually I saw
my father in him.

360
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,754
Your father?

361
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:31,672
Yes.

362
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,383
My father was quite liberal,

363
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,721
just not to family and women.

364
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,932
I'm okay now. Because...

365
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,727
I realized that life isn't easy

366
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,771
for everyone else either.

367
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,276
Since then, I've been trying
to live life to the fullest.

368
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,739
What is it you want to do?

369
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,283
She's dancing, isn't she?

370
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,243
Me?

371
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,621
You know.

372
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,289
People who tumble in the air.

373
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,665
That's what.

374
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,459
Really?

375
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,544
Yes, I really will someday!

376
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,095
Can I borrow your lighter?

377
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,722
Lighter?

378
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,060
Here.

379
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,483
Thank you, I appreciate it.

380
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,865
Wonderful.

381
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,617
Try a Korean song.

382
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,160
You're truly wonderful.

383
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:31,250
Stop worrying about driving,
and drink up.

384
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,335
No, I'll pass today.

385
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,671
I have to drive.

386
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,048
No drivers-for-hire here.

387
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,925
Don't overdo yourself too.

388
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,677
No drivers-for-hire here?

389
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,845
No.

390
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,183
Excuse me.

391
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,020
No drivers-for-hire here?

392
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,278
You're a strong drinker.

393
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:05,033
I drink because I like the taste.

394
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,369
I see...

395
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,378
Why don't we...

396
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,484
Let's kiss to break the ice.

397
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,570
Sleep well.

398
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,907
I'll bring your car
tomorrow morning.

399
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,869
Aren't you getting out?

400
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,038
What?

401
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,673
Then Sungwoo, good night.

402
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,509
What do we do?

403
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,138
He'll be back later, I guess.

404
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,475
I think he misunderstood.

405
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,696
Care for another drink?

406
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,118
No, I had too much already.

407
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,669
Chuncheon is colder.

408
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,007
Are you worried?

409
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,596
What are you thinking
about now?

410
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,224
Now?

411
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,769
Since this afternoon.

412
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,439
Since we met?

413
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,735
I was so happy

414
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,821
when I heard you were here.

415
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,825
Really? Thank you.

416
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,789
I even prayed for it, really.

417
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,833
To meet you.

418
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,850
I love the expression on your face!

419
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,936
Can you see it?

420
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,730
Yes.

421
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,651
Want to go home?

422
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,862
We've come too far.

423
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,704
From now on, no more lies.

424
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,376
Okay.

425
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:55,592
Here.

426
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,804
What's wrong?

427
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,223
Don't you want to
show your face?

428
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,433
Yes.

429
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:20,700
Kyungsoo waits for
Sungwoo all day long

430
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,585
You don't have one?

431
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,091
Yes, but it's a bit funny.

432
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,634
What is it?

433
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,220
Supergirl.

434
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,264
Supergirl?

435
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,643
I'm strong.

436
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,771
I don't get tired easily.

437
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,399
Strong?

438
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:57,028
It seems to run in my family.

439
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,073
And my uncle can even carry

440
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,868
80kgs of rice using one hand.

441
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,452
Really?

442
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,457
You're so cute.

443
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,462
I hate that word.

444
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,090
Why?

445
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,968
I hate it.

446
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,928
Can't you find a better one?

447
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,348
Like what...?

448
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,730
You don't love me, do you?

449
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,609
Love?

450
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,163
To me, love is just liking a lot.

451
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,667
You don't love me.

452
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,968
Come here.

453
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,137
Come.

454
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,140
Stop it.
You don't love me anyway.

455
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,483
lf it only leaves bad memories, then stop.

456
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,985
Let go.

457
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:26,576
It really hurts!
It really hurts!

458
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,536
Really?

459
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,297
Ah, that feels good...

460
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,509
You're so great.

461
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:08,243
You could please any woman
if you do this...

462
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,594
lf you're not going home,
how about a hot meal?

463
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,638
Okay.

464
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,560
Why don't we go to the farm
and get Sungwoo.

465
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,566
Okay.

466
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,152
It is a bit of a walk
from the taxi.

467
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,529
Yes, it is.

468
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:49,326
Let's tell him we talked

469
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,828
all night at a street bar.

470
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,212
Do as you wish.

471
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,297
That tree looks like
it was struck by lightening.

472
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,143
You don't eat meat at all, do you?

473
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:02,607
It tastes okay for hotel food.

474
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,652
Yeah? I'm glad.

475
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,700
Get some rest.

476
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,803
Are you okay?

477
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,683
How about you?

478
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,815
I think he really trusts you.

479
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,192
You think so?

480
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,527
Yes.

481
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,617
Get some rest.

482
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,203
The same with you.

483
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,077
Scott Nearing's
"The Making of a Radical"

484
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,675
Come out for lunch.

485
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,387
Yes, thank you.

486
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,848
Over there, at our place.

487
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,099
Okay.

488
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,229
Sungwoo's not in yet, is he?

489
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,564
He's still out.

490
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,235
I don't get it,

491
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,403
abandoning his guest like this...

492
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,465
Hello?

493
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,134
It's me, Myungsuk.

494
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,012
Yes, hello.

495
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,432
I'm at the dance studio.

496
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,476
I see...

497
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,603
Wait a moment.

498
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,278
I can talk now.

499
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,031
I can't do anything.

500
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,117
It's so hard to practice dancing,

501
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,161
I can't focus.

502
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,789
What should I do?

503
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,584
Really?

504
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,299
When do you finish, today?

505
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,468
Today?
I can't meet you today.

506
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,596
I have an appointment.

507
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,514
We'll go drinking.

508
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,558
I see.

509
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,353
It's a writers' gathering, you see.
We'll probably have drinks.

510
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,731
We should make it another day.

511
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,777
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

512
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,697
Tomorrow morning?

513
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,952
I'll call you another time.

514
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,371
We can meet
in Seoul or something.

515
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,249
If you don't tell me you love me,

516
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,668
I'll never see you again!

517
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,928
Say something...

518
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,849
What should I say?

519
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,810
Say anything.

520
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,479
So I can hear your voice.

521
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,317
What should I say...

522
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,819
Tell me you love me.

523
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,031
You don't want to, do you?

524
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,619
No.

525
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,625
I'm hanging up.

526
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,628
Okay.

527
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,198
Hello?

528
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,494
It's me, Myungsuk.

529
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,414
Yes.

530
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,750
Life is a challenge!

531
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,961
What?

532
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,548
Do you know where I am?

533
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,008
No.

534
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,971
I'm in a motel.

535
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,728
A man's in the shower.

536
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,398
I see.

537
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,358
What should I do?

538
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,527
I called to ask you.

539
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,490
Follow your own judgment.

540
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,077
That's not it.

541
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,833
Want to know whom I'm with?

542
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,672
Is it Sungwoo?

543
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,346
Yes, you're right.

544
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,682
What should I do?

545
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,935
Is he taking a shower?

546
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,897
Yes, I told him to.

547
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,983
We haven't even kissed yet.

548
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:30,119
Even though it's difficult
to be a human being,

549
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,290
let's not turn into monsters.

550
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,085
Okay.

551
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,630
I'm hanging up!

552
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,674
Yes...

553
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,718
I'm sorry.

554
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,055
Bitch!

555
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,808
What a bitch!

556
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,189
Fucking bitch!

557
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:21,629
Kyungsoo meets
Sunyoung on the train

558
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,487
Take it.

559
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,073
Thanks.

560
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,535
I'm sorry.
You spent a lot the other night.

561
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,037
Is this enough?

562
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,290
Of course.
I'm going home anyway.

563
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,709
The Wonju-Busan train

564
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,627
only runs twice a day.

565
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,547
So off the bus,
go straight to the station.

566
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,215
I know.

567
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,384
Thanks for the T-shirt.

568
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,261
Are you sure about
giving this to me?

569
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,346
Yes.

570
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,515
The color suits you.

571
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,475
Yeah?

572
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,773
You're here.

573
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,276
What time's your bus?

574
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,571
I have 1 5 min. left.

575
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,573
Why are you
wearing sunglasses?

576
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,579
Last night, I cried too much.

577
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,664
My eyes are really swollen.

578
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,419
Are you okay?

579
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,504
Take them off.

580
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,843
But, they're so swollen...

581
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,849
Leave them off. You're fine.

582
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,560
It's better with them on.

583
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,148
I have a present for you.

584
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,568
I had no time to shop,

585
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,030
so I brought something
from home.

586
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,408
It's cologne I bought in Shanghai.

587
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,373
This is a photo of me.

588
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,125
Thank you.

589
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,299
Your phone's not working,

590
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,678
have you checked my message?

591
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,597
No, yesterday it got
wet in the rain.

592
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,474
It needs to be fixed.

593
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,227
I see...

594
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,565
You can't fix a wet
phone, can you?

595
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,531
Check my message later.

596
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,242
Okay.

597
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,831
Excuse me.

598
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,188
Let's really talk next time

599
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,359
Okay.

600
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,488
What's that on your neck?

601
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,616
What?

602
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,789
You should have told me...

603
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,333
about your relationship with her.

604
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,837
You didn't say anything.

605
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,673
Did you ask Myungsuk to come?

606
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:57,344
No, I only mentioned

607
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,598
I am leaving this morning.

608
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,391
But here she is.

609
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,981
It bothers you, doesn't it?

610
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,193
Kyungsoo.

611
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,363
Don't ask for more than
a man can take!

612
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,576
Yeah.

613
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,787
I know.

614
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,382
This is enough.

615
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,801
Let's say our goodbyes here

616
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,718
Goodbye.

617
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,345
But, l...

618
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,639
It's really okay.

619
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,684
I need to talk to Sungwoo.

620
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,312
So just stay here.

621
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,564
Goodbye.

622
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:24,640
Are you an artist?

623
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,642
No, why do you ask?

624
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,812
No, you just seem like one.

625
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,564
I see.

626
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,358
Are you good at Go?

627
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,236
Not really. Just a bit.

628
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,782
How about a game?

629
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,579
No, I can't play.

630
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,838
She's beautiful.

631
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,634
Is that your girlfriend?

632
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,597
I don't have one yet.

633
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,767
Then why do you
carry that photo?

634
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,397
She's a real beauty.

635
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,027
Would you like to have it?

636
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,864
What for?

637
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,158
It was given to me.

638
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,702
It's not mine.

639
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,454
You can have it.

640
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,999
Then, who is this woman?

641
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,168
There's a name on the back.

642
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,396
Wishing eternal happiness
and good health to you.

643
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,232
Keeping the precious memories

644
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,399
we've shared.

645
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,360
You in me. Me in you.

646
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,028
So precious to me.

647
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,821
Myungsuk.

648
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,125
Hello.

649
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,503
What? Hello.

650
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,219
So nice to meet you.

651
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,846
Yes.

652
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,730
Where's your stop?

653
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,565
Kyungju.

654
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,150
Kyungju...

655
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,861
Are you traveling alone?

656
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,573
Yes, I'm going home.

657
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,908
Where do you live?

658
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,328
I live in Seoul,

659
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,413
but my parents are in Busan.

660
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,081
Busan?

661
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,584
I'm getting off at Kyungju...

662
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,757
Do you know me?

663
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,091
Yes!

664
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,678
I've seen you perform
on stage, Kyungsoo.

665
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,639
How do you know my name?

666
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,641
I'm quite flattered.

667
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,813
I think you are a good actor.

668
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,906
I guess you've seen my plays.

669
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:09,990
Yes, I have.

670
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,744
You were great in some.

671
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,915
But I shouldn't flatter
you so much.

672
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,711
Of course not.

673
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,240
Kyungsoo!

674
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,576
You're really into that book.

675
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,832
Have you read it?

676
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,250
Yes.

677
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:08,090
They say the author lived
to be 1 00,

678
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,259
but took his own life

679
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,594
by starving himself.

680
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:17,516
That book changed
the life of someone I know.

681
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,935
I see...

682
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,819
You're so absorbed in it...

683
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:38,954
There's a bar inside the game cart.

684
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,873
Will you join me for a beer?

685
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,541
No, thank you.

686
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,170
Then...

687
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,728
I just wanted to say goodbye.

688
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,694
Good luck with your acting.

689
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,534
Stay as passionate as you were
when you first started out.

690
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,037
I really appreciate it.

691
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,667
Now I've embarrassed myself.

692
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,795
Goodbye.

693
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,789
Mom, Sunyoung!
Open the door!

694
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,757
Mom, it's Sunyoung!

695
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,696
I like your garden.

696
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,324
It's not much.

697
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,494
How long are you staying?

698
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,246
Well...

699
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,249
I'm not sure yet.

700
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,712
I'll be here today
and tomorrow.

701
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,757
I'll let you know later.

702
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,550
Whatever you want.

703
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,347
Where can I wash my face?

704
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,474
Wash up? Over there.

705
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:27,279
Was it that hard...
to call from Seoul?

706
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:32,409
I was busy... with school.

707
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,911
You do understand?

708
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:42,335
So, you couldn't even spare

709
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,588
1 0 min. to call me?

710
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,175
That happens when you're busy...

711
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,530
Drink up.

712
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,411
Don't think too much of it.

713
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,590
Excuse me.

714
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:30,926
Hey, you...

715
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:36,598
What's your problem?

716
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,434
Can't you see her sitting there?

717
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,772
I'm sorry.

718
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,398
Wait.

719
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,362
What are you doing?

720
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,572
What were you looking at?

721
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,450
Nothing...

722
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:58,161
Asshole, where's your
fucking manners?

723
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:01,831
I wasn't staring at anything.

724
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:05,710
Stop it!

725
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,920
Take it easy.

726
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,338
Just sit and drink up, asshole!

727
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:16,262
Sit!

728
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,942
What about your college degree?

729
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:36,992
You've come this far...

730
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,078
It's just for self-satisfaction...

731
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,497
Excuse me.

732
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:47,794
That picture.
where can I find one like that?

733
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,464
Like that, I don't know.

734
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,759
I see...

735
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:11,568
Kyungsoo recognizes Sunyoung
as an old acquaintance

736
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,500
Excuse me!

737
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:39,804
Who are you?

738
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,432
Is this where Sunyoung lives?

739
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,476
Yes, she does.

740
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,519
Can I help you?

741
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,355
Can I see her for a moment?

742
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,567
She's here...

743
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,570
but who are you?

744
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:59,616
I'm Kim Kyungsoo.

745
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,285
- Kim Kyungsoo?
- Yes.

746
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,496
Okay. Wait here...

747
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,551
What brings you here?

748
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,515
How did you find me?

749
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,267
You're home.

750
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:27,727
Yes.

751
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,146
I've come too early...

752
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,316
Who are you?

753
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:37,487
I've come to see Sunyoung.

754
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,281
What for?

755
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,325
Do you know him?

756
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,076
Yes.

757
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,246
We've met, before...

758
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,372
He's an actor.

759
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,124
Actor?

760
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,626
What kind of actor?

761
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,629
You left this book on the train.

762
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:01,469
He's a friend
You can go now mother.

763
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,596
You're returning her book?

764
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,557
This book's yours?

765
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:06,891
Yes.

766
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,018
What kind of book is it?

767
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,688
It's yours?

768
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,523
Can I talk to you for a moment?

769
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,692
Talk about what?

770
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,028
Can we go somewhere else to talk?

771
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,781
About what?

772
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,741
Talk right here!

773
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,327
I'm listening.

774
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,787
Mother, go inside.

775
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,957
It won't take long,

776
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,877
What is there to talk about?

777
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,380
Please.

778
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,341
It really won't take very long...

779
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,636
Sunyoung, shall we go over there?

780
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,847
Where?

781
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,142
It's so strange...

782
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,477
Why don't you talk inside?

783
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,687
Yes, talk inside the house.

784
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:54,439
Be quiet!

785
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,690
I'll talk to him.

786
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,150
It won't take long.

787
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:30,016
Have I imposed on you?

788
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,061
Yes, you have.

789
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:38,274
Really, I've never done anything
like this before.

790
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,111
Is that so?

791
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,696
Never!

792
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:50,662
I'm sorry, but mother's waiting.

793
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,748
I'll be straight with you.

794
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,043
After meeting you,

795
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:02,757
I wanted to tell you
how beautiful you are.

796
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,181
I'm not beautiful, Kyungsoo.

797
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:14,477
Sunyoung, you are to me!

798
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:24,404
I'm flattered to hear this
from a handsome man.

799
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,613
What?

800
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:30,535
It doesn't matter how...

801
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,372
I want to see you again.

802
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,381
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

803
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,590
They'll get the wrong idea.

804
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,883
About what?

805
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:53,349
Go now.

806
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,060
Can I have your mobile number?

807
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,230
It's 01 7-204-1 61 7.

808
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,399
01 7-204-1 61 7?

809
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,400
Yes.

810
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:06,154
You're going home now,
aren't you?

811
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:09,032
Goodbye.

812
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,160
Don't rush!

813
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,405
You're here.

814
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,158
Hello.

815
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,662
What time is your train?

816
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,333
I'm leaving soon.

817
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:43,960
How soon?

818
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,878
In about 1 5 min.

819
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,342
Were you going somewhere?

820
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:55,346
Just to get some cosmetics.

821
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,686
I didn't know what time
you were leaving...

822
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:11,696
I hope you didn't feel
insulted by my mother.

823
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,114
No.

824
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,952
She's like a child.

825
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,745
Yes.

826
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,124
I see you were sucking
on these flowers.

827
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,960
You saw me?

828
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,462
Yes.

829
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:31,340
I did the same thing
in kindergarten.

830
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,719
There were so many
in the front yard.

831
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,722
What are they called?

832
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,639
Salvia

833
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,183
Right.

834
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,317
Thank you.

835
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,403
They're all withered, not too many left.

836
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,328
Here's one.

837
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,333
Want to try?

838
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,669
Thank you.

839
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,644
How much are these?

840
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,354
3,000 won.

841
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,781
Shall we go that way?

842
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,514
That way?

843
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:19,865
Would you like to hear an old story?

844
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,867
An old story?

845
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,622
Have you ever been
to Taeneung?

846
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:30,876
Taeneung? The one in Seoul?

847
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,798
I may have, many years ago.

848
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,050
What for?

849
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,637
I just used to go there,

850
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,181
but not recently...

851
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,561
And the Chinese restaurant there?

852
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:49,729
Chinese restaurant?

853
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:51,314
Don't you remember?

854
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,567
Chinese restaurant...

855
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,862
What Chinese restaurant?

856
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,990
Then...

857
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,368
the day at the pool on a rainy day?

858
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,829
Where, in Taeneung?

859
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,999
The outdoor pool

860
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,459
near the National athlete's pool.

861
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,002
I remember the place.

862
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,756
So, you saw me there?

863
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,428
You're not lying, are you?

864
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:25,389
Why would I lie to you?

865
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,394
We met there!

866
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,064
You saved me from the bullies,

867
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,940
posing as my friend.

868
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,778
You were in middle school.

869
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:47,119
Then your friends and mine
all had Chinese food together.

870
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:50,456
We did?

871
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,542
The next morning

872
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,961
you came to my house.

873
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,713
Your house?

874
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,674
Yes, in Seoul!

875
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,843
You did the exact same thing!

876
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,887
Like you came looking for me

877
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,598
this morning!

878
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,977
Don't you remember?

879
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:14,438
Yes...

880
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,607
I remember...

881
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,276
I do recall something like that.

882
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,779
You're saying that was you?

883
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,740
You remember now?

884
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,784
Yes, I think so.

885
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,788
But your face...
I'm amazed.

886
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,874
That's why I said it was strange.

887
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,920
That's why I've been
seeing your plays.

888
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,549
I see.

889
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:45,928
But I just don't recognize your face.

890
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,388
I'm so sorry...

891
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,807
It happens,

892
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,809
that was more than 1 5 years ago.

893
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,521
Anyway, I'm amazed.

894
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,777
Isn't it amazing?

895
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:08,200
By the way, this place
seems quite empty, doesn't it?

896
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,122
Yes.

897
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,875
It's strange,

898
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,335
whenever I enter
an empty restaurant,

899
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,713
it soon fills up with customers.

900
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,339
How about you?

901
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:30,514
The same happens with taxis.

902
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:33,142
A cabbie once told me,

903
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,478
"Hey, you seem to attract people."

904
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,657
I tried to tell you earlier,

905
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,660
that I'm married.

906
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,708
What? I had no idea...

907
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:04,507
My husband's a professor
at Andong University.

908
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,094
When he was young,

909
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,305
they called him a genius.

910
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,641
Life became difficult
with his involvement

911
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,856
in political activism.

912
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,192
Times have changed,

913
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,861
now he is respected for his past.

914
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,863
Strange, isn't it?

915
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,742
I see.

916
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,736
Is it your fault?

917
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:09,989
No.

918
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,288
Watch your fingers.

919
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,123
Okay.

920
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:38,809
Move!

921
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,890
Why do you sway so much?

922
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,687
It calms me.

923
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,733
It also helps me stay sober.

924
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:35,115
When I am down.
I do it back and forth.

925
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:43,832
You've got such thin ankles.

926
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,171
How did you notice?

927
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:52,716
They are a bit thin.

928
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,929
They're so pretty.

929
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,810
I have to wear the
right length skirts.

930
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,105
lf not, I look very awkward,

931
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,691
because I'm a bit heavy on top.

932
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,581
I remember now.

933
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,876
You remember, now?

934
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:29,878
Yes.

935
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:36,135
You moved your hand like that
at that Chinese restaurant.

936
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:38,303
Probably so, it's a habit of mine.

937
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:42,641
Now, I remember!

938
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,688
I really remember your face.

939
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,190
This is great!

940
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,402
It makes you that happy?

941
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:56,905
Yes, your hand motion

942
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:00,117
brings back everything.

943
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,870
You must really remember now.

944
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,046
I'm glad.

945
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:15,132
Drink up, to celebrate.

946
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,554
I'll drink from the bottle.

947
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:57,716
I wish we could be alone.

948
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:09,353
I won't lay a finger on you.
I promise.

949
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,356
I won't, okay?

950
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:36,880
Take us to a decent motel, please?

951
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,424
Which one do you mean?

952
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:42,052
Concord Hotel, please.

953
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,595
Concord Hotel?

954
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:44,930
Yes.

955
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,731
Your signature please.

956
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,198
Have a pleasant stay.

957
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,782
Gently, or with force?

958
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,117
Which do you prefer?

959
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,706
Either way.

960
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:39,419
How do you like this move?

961
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:51,765
You lied to me, Kyungsoo.

962
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:55,143
Yes.

963
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:08,115
Please don't ejaculate inside me.

964
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:10,993
No, of course not.

965
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,915
How do you like my moves?

966
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:25,090
I don't want to get pregnant.

967
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,385
Of course.

968
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:30,053
Don't worry.

969
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:33,473
I love you.

970
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,363
Me too.

971
01:28:53,453 --> 01:29:00,375
Kyungsoo is reminded
of the Turning Gate's snake

972
01:29:53,846 --> 01:29:55,013
Where are you going?

973
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,723
You're awake?

974
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:03,814
I have to attend my cousin's
wedding with my mother.

975
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,864
I have a headache!

976
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:14,866
A headache?

977
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:17,244
Then get some medicine.

978
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:19,913
Yes.

979
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,756
I'll be back before noon.

980
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,175
Will you wait?

981
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:34,719
I will.

982
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,139
Get some sleep.

983
01:30:37,723 --> 01:30:39,599
Wait.

984
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,768
Come over here.

985
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:17,762
Can I take them off?

986
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,731
It doesn't matter.

987
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:30,293
Those things are everywhere.

988
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,655
Nature always seems
indifferent to us.

989
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,824
But the sight of you sleeping

990
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,034
and the fresh vigor of the morning

991
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,620
overwhelms me
with the wholeness of the world.

992
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:08,415
Me in you! You in me!

993
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:01,801
Nobody home?

994
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,599
Everyone's inside.
Can I help you?

995
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:16,650
Excuse me!

996
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,527
What are you doing?

997
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:22,906
Can you speak English?

998
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:49,307
Catch!

999
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:43,945
Here's string for you.

1000
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:45,321
Thank you.

1001
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,157
What's this for?

1002
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:49,492
Yes, thank you.

1003
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:03,757
What's the persimmon for?

1004
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:12,682
I'm trying to punish a fraud,

1005
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,642
but I just might be
wasting my time.

1006
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,605
"I hereby charge you

1007
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:22,275
"with hypocrisy, deception,
and cowardliness..."

1008
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:24,736
Real persimmon/Word "persimmon"
"Your wife, suspecting

1009
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,404
the lack of truthfulness

1010
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,822

in your name,
in your occupation

1011
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,741
and your façade,
has written a note

1012
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:33,203
to another man which
I've attached."

1013
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:36,873
Nature always seems
indifferent to us.

1014
01:37:04,443 --> 01:37:04,984
Go now.

1015
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:06,444
Drive safely.

1016
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:09,572
Bye.

1017
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:18,832
I'll call you.

1018
01:37:18,874 --> 01:37:20,124
Okay.

1019
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:20,917
Take care.

1020
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:22,293
Yes, go now.

1021
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,460
Can I see you for a moment?

1022
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,718
What is it you want?

1023
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,763
You weren't answering your phone.

1024
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,646
Should I just give up?

1025
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:01,619
Wait here. I'll check inside.

1026
01:40:02,496 --> 01:40:04,080
I'll wait here.

1027
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:26,436
I forgot to bring my wallet.

1028
01:40:27,312 --> 01:40:28,813
It's okay.

1029
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:52,170
It's so funny.

1030
01:41:03,682 --> 01:41:07,852
This has never happened
to me before.

1031
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:14,776
It's because you drink too much.

1032
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,862
Alcohol does this?

1033
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:22,366
Does your husband
work in Chuncheon?

1034
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:24,660
No.

1035
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:28,164
I think I've seen him there.

1036
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:30,333
What?

1037
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:33,503
When I was in Chuncheon.

1038
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:37,215
I saw him with a woman
in a duck paddle boat.

1039
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,718
My husband?

1040
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,680
How do you know him?

1041
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:48,017
I think I met him this morning.

1042
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,439
Why did you meet him?

1043
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:59,612
I just did by chance.

1044
01:42:00,405 --> 01:42:01,697
No, I think I'm wrong.

1045
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:06,327
Koreans all look alike.

1046
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:17,213
Could you stop talking about him?

1047
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:23,386
He's not like us.

1048
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:28,432
He has something
that most people lack.

1049
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:33,062
He truly lives for others.

1050
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:36,399
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in that.

1051
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:47,326
Stop it.

1052
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,582
I could have been mistaken.

1053
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,633
I went to Chuncheon

1054
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:05,553
when I was in university.

1055
01:43:08,056 --> 01:43:09,599
They tell you to travel alone

1056
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:13,019
when you're a freshman.

1057
01:43:15,397 --> 01:43:17,023
Have you been to Lake Soyang?

1058
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:18,524
Yes.

1059
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:19,942
Nice there, isn't it?

1060
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:23,487
I remember it so vividly.

1061
01:43:24,907 --> 01:43:27,742
Everything stirred me

1062
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:29,952
like a newborn child.

1063
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:31,787
A little frightening as well.

1064
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:39,420
I skipped the ferry
after hesitating for a while.

1065
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:41,756
I took that ferry.

1066
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,341
You did?

1067
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:49,013
Two men followed me.

1068
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,642
I think one of them was nice.

1069
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:56,604
I skipped the ferry because of him.

1070
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,689
Sunyoung, I love you.

1071
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:09,325
Really?

1072
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:17,625
There's nothing more
I can wish from a woman.

1073
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:29,845
Do you like my breasts?

1074
01:44:30,847 --> 01:44:32,223
Yes, a lot.

1075
01:44:36,812 --> 01:44:38,604
You want me to help you?

1076
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:43,943
It's okay.

1077
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,824
Want to die together?

1078
01:44:53,495 --> 01:44:54,662
Why?

1079
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,206
I don't want sex anymore,

1080
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:02,336
just die, pure and innocent.

1081
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,573
Nice, isn't it.

1082
01:45:37,873 --> 01:45:39,457
Hello.

1083
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:43,794
Do you read fortunes?

1084
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:46,422
Yes, why do you ask?

1085
01:45:47,507 --> 01:45:49,008
Do you read fortunes?

1086
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:52,845
How much do you charge?

1087
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,472
Why?

1088
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:58,517
Why do you want it read?

1089
01:45:59,978 --> 01:46:01,562
No need for it...

1090
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:07,818
How much do you charge?

1091
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:09,945
As much as you'd like.

1092
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:12,490
You don't seem to need it.

1093
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,123
Would you like to try?

1094
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:23,709
Come in...

1095
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:36,222
Age 30.

1096
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:41,394
Born in 72, May 9th, Lunar year.

1097
01:46:58,203 --> 01:47:01,789
Luck opens up for you
from this year.

1098
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:06,377
Next year, all four gates will open.

1099
01:47:06,628 --> 01:47:09,713
Fame and fortune will grow
as you wish.

1100
01:47:09,881 --> 01:47:14,135
All people of the secular world
will look up to you.

1101
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:16,303
From next year,

1102
01:47:16,721 --> 01:47:20,182
your wishes will be your command.

1103
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:22,726
Are you married?

1104
01:47:22,894 --> 01:47:24,353
Yes, I am.

1105
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:26,772
What does your husband do?

1106
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:30,025
He teaches at a national university,
a kind of public officer.

1107
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,612
You've met a good person.
His age?

1108
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,991
43

1109
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:37,867
Date of birth?

1110
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:42,329
June 23rd , Lunar year.

1111
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:55,926
Your husband also foresees good luck.

1112
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:02,766
Your husband's luck begins
this year, for a 3-yr peak.

1113
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:04,768
Great luck it is.

1114
01:48:04,936 --> 01:48:07,771
He will acquire high dignity

1115
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:12,651
which commands over people.

1116
01:48:12,777 --> 01:48:15,321
I see great fortune awaiting him.

1117
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:20,326
Both of you were destined
to experience early hardship.

1118
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:23,871
You have passed that.
Now is the beginning.

1119
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,957
From now on you will enjoy

1120
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:29,960
his good fortune.

1121
01:48:30,086 --> 01:48:33,756
Support him well as a good wife.

1122
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,217
Good fortune is coming your way.

1123
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:40,221
What about him?

1124
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:42,097
I've already read his, haven't l?

1125
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:46,977
His fate is like a Buddhist priest.

1126
01:48:47,103 --> 01:48:51,273
Destined to turn his back

1127
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:52,816
to the secular world,

1128
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:54,693
he has bad ties with others,

1129
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:57,613
and foresees 3 years of bad luck.

1130
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:00,032
September and October

1131
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,951
are his dark month.

1132
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,411
I see a knife touching his body.

1133
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:09,458
He should be very careful
for the next 2 months.

1134
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:12,962
Anyway, take good care
of your husband

1135
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:16,048
and luck will come your way.

1136
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:18,884
Fortune hovers over
your household.

1137
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:22,763
It takes a decade to find
a fortune like this.

1138
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:32,189
Goodbye.

1139
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:43,826
Aren't you coming?

1140
01:49:57,215 --> 01:49:58,507
What's wrong?

1141
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:01,677
Where are you going?

1142
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,817
Then, I'm leaving.

1143
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,421
Will you wait for me?

1144
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,428
I'll return with some money.

1145
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:48,682
Will you?

1146
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:55,314
Wait for me here.
