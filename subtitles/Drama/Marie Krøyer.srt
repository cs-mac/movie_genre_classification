1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,319
In the early 20th century
a colony of artists settled in Skagen -

2
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,919
a remote place in Denmark.

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,839
The exceptional light attracted the
artist couple Søren and Marie Krøyer -

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,759
who stood out thanks to Søren's
expert talent and international fame.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,234
Based on a true story
inspired by -

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,874
Anastassia Arnold's biography
"The Passion of Marie Krøyer".

7
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,632
Søren.

8
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,951
Søren?

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
Take a look at it, please.

10
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,354
Of course.

11
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,192
It's nice.
Very nice.

12
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,154
But even though it's light -

13
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,828
it doesn't light up.
Look at my hand.

14
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,036
See how the light makes it glow?
So full of life?

15
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,756
You must see the life in the colors.

16
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,110
Thank you.

17
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,876
Vibs.

18
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,629
Tell Mom that Tannhäuser beckons.

19
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,389
Tann...
- Tannhäuser.

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,597
Dad says that Tann...
- Haüser.

21
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,839
Tannhäuser beckons.
- I heard your naughty dad.

22
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,437
Want to try Mommy's brushes?

23
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,671
Tannhäuser mounts
the mount of Venus.

24
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,318
No.

25
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,510
I'm not worthy of soiling the beauty.
- Søren...

26
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,869
No. Oh, well...
The belly rumbles.

27
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,868
Could you see to it
that lunch is prepared?

28
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,433
Aren't you excited, Vibs?

29
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,952
All the posh Copenhageners
are coming to see Papa's paintings.

30
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,755
Your cab is here, Mrs. Krøyer.
- Thank you. My husband is coming.

31
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,589
All the ladies are wearing
their most beautiful dresses.

32
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,109
What's the matter, Vibs?

33
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,390
Tell Mommy.

34
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,710
I'm afraid Papa will act all strange.

35
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,471
Dearest, don't worry.

36
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,831
Papa has been well for a long time.

37
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,474
Don't worry your head about that.

38
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,515
I understand it scares you
now and then.

39
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,429
But it's his illness.
He can't help it.

40
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,794
Most of the time he's sweet and good
and the nicest papa.

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,470
And I'm there to look after you.

42
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,956
You and I have to stand together.
Right, Vibs?

43
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,030
Here you are.
Thank you.

44
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,317
Marie.

45
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,230
One of the men called you
the most beautiful woman in Europe.

46
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,396
Nonsense.

47
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,910
I don't know if I'm me
or the woman in the paintings?

48
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,031
Poor Marie.

49
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,677
Who's that?
- Lachmann, the attorney.

50
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,912
Ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,078
As a member of the board -

52
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,272
I am honored and delighted -

53
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,191
to welcome you to this
the great event of the year.

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,835
Were it not for my personal friendship
with our dear master Krøyer -

55
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,873
and his enchanting wife Marie -

56
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,552
we'd never have lured them to
Copenhagen from their windy Skagen.

57
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,638
I hereby declare the exhibition open.

58
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,597
Excuse me.
Do you know the works?

59
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,839
I've read about the exhibition
and Krøyer's works.

60
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,271
"The essence
of sensuality and beauty."

61
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,914
I must say he has succeeded.

62
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,477
The sensuality comes out
in the most sublime way.

63
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,753
It's far easier to paint
a businessman than a fisherman.

64
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,078
And I'll tell you why.
The fisherman is complicated.

65
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,592
A businessman struggles
with stocks and bonds.

66
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,712
The fisherman's struggle is one
of life and death.

67
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,311
I can paint a businessman
in a cigar's time.

68
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,392
The fisherman...

69
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,477
Well, he takes an entire day.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

70
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,040
May I invite you for a cup of coffee?

71
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,750
Yes, please.

72
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,555
Do you know the woman?
- Yes. We're good friends.

73
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,680
Right.
Vibs, take this.

74
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,956
Right.
Vibs, take this.

75
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,709
Hold on to the tail.

76
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,309
I'll run ahead, you follow
and let go at my command.

77
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,192
Run!

78
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,230
Vibs, would you like to try?
Hold on tight.

79
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,271
Dear friends.

80
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,712
Thank you for coming to celebrate
my beloved Søren's birthday.

81
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,196
Cheers and congratulations, Søren.
Three cheers.

82
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,197
Congratulations, Papa.
- Thank you.

83
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,359
My dear, dear friends.
I'm the happiest man in the world.

84
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,075
Look at me.
I'm a prince.

85
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,510
It's raining oranges down on me -

86
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,395
like sorrows rain down on others.
I am so very happy.

87
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,831
Words can't describe
how happy I am. Cheers.

88
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,516
The Copenhagen exhibition was
a huge success. Orders are pouring in.

89
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,192
Krøyer is more popular than ever.
You must be very content.

90
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,597
Everyone,
get up and follow me.

91
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,234
Come along.

92
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,595
Hurry up.

93
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,438
Agnete, let's clear the table.

94
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,070
Marie, don't stand out there.
Come and join in the fun, darling.

95
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,030
What a pity.

96
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,757
What a pity, little Vibs.
- Come here, little Vibs.

97
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,679
Henny, no cheating.

98
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,309
Oh dear, Marie.
Away with your chair.

99
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,636
I'm worried about him.
He's always like this before he snaps.

100
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,513
Maybe you should call Dr. Lange.

101
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,271
And you know
you can always turn to me.

102
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,119
Thank you, dear Lachmann.

103
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,631
Marie.

104
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,876
Wake up.

105
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,992
Wake up.
Come, Marie.

106
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,430
Don't tell anyone.
Promise, darling?

107
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,955
They've put a price on my head.

108
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,629
Nobody is out to get you.
- Yes. They blame me.

109
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,910
They've offered a reward.

110
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,192
Where are we going to flee?

111
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,998
I'm not mad, Marie.

112
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,352
It's all the... creatures inside me.

113
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,516
I know, Søren.

114
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,518
Where did he go?
Your prince?

115
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,190
He's right here.
- Is he?

116
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,039
Do you still see him?
- Yes.

117
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,515
He's dressed in white.

118
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,759
His eyes shine like crystal.

119
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,999
Do you see his mouth?
It's so beautiful.

120
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,714
Soft to the touch.

121
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,996
But...

122
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,668
There's a snake in Paradise.

123
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,953
Hold the snake, my Queen.
Hold Tannhäuser.

124
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,833
Bite the apple.

125
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,028
I'm no man anymore.
- It's your illness, Søren.

126
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,959
You think you know it all.

127
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,469
But you don't know anything.

128
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,435
You're just an untalented
little wretch.

129
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,156
But they've put a price
on the big whore.

130
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,636
They will catch her and cut her up
like a pig to the slaughter.

131
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,149
Søren...

132
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm going to kill you, Marie.

133
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,275
That will make the illness go away.
- Søren, you're making all this up.

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,390
Dr. Lange wrote
that you need to rest your nerves.

135
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,549
This is best for all of us.
For me, Vibeke and for you.

136
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,558
Can you forgive me?

137
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,599
How do you do, Mr. Krøyer.
And welcome back.

138
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,353
Don't leave me.

139
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,917
You must be brave for us all.
- I love you, Marie.

140
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,879
Please don't visit Mr. Krøyer
until there are signs of progress.

141
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,914
I'll write and keep you informed.
- Thank you.

142
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,989
We've been very pleased with your
work lately. Here's a little bonus.

143
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,671
I trust Mr. Krøyer's little bad spell
will remain within these four walls?

144
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,950
Thank you.

145
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,077
How are we going to manage, Vibs?
- Its arm is broken.

146
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,634
We'll put it back on, then.

147
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,549
"Suddenly, through the window
came a burst of song."

148
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,150
"It was the little live nightingale
who sat outside on a spray."

149
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,718
"He had heard of his Emperor's plight
and had come to sing of hope."

150
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,675
Would you like to sleep
in my room tonight?

151
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,508
I want to go home.

152
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,909
I want to go home
because they're going to kill my wife.

153
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,430
I want to go home.
They're going to kill my wife.

154
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,234
I don't want her to die
before I've spoken to her.

155
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,716
I want to go home.
Stop the execution!

156
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,390
Stop the execution!
Stop the execution!

157
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,871
I demand to see the king!

158
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,640
Tell His Majesty -

159
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,355
that P.S. Krøyer wants
to talk to him.

160
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,312
I was with you, Marie.

161
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,718
I heard how those brutes dragged
your body across the prison floor.

162
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,354
I was with you.
I saw your eyes -

163
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,634
when the bullets tore your body
apart. I was with you in death.

164
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,675
I was there when the worms
dug into your beautiful body.

165
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,792
I was with you in the coffin, Marie.

166
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,390
Marie, we died together.

167
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,673
We died together.
- I'm not Marie, Mr. Krøyer.

168
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,676
Dr. Lange says it may take weeks.
Months even.

169
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,792
How are you coping?

170
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,833
Would you like some more cocoa?

171
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,314
Why is everyone staring at me?
- Because you're famous.

172
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,751
Famous for nothing.

173
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,034
It's true. All I'm famous for
is being Søren's beautiful wife.

174
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,476
Don't smile.
- Sorry.

175
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,797
What's the matter with you?

176
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,790
You've met someone.

177
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,636
Who?
- A Swede. I think I'm in love.

178
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,990
Can I have more cream?
- Yes.

179
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,193
I don't even know if he loves me. I've
never experienced anything like it.

180
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,753
Like what?

181
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,713
He is an extraordinary lover.

182
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,435
Not in front of a child!
- Is Søren good in bed?

183
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,633
One doesn't ask questions like that.
- I do.

184
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,150
I'm sorry.

185
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,512
I thought I was married to a strong
man who could take on the world.

186
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,599
But our life is a living hell.
- Marie.

187
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,878
If you and Vibs need a vacation,
come with me to Sweden this summer.

188
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,838
Nobody knows you there.

189
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,195
I can't.

190
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,874
How is he?

191
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,435
Dr. Lange says he's making progress.

192
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,633
It's no joke when the breadwinner
goes mad. Can you eat a lobster?

193
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,712
Lobster is for festive occasions.
I'm not feeling very festive.

194
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,480
You're making too big a fuss.

195
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,912
I'm sure all your problems
will find a happy solution soon.

196
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,352
I assure you I will do anything
in my power to help you.

197
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,348
And Mr. Krøyer.
- Thank you, my dear Lachmann.

198
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,873
Mr. Krøyer has made great progress.
His condition is much better.

199
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,198
I think it will do him good
to come home.

200
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,118
Søren.

201
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,550
Marie?

202
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,274
Is that you, Marie?

203
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,914
It's me, Søren.

204
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,273
But you're alive?

205
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,198
Yes, my darling Marie,
you're alive.

206
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,518
Let me touch you.
It really is you?

207
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,630
It's me.

208
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,991
Yes, it is you.

209
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,590
My poor Marie.
You're so fair and fragile.

210
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,078
I will look after you.
- I know, Søren.

211
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,878
Do you know what day it is?
- What day is it?

212
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,548
Our wedding day.

213
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,593
I've been in a horrible darkness.

214
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,673
Everything disappeared.

215
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,555
But that didn't matter.
I could bear it.

216
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,234
It didn't get to me
until they killed you.

217
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,790
They didn't kill me, Søren.

218
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,878
I know that now.
But I didn't then.

219
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,469
It's over now.

220
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,352
Are they going to let me out?

221
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,950
I'm here to take you home.

222
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,510
You won't leave me?
- No.

223
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,829
You're still young and beautiful.

224
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,238
What do you want
with an old wreck like me?

225
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,874
I love you.

226
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,430
Can we rediscover...

227
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,555
What does Ibsen call it?
- "The wonderful".

228
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,354
The wonderful.
Do you think we can?

229
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,313
Drink your lemonade.

230
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,148
I've made a mess of everything.

231
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,670
It's not your fault alone.

232
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,518
I have a large exhibition in Paris.

233
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,837
I've been recommended for
La Légion d'honneur.

234
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,113
No Danish artist has
ever received that order.

235
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,995
Our dreams have come true,
haven't they?

236
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,319
I'm tired.
I need to go inside and rest.

237
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,396
Will you give me a hand?

238
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,712
I saw it.
I see everything.

239
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,230
What did you see?
- I saw you crying.

240
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,193
Just now in the garden.

241
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,154
Why were you crying?

242
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,072
Because it was so sad.

243
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,192
About me?
- About us.

244
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,996
You're lying.
- I never lie.

245
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,036
No, but...

246
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,518
You said: All the things that have
come between us and our dreams.

247
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,836
But you really meant:

248
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,194
All the things that have come
between you and your dreams.

249
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,991
Isn't that so?

250
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,954
Aren't those the thoughts you keep
when my back is turned?

251
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,513
No?

252
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,599
In my bright moments
at the asylum -

253
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,951
I thought about you.

254
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,516
About you. Your life.

255
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,316
I know I've ruined a lot for you,
but not on purpose.

256
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,314
It's because God has cursed me
with a monstrous talent.

257
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,753
And I do understand
your artistic yearnings.

258
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,350
No one understands better than me.
But...

259
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,677
How do I put this
without hurting your feelings?

260
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,555
I love you as a woman
and as a human being -

261
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,833
but I see your desire
to become an artist, too -

262
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,672
and I understand your torment.
But art is easy. Life is the hard part.

263
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,998
There's so much more to you than art.

264
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,513
I can paint like nobody else.
It comes easy to me.

265
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,233
I...

266
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,998
I have it in me, but...

267
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,952
Marie, you don't.

268
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,632
Even if you worked until
the end of time, you'd never get it.

269
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,434
God hasn't breathed on you.

270
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,111
Your life would be much happier,
if you gave it up.

271
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,880
Will you fluff my pillow for me?

272
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,230
Vibeke, sit still.
Don't move.

273
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,592
She's tired. It's been two hours.
- Spare me the pettiness.

274
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,712
No pettiness, please.

275
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,515
Marie, I see you.
Damn, do I see you.

276
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,154
You can look now.

277
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,271
Well?

278
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,271
What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

279
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,837
It is. We're beautiful.
Don't we look splendid?

280
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,237
Why am I not in it?
- But you're the dog, little Vibs.

281
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,151
See? You look like the dog.
- It doesn't look like me.

282
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,195
It's much prettier than you.
You'll never be as pretty as that dog.

283
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,472
Be quiet, Søren.
- She loves me. Don't you, Vibs?

284
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,196
You love me!
You love your old Papa.

285
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,313
Stop it, Søren.
It's too much.

286
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,234
Welcome, Lachmann.
Welcome.

287
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,274
Welcome.
Welcome, Your Excellency.

288
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,359
Thank you. Happy to see you.
Charmed, I'm sure.

289
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,917
How do you do, Krøyer.
- Henny!

290
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,159
Nice to see you again.
- Give everyone a glass.

291
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,557
There we are.
Cheers.

292
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,914
Let us drink to the world.
Let us drink to... life.

293
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,192
Let us drink to art.

294
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,388
The Ambassador can't wait
to see your works.

295
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,036
Well, I've never been better.
And that's saying something.

296
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,073
And now, the paintings.

297
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,590
Vibeke, come along.
Marie, inside.

298
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,190
Take it easy, Søren.
There's no rush.

299
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,551
You, inside.
Please wait here one moment.

300
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,431
You may enter now.

301
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,717
It will cause a sensation.
- And so I ask you:

302
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,595
Does art surpass reality,
or does reality surpass art?

303
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,953
Reality is art!

304
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,913
Champagne!
More champagne!

305
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,079
The world must know that we exist!

306
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,033
A true artist.

307
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,632
I got it!

308
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,674
Vibeke, fetch!
Vibeke.

309
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,633
Come along. Fetch!

310
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,753
Over there.
Fetch, Vibs!

311
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,270
Very good. Heel!

312
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,392
Get down on all fours.

313
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,149
You call yourself a hound?
Hold it by your teeth!

314
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,876
There you go, Vibs.
Yes, fetch!

315
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,113
Is she happy?
- She's beautiful.

316
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,717
Don't you see how unhappy she is?
The woman in the painting?

317
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,789
What have those two got in common?

318
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,197
Why is there a distance
between them?

319
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,753
I thought we were going to fight
to rediscover the wonderful.

320
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,629
I'm suffocating.
Don't you understand?

321
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,994
Are you leaving me?

322
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,513
Are you leaving me?

323
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,110
I can't.
I would if I could.

324
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,312
What is holding you back?

325
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,795
Marie!

326
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,071
He was horrible to Vibs.

327
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,515
It's not the first time.

328
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,871
Is everything this bad?

329
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,909
I can't go on.
Not like this.

330
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,078
But what can you do?

331
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,073
I'm considering going to Sweden
this summer to visit a friend.

332
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,193
Me and Vibs.
- Do it.

333
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,554
But I can't leave him on his own.
- Do it, Marie. I'll look after Søren.

334
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,152
Who are you?
- Hugo Alfvén.

335
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,875
Hugo Alfvén.
You're Swedish.

336
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,392
Yes.
Swedish as hell.

337
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,868
Am I bothering you?
- Say something.

338
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,028
Why don't you say something?
- My name is Hugo Alfvén.

339
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,071
I already said that.

340
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,752
I'm a composer.
Swedish, well, obviously.

341
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,393
I'm sorry.
- Say more.

342
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,875
I've written two symphonies -

343
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,119
chamber music, songs,
choral works.

344
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,191
Marie Krøyer is my name.

345
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,879
I've never met a woman who doesn't
open her eyes in front of a stranger.

346
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,750
I would like you to walk again
while talking.

347
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,632
I just arrived at the hotel.

348
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,116
I'm a composer from Stockholm.

349
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,515
I already said that.

350
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,958
I'm sorry. I can't be spontaneous.
- Just say what enters your mind.

351
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,996
I've never seen
a more beautiful woman in my life.

352
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,760
Never.

353
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,556
You, Marie Krøyer, are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

354
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,909
I see you've met
and spared me the introductions.

355
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,588
Coffee?

356
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,074
He's so nice to her.

357
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,272
Søren said something that stung.
- What did he say?

358
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,438
Art is no comfort.

359
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,717
Søren and I tried to live up to
a picture postcard that didn't exist.

360
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,151
The talented artist
and his beautiful, happy wife.

361
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,669
"Tried"?

362
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,394
Whenever we failed,
I found comfort in painting.

363
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,717
In my dream of becoming an artist.

364
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,317
He didn't say it to be mean.
He just told me the truth.

365
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,273
I don't have it in me, Anna.

366
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,994
It was just an excuse
not to face up to it.

367
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,478
I've given up painting.
- What do you have to face up to?

368
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,558
All the things that aren't there.

369
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,272
Do you think I can find my way back?

370
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,870
To what?
- Myself.

371
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,436
A woman shouldn't find herself.
She should find a man.

372
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,555
That will make her happy.
- You do hold yourself in low esteem.

373
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,795
I hold men in low esteem.

374
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,673
Excuse me.
I have to go to the bathroom.

375
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,115
Anna?

376
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,079
Marie Krøyer.
- I don't want to disturb you.

377
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,510
You aren't.

378
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,678
Did I wake you?
- Thank you for the music.

379
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,350
Call me Marie.
What were you playing?

380
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,552
A new piece.
- Called?

381
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,672
Nothing... yet.

382
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,638
Thank you for playing with Vibeke.
She hasn't slept this well for a while.

383
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,628
Let me be honest.
- Haven't you been so far?

384
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,196
I've had an affair with Anna.
But it's over now.

385
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,552
That's none of my business.
- I didn't mean it like that.

386
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,593
What do you mean?

387
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,351
The first time I saw you,
I was swept away.

388
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,399
Aren't you a married man?
- No.

389
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,676
There's... only me.

390
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,078
But I'm a married woman,
and my child is asleep upstairs.

391
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,031
So is Anna.
- But I love my husband.

392
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,677
Marie.

393
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,709
This is for you.

394
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,071
Thank you.

395
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,394
Vibeke and I are so happy to be here.
We needed it.

396
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,234
Anna, you and...
- Hugo.

397
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,115
What is between you?
- Something we've regretted.

398
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,030
Is that all?
- He came to end the affair properly.

399
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,548
Anna?
- Yes.

400
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,439
Am I hurting you?

401
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,792
Beware of Hugo.
- What do you mean?

402
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,230
More wine?

403
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,396
Anna?
- No thanks.

404
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,991
Vibeke, more ice cream?
- I have a tummy ache.

405
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,199
Do you want to go to the room?
- Soon.

406
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,436
I'll go with Vibeke. You can stay.
- No, I don't think so.

407
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,073
But I do.

408
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,555
Come along.
- Sure?

409
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,876
Yes, I'm sure.
Let's go.

410
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,753
I want to stay with Papa Hugo.

411
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,116
I'll tell you a bedtime story.
Wouldn't you like that?

412
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,759
Good night.
- Good night.

413
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,916
Good night.

414
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,993
Did you hear her?
She called me papa.

415
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,188
I ought to go with her.

416
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,078
This is no coincidence.
I've seen you before.

417
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,669
I gave a concert in Copenhagen -

418
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,079
and then I went to an exhibition and
saw your husband's paintings of you.

419
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,953
I hate those paintings.

420
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,153
They don't do you justice.
- That's not why I hate them.

421
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,592
I know why you hate them.
- You do?

422
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,349
They only show your outer beauty.

423
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,233
No, Hugo. I can't.

424
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,110
Marie...

425
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,198
There's only us.
Only you and I.

426
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,029
I saw you too.

427
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,354
What do you mean?

428
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,597
At the Copenhagen exhibition.

429
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,715
I saw you.

430
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,590
Well, how do I look?

431
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,950
Don't I look splendid? Have you seen
my Légion d'honneur?

432
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,232
I was presented with it yesterday
at the embassy.

433
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,989
Magnificent event.
The French have style.

434
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,514
The ambassador sent his regards
to my beautiful wife.

435
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,678
How was Sweden?
- Fine.

436
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,634
You'd better get changed.
- I can't go on.

437
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,400
All of Copenhagen is waiting for you.

438
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,795
Søren, don't you understand?

439
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,959
In the two hours I've been here you've
done nothing but talk about yourself.

440
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,993
I'm sorry. You're right.

441
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,113
I haven't had anyone to share it with.
I've missed my Marie.

442
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,233
Tell me all about Sweden.
Did you find yourself there?

443
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,716
Horrid thought, really.
To find oneself.

444
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,595
Who the hell wants to find oneself?

445
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,713
To be confronted with the
naked cadaver in all its misery.

446
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,313
I'd never let you down, Søren.
- And I love you for that. I love you.

447
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,830
Something happened in Sweden.
- We're late.

448
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,398
I lose myself in my love for you.
- I'm condemned to drag myself about.

449
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,036
What did you dream of?
- Love.

450
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,757
And you didn't find that with me?

451
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,950
Is he Danish?

452
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,915
What does that mean?
- Will I be the laughing-stock or not?

453
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,190
Swedish.

454
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,790
And what is this Swede called?

455
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,514
Alfvén. Hugo Alfvén.

456
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,757
And what does this Hugo do?
- He's a composer.

457
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,033
I've never heard of a Swedish
composer named Hugo. Is he famous?

458
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,949
Does it matter?
I'm not interested in his music.

459
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,118
That will benefit your relationship.

460
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,995
Is he old like me?
- You're not old.

461
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,395
Like you?

462
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,311
And what is the point
of this little confession?

463
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,910
I can't go on.
- How do you mean?

464
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:18,116
Do you want a withering wife?
- Should I cry over this gift of grace?

465
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,518
You should understand that painful as
it may be, it's our only chance to...

466
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,359
...to find the wonderful?

467
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,235
We love each other,
but we can't find it.

468
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,590
Isn't itjust a hollow dream?
- That we can't find it?

469
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,555
No. This your new love.

470
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,671
Only now do I understand
what love is.

471
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,235
And it's Hugo.

472
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,591
Just a moment!

473
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,638
Forgive me.

474
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,230
Divorce is out of the question.

475
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,877
If you insist on living in sin
with hopeful Hugo, know this:

476
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,389
Vibeke is staying with me.

477
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,995
You can't take her away from me.
- It's not revenge. It's for her sake.

478
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,636
Don't go!
- Why this sudden maternal feeling?

479
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,434
Stop it!

480
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,668
If you don't leave tonight,
do me a favor and find another hotel.

481
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,036
Thank you.

482
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,196
Thank you.
- One moment, Mrs. Krøyer.

483
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,559
Oh, Marie. There you are.

484
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,469
I haven't slept a wink.
Are you intent on leaving me?

485
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,514
We can't talk here. Let's go.
Thank you.

486
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,551
My darling Marie.

487
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,470
I thought it was a fantasy, a whim.

488
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,355
Forgive me.
Now I know you're serious.

489
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,315
I'm going to fall apart. What am I
going to do, if my life disappears?

490
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,308
I can't live without you.
I'm going to fall apart.

491
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,435
I need you by my side.
I need to feel that life is there.

492
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,189
Real life.
Please forgive me.

493
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,995
I promise to change.
I'm going to change my life.

494
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,512
You don't understand a thing.
- I understand everything.

495
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,759
For once I didn't enjoy being
the center of attention.

496
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,235
I could only think of you.

497
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,991
Now I understand, Marie.
- What do you understand?

498
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,028
The Gordian knot.
You...

499
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,753
You love him.
I love you.

500
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,957
And I can't... be without you.

501
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,709
I didn't understand that
until last night.

502
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,277
I'm going to invite Hugo to Skagen.

503
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,439
I'll rent a house for him in the dunes.

504
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,598
You can visit him when I work.
What you do when I'm not looking -

505
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,351
I don't want to know. And I don't
want anyone else to know either.

506
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:25,510
Nobody can bear that.
- I'll bear anything to keep you.

507
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,838
One can't give such huge gifts.

508
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,919
I'm not giving.
I'm receiving.

509
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,880
I love you.
- I love you, Marie.

510
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,355
I love you.

511
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,875
Will you come with me
back to my hotel?

512
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,992
Marie...

513
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,914
Smile, Marie. Smile.

514
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:28,353
Smile all the time and be happy.
Remember that we're...

515
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,677
We're here to pick up our house guest.

516
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,839
And what's his name again? Hugo.
I must try to remember.

517
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,197
Hugo! My dear friend.

518
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,989
Look happy to see me again,
damn it. I'm Søren.

519
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,354
Søren. Brother.
- Hugo!

520
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,758
Søren!
- Hugo, my dear...

521
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,635
Come along, dear friend.

522
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,631
Thank you for your magnanimity.
It's almost embarrassing.

523
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,594
No. I'm rich and famous.
You're not.

524
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,588
Hugo didn't mean wealth and fame.

525
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,269
You can spend the days together,
but not the nights.

526
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,950
And I won't be offended
in my own house. Understood?

527
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,353
Papa Hugo!
- Little Vibs. I've missed you.

528
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,028
How are you?
- Put her down.

529
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,718
Be careful.
- This is my bicycle.

530
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,035
Can you ride it?

531
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,440
I've furnished it.

532
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,479
To live here is like living in you.

533
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,553
Everything I compose here
I will dedicate to you.

534
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,710
Oh, there you are.

535
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,038
Where's Vibs?
- Inside. I fell asleep.

536
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,232
I've been working all day.
Come and sit down.

537
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,752
I have to prepare dinner.
- No, don't worry about dinner.

538
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,875
I found it impossible to work.

539
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,790
Henny looked after Vibs,
Vibs loves her dearly.

540
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,310
She has prepared dinner for us.

541
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,229
Seeing as
you don't have time for that.

542
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,712
Marie.
Look what we've made.

543
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,230
Vibeke is such a clever girl.

544
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,195
Isn't life marvelous?
Cheers.

545
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,349
I toast you, Hugo.
My life's savior.

546
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,832
Well, Hugo, my friend.

547
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,998
Are you getting
any composing done in the dunes?

548
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,158
I'm working on a piece called
"Midsummer Vigil".

549
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,796
"Midsummer Vigil".
"Midsummer Vigil".

550
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,515
Sounds awfully Swedish.
Play it for us.

551
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,395
Søren...
- Hell, let's hear some music.

552
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,512
Play for us.
Play your "Midsummer Vigil".

553
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,471
Now, sweetheart.
Tell me -

554
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,310
who do you like best?
Papa or Papa Hugo?

555
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,592
Tell me. Where are you going?
- Outside with Vibs.

556
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,950
Stay here!

557
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,989
Mr. Krøyer...
- Shut up! It's my house, my wife. Sit!

558
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,756
Answer me. Papa or Papa Hugo?
- You're scaring her.

559
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,509
You're not scared of me, are you?

560
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,838
So tell me. Which one of us?
- None of you.

561
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,591
That won't do.
You have to choose.

562
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,478
I know a Swede by the name
of Persson. Do you know him?

563
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,319
No.

564
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,398
Answer me. Who do you love
the most? Me or him?

565
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,115
Give me the gun.
- Nobody talks like that to me.

566
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,472
Are you scared, Marie?
Love's sister is afraid, eh?

567
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,717
Give it to me!
- Damn you, Swede!

568
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,910
Well, let's have some dessert.

569
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,438
Sit down, Mrs. Krøyer.

570
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,911
I told you,
your problems will be solved.

571
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,476
How is your painting coming along?
- I haven't got it in me.

572
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,593
I'm sure you do.
- It's not a necessity anymore.

573
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,669
Your presence in this room
makes me realize how drab it is.

574
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,269
What can I do for you, Mrs. Krøyer?

575
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,075
You know how conscientious I am.
- As I've told Mr. Krøyer many a time:

576
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,990
He doesn't know how grateful
he ought to be for your endurance.

577
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,239
He threatened me and our daughter -

578
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,874
with a loaded shotgun.

579
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:09,155
I've never been more scared. He
hadn't a shred of humanity left in him.

580
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,399
I was sure he was going to kill us.
- Poor thing. Would you like a brandy?

581
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,036
I can't go on.
- Do you want me to call Dr. Lange?

582
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,073
When he's discharged,
hell will start all over again.

583
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,352
It will never end.

584
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,075
Have you and Krøyer discussed...
- Divorce?

585
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,434
Yes. I know how hard you have
struggled to preserve your marriage.

586
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,077
I know how brave you've been.
No one knows it better than me.

587
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,434
Please don't think me forward, but
I have a large house in here in town.

588
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,872
I live there on my own.
You're welcome to move in with me.

589
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:51,198
With your child, of course.
- It's nice of you, Lachmann.

590
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,280
But Søren won't hear of divorce.
Will you talk some sense into him?

591
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,314
I'm sure Mr. Krøyer and I can have a
sensible man-to-man talk about this.

592
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,752
I'm not on my own.
- What do you mean?

593
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,712
I didn't intend to tell you.
- Tell me what?

594
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,838
I've met another man who loves me.

595
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,669
And I love him with all of my heart.

596
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,429
It is a complicated matter.

597
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,352
But didn't you say
you could talk some sense into him?

598
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,838
I can, and I'll be happy to.

599
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,715
But I also know
how much Mr. Krøyer loves you.

600
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,150
He won't give you up without a fight.

601
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,716
Mr. Krøyer is a great man,
a famous and highly decorated man.

602
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,358
Whom will people believe? Him or
a woman leaving him for another man?

603
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,998
I thought you wanted to help me.
- I will. But it will be difficult.

604
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,398
You will be seen as a treacherous
woman and judged harshly.

605
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,356
Thank you for your time.
- Wait.

606
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,590
You're right.
I've been naiive.

607
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,318
In my primitive lawyer's imagination
I thought that maybe -

608
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:27,117
when things were different,
if they were to become different...

609
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,758
Under different circumstances...

610
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,239
Forgive me my improper thoughts.

611
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,079
Let me at least help you at a distance.

612
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,238
Let's be sensible.
You're going away.

613
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,876
Someone has to take care of Søren's,
yours and Vibeke's interests.

614
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,709
Let me at least help you with that.
- And talk some sense into Søren.

615
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,514
The law is on his side.

616
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,918
Your position is weak...
In the eyes of the law.

617
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,432
No child can live in a loveless home.
- The law doesn't understand that.

618
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,474
Do something, Lachmann.

619
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,557
Do something.

620
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,036
Vibs can't live alone
with her sick father.

621
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,438
During his bad spells...
He loses control.

622
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,358
Help me.

623
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,918
I could ask the district doctor
in Skagen, an old friend -

624
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:31,353
to keep an eye on Søren
and call me, if he suffers a relapse.

625
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:35,394
Then I could ask
the authorities to remove the child.

626
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:44,192
But such a measure requires you
to give me a power of attorney.

627
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,518
A power of attorney?
- Yes. Make me her guardian.

628
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:57,157
Is that the only way you can help?
- I see no other.

629
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,555
Very well. Draw up
a power of attorney for Vibeke's sake.

630
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,389
I'll have my head clerk
do it right away.

631
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,475
I could do with a brandy now.
- I'm sorry. How selfish of me.

632
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,436
Excuse me one moment, Mrs. Krøyer.

633
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,712
Marie, is that you?
Won't you come inside?

634
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,595
I just came to thank you for looking
after Vibeke during our hard times.

635
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,113
Why of course.
- I have a bigger favor to ask of you.

636
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,357
You know how things stand -

637
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,189
and she is awfully fond of you.
It almost makes me jealous.

638
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,757
She's fond of you too.
She's confused, that's all.

639
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,436
Hugo and I have to leave.
There is no other option.

640
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,155
The sight of us torments Søren,
and I don't blame him.

641
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,716
But it doesn't change how I feel.
Not anymore.

642
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,036
Do you understand, Henny?

643
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,472
I think so.
- Søren needs security. A home.

644
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,557
You're such an affectionate woman,
Henny. Not a bad bone in your body.

645
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,356
I say that in admiration.
- What do you want to ask of me?

646
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:33,190
The law forbids me
to take Vibs with me.

647
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,598
I don't think I can live without her.

648
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,076
Will you take care of Vibs
while I'm gone?

649
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,519
Oh, dear God.
- Why are you crying?

650
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,794
I've always wanted a child.
I haven't been this happy in years.

651
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,436
Thank you for your trust, Marie.

652
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,155
I've never worked this well before.
I've never been this happy before.

653
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,308
It's just like the first time we met.
- My eyes are open now.

654
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,398
Yes, your eyes are open now.

655
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,072
Nothing inspires a composer more
than silence.

656
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,593
And here, in the middle
of the Swedish archipelago.

657
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,271
My new symphony.
It isn't about anything.

658
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,710
It is something.

659
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,957
What is it?
- Light.

660
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,118
Light and joy.

661
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,271
Light and joy.

662
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:36,515
Why are you looking so secretive?
- Am I?

663
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:44,395
Will your inspiration vanish,
if the silence is broken?

664
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,559
No.
Not if you break it.

665
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,638
And if it were a child?

666
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,320
A child?

667
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,751
I'm pregnant, Hugo.

668
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,351
Are you sure?
- A woman knows.

669
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,712
Congratulations.

670
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,998
Our real life starts now.
The life we've been dreaming of.

671
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,516
What?
- Look under your plate.

672
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,596
Read it.

673
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,713
He has agreed to the divorce.

674
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,833
Isn't it wonderful?

675
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,508
We can finally live as man and wife.

676
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,190
We don't have to live in sin
with our little child.

677
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,837
Let's get married right here in
the wild. Wouldn't that be beautiful?

678
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:40,591
And where are we going to live?
Let's stay here.

679
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:47,752
In Denmark I'm the unfaithful wife.
Here in Sweden we can start over.

680
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,111
It would do Vibs good, too.

681
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,318
Are you listening?
- Yes.

682
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,910
What do you think?
- About what?

683
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,396
You're not listening.
- I am.

684
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,149
Are we going to live here or there?
- I don't know.

685
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,677
You sound as if you don't care.
- I do.

686
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,994
I'm sorry.
Where do you want to live?

687
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,794
I already said.
Aren't you happy?

688
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,956
I'm happy.

689
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,557
You don't seem happy.

690
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,189
I'm nervous.

691
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,437
For me?
- For you and the child.

692
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,552
It will be fine.
I've tried it before.

693
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,912
And we'll find the best doctor to bring
our child safely into the world.

694
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,078
I'm an artist, Marie.
I need my freedom.

695
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,990
If I can't create, I'm useless.
- Will a child hinder your creativity?

696
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,034
I fear that.
- I'm there to give you that freedom.

697
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,959
I don't want you on my conscience.

698
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,993
You don't sacrifice yourself.
You give yourself and get love.

699
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,273
What you call a calling from God
is also an obligation.

700
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,519
God demands it, art demands it.
- Do you regret all this?

701
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,276
No.
- Is it the child then?

702
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,836
No.
- Is it because I talk of marriage?

703
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,951
No.
- Then what is it?

704
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,756
Why all this talk of obstacles?
Aren't you at all happy?

705
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,319
I can't.
I can't get married.

706
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,829
What?

707
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,875
I should have told you earlier,
but I couldn't.

708
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,238
I'm engaged.

709
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,716
I was engaged when we met.

710
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,038
But the sight of you
drove me crazy.

711
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,152
Made me reckless.

712
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,998
I promised to marry her
as soon as she left her husband.

713
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,749
And she has left her husband now.
- I left my husband, too.

714
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,032
I never asked you to.

715
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,271
I love you, Marie,
but I can't let her down.

716
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,519
But you can let me down.
- I told you. I need my freedom.

717
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,030
Without that I'm nothing.
I need boundless...

718
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,233
You don't fear for your freedom.
- So what do I fear?

719
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,749
Me.

720
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,190
What about the child?

721
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,560
I will never forgive you for this.

722
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,473
Marie? You're back?

723
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:37,592
May I come in?
- Why of course. Come in.

724
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,357
Aren't you going to greet your mother?

725
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,029
Let's go and sit down.

726
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,993
How is Søren?
- He tries to work.

727
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,954
But his poor eyesight is making it
almost impossible for him to paint.

728
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,948
So he sleeps most of the time.

729
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:24,473
And Vibs is such a clever girl.
Show your mother all you've learned.

730
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,036
Show her your exercise books.

731
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,912
You've made such progress
while Mommy's been away.

732
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,030
Do you want me to wake him?
- Will you?

733
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,277
Søren, Marie is here.

734
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,714
Marie.

735
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,559
Marie, you've come back?
- It's too late.

736
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,190
Is it his?
- It's mine.

737
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,076
I thought you were happy.

738
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,079
So why don't you come back?

739
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,430
We'll say it's my child.

740
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:40,031
No one will point fingers at you.
You will still be Mrs. Krøyer.

741
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,677
After I've let you down,
I should hide behind your name?

742
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,997
We've let each other down.

743
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,552
Your hands are cold.

744
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,957
Please put them on my forehead.

745
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,878
You know I love you.

746
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,153
No one on earth will ever
love you as much as I.

747
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,438
And no one understands you
as well as I do.

748
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:25,715
That's true.
- No one understands me like you.

749
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,230
But there is an abyss between us.

750
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,152
We could try.
- Haven't we tried?

751
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,238
Yes.

752
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,115
But where will you go?
- Where?

753
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:47,552
What with the child and everything?
- I'll find a way.

754
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,316
We're still married. On paper.
I'm obligated to provide for you.

755
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,274
I'll have Lachmann transfer
some money to you.

756
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,871
That will make everything...
a little easier.

757
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,113
Thank you, Søren.

758
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,279
Marie... Say something.

759
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,989
What do you want me to say?
- Say something about yourself.

760
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,033
You never talk about yourself.

761
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,789
Do you know
what your first word to me was?

762
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,432
No, what?
- Champagne.

763
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,793
Damned right.

764
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,436
Damned right.
Oh, Marie.

765
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,076
Aren't we the happiest people
in the whole world?

766
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:48,717
Aren't you and I the happiest people
in the whole world?

767
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,597
There!

768
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,114
It's a beautiful little girl.

769
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,269
Look, Mrs. Krøyer.
She's smiling at you.

770
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,079
Merry Christmas.

771
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,912
Come in.

772
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,635
It's so sad to think of you sitting
all alone here on Christmas Eve.

773
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,149
You must know many in Copenhagen.

774
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,395
I prefer to be alone.

775
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,991
You're welcome to join my wife
and me. The more, the merrier.

776
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,829
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

777
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:47,474
Come in.
- A gentleman insists on seeing you.

778
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,353
A Mr. Alfvén.

779
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:56,190
I don't want to talk to him.
- Marie, I need to talk to you.

780
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,800
I have to talk to you.

781
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,797
You know where you can find me.

782
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,189
I've traveled all day and all night.

783
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,154
Christmas Eve is not
a night for traveling.

784
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:20,512
Why did you come?
- I love you. I can't live without you.

785
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:26,670
I can't work. I sit down at the piano,
and I see you and hear your voice.

786
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,393
I've broken off the other engagement,
so there are no obstacles now.

787
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,957
Please forgive me.
I've been such an idiot.

788
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,914
A bastard.

789
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,717
Forgive me.

790
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,152
Too much love isn't suffocating?
- I'm all the wiser now.

791
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,992
I know that under no circumstances
do I want us to be apart.

792
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,953
What about your freedom to create?

793
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:01,312
A man can't live by art alone.
You taught me that.

794
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:07,117
I realized too late
what a treasure I held in my hands.

795
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,398
Don't you want to see your child?
- Yes.

796
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,470
It's beautiful.
- It's a little girl.

797
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,318
May I?

798
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,831
She's looking at me.

799
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,600
Hello. It's your father.

800
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,031
Can you say father?

801
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,639
She spoke to me.

802
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:52,438
What is her name?
- I haven't decided on a name.

803
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,552
What are we going to call you,
little girl?

804
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,797
You are both so beautiful.

805
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,993
Please believe me, Marie.
You hold my happiness in your hands.

806
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,952
I love you.

807
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,596
Our love comes before anything else.

808
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,439
Marry me, Marie.
For our sake.

809
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,268
For Vibeke's sake.

810
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,870
If you only knew
how much I miss Vibeke.

811
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,629
Not a day goes by
that I don't...

812
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,912
I will never let down a child again.

813
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:37,398
As long as we aren't married,
she's mine alone -

814
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,036
and no one can threaten me.

815
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:46,314
Is that how you perceive me?
- No, not now.

816
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,159
Now I love you.

817
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,831
And I can feel that you love me.
I believe every word you say.

818
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,715
Every bone in my body cries out to me
to give myself to you.

819
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,596
To feel you inside me.
To be together as only we can.

820
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,989
But everything can soon change -

821
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,910
and then no one remembers
the bliss. Only evil remains.

822
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,232
I will wait for you, Marie.

823
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:58,032
Today we lay to rest
one of Denmark's great sons.

824
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,872
The greatest painter
Denmark has ever known.

825
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,277
The financial side of things
will soon be settled.

826
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:50,076
I presume you have
no objections to his will?

827
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,071
That leaves
only one problem unsolved.

828
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,953
The child.
- The child?

829
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,436
Vibeke.
- Oh, but I've rented a house.

830
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:07,509
But I'm obligated to think
of the welfare of the child.

831
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:12,919
I don't understand.
- You gave me a power of attorney.

832
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,920
That was to protect her.
- Which I'm doing. I'm her guardian.

833
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:25,150
Don't forget, my dear.
You had deserted your family.

834
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,753
I demand to see her.
- You will.

835
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,590
Where is she?
- Let me outline your options.

836
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:41,148
Options?
- Vibeke is to determine her own fate.

837
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,353
What do you mean?
- I have no offers for you, only terms.

838
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,154
Sit down.

839
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,598
As you wish.

840
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,875
Sit down.

841
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:14,078
Vibeke is on her way.
I will ask her a very simple question.

842
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,671
Do you want to live with your mother,
or do you want to live with Henny?

843
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,510
She's my child.
- As her guardian I can do as I please.

844
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,759
A woman who betrays her husband
and has an illegitimate child -

845
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,873
has not got much of a say
in this world. Nor in the legal world.

846
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:38,234
I decide. You are not to speak
or gesture to the child.

847
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:42,956
Are we agreed? Good.
I will fetch the child.

848
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,358
Vibeke.

849
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,917
I want you to answer me
truthfully and sincerely.

850
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,634
Will you promise me that? Good.

851
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,072
Don't be afraid. No one is going to get
angry with you. Do you understand?

852
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,239
Good.
Who are these people?

853
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:22,592
My mother and Henny.
- Yes. Do you like them?

854
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,476
You like your mother?

855
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,708
And you like Henny?

856
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,311
But you can't be with both of them
at the same time. You do understand.

857
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,752
So you have to choose
whom you want to live with.

858
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:44,397
Would you prefer to live
with your mother or with Henny?

859
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:50,311
They both want you, you see.
But you get to decide.

860
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,080
I've decided that.

861
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,078
So I ask you, Vibeke.

862
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,748
Who do you want to live with?

863
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,114
Would you prefer to live
with your mother or with Henny?

864
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,159
You have to say something.

865
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,353
Go to her then.

866
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,231
I'm sorry.

867
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,875
I'm sure you can visit her
as often as you like.

868
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,513
I do understand
how hard it must be for you.

869
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:28,395
Just as hard as it is for me.

870
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,070
You must think I've been horrible.

871
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:39,512
That I've let you down
and done everything wrong.

872
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,591
I have let you down.

873
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,429
And I don't blame you
for being angry with me.

874
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:57,590
I really wanted to be a good mother
and give you love and comfort.

875
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,638
But I couldn't.
Do you understand me, little Vibs?

876
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:10,551
I haven't been happy.
Yes, I was happy that I had you.

877
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,116
But I haven't been happy in my life.

878
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:19,996
And an unhappy person
can't make another person happy.

879
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,109
I know I should have stayed with you.

880
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:34,039
And taken much better care of you
than I did.

881
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,075
But it wouldn't have done you any
good to see your mother so unhappy.

882
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,555
No matter how much you missed her.

883
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,311
If all you see are unhappy adults, you
think that's what being an adult is.

884
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,274
But life isn't like that.
One can be happy.

885
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,916
And that has nothing to do
with one's parents.

886
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,237
It's all up to oneself.

887
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,431
You've taken the first step.

888
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:12,469
And that step leads away from me.
So be it.

889
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,309
I just wanted to say
that I hope -

890
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:28,593
you will become a happy person
in your own opinion.

891
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:33,632
Only your own opinion
of yourself matters.

892
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,150
You can always knock on my door.

893
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,710
Goodbye, Vibs.

894
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:01,073
Mommy and Papa hope with
all our hearts that you will be happy.

895
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:25,311
THE END
