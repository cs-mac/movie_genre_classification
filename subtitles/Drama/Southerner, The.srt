1
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,732
This is a little souvenir...
picture of my best pal...

2
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,713
Sam Tucker and his folks

3
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,666
Believe me, they don't come no better...

4
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,783
Only, when old Sam gets an idea
in that hard head of his...

5
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:05,111
he don't behoove with nothin' else.

6
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:07,003
This is Nona...

7
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:08,476
Sam's wife.

8
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:11,732
And here's Sam's ma... a widow-woman

9
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,603
Ma ain't so young...
but her heart's still full of fire.

10
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,936
Harmie here ain't no Tucker...
just a good friend.

11
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:21,110
If he looks kinda
sheep-eyed, it's because

12
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:23,402
he's all lit up with that
flame in Ma's heart.

13
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,724
These are the youngest
of the Tucker clan.

14
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,881
Sam's kids... Daisy and Jotty.

15
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:30,848
And here's Sam's granny.

16
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:33,323
She didn't like having her
picture took, neither.

17
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:37,123
This one's me...
I'm a town man myself.

18
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,909
Only come home for fairs
and weddings and stuff.

19
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,732
That's how come I cherish
this picture show...

20
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,720
Makes me feel close to my friends,
to look at it.

21
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:30,586
Sam... Sam...

22
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,364
What's the matter, Uncle Pete?

23
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,822
- It's all so hot!
- Hey, Nona!

24
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,046
My hat...

25
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,226
You lie here, Uncle Pete...

26
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,344
Get some water.

27
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,700
It's my darned old heart.

28
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:15,607
You just lie here, Uncle Pete...
I'll finish your row for you.

29
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,796
Much obliged to you, Sam.

30
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,071
I gotta take my cotton back,
now, Honey.

31
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,376
I'll take care of Uncle Pete.

32
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,292
Uncle Pete's sick,
I'm gonna finish his row.

33
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,915
Where are you going
after the crop's over?

34
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,321
I figured I might stay here...
I got me a bulldozing job.

35
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,951
- Where are you going?
- I think I'm going north next year.

36
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,617
- Can I sit down?
- Hi fellas.

37
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,066
- Hot.
- Yeah.

38
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,111
How is he, Honey?

39
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,491
He ain't so good.

40
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,239
Look for yourself...

41
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,492
Grow your own crops.

42
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,401
You want some more water, Uncle Pete?

43
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,857
Grow your own crops.

44
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,834
I wish we could raise him
a tombstone.

45
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,564
That's for folks that got money.

46
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:31,279
Come here, "Zoomy".

47
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:40,524
Jotty...

48
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:16,708
My eyes hurt!

49
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,913
Oh, does it, Jotty?

50
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,857
Granny!... Granny!

51
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:26,190
Here, Honey... hold him.

52
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:28,542
Look at the fast grapes!

53
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,605
Don't you want any fast grapes, Granny?

54
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,347
I don't want to get mixed up
with no copperheads!

55
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,700
Already wearin' one crooky toe
on o' them scoundrels ruined!

56
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:55,385
Don't be a hog, Daisy...
Leave a few for the next fella!

57
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:57,430
I thought you was afeard of snakes!

58
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:01,954
I am... but that ain't no sign
I got to starve to death, is it?

59
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:05,245
You know that little San Pedro place
down near the river?

60
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,097
I heard of it... I ain't never seen it.

61
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,861
Well, that belongs to the boss, too.

62
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,457
Old Ike at the commissary
was tellin' me it was for rent.

63
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,192
Been layin' out there now
for three years...

64
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,075
It should be as rich as mud.

65
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:18,650
In the old days, old man Corinth used to
raise the best crops in the country on it.

66
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,763
If it's been layin' out all that time,
it'll take a whole year to clear it off.

67
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,936
Yeah.

68
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:33,585
Nony... Nony come here!

69
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:42,443
Behave yourself...
Don't you be always teasin' Granny.

70
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:47,168
I reckon I could ask old man Neward
for his mules...

71
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:48,739
He don't ever hardly use 'em,
no how.

72
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,434
Same with the bed of the crop.

73
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,262
As for seeds and fertilizer...
I bet I could make a deal with Harmie.

74
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:57,311
And as for a plough,
there's that old one of Pa's...

75
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,645
been layin' out in Ma's backyard
ever since he died...

76
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:01,825
Ain't been used for nothin'
but roostin' chickens on.

77
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,438
I'm gonna ask the boss about it.

78
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:06,473
Askin' don't do no harm.

79
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,229
No askin'... or work either...
don't harm a man.

80
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,492
After all, the boss
is a pretty good guy.

81
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:14,068
We always been friends.

82
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,743
Jotty, Dis, Granny... come on!

83
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,701
It's OK with me, Tucker...
I ain't interested in that piece o' land.

84
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,245
Too far away from my other property.

85
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:46,757
But just remember this...

86
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:50,288
If I ain't satisfied
with the way you're workin' it...

87
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:53,691
I aim to break that contract
any time I like.

88
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,688
It's alright with me, boss.

89
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:00,206
I like you, Tucker.

90
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:01,788
You're a good hard-worker.

91
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,977
And that's why I'm botherin' to warn you...

92
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:05,614
Now, I'm tellin' you again...

93
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:07,870
If you're workin' for a big outfit...

94
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,457
Maybe you don't get rich...

95
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:13,071
But you still get your pay...
even if the crops is bad.

96
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:15,913
But the little guy,
who's growin' his own...

97
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:18,311
If his crop is ruined...

98
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:19,858
He's got nothin' left.

99
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:23,400
I see you've made up your mind.

100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,192
Got some way of movin' your things?

101
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,040
Yessir... Coreo said I
could borrow his truck.

102
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,042
OK... Good luck, Tucker!

103
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:29,839
Thank you, sir.

104
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,274
How far is our house
from the river, Papa?

105
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,561
Why, it's almost just right next
to the river, Honey!

106
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,650
Goody... goody!

107
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,726
Don't look like no house
at all to me.

108
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:36,512
Looks more like a cow shed!

109
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:41,466
I'd rather live back there in that dirty
old camp than a heap o' junk like that!

110
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:46,540
Ain't never gonna get me
to go into that old tin hole

111
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,849
Bringin' their old granny
to this scrubby place!

112
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,372
I see they don't love me no more
than if I was a yellow dog!

113
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:58,877
I always hoped we could have a room
to ourselves, some day.

114
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:02,094
We can have... when summer comes.

115
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:06,302
Let Granny and the kids sleep in here...
and move our bed out on the porch.

116
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:08,971
And have everything real nice.

117
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,078
Oh, Sam...

118
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:14,690
The house don't seem
like nothin' extra!

119
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,510
Seems like extra one thing...

120
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,180
Pretty darn extra bad.

121
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,053
I reckon I was thinkin' too hard
about the land...

122
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:23,965
I plum forgot about the house.

123
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,444
There sure be some patchin' to do.

124
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,590
More 'n a little!

125
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,652
What about the well, Sam?

126
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,578
Let's go look at it.

127
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,282
I was crazy to think
we could live in this place.

128
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,941
Why, it'd take me at least 2 weeks
to dig this well again.

129
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:49,736
Without even talkin' about the
money the planks and beams w'd cost!

130
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:54,480
Tain't much of a man that brings
his babies and his womenfolks

131
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,446
to soak and freeze...
in such a hole as this!

132
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,328
Maybe she's right.

133
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,477
Water from that river,
for the kids...

134
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:08,319
'd just be like servin' them up
a dish of typhoid.

135
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,415
Tain't much of a man, I say!

136
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,888
Look, Honey... we can still
go back to the camp, if you want to.

137
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,569
The boss couldn't have knowed
how bad the place is.

138
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,869
I could talk to him again, and still maybe
get my bulldozing job for the winter.

139
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,445
Well...

140
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,645
How's the ground?

141
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:30,653
Oh, it's good earth alright...

142
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,473
You know, with dirt like this, a fella
could raise the best crop in the country.

143
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:36,105
Been layin' out all these years.

144
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:39,967
The earth's kinda like men, you know...
It needs a rest every once in a while.

145
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,629
Maybe that's the reason
the Lord invented Sunday.

146
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,730
But how about all this brush
and Johnson grass?

147
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,297
You'll kill yourself gettin' rid of it
before the plantin'.

148
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,518
I ain't all alone Honey...
I ain't like Uncle Pete.

149
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,424
Every time i get plum wore out...
I think of you and Jotty and Daisy...

150
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,673
And I ain't quite so tired anymore.

151
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:56,906
Oh, Sam!

152
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,494
I just could never get along
without you.

153
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,017
Me too, Honey...
I couldn't live without you.

154
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,751
The thing that'd be good about it is
we could always work together.

155
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,358
When you did the ploughin'
I could lead the mules... and...

156
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:11,963
When you clean up this brush,
I could burn it for you... and...

157
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:15,315
Summertime we could lie in the grass
and watch the kids swimmin' in the river.

158
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:16,476
Yeah... that'd be fun, Honey!

159
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,777
But what worries me
is that busted well.

160
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,099
Oh, Sam... we could surely borrow water
from the neighbour, yonder...

161
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,715
Nobody refuses water.

162
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:27,199
Yeah... I hear he's got a good well.

163
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:31,047
Sam... I reckon we ought to stay!

164
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:33,595
You really mean that?

165
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,785
You ain't just sayin' that
to make me feel good?

166
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:38,022
I'm sayin' it because I believe
you're as good as any man...

167
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,570
and it's right for you
to be your own boss.

168
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,838
Hey, you two...
You ain't all alone here, you know!

169
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:55,577
Hey there... we've got enough... we're
moving in and it's all ironed... come on.

170
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,511
Come on... give me a hand.

171
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:04,396
You take the pictures...
mind you don't drop 'em.

172
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:11,852
Come on sweetie...
I'll help you down

173
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:12,762
No you don't!

174
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,276
I don't want aim to go no...

175
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,118
Can't even say it...
me I'm a lady.

176
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,653
Alright old lady...
but you better be down before morning...

177
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,522
or you'll go right back to camp
with this truck.

178
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,811
Old man Coreo mightn't
like it too much, neither.

179
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:40,233
Sam Tucker! My own grandson
gone as crazy as a bedbug!

180
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,390
Total crazy I tell you!

181
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,775
Crazy as a bedbug!

182
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,503
You've gone completely silly!

183
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:53,029
He's clean outta his mind,
I tell ya!

184
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,977
There's so much...
You're downright mean!

185
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:25,068
They gotta take out their cussedness
on somebody's old folks!

186
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,847
I done had my share
and I ain't takin' no more no how!

187
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:32,714
I takin' no more!

188
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:37,681
Ain't exactly a veranda, honey... but to me
it's the porch that makes the house a home!

189
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,745
Sam, I think I got the stove working!

190
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,378
We'll all light it together.

191
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:27,236
Our first fire in our own house.

192
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:29,712
Yeah... You sure made a good job
of that stove, Honey.

193
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:32,251
Won't be long before we'll have
a good hot cup of coffee.

194
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,943
You get some water, Sam.

195
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:36,762
Jotty, Daisy... get the cups
and put 'em on the table.

196
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:46,569
You reckon Granny's gonna
stay out there all night?

197
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,689
I'd say she'll be too coward.

198
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,229
Dis... you go call Granny.

199
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,825
Granny... you want some good hot coffee?

200
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,059
No sir! Nothin' what comes outta that
old pot don't tempt me none at all!

201
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:30,255
Mama, it's raining and
Granny won't come in!

202
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:33,144
Well, we'll have our coffee anyway.

203
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,385
Sit down, Honey...
I'll get it.

204
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,139
Oh, Papa... there's a hole in the ceiling!

205
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,435
Granny's changed her mind!

206
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:36,023
Come on Granny.

207
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,197
Here, I've got your good blanket...

208
00:19:40,198 --> 00:19:42,540
Now put it around you before you catch
your death of cold.

209
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,388
Here's some honey, Granny.

210
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,963
Honey!...

211
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,269
They not only let me die
of the cold...

212
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,572
But they hide out the goodies on me!

213
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:46,250
How do you want your bedcover, honey?

214
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,661
With the fire going,
it's nice and warm in here.

215
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,110
Goodnight Granny.

216
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,304
Nona, come on over here.

217
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,502
Oh, that's a pretty one, Sam!

218
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:13,319
Yeah, Honey... that's a mighty fine fish!

219
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,625
It'll make us a good dinner.

220
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,789
Well I figured I'd take
this one to Denvers,

221
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,072
our neighbour down the
road, with a good well.

222
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,150
That little one in the bucket's
for us.

223
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,679
Aren't you gonna put on dry clothes?

224
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,174
Oh, I'll dry it off walkin' over...
won't be gone long.

225
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:28,737
You'd better keep Zoomy here.

226
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,448
This one ain't so big, honey.

227
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:35,370
Well I'll catch us another tomorrow...
a big one... we'll keep it

228
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:43,406
Go along with your mama, Jotty.

229
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:11,757
Mighty fine place
you got around here.

230
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,265
You the owner?
You Henry Devers?

231
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,322
- No, folks call me Finlay.
- Howdy!

232
00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:18,133
He's my uncle...
He's over yonder in the shed.

233
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,359
Much obliged... Finlay.

234
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,254
Howdy!

235
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,591
What do you want?

236
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,410
I'm your neighbour...
my name's Sam Tucker...

237
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:41,861
I brought you a fish.

238
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:42,886
Mean do I want to buy it?

239
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:43,921
No... It's a present.

240
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,784
Well, leave it if you got no use for it.

241
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:48,279
Where'll I put it?

242
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:50,715
Any place... on the bench.

243
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:55,974
Say, that's a mighty queer-lookin'
fishhook you picked up.

244
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,914
I ain't no graveller...
I fish hook and line.

245
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,156
Aim to use it in this river?

246
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:02,808
Aim to use it any place I feel like it.
Finlay!

247
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,554
Take this here fish, and give it
to Becky to cook for dinner.

248
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,943
Are you the new neighbour?...
I'm Becky Devers.

249
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,360
Yes'm... we're the Tuckers.

250
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,655
Be nice havin' folks next door...
It's lonesome here.

251
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,544
What are you doin' here...
I didn't send for you.

252
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:28,591
Well, I thought, pop...

253
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,192
You don't have to think...
Get that fish and go back to the house.

254
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,758
And you get your washin' finished!

255
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,377
My wife be likely over soon
to borrow some of your well water.

256
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:50,513
So that's what you come for!

257
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:52,760
That's right.
My well ain't no good.

258
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,702
I coulda told you that.

259
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,144
So can I, now.

260
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,472
What about that water?

261
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,067
Why don't you get your water
at the river.

262
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,445
River water ain't no good
for kids to drink.

263
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,679
Alright...
As long as there's plenty of water.

264
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,847
You'll have to make other arrangements,
though, when summer comes.

265
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:14,837
Gets pretty weak
when the weather's dry.

266
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:18,507
We'll take turns about replacin'
the wore-out rope.

267
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,786
Seems pretty wore-out already.

268
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:27,005
Well, if you don't like it, next well's
5 miles down the road.

269
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,805
Suits me.

270
00:25:29,806 --> 00:25:33,136
Alright... so long Devers.

271
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,724
Just a minute!

272
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,232
You're likely gonna fix your own well,
ain't you?

273
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,364
If you're rentin' you must have
some savings put aside.

274
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:44,436
I got 2 good arms...
worth more than savings.

275
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:47,834
To hear folks talk...
you think you can be

276
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,196
farmers just like that...
with your bare hands.

277
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,620
Got any tools or tractors?

278
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:54,358
No, I ain't got no tractor.

279
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,823
But I got 2 mules and a good old plough...
and a friend o' mine's lendin' the seed.

280
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,698
And Ruston furnishes the fertilizer.

281
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,670
Don't need much
for good muddy land like that.

282
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:06,564
And he gives the poison for the weevils,
pays the cotton-pickers...

283
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,096
even lets you draw grub
from his commissary.

284
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:11,181
After you get the ground broke.

285
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:14,656
Yeah... he just furnishes
about everything...

286
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,662
With the sweat.

287
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:18,273
And if you get by the year...

288
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:20,586
he generously lets you
take your share of the crop...

289
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:21,553
Ain't that right?

290
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:24,056
Why ask me... It seems
you know it already.

291
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:25,859
Oh, but I know Ruston...

292
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,880
Ain't the first time he's gettin'
a piece of land cleaned off for nothin'.

293
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,525
Until you get your ploughin' started...

294
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,545
how do you aim to eat?

295
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:36,272
I aim to fish...

296
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:38,285
and hunt varmints
and sell a few skins.

297
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:40,705
Lots of folks like that
live around here.

298
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:42,234
Plenty more done it before.

299
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,999
How about you?

300
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,648
How'd you get started?

301
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,428
Sharecrop.

302
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:56,662
First year I lost my whole crop,
it was ruined by the hail.

303
00:26:57,695 --> 00:27:01,750
Next year black leg got my cow and pig
that I'd spent all my savings for.

304
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,388
My wife caught cold
and she died.

305
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:09,306
Two years later, one of my kids, the boy...
He died from spring sickness.

306
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:12,618
Maybe I lost them both,
my woman and my kid...

307
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,882
because I didn't have
no money for doctoring.

308
00:27:15,826 --> 00:27:18,620
And here I am with a farm...
a good one...

309
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:20,951
belongs all to me
and worth lots of money.

310
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:24,265
Only, I can't forget what it cost me.

311
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:29,255
So when I see young folk like you
with their proudness...

312
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,344
noses stuck in the air...
just makes me laugh!

313
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,705
Well... much obliged for the water,

314
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:40,373
And good luck with your fishhook.

315
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:52,945
Hey... Finlay...

316
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:55,970
What's that big old fishhook
you uncle's fixing up there?

317
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:57,320
Is there a whale in this river?

318
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:58,386
That's for "Lead Pencil".

319
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,867
"Lead Pencil"... what's that?

320
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:02,406
A catfish... he's got 2 whiskers
like lead pencils.

321
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:04,367
Biggest durned catfish
you ever seen in the river.

322
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:06,780
Hey! get that washing away Finlay!

323
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,621
Nothin'?

324
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,255
Must be the wind.

325
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:27,958
It's more the time.

326
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:31,787
For days now the moon has been moving
closer and closer to the North Star...

327
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:34,629
The animals don't like that...
they hide out.

328
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:38,612
It's crazy to go against the signs,
but what can you do?

329
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:40,202
We gotta get fresh food.

330
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,617
Daisy, honey... why don't
you and Sonny get into bed.

331
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,394
Nice and warm there.

332
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,739
Did you have a nice day at school?

333
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:07,166
She didn't go, Sam.

334
00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:08,618
Why not?

335
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:13,906
It's too cold... she ain't got no coat...
She'll catch her death of cold.

336
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,912
But they just gotta go to school.

337
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:23,185
Just because we're having hard times right
now doesn't mean we gotta stop nothing.

338
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:24,705
We gotta keep going.

339
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:29,706
Once we give up we won't have the courage
to get back to the good time.

340
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:34,565
As I see it... ain't gonna have
no dinner again tonight.

341
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:38,982
Never you mind, Granny.

342
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:41,875
For breakfast we'll have a nice big bowl
of cornmeal mush.

343
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:48,882
You'll all look down on my cold dead face
in that county pine box.

344
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:49,952
You'll be sorry then.

345
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:50,993
Maybe.

346
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:55,181
You keep on promisin', Granny!

347
00:30:55,182 --> 00:30:57,571
You don't never deliver the goods!

348
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:59,688
Hush your mouth!
You can't talk to me like that!

349
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:00,849
You ain't even a real Tucker!

350
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:02,986
Well, you ain't either!

351
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:03,920
Hey... Honey!

352
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,046
Daisy's got to be coated.

353
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:12,851
They gotta go to school.

354
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:15,526
Don't you take my blanket, Sam!
Don't you touch my blanket!

355
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:19,534
Sam Tucker... you take one bit
of my best blanket, you'll get punished...

356
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:23,058
Granny, ain't you got no heart...?
You want Daisy to catch her death?

357
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,014
There'll be enough blanket
to keep you warm.

358
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,278
I like it big!

359
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:27,948
Curse you, Sam Tucker!

360
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,858
My big blanket!
Curse you!

361
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:30,955
Granny!

362
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:35,104
Sam Tucker's the boss here...

363
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:36,828
He can cut up whatever he likes.

364
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,045
He's the boss!

365
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,251
You hear me?

366
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:45,780
Oh, Granny!

367
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:48,456
Now don't take on so!

368
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,373
Look, I think I know where
there's a nice swarm of wild bees...

369
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:57,167
Maybe tomorrow I'll go out
and get you some honey!

370
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:58,740
Maybe.

371
00:31:58,741 --> 00:31:59,828
Why me?

372
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,922
Why me? I don't care for folks comin',
and helpin' yourselves, you know.

373
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,821
Now don't you worry!
I'll get your honey.

374
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:12,845
Nony...

375
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,513
You know I guess you're
a right good Tucker after all.

376
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:20,045
That Sam of yours...

377
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:23,798
He's 'most as good a man
as my Fayette!

378
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,080
My best blanket!

379
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:57,940
Yessir, that carcase of yours
is sure gonna make 4 more Tuckers happy.

380
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:00,902
C'mon Zoom!

381
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,447
Yes sir, you're hide 'll
just about bring the

382
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,615
price of a pair of silk
stockings for mama.

383
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,969
Nice and shiny!

384
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,762
Reckon we can eat now, folks!

385
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,287
Easy!... You'll all get your share!

386
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,237
Hold on, everybody...
there's gonna be a blessing.

387
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:00,653
Much obliged, Lord...

388
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:03,355
Looks like the Tuckers are gonna
make the grade after all.

389
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:05,680
Amen.

390
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:06,694
Granny!

391
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,081
Granny gets the first,
because she's the eldest.

392
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:23,219
I'd taken the Lord to be a stranger
in this house!

393
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:27,190
Then comes Jotty,
coz he's the littlest.

394
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:34,164
Then comes Papa
coz he caught this possum.

395
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,717
And this one's for Zoomy...

396
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:45,110
Because he helped him.

397
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:52,965
And last of all, Daisy and me...
coz we're the womenfolk.

398
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:57,340
At school they say this kinda food's
bad for you all the time.

399
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:04,976
They say you gotta eat vegetables.

400
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,945
Too much meat's bad.

401
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:08,416
Vegetables in winter?

402
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:09,795
If you don't...

403
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:13,244
they say you get pellagra.

404
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:15,570
That must be the 'spring sickness', Sam.

405
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,905
Why, it's vegetables
that causes 'spring sickness'.

406
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,898
That's when you get it... 'long about
the time you start eating vegetables.

407
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:26,090
I oughta know... I lost
three o' mine from it.

408
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:28,942
Their Uncle Walter...
Aunt Beck and Sue.

409
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:31,435
And not one was over 6!

410
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:34,441
Shucks... look at THEM.

411
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:37,716
And anything a body likes as good as that,
couldn't be bad for 'em.

412
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:40,617
Ain't that true, Nona?

413
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:41,921
That's right, Sam.

414
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,755
We done all that ourself.

415
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:56,025
Just kept workin' and pluggin' away...

416
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:58,379
By gosh, we done good.

417
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:02,880
Before long now we can start plantin'
our cotton roundabout the twentieth.

418
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:05,752
Then that crop will really get started.

419
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,023
Hold that for me, will you.

420
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:44,113
You see those little green woolly worms
fallin' outta that tree... ten a minute?

421
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:46,963
They're all drifting down together
in the same place.

422
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:50,207
And some folk might think
that they're what "Lead Pencil" is after.

423
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:51,699
But they'd be wrong.

424
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,579
Coz he's after somethin' else!

425
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,733
He ain't interested in no worms.

426
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:57,797
Old "Lead" is a pretty smart old guy.

427
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:00,140
Wouldn't hardly live to be
as old as he is, if he wasn't.

428
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:03,378
I'll bet you old "Lead"
waits for his dinner

429
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:05,138
right over yonder at
that there drift.

430
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:07,766
It's like a trap, on the river bottom.

431
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:10,970
Is "Lead Pencil" older than Granny, Papa?

432
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:12,528
Yeah... he's older than Granny.

433
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:18,788
Yessir, it must be yonder, old
"Lead Pencil" has got his cubby.

434
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:24,873
Gimme that, Honey.

435
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:38,215
Sam!

436
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,466
Nony!

437
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,844
You got to come here quick!

438
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,166
What are you sayin', Granny?

439
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:45,936
Jot's ailin'...

440
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:48,744
I reckon he's got the Spring Sickness!

441
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:50,164
Spring Sickness?!

442
00:41:50,165 --> 00:41:51,822
How do you know?

443
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,993
I am sayin' it's Spring Sickness!

444
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:58,435
Who'd know better 'n me?...
Already lost 3 from it.

445
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:22,659
Sam...

446
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,819
I'm afraid!

447
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:40,186
I didn't see no reason
to bother you, Doctor...

448
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,869
It was just that little sore.

449
00:42:43,948 --> 00:42:45,730
Sonny ain't ever been sick.

450
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:47,592
When it grew and grew...

451
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:50,924
And now it seems like
it's just plum gonna possess him...

452
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:57,021
You see Doctor... it's like some evil
crawlin' worm eatin' up my baby!

453
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:00,962
I can't stand to watch it
no longer, Doctor!

454
00:43:00,963 --> 00:43:03,566
You gotta do somethin' to stop it!

455
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:18,219
You don't have a cow, do you?

456
00:43:18,811 --> 00:43:19,717
No, Sir.

457
00:43:22,723 --> 00:43:25,154
Well, you better tell Sam to get one.

458
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:26,809
How do we get a cow?

459
00:43:27,393 --> 00:43:28,530
Borrow one!

460
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:31,970
Let Sam raise a heifer for somebody.

461
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,648
Or borrow some milk, anyway.

462
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:37,311
A pint a day...
or better still, a quart.

463
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:41,479
Any neighbour with a cow
could spare you that.

464
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,113
I'll try Doctor...
What medicine?

465
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:45,217
Undress the boy.

466
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,363
What vegetables
you been eatin' lately?

467
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:56,663
Vegetables?...
Couldn't grow vegetables in winter.

468
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:58,016
You got any money?

469
00:43:58,017 --> 00:43:59,966
Yes, Doctor... I got your $2.

470
00:44:00,502 --> 00:44:02,536
Sam's got $1.35 more...

471
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:04,208
Keep it.

472
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:07,102
Take all your money
and spend it all for vegetables.

473
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,163
And get some lemons...

474
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:10,537
Give him a glass of lemonade,
twice a day.

475
00:44:10,538 --> 00:44:12,475
And get that milk...!
Do you hear?

476
00:44:12,476 --> 00:44:15,014
If you don't give him milk
and vegetables...

477
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:17,640
anything that I can do will be
just plum wasted.

478
00:44:18,196 --> 00:44:19,820
And with the milk and vegetables?

479
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,072
I think he's got a chance.

480
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:41,089
Thank you! Call again!

481
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,206
Me... I know what war is.

482
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:48,929
We was right close to Chateau Thierry
and the old colonel...

483
00:44:49,578 --> 00:44:52,754
He brung us all together, and said...

484
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:56,922
Young man, in civilian life,
never brag about you conquests...

485
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:59,520
- Whether they be love or war.
- Shut up, young fella!

486
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:01,716
I'm tellin' ya... I know!

487
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:03,090
And I know I know!

488
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,284
Well, if it ain't Sam Tucker!

489
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:08,791
Tim... when did you get in town?

490
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:11,817
- How much for these here pipe cleaners?
- 10 cents, for you.

491
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:14,900
Has it gone up?
Used to be a nickel?

492
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:18,361
No ma'am... Old Zeke 'll be
mighty pleased with 'em, ma'am

493
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:21,284
Tim just came back to show off
his city clothes.

494
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:23,167
Take a look at that fancy tie!

495
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:26,297
Seems like in the city, dollars grow faster
than beans in the field!

496
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:27,660
Don't bet on it!

497
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,613
Hey, I been lookin' all over for you...

498
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:32,292
Let's go over to Seamen's and I'll buy
you some beer and tell you all about it.

499
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,356
Brother, I'm with you any time
you'll buy me a beer.

500
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:36,275
Well Harmie... Nona and Jotty
are over at Doc Whites...

501
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:38,330
When they come over tell them
I'll be back in a minute, will you?

502
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,044
Yeah... I know what a minute means, when
you're drinkin' beer with old Timmy there.

503
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:45,262
How much for this pair of garters?

504
00:45:45,263 --> 00:45:47,559
You said Nona and Jotty's
over at Doc White's?

505
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,138
Yeah.

506
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:50,433
What's wrong, Sam?

507
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,550
Jotty's ailin'.

508
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:53,385
Ran into this Spring Sickness.

509
00:45:54,603 --> 00:45:58,395
Poor Nona... with a sick kid
she don't hardly get a wink of sleep.

510
00:45:58,396 --> 00:45:59,561
That's tough, man.

511
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:01,960
My ma came out to my place
yesterday, to help.

512
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,136
Harmie brought her out in his truck.

513
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:06,488
That's kind of a relief.

514
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:17,269
Slow down!

515
00:46:25,975 --> 00:46:28,074
Would you be interested in coming
and work in the factory with me?

516
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:30,226
Are you crazy?
What would I do in a factory?

517
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:31,245
I'm a farmer.

518
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,097
Well, they just opened a new plant
and they're just cryin' for men.

519
00:46:34,098 --> 00:46:35,821
Don't even have to be skilled.

520
00:46:35,822 --> 00:46:38,760
I know the foreman...
I can get you in a minute.

521
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:40,088
Pay much?

522
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,003
Seven bucks a day!

523
00:46:43,862 --> 00:46:44,871
Seven bucks a day!?

524
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,800
Howdy gents... what'll it be?

525
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:52,882
Ain't you new here?

526
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:53,639
What'll it be?

527
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,875
OK, big-shot...
2 bottles of beer.

528
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:58,329
Sure is hot in here...
what about a beer for me?

529
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,656
I'm mighty thirsty.

530
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:02,456
Why don't you ask your papa here...
He gets it wholesale.

531
00:47:02,457 --> 00:47:05,060
Oh, him! This ain't one of his good days.

532
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:07,317
Must've got out of bed
on the wrong side!

533
00:47:08,707 --> 00:47:10,136
Well I got out on the right side...

534
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:11,587
Bartender... another beer.

535
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:15,216
Handsome... ain't I seen you
some place before?

536
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,678
Nuh... what'd you say?

537
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,961
I asked you... ain't I ever seen you
some place before?

538
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,557
Could be... I don't know.

539
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:23,843
You in town all alone?

540
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:24,858
Oh, no ma'am...

541
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:26,443
Like you see, I'm with my friend here...

542
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,573
And my wife's waitin' for me
at Harmie's store.

543
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:30,883
- So you got a wife?
- Yep... I got a wife.

544
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:34,785
There's some that got wives
and they're still nice and... friendly.

545
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:37,202
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I was studyin' about somethin'.

546
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:39,731
Let's go down the end of the bar, pal...
we can't talk here.

547
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:41,286
Excuse me, ma'am.

548
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,214
I ain't got no wife waitin' for me, baby...
How about a date tonight?

549
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:47,668
You big pig!

550
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:49,639
You know what you can do
with your date.

551
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,576
OK... OK, baby...
We'll talk about it later.

552
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:01,041
To your kid, Sam!

553
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,367
Seven bucks a day, eh?

554
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,375
So it's "yes"... you'll come?

555
00:48:07,376 --> 00:48:09,111
Don't rightly see how I can, Tim...

556
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:10,471
I made a deal with Ruston...

557
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,786
I already got some credit
from his commissary.

558
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:15,402
At $7 a day it wouldn't take you long
to pay him back.

559
00:48:15,403 --> 00:48:16,738
Yeah, but I'm tellin' you Tim...

560
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:19,146
This is the first time I been able
to farm my own crop...

561
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,809
Just like I always wanted to.

562
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,128
Ain't somethin' I can give up,
just like that.

563
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:24,824
Well, how much can you get
on your credit.

564
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:27,382
Man, with that there ground I got...

565
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:29,338
it'll be the finest crop
in the country.

566
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,492
What does that mean...
"The finest crop in the country"...?

567
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:33,981
With any luck at all I can make
2 bales an acre.

568
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:35,713
How much does that make for you?

569
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:36,699
More 'n 50 bales.

570
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,153
No, I mean how much money?

571
00:48:38,154 --> 00:48:41,030
Do you know that on that ground
that I been workin' on now...

572
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:45,284
Old man Corinth made a fortune
in the last cotton boom... a real fortune.

573
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:47,052
So that's the idea!

574
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:49,366
All you farmers is just the same...

575
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:50,583
Gamblers!

576
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:52,436
That's what you all are...
to a man.

577
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:55,245
Year after year
you starve yourself to death...

578
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:56,862
and hope that some fine day...

579
00:48:58,642 --> 00:49:00,169
Well... I think you're loco!

580
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:02,516
Me, I'd rather be safe, first.

581
00:49:02,517 --> 00:49:04,894
Me... I'd rather work in my field.

582
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:08,426
I feel better that way...
I feel more free.

583
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:10,048
Free?... Free?

584
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:12,989
Man, with money in your pocket,
you're as free as the wind.

585
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:16,585
With this... you want a good meal...
you go to a restaurant.

586
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,238
Good room... you go to a hotel.

587
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,141
All you gotta do
is flash your greenback...

588
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:21,420
You get anything you want.

589
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,976
You call that free,
sweatin' from mornin' 'til night?

590
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:28,161
In the bakin' hot sun,
workin' in them fields!

591
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,249
Oh, I'll allow as how
it's sometimes pretty hard.

592
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,807
What I mean is, being able
to decide things for myself...

593
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,904
To know I can choose my
own time about plantin'

594
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,000
and ploughin' and
harvestin' the crop.

595
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:43,849
That I can do it all in my own way...
and don't have to answer to nobody.

596
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:46,916
I mean for me alone
being accountable for it.

597
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:51,193
Whether the weevils strip you clean...
or you get the best price.

598
00:49:52,124 --> 00:49:54,086
Instead of all that baloney...
that means no?

599
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:56,223
Afraid so, Tim.

600
00:49:56,224 --> 00:49:59,032
Well, pal... I think you're
makin' a big mistake.

601
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:02,849
Hey, bartender... where's my other $4?

602
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,109
What $4?

603
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,698
I gave you a $5 bill.

604
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:08,799
Oh, no... Lizzy... you seen that was a $1.

605
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,087
Of course I did.

606
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:16,106
And the pretty boy
who's goin' home to his wife...

607
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:17,436
He seen it, too.

608
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:21,051
Well I'll be doggoned!
So that's how it is!

609
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:23,505
Nothing but a hicky old farmer...

610
00:50:23,506 --> 00:50:26,335
and yet the girls fall for you
like a ton of bricks!

611
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:30,368
What the heck have you got
that I can't buy with my dough?

612
00:50:33,955 --> 00:50:37,581
Give me my $4, you big double-jointed son
of a skunk, or I'll tear this joint apart!

613
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:38,856
Outside!

614
00:50:39,156 --> 00:50:42,315
OK brother... but I hope it's gonna
be worth the $4 to you.

615
00:50:48,616 --> 00:50:49,386
What do you aim to do?

616
00:50:49,387 --> 00:50:51,567
I ain't asking you to help, Sam...
you got a family.

617
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:53,677
I wouldn't start any more trouble, Tim.

618
00:50:53,678 --> 00:50:54,694
Don't stay here, Sam.

619
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:56,830
This'd have to cost you
more than $4.

620
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:59,048
I'm asking you as a
friend not to stay here.

621
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:52,645
Milk and greens...

622
00:52:57,546 --> 00:53:00,072
That doctor man done said about Jotty.

623
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:04,377
I'd like to see some of them
damn vegetables to grow.

624
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:08,716
Where he figure we're gonna
get that there milk from.

625
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:12,166
Out of the sky... just like that!

626
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:27,606
Seems like Sam ain't the only
pig-headed one around here.

627
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,511
That ma of his!...

628
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:34,412
Thinks she can cure the Spring Sickness
with fresh air!

629
00:53:36,636 --> 00:53:38,937
A widow-lady her age
ought to have better sense.

630
00:53:39,452 --> 00:53:44,653
Me? I say that baby 'll just catch
its death in this here wind!

631
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:51,619
I'm gonna get that milk.

632
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,550
Poor Sam!

633
00:53:58,003 --> 00:54:00,809
Men in this here Tucker family
just ain't strong.

634
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:05,689
No sir... it's just like
I told you Tucker...

635
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,038
I don't need no extra help.

636
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,133
I got Finlay and my girl Becky.

637
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:14,304
Too bad about your boy...
I know how what that is...

638
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:15,823
Sick kid is pretty sorrowful.

639
00:54:16,614 --> 00:54:18,013
Pitch it in Becky!

640
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:27,204
Like I told you before, it's wrong for
a man to get too big for his breeches.

641
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:30,094
When you got no money,
you work for them what's got it...

642
00:54:30,095 --> 00:54:31,199
That there's the rule.

643
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,903
Why don't you go back to Ruston...
get your 6 bits a day...

644
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:38,186
Some milk for your chap...

645
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,681
and maybe some doctor, even.

646
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:43,568
About the milk, like you see,
I can't rightly spare a drop.

647
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,076
Me? I got no milk for m'self...
It's all for the pigs.

648
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:48,356
Pour the rest in, Becky.

649
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:50,390
Finlay... bring the drain.

650
00:54:55,312 --> 00:54:58,493
Your cotton? Coming along?
Not too many bugs?

651
00:54:58,494 --> 00:55:00,267
I seen you the other day in field...

652
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:02,790
You were shavin' the cotton
so close to the ground with the plough...

653
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:03,818
You scared me!

654
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:06,381
Still that's the best way
to get rid of the bugs...

655
00:55:06,382 --> 00:55:08,734
Rolls 'em right out in the sun...
The heat kills 'em...

656
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:10,021
Better than any poison!

657
00:55:10,022 --> 00:55:12,840
But you gotta have a good eye
and a steady hand.

658
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:15,669
You're a good worker alright, Tucker.

659
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,170
If I was you,
I wouldn't think twice...

660
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:20,208
I'd go back to work for Ruston.

661
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:23,512
If I wanted to give up,
I wouldn't have to go back to Ruston.

662
00:55:23,513 --> 00:55:25,629
Got somethin' better?

663
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,116
Yeah... lots better.

664
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,683
But like I already done told you...

665
00:55:29,684 --> 00:55:32,383
I want to grow my own crop...
and I aim to do it.

666
00:55:32,384 --> 00:55:34,180
Well, if you're so sure of yourself...

667
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:36,917
why are you always coming around
asking your neighbours for help?

668
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,762
I never asked you for anything.

669
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:43,787
Likely, some old-fashioned idea
I had about neighbourliness...

670
00:55:47,026 --> 00:55:48,763
Take good care of them pigs.

671
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:50,573
That's sure what I'm gonna do.

672
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:53,743
See that that black hog eats
all his dinner, do you hear?

673
00:55:55,479 --> 00:55:57,145
So long, Devers.

674
00:56:07,543 --> 00:56:08,986
Sam! Sam!

675
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,408
Here... take this...
It's for Jotty.

676
00:56:18,635 --> 00:56:19,435
Thanks, Becky.

677
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:21,508
I can get you some more
if you want some more.

678
00:56:21,509 --> 00:56:22,877
My daddy won't have to see.

679
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:24,082
I'm much obliged, Becky...

680
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:26,469
and I'll take it, coz my
boy's really bad off.

681
00:56:26,612 --> 00:56:27,572
But I'll pay you for it.

682
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:30,343
Becky... I seen ya...
I seen what ya done!

683
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:32,586
I feel just like breakin'
somebody's neck today.

684
00:56:32,587 --> 00:56:34,261
I'm gonna tell your pa
you was stealin' his milk!

685
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:37,342
I knowed you was hackin' after this
fella... I saw you lookin' at him, before.

686
00:56:37,505 --> 00:56:38,425
I'm gonna tell your pa!

687
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:40,770
What did you do that for?!

688
00:56:40,771 --> 00:56:43,064
I'm never going to speak to you again.

689
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:44,791
If I see you talkin' to HIM again...
you'll be sorry!

690
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:45,850
Yes, Finlay?

691
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:51,883
Don't fret, Becky...
You're a good gal.

692
00:56:51,884 --> 00:56:52,960
Thanks just the same.

693
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:27,408
Honey...

694
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:41,296
Nona...

695
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:48,596
Nona...

696
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:51,060
I can't listen to him cry no more!

697
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:33,794
Oh Lord, how come you put the sky up there
and this old mud down here.

698
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:37,389
Made it so purdy if You didn't want us
to work it... to love it...

699
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:40,574
Do You want me to give all this up?

700
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:44,009
Move in town with Tim
and work with him in a factory...

701
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:47,042
Under a roof as high as your sky...
and puts out your light?

702
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,066
Tell me Lord... help me to know.

703
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:19,465
How are you lady?
Did you have a good trip?

704
00:59:19,466 --> 00:59:21,333
She had a fine trip...
She's a wonderful old girl.

705
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:22,315
Did you have a good trip, Timmy?

706
00:59:22,316 --> 00:59:25,166
You know Harmie, a cow's the only thing
I left in the country...

707
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,302
that I miss in the city.

708
00:59:26,303 --> 00:59:31,507
Believe me that sweet old gal is a lot
gentler than that Lizzy at the saloon.

709
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:33,427
Harmie, can milk the cow now?

710
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:34,612
Of course you can.

711
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:42,138
That Harmie!

712
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:46,940
He'll come waggin' in here one of
these days with a boa constrictor.

713
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:49,375
I wouldn't be one mite surprised.

714
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:15,255
I'm gonna call her...
"Uncle Walter".

715
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,644
Our vegetable garden!

716
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:37,325
That's Finlay... and them's Devers cattle!

717
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:28,550
Oh, Jotty!

718
01:02:37,704 --> 01:02:39,104
You go on back in the house, Honey.

719
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,427
Go on back in the house.

720
01:02:54,518 --> 01:02:56,031
Finlay! What do you know about this?

721
01:02:56,032 --> 01:02:56,989
I don't know nothin'!

722
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,606
I didn't do it!

723
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,667
No... not by yourself...
but we both know who did!

724
01:03:00,668 --> 01:03:02,249
C'mon... we're goin' to your place.

725
01:03:16,856 --> 01:03:18,180
Devers... look at me...
Why did you do it?

726
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:20,542
What you mean why did I do it?
You can't prove nothin'...

727
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:22,198
The Law 'd call it an Act of God!

728
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,851
As for your garden...
you can plant it again, can't you?

729
01:03:24,852 --> 01:03:25,841
Plant it again!?

730
01:03:25,842 --> 01:03:27,697
Or did you come to borrow some seed?!

731
01:03:27,698 --> 01:03:28,469
I wouldn't borrow...

732
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,408
Wait a minute!

733
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:33,196
This rope's plumb ruined...

734
01:03:33,197 --> 01:03:36,055
Remember what we agreed on
when you first come and asked for water?

735
01:03:36,376 --> 01:03:38,776
Yeah... about replacin' it...
It's time for you to do it now...

736
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,542
I don't aim to use this one no more.

737
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:43,823
And I'm sick and tired of you
comin' around askin' for water.

738
01:03:44,669 --> 01:03:47,017
And now Devers,
I'm gonna break your neck!

739
01:03:51,818 --> 01:03:54,404
I'm mighty glad you started this, Tucker.

740
01:03:55,605 --> 01:03:57,382
Specially with Finlay here
as a witness.

741
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:01,389
That makes two of us
can talk to the law.

742
01:04:50,996 --> 01:04:52,238
Pa... don't!

743
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,558
Shut your mouth...
Get back in the house!

744
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:29,344
You'd like to see me leave here,
wouldn't you?

745
01:05:29,345 --> 01:05:30,111
Yeah!

746
01:05:30,112 --> 01:05:31,598
- Why?
- Course I would!

747
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,686
What did I ever do to you?

748
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:34,967
Like I told you first time
you come to ask for water...

749
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:38,279
Just don't like to see folks
tryin' to be better than they are.

750
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,532
This world has got to be them that
gives orders and them that takes 'em.

751
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:44,351
And you figure it's you to give 'em
and me to take 'em... That right?

752
01:05:44,352 --> 01:05:45,149
Why?

753
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,882
Coz I worked hard... all my life.

754
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:48,579
I worked hard too...
You know that!

755
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,494
Why here, and not someplace else?

756
01:05:50,495 --> 01:05:53,179
Before you come,
I was alone in this place...

757
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,474
Everything was mine!

758
01:05:54,475 --> 01:05:57,277
I was figuring on buying your farm...
It was cheaper then.

759
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:01,073
Now, if things goes on like this,
everything's going to be yours.

760
01:06:01,074 --> 01:06:03,778
All I ever see is you...
everywhere I go!

761
01:06:03,779 --> 01:06:07,403
In the woods... killin' the varmints...
at the river, catching the fish.

762
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:11,423
Even Finlay told me...
you set a line for "Lead Pencil".

763
01:06:11,424 --> 01:06:14,022
And my girl Becky...
You heard what she said!

764
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:15,384
Sam!... Sam!

765
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:31,104
Sam...

766
01:06:31,105 --> 01:06:34,588
Sam... you better take care
of that cut.

767
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:39,427
Go on back in the house, Becky...
you best not bother about me anymore.

768
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:52,403
Finlay!

769
01:06:54,464 --> 01:06:55,643
Get my gun!

770
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:14,511
Uncle Henry!

771
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:18,118
Shut your mouth!

772
01:08:00,204 --> 01:08:01,193
Holy smokes!

773
01:08:02,269 --> 01:08:03,228
It's "Lead Pencil"!

774
01:08:31,936 --> 01:08:32,778
Can I help you?

775
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:34,406
You can grab hold of that line.

776
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:48,229
Finlay, you was right...
His whiskers is as big as lead pencils.

777
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:51,169
Tucker...

778
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:53,485
That's my fish.

779
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:56,099
So you own the river, too, eh?

780
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,375
Well, maybe the law will call
my hook and line an Act of God.

781
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:02,268
You give me the fish and swear
never to say you caught it...

782
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:04,685
I'll give you a dollar.

783
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:07,683
I don't want your dollar...
My folks likes fish.

784
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:11,036
Well, alright... let me take it
and keep it for a day or two...

785
01:09:11,037 --> 01:09:12,414
..and show it at the store... and...

786
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,206
Then you can have it back.

787
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:17,275
Folks likes fresh fish, Devers.

788
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,961
Well, let me take it, and...

789
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:23,796
You can use out of my garden.

790
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:29,478
Well, you can have
the whole garden.

791
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:33,749
The well rope...
How we gonna draw water?

792
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,900
Oh... I got another rope
in the barn.

793
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:39,368
What happened, Sam?
Becky told me...

794
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:40,355
It ain't nothin'...

795
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:43,656
I was just helpin' Devers pull
this big old catfish out of the river.

796
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:45,634
He done caught "Lead Pencil".

797
01:10:09,152 --> 01:10:10,458
We forgot to tell you.

798
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:12,507
Yeah... we plum forgot!

799
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:15,129
You tell 'em, Harmie.

800
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:18,635
Well... we're gonna get married, Sunday...

801
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:22,423
I was just thinkin'
how blessed the Tuckers is...

802
01:10:22,424 --> 01:10:24,281
and I can't help wonderin' why.

803
01:10:25,329 --> 01:10:26,914
I get the man I want...

804
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,594
Here we are... all together...

805
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,539
Jotty's cured and happy
once more...

806
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,414
Daisy's so good at her book learnin',
she's gonna get a prize at school...

807
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,915
Sam's growed the best crop
in the county.

808
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:50,868
Maybe even gonna buy his own place,
that's what he makes off on it.

809
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:58,022
I keep studyin' why Almighty
blessed us Tuckers so generous.

810
01:10:58,727 --> 01:10:59,862
But I reckon I know.

811
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,160
Coz of Sam, and the way
he worked that farm o' his...

812
01:11:04,235 --> 01:11:06,059
that crop he done growed

813
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:08,464
He must be just where the Lord
wanted him to be.

814
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:09,514
You're sure right!

815
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,182
Only if Sam is like he is, it's because
he's got such a good ma!

816
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:15,866
I can't think of nobody I'd rather have
than Harmie for my pa!

817
01:11:17,049 --> 01:11:19,818
He, son! You ain't a baby no more...
Leave your ma alone!

818
01:11:19,819 --> 01:11:20,706
She's mine now!

819
01:11:20,707 --> 01:11:22,200
Oh, she's yours is she?

820
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,353
What do you think you are...
an Indian chief?

821
01:11:26,764 --> 01:11:28,252
Let me kiss the groom!

822
01:11:28,253 --> 01:11:31,494
These kids don't know anything...
they ain't had our experience.

823
01:11:32,174 --> 01:11:34,026
Hey, Harmie...
now that you're married...

824
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:35,814
I suppose you'll be
going on the wagon, eh?

825
01:11:35,815 --> 01:11:39,618
I was just thinkin'...
I'd start that tomorrow.

826
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:41,800
But it ain't tomorrow yet!

827
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:45,805
Say Sam... c'mon!

828
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:46,923
Come on everybody!

829
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,846
When we get rich...

830
01:11:57,782 --> 01:11:59,738
When our ship comes in...

831
01:12:00,622 --> 01:12:04,368
I want us to get one of them
talking machines!

832
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:06,211
And a lot o' sacred records.

833
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:13,415
I want sit on the gallery...
and drink lemonade with ice in it!

834
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:17,462
And hear "Beulah Land", you know?

835
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:19,915
<i>Sweet Beulah Land...</i>

836
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:22,876
<i>Sweet Beulah Land...</i>

837
01:12:22,877 --> 01:12:27,134
<i>As on thy highest mount I stand,</i>

838
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,164
<i>I look away across the sea,</i>

839
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:31,591
Say Harmie...

840
01:12:31,592 --> 01:12:34,112
You sure you didn't catch cold, that night?

841
01:12:34,113 --> 01:12:36,353
Don't you know this is
just the stuff to keep you warm?!

842
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:39,018
Hey Harmie...
weren't you afeard of the law?

843
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:39,905
Are you kiddin'?...

844
01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:42,032
The law is right there, waitin'
for the finished product.

845
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:46,379
Hey Sam... come on...
I want to show you somethin'.

846
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,302
<i>Rye whisky, rye whisky,
rye whisky I cry...</i>

847
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,153
Don't worry, I've got us a third!

848
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:00,573
It's real city-stuff, Sam...

849
01:13:00,574 --> 01:13:02,555
Same as they drink
in them hot-shot nightclubs.

850
01:13:02,556 --> 01:13:03,969
Lay your nose on that!

851
01:13:04,403 --> 01:13:06,051
Smell it, Sam... smell it!

852
01:13:07,233 --> 01:13:08,305
Ain't that somethin'!

853
01:13:08,776 --> 01:13:09,560
Sure is!

854
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:10,645
3 bucks a quart!

855
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,620
We're gonna dance now, folks!

856
01:13:14,634 --> 01:13:16,987
Oh, I gotta find a good
hidin' place for this!

857
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,244
Oh, there you are, Sam!...

858
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:24,921
Come on honey...
you dance with me.

859
01:13:24,922 --> 01:13:26,931
No, you're very nice, ma'am...
but thanks just the same.

860
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:29,435
After the dance we could
go outside, honey...

861
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:31,489
I got some mighty fine drinkin' whisky
in my car.

862
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,125
Thank you ma'am,
but I got a partner.

863
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,281
How about dancin' with me, honey-child?

864
01:13:36,282 --> 01:13:38,060
And after the dancin'
go out to your car?

865
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,712
Well, I don't know about that!

866
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:41,614
C'mon now... don't be like that.

867
01:13:45,768 --> 01:13:47,397
<i>Promenade single file...</i>

868
01:13:47,398 --> 01:13:49,137
<i>Ladies in the lead, that Indian style...</i>

869
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:51,056
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

870
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,123
<i>Promenade single file...</i>

871
01:13:54,124 --> 01:13:55,726
<i>Ladies in the lead, that Indian style...</i>

872
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:58,074
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

873
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:01,306
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

874
01:14:02,088 --> 01:14:04,031
<i>First and third lead to the right...</i>

875
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:05,756
<i>Chase the rabbit, chase the squirrel...</i>

876
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:07,307
<i>Chase that pretty girl 'round the world...</i>

877
01:14:07,308 --> 01:14:08,988
<i>Chase the possum, chase the coon...</i>

878
01:14:08,989 --> 01:14:11,005
<i>Chase that pretty boy round the moon...</i>

879
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,932
<i>Four hand up and around you go...</i>

880
01:14:13,933 --> 01:14:15,558
<i>Round and round and don't be slow...</i>

881
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:17,195
<i>Away he's making a docey-doe...</i>

882
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:49,839
C'mon... get in there, folks.

883
01:15:02,386 --> 01:15:03,572
Granny... mind what you're doin'...

884
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:05,095
I got my bottle in there.

885
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:30,366
Serves you right!

886
01:15:30,937 --> 01:15:32,757
Well, it cost me 3 bucks.

887
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:37,453
Oh, so you think it's a joke, eh?

888
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:52,364
The winner!

889
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,486
The winner!

890
01:16:50,508 --> 01:16:52,582
Best wedding I was ever at.

891
01:17:23,216 --> 01:17:25,802
It's raining. What's gonna happen
to our cotton?

892
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:32,169
Sure is a bad time
for rain to come.

893
01:17:34,085 --> 01:17:35,741
Better get us all back inside.

894
01:17:36,355 --> 01:17:38,237
No good for us to get wet.

895
01:19:08,716 --> 01:19:09,510
Sam!

896
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:11,462
Sam!

897
01:19:13,196 --> 01:19:14,571
Sam... wake up!

898
01:19:22,717 --> 01:19:24,542
We've got to go home!

899
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,168
Oh, Sam!

900
01:20:53,294 --> 01:20:55,619
I ain't gonna stay here
a minute longer.

901
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,321
Not even a decent place to sit.

902
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:04,741
I'm gonna take this old carcase direct
to the cemetery and await my Maker!

903
01:21:09,582 --> 01:21:12,619
I never thought you'd treat
your old granny like this!

904
01:21:13,968 --> 01:21:15,890
Sam Tucker...
You're a criminal!

905
01:21:27,692 --> 01:21:28,611
Granny!

906
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,160
You stay here!

907
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:34,765
Times like this,
folks got to stick together!

908
01:21:35,114 --> 01:21:37,341
You'll stay here
with the rest of us!

909
01:21:38,379 --> 01:21:39,222
Hey, Sam...

910
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:42,624
Boy, it's good and ruined Tim.

911
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,522
Well... gotta go find Uncle Walter.

912
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,257
Alright... I'll stay...

913
01:21:53,258 --> 01:21:55,482
Coz you're trappin' me
like you always do!

914
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:58,889
You're strong, and you're the boss.

915
01:21:59,842 --> 01:22:04,261
What can an old decrepit granny do
agin the likes o' you?

916
01:22:04,262 --> 01:22:07,494
Come on... back to the house...
we got work to do.

917
01:22:23,415 --> 01:22:24,766
Where do you reckon
she might be?

918
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:27,436
Ain't no tellin...
But I just gotta find her, Tim.

919
01:22:28,272 --> 01:22:30,272
Pasture down there by the river
is all under water.

920
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:32,323
Sure hope she ain't in that river...

921
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:34,340
Ain't no cow worth gettin' drowned for.

922
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:36,584
Not asking you to help, Tim.

923
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:39,571
I'll go with you.

924
01:23:16,822 --> 01:23:17,961
There she is!

925
01:23:21,614 --> 01:23:23,215
I'll go over and get her.

926
01:23:23,216 --> 01:23:24,591
Why don't you wait
until the water goes down?

927
01:23:24,592 --> 01:23:25,845
The river'll never stop rising.

928
01:23:25,846 --> 01:23:27,165
OK boy, I'll give you a hand.

929
01:24:23,549 --> 01:24:24,667
OK?

930
01:24:24,668 --> 01:24:25,685
OK, boss.

931
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:26,882
OK... I'm goin' on alone.

932
01:24:26,883 --> 01:24:28,880
Oh no... I'm goin' along with you.

933
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:29,828
You'll stay here.

934
01:24:39,497 --> 01:24:40,978
Sam!...

935
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:50,607
The current!... Help!

936
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:56,841
- OK, Tim?
- OK, boy!

937
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:17,475
I'm comin' to town with you, Tim.

938
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,857
Gather up my measly belongings
that's left...

939
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:23,189
and pack up my whole bunch
and get out!

940
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:26,352
All them fields and trees and the river...

941
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:27,972
I just can't look at 'em no more!

942
01:26:27,973 --> 01:26:29,912
I give 'em everything
I had to give... honest!

943
01:26:29,913 --> 01:26:31,357
And what did they give me back?

944
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:32,345
Nothing.

945
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,586
Nothing but trouble and misery.

946
01:26:35,767 --> 01:26:37,290
Be crazy to stick any longer...

947
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:38,703
A fella ought to know
when he's beat.

948
01:26:38,704 --> 01:26:40,054
When he ain't wanted on the place

949
01:26:40,055 --> 01:26:42,135
ain't nothin' for him to do
but to pack up and get out!

950
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:44,442
Come on... let's go.

951
01:27:14,025 --> 01:27:15,383
Sam!

952
01:27:15,384 --> 01:27:18,391
I can hardly believe
the house is still standin'.

953
01:27:22,078 --> 01:27:25,257
Sam, your gun is safe...
and lots of other things, too.

954
01:27:25,972 --> 01:27:28,901
Most of Jotty's vegetable jars
are still whole.

955
01:27:28,902 --> 01:27:30,424
Of course, the pictures
got kind of broke...

956
01:27:30,425 --> 01:27:33,462
But once I get 'em hangin' straight
on the wall, they won't look so bad.

957
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:42,702
Course, the worst thing of all
was the stovepipe...

958
01:27:42,703 --> 01:27:45,810
But I got it back up again,
and I think it'll work alright now.

959
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:47,986
How do you like that, Sam?!

960
01:27:48,603 --> 01:27:50,420
I like it fine, Honey.

961
01:27:51,318 --> 01:27:52,193
Hey, Sam Tucker!...

962
01:27:52,194 --> 01:27:53,499
You know what this 'minds me of?

963
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:58,680
'Minds me of 43 years ago,
with your grandpappy, Fayette.

964
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:01,298
Same thing happened to us.

965
01:28:01,299 --> 01:28:02,793
Only worse... much worse.

966
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:06,669
Our roof come clean to the floor, and...

967
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,697
our walls just plum caved in.

968
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,971
For a week we crawled in and out
on our hands and knees...

969
01:28:12,972 --> 01:28:14,892
like prey goin' down their holes.

970
01:28:15,795 --> 01:28:17,460
Oh, my fan!

971
01:28:21,007 --> 01:28:22,778
Old Fayette... he said...

972
01:28:23,326 --> 01:28:24,835
Never mind, Sugar...

973
01:28:24,836 --> 01:28:26,261
It could've been much worse...

974
01:28:26,262 --> 01:28:28,350
if the Indians attacked it!

975
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:46,070
Sam...

976
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:47,179
Yeah, what is it, Tim?

977
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,924
You said you was comin' to town
with me.

978
01:28:51,265 --> 01:28:53,706
Yeah... yeah, I said it.

979
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:56,665
You said it, but you ain't comin' now, eh?

980
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,907
I was so plum wore out for a while...

981
01:28:58,908 --> 01:29:01,025
I didn't seem to believe
in nothin' no more.

982
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:03,237
But now my clothes are startin' to dry...

983
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:04,478
I'm beginnin' to believe again.

984
01:29:05,254 --> 01:29:07,925
I guess that's the way the earth feels,
when she's wet.

985
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,368
But the sun'll start dryin' her out...

986
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:13,809
And she'll start callin' to me again
just the way Nona does sometimes.

987
01:29:16,305 --> 01:29:18,773
I knowed it all along,
you'd never leave this place.

988
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:22,525
If there was only one farmer
left on this earth...

989
01:29:22,526 --> 01:29:23,703
It'd be you.

990
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:25,253
Crazy kiddin', Tim!

991
01:29:25,254 --> 01:29:28,075
Them machines o' yourn... they're fine...
I realise that.

992
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:29,276
But you just can't eat 'em.

993
01:29:29,277 --> 01:29:33,088
Once in a while, you gotta have a
hunk 'o beef and a few ears o' corn

994
01:29:33,089 --> 01:29:34,738
to fill up your belly.

995
01:29:34,739 --> 01:29:37,000
Oh, you city folks are mighty smart...

996
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:39,992
But I'm afraid without us farmers,
you'd get kinda skinny.

997
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:43,964
And without us workers,
I just wonder what'd happen to you all.

998
01:29:44,828 --> 01:29:47,876
You're plough... sure didn't grow
on no tree.

999
01:29:47,877 --> 01:29:51,170
And your gun that you feed
your bunch with in the winter...

1000
01:29:51,171 --> 01:29:53,629
You didn't plant no seeds to get that.

1001
01:29:54,779 --> 01:29:57,026
Some day, like I hope
you get you a tractor.

1002
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:59,151
Where do you reckon that'll come from?

1003
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:04,430
Believe me, friend... it takes all kinds
to make up this whole world.

1004
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,374
You love your farm.

1005
01:30:07,171 --> 01:30:08,631
That's right. You stay.

1006
01:30:08,632 --> 01:30:10,613
I like to work in a factory.

1007
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:13,586
And that's why I come
to take you back with me.

1008
01:30:16,368 --> 01:30:18,485
Well... you know what I'm talkin' about.

1009
01:30:18,486 --> 01:30:21,652
I don't mean no harm...
I'd just like to help you.

1010
01:30:22,655 --> 01:30:25,188
Yeah... I know, Tim... thanks!

1011
01:30:28,225 --> 01:30:29,886
Coffee's all ready!

1012
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,416
I want honey! I want honey!

1013
01:30:41,417 --> 01:30:43,390
Boy, nothin' could taste better
than this!

1014
01:30:43,882 --> 01:30:46,926
I think this is the first time you've made
anything out of that old pot

1015
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:48,422
that was fit to drink, Nony!

1016
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:50,745
Thank you, Granny!

1017
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,166
Thank you, Honey.

1018
01:31:26,031 --> 01:31:28,111
Tomorrow I guess we'll be through
with the ploughin'.

1019
01:31:30,146 --> 01:31:33,390
As if we ever get through
with the ploughing!

1020
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:38,824
I'm goin' back to the house, and just
sit... and wait for my call to glory.

1021
01:31:44,134 --> 01:31:46,998
Yeah... spring's gonna come
a little early this year, Honey.

1022
01:31:48,178 --> 01:31:51,181
Yeah, I reckon we can start our seedin'
even before the twentieth.
