1
00:00:56,696 --> 00:01:00,633
- Unbelievable.
- I can't hold it much longer.

2
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:07,639
You've almost got the record.

3
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,175
Come on, 20 more seconds.
Hold on tight...

4
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,178
I think I'm about to pass out!

5
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,748
I can't!

6
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,159
Oh...

7
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,763
Mm... Oh, my God!
This is so good!

8
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,464
I put a little Cointreau in.

9
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,433
- Mm.
- That's the secret.

10
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:37,601
Mm. I have to
go in a minute,

11
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:40,206
- do you want to dance?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:43,875
# Just blows me away #

13
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:46,545
# Unskinny bop, bop #

14
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:49,181
# All night and day #

15
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:51,815
# Unskinny bop, bop, bop #

16
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,318
# She just loves to play #

17
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,724
# Unskinny bop
Nothing more to say #

18
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:02,630
# You look at me so funny #

19
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,234
# Love bite got you acting
oh so strange #

20
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:11,437
# You got too many
bees in your honey... #

21
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,340
You're a fucking
hot one, ain't ya?

22
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:19,783
Oh, I'm OK.

23
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:28,620
Check us out.

24
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:31,790
Can you... put that away?
You're scaring me.

25
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,226
Well, you should be scared.

26
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:37,862
It's a healthy reaction
to a big ass gun like this.

27
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,834
Yeah.

28
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,342
OK.

29
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:53,845
I'm going to go now, time's up.

30
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:56,481
I guess you've got to go.

31
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,485
OK.

32
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,554
I enjoyed your company!

33
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,290
I hope you come back!

34
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,858
Get me out of here.

35
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,727
OK, Otis, we're going.

36
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,773
We are going, right now.
Come on, honey.

37
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,741
- Hi, Dad.
- Beth! Bethanna...

38
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,844
- Hey.
- Hello.

39
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:30,681
- OK, what's up?
- I need to do something else.

40
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:32,518
What's wrong with
the pet sitting?

41
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,287
I never knew anyone who could
make so much off that.

42
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,621
Yeah, the money's good,

43
00:03:37,622 --> 00:03:40,525
but the pets are not
always that nice.

44
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,594
I'm burned out.

45
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:47,031
Take it from me, now is not the
time to put down a good job.

46
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:48,531
You still haven't
found anything?

47
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:49,835
No, nobody's buying cars.

48
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:51,536
Hell, they're
barely making them.

49
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:53,871
Well, it's more
than just my job.

50
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:56,875
I need like a big change.

51
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:00,879
I have to, I don't know...

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,882
I want stimulation.

53
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,685
And I want good money.

54
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:11,056
And I want a change of
scenery that's interesting.

55
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:16,594
OK... OK, let me think if I
know anybody over at the mall.

56
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,931
Yeah, it's not going to do it.

57
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:23,971
I want to move to Las Vegas
and be a cocktail waitress.

58
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,975
Beth Anne...

59
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:33,912
...goddamn,
that is a great idea!

60
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:36,547
Wow! Yeah, Oh...
Caesars Palace.

61
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,751
- That's where you got to get in!
- Caesars would be amazing!

62
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:41,440
Oh...

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,851
- I think the hot plate works.
- I'll take it.

64
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,155
Go! Go...
Oh, so close.

65
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,924
Go! Yes... Oh! Oh.

66
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,160
Please... Go on!

67
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,031
Hey. I advise you to
stop playing this thing.

68
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:01,697
Why? Am I in trouble
or something?

69
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,500
No, no. It's just...
You seem like a nice girl,

70
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,001
and flip's for retards.

71
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:07,905
Oh... OK.

72
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:10,741
- Thank you.
- No problem. Have a nice evening.

73
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,710
Hey, wait.

74
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:16,513
Do you know where I could find
a job as a cocktail waitress?

75
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:18,549
I think you pretty much
have to grab the tray

76
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,085
the exact second one of these
golden girls kicks the bucket.

77
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,653
This is a union town.

78
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:24,222
Take it easy.

79
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:26,995
Huh.

80
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:42,106
Why don't you strip?
It's good money.

81
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,076
Yeah, I don't think
I want to do that.

82
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:45,943
You've done it before, right?

83
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:47,912
Why do you say that?

84
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:50,582
- 'Cause it's kind of obvious.
- It is? Really?

85
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,622
Just to us girls in the club.

86
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:59,756
I just want to do something
exciting and different.

87
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:02,093
- I came here to...
- Yeah, change everything.

88
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:04,261
Hey, Holly, what about Dink?

89
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,832
- What's Dink?
- Doesn't he need anybody?

90
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,200
Well, that's kind of...

91
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,935
You know, I kind of
need to know someone

92
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:13,071
before I send them to Dink.

93
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,739
It requires a great deal
of trustworthiness.

94
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,677
Oh, my God, you guys...
I am super trustworthy.

95
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,990
All right.

96
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,657
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Dink?

97
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:37,932
I am Dink, yes.
You must be Beth. Come in.

98
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:42,066
So, how much do you
know about gambling?

99
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,936
Uh, I played some
Flip-It the other night...

100
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,638
How'd you do?

101
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,837
I was told it was for retards,

102
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:49,338
but I got really into it.

103
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:52,609
I might not trust you
with my money.

104
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,178
You're going to rob me and
go play Flip-It all night.

105
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,114
No, no, I'm not.

106
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,583
Come on, I need this Louisiana
game to stay under...

107
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:03,054
- Not for a little.
- So, you're a bookie.

108
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:06,323
Absolutely not.
Bookmaking's illegal.

109
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,859
I'm a gambler.
Everything I do here

110
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,726
is completely legal
in the state of Nevada.

111
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,197
So, do you play
poker or blackjack?

112
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:16,301
Some poker... blackjack,
not really gambling.

113
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,169
It's just no skill, no odds.

114
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,072
Just a racket for the
casinos to make money.

115
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:22,273
Well, my dad played
a lot of blackjack.

116
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,075
Sorry to hear that.

117
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,744
Ah, this San Francisco
line is way too high.

118
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:29,647
Look at something.

119
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,082
You see that little patch
of yellow skin right there?

120
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,585
- Nope.
- Well, maybe not in this light.

121
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,988
Anyway, I make my lines. Then
I compare them to the books.

122
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:39,691
- To the books?
- Sports books.

123
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:42,994
A sports book is where you go to
make a bet on a sporting game.

124
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,796
You can do that here in Vegas,

125
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:47,166
or you can do it online overseas,
but I gotta do it here.

126
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,801
So, I gotta send guys
that run and take the

127
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:51,802
money down there and
make the bets for me.

128
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:54,072
Maybe that's something you could
do, if you come down here to work.

129
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:58,075
I can't believe you can't see
this little yellow mark.

130
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,379
So, I specialize
in horse racing,

131
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,215
hockey and baseball, but
we bet on all sports here.

132
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:07,250
- Can I?
- NFL, NBA, the PGA,

133
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:10,354
NCAA Football, NCAA Basketball,

134
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:13,725
tennis, the WNBA,

135
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,193
Little League World Series,

136
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:17,228
the National Spelling
Bee Competition,

137
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,096
the Miss America Beauty Pageant,

138
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:22,200
the... Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Contest.

139
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:26,269
Pretty much anything,
always odds can be made.

140
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,106
That is a lot of stuff.

141
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:33,978
Yes, but all I have to do is make 55
percent, and I am very, very happy.

142
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:37,981
It's about time!

143
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:40,752
- You're both late.
- Construction!

144
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:43,921
- Hi...
- Beth, say hi to Frankie and Scott.

145
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,257
Hey, do not fall
in love with me.

146
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,226
- OK.
- - Don't believe a word he says.

147
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:51,129
Frankie is a much better
person than he seems.

148
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,263
Scott, on the other hand,
is the sensible one.

149
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,970
If you ever need me for
something and I'm busy?

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,204
I'm going to bet
this seven horse.

151
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:04,341
First time starter.
Could be a total zero.

152
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,077
- New York's moving big time.
- Call Jazz.

153
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,945
I wish you guys weren't late...

154
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,380
One-six-four
Ivy sixth race...

155
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,763
OK, here's what just
happened in New York.

156
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:28,832
They're moving their line, so now we're
trying to move our lines accordingly

157
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,969
to adjust for a couple of outs that
haven't moved their lines yet.

158
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,936
- You understand?
- Uh-uh.

159
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:35,138
The rules at Dink Inc.
are responsibility

160
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,074
to come on time is
job is number one.

161
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:39,041
Number two, keep your
head around the numbers.

162
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,379
You've got to
learn the numbers.

163
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,747
Very important to
get the numbers down.

164
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,415
Rule number three,
do not steal.

165
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,284
Most people fail
at one of those.

166
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:50,922
- Is that a guinea pig?
- That is my hamster, Jyrki.

167
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,290
I named him Jyrki Lumme

168
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,725
after the defenseman
from Vancouver Canucks.

169
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:57,295
- Oh.
- And that is my wife, Tulip.

170
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,497
She's on a cruise in
the Bahamas right now.

171
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:03,167
Dinky, Dinky. This nag you
bet on is coming up fast!

172
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:06,436
- Go, go, go...
- - Wow, wow, wow...

173
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:10,109
Come on! Come on...

174
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:27,992
You won!

175
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:30,161
- You won!
- Genius.

176
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:33,531
Just like that. Wow.

177
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,899
I have to pay
attention to this now.

178
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,537
Um, meet me at the
sports book at the Rio.

179
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:41,373
Eight AM sharp, OK?
Do you need some money?

180
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:42,874
- No.
- Everybody needs money.

181
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,549
Take it. OK? Bye.

182
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,057
- Thank you.
- Yeah, take it easy.

183
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:02,326
You're lucky if
Dinky hires you.

184
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:04,095
He's a good guy to work for.

185
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:07,398
He buys his crew
breakfast and lunch.

186
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,903
And how does a girl like you
get along with Dinky's wife?

187
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,237
I haven't met her yet.

188
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,406
- Is that right?
- - Hey, Dinky!

189
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:19,210
There she is! I thought I
scared you off yesterday.

190
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:21,479
Hey, I know you.
It's the Flip-It girl.

191
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,447
Oh, no. You're not
still playing Flip-It?

192
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:26,350
- No.
- Just do me a favor, go into the counter...

193
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:29,887
Belmont, race two. 50 dollars
quinella on the five and seven.

194
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,557
- And keep this for yourself.
- Oh no, I'll do it for free.

195
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,590
- I need to learn.
- Take the money.

196
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:37,228
He's on a roll.
You're struggling.

197
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:40,933
Take the money. Come on,
I'll walk you up there.

198
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,102
So...

199
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,871
...when someone
gives you their money,

200
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:49,008
it's a... a sign of trust.

201
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:51,275
You understand that, don't you?

202
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,210
Yeah, I understand.

203
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:56,047
Belmont, race two.

204
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:58,620
Fifty dollar quinella
for the five and the seven.

205
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,321
What?
I'm good with numbers.

206
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:05,623
Hm.

207
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:08,091
All these sports,

208
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:13,096
hockey, racing, football,
basketball, whatever.

209
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:17,969
Over there on the board are the lines
the casino is offering. The odds.

210
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,504
You can bet on anything.
Who wins, who wins by how much.

211
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:25,942
The team with the best finish.
Anything. Look, see?

212
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:30,480
Someone's laying a lot of money,
so the casino's changing the odds.

213
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:34,118
I make my money by working
out where they're wrong.

214
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:39,523
God, that was so exciting! And the
money, you won so much money!

215
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:42,960
I had a bad day yesterday.
The money's not that important.

216
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:44,029
Oh, well, that's what people
with money love to say.

217
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,463
You are good with numbers.

218
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,066
Yeah, I'm pretty good
with letters, too.

219
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,066
- What?
- Say a word.

220
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,538
- Lose.
- No, a long one.

221
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,407
Louisiana.

222
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,475
Double A, double I,
L, N, O with U.

223
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,913
- I don't get it.
- It's the letters of Louisiana,

224
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,647
put in alphabetical order.

225
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:04,949
- I know, it's weird, right?
- Do it again.

226
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,051
Well, give me a word.

227
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:11,024
- Suicide.
- C, D, E, double I, S, U.

228
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:15,229
That was amazing.

229
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,630
So, after Ohio,
I moved back to Florida again,

230
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:24,234
where my dad lives. And I got
a job in a Thai restaurant,

231
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:28,573
but when I broke up with
their son, they fired me.

232
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,379
- OK.
- OK.

233
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,216
What?

234
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:43,053
OK, so after I got fired,
I had to find another job.

235
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:45,956
And I found one in the paper.

236
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,058
And, it was...

237
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,360
...private dancing.

238
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:53,730
You know, going to clients
houses and stripping.

239
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:57,201
- Basically.
- OK.

240
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,969
And then also I had
a pornographic website,

241
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,436
which was pictures of me naked,

242
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:02,206
Photoshopped to look
like I was giving oral sex

243
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,475
to my twin and stuff.

244
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:07,744
Eventually, a few other
girls joined it, too.

245
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:10,380
Nobody knows about that.

246
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:14,250
- Nobody.
- You're a gonif.

247
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:18,288
Gonif. Yiddish for a
small time loveable thief.

248
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,992
You'll do very well
in this business.

249
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,061
Well, you don't think it's
something I should be ashamed of?

250
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,461
No, no. You're a kid.

251
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:27,465
You're just doing kid things.

252
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,768
I mean, it's dangerous.
Not that happy about that.

253
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,634
If my parents ever found out,

254
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:34,471
they would feel like they
have no idea who I really am.

255
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:38,308
I freebased a couple of times.

256
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:40,444
I never told my mom.

257
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:42,779
I was a bookie,
back in New York.

258
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,018
Harmless, but illegal.

259
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:49,253
As it turns out, I took some
bets from this guy in Detroit.

260
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:52,489
I never met him,
turns out he's a mob guy.

261
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,493
When they bust him, they go
through his phone records.

262
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:57,661
- They end up busting me.
- Did you go to jail?

263
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:01,297
No, a felony conviction, but I
was only in a halfway house.

264
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:04,402
But my mom was devastated.

265
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,707
At least she never thought
she had no idea who I am.

266
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,776
- OK?
- OK.

267
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,412
- OK, then.
- Oh, OK. Bye.

268
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,247
OK, bye.

269
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:20,518
All right, see you
in the morning.

270
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,154
- Don't be late.
- Wait! Are you hiring me?

271
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:27,792
- Still want the job?
- Yes! I want the job.

272
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,427
Then yes, I'm hiring you.

273
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:31,262
Hours are from 8 to 5,

274
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,330
you get four hours
off for lunch, 10 to 2,

275
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:36,633
Monday through Saturday,
Sundays we go all day, 8 to 4.

276
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,235
You get paid
20 dollars an hour...

277
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,571
- Really?
- ...Bonuses, vacations.

278
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,672
- Yes. And three meals.
- Really?

279
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:45,109
Oh, my God, yes, really.

280
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,380
Bye.

281
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:56,288
- OK.
- - All right, I'll call you back in 10.

282
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,289
Oh shit, shit's popping off!
Let's get ready to rumble!

283
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,393
OK, there's my
Minnesota, minus six.

284
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,728
Are you ready for
this, sweet thing?

285
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,097
- No, I don't get it.
- You don't get what?

286
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,666
This! All of it! How to do it.
You should fire me.

287
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,768
- No.
- Dink, Dink, Dink. Let me fire her.

288
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,270
I'm not going to fire you, OK?

289
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:17,274
I've just been talking to you too
much and you're mired in theory.

290
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,478
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
You are gonna make this bet.

291
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,644
Just use your phone,
pick it up. OK?

292
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,714
- We're gonna call...
- Try Top of the World, they're slow.

293
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:26,483
That's your speed dial for Top of the
World, you're going to call them.

294
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,786
It's a sports book
in Costa Rica.

295
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,721
Ask about Minnesota game, 224.

296
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:34,624
You lay the minus six,
but two dimes.

297
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,828
OK, hi. Six, four, six,
double D.

298
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:42,298
Uh, game 224, Minnesota.

299
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,335
OK, I'll take the
six with Minnesota.

300
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:47,337
- No, no, don't...
- What? What...

301
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:50,240
Don't say take. You're doing great.
You're doing great, OK?

302
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:53,677
Minnesota is the favorite, you don't
take the favorite, you lay the favorite.

303
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:57,347
OK, so we're going
to lay two dimes.

304
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:01,820
Hi. Actually, can I lay
the six for two dime?

305
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,624
Uh-huh. Six, four,
six, double D.

306
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,628
OK, OK.
Watch, now watch this.

307
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,662
Wait... Wait...

308
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:15,199
You see that?
Wait for it.

309
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,334
- And, boom.
- What?

310
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:19,304
- You just changed that line.
- I did?

311
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:21,572
Our $2000 bet just
moved those odds.

312
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:24,275
And that's what we did, OK?
You just made your first bet.

313
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:27,945
- For $2000?
- $2000.

314
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:33,816
The way the numbers keep
changing on the screen.

315
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:36,487
You just make it into
what you want it to be.

316
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:39,323
I don't know, it's the
first place that's ever

317
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:41,825
made any sense of
how my brain works.

318
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:44,728
Well, next thing you know he'll be
taking you to Magic's for game day.

319
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:46,797
We're going there on Sunday.

320
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,237
He asked the guys.
They couldn't come.

321
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:53,704
- Hey, you're not...
- What?

322
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,806
Are you?

323
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,776
God, no.

324
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:00,746
Mm-hm.

325
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,314
All right.

326
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:04,882
'Cause I wouldn't
if I were you.

327
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:07,851
If you last long
enough to meet Tulip,

328
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,688
- you'll know what I mean.
- Well, I'm not.

329
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,456
The thought never
entered my mind.

330
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:14,525
Mm-hm.

331
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:16,760
Dominic kicks...

332
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:23,767
- Hey, Dink!
- - Dinky!

333
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:25,903
Everybody meet Beth.

334
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:28,271
Dink Inc's newest employee

335
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:31,408
and Flip-It aficionado.
Say hi to everybody.

336
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,445
Hi.

337
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,280
I don't think your
friends like me.

338
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:38,515
They like you.

339
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:39,916
They like you.

340
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,551
They can just barely
tolerate women.

341
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,385
- Forgot about that.
- I got too much on the under.

342
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,622
- Anybody want a piece of this?
- I'll take two dimes.

343
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:47,026
- Done.
- How the fuck you got two dimes to bet on the game

344
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:50,729
when you ain't paid me back the
money from Saratoga, you fat fuck.

345
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:56,333
Dinky! I'm back!

346
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,501
- Uh-oh.
- Who is that?

347
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:01,505
Rosie, the bookmaker
from New York.

348
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:03,039
I thought that was illegal.

349
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,808
It is. Last year,
he went on a big broke.

350
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,345
I mean, I can't believe he'd
show his face here, broke.

351
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,581
Still owes me 70 grand.

352
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:12,316
Aren't you mad at him?

353
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:13,851
No, it's not
that kind of thing.

354
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:16,393
Oh...

355
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:23,326
I believe this is yours.

356
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,562
Me handing over to you,
now that is a switch.

357
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:27,731
Are you trying to tell me
I didn't beat you on Charlotte?

358
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:31,335
- Fair and square, Dink.
- Fair and square.

359
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,770
Wow. Can you put
this in your bag?

360
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,373
I just don't have enough room in
my pockets for all that money.

361
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:37,908
Dinky...

362
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:39,577
Did you know this man
is one of my heroes?

363
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:42,746
When I was 16 I wanted to
be Dink when I grew up.

364
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:45,048
A real classic thing...
What the fuck is that?

365
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,950
Is that a fucking ticker?

366
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,752
Holy shit! They still
have that service?

367
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:52,355
What is there a fucking mouse on
a treadmill inside that thing?

368
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,857
It gives you the latest
scores from when? 1997?

369
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,628
Still works for me.

370
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,970
I just won $114,000!

371
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:10,711
Oh, fuck you, Rosie.

372
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,412
Dinky, I had to
change my phone number.

373
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,514
This is my recent contact info.

374
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:20,918
My name is Troy Roseland,
you get to call me Rosie.

375
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,653
- Hi, I'm Beth.
- She works for me.

376
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,365
It's great seeing you, Dink.

377
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:41,805
Oh, hi... I'm Beth.

378
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:44,674
- You're Beth.
- Mm-hm.

379
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,012
Oh.

380
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,848
Did you have a nice time
on your boating trip?

381
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:54,050
Yes, yes. Beautiful.

382
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,586
Beautiful.

383
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,955
- So, who've you worked for?
- Oh, you mean where have I...

384
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:00,724
Have you ever
worked for a gambler?

385
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,727
No, no... but I'm loving
working for your husband.

386
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,929
He's so great,
honest, wonderful.

387
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,432
- Wonderful boss.
- So, who've you called so far for rundowns?

388
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,403
- Oh...
- That is the first thing you do

389
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:13,477
when you get to the office.

390
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,180
Um, minus two.

391
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,949
- There's nothing for me.
- No, Knox's line was better.

392
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,816
- I'll call him back.
- Forget it. We missed it.

393
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:29,654
We're already
on the other side.

394
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:33,431
I'm down $50,000 today.

395
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:41,498
You! Park it!

396
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:43,803
No more scores.

397
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:46,702
And that goes for you, too!

398
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:50,179
You stay put! I mean, both of
youse just stay put, you hear me?

399
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,979
Oh, no...

400
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,582
No!

401
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,050
Oh, touchdown, Dinky.
Twenty-nine seconds...

402
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:04,654
Oh, perfect!

403
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,656
- Tulip! You're a jinx!
- No, I'm not.

404
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:08,625
Either you're a jinx,
or God hates me.

405
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,728
You tell me which one it is.

406
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:13,730
Would you turn that thing off?

407
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:20,005
I'm gonna go broke this winter,
we're gonna have to sell a house.

408
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:25,576
- You say that every winter.
- Yeah, this year I know. We are gonna go broke.

409
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:28,479
And it's gonna sneak up on
us quietly, very quietly!

410
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,814
You know what?
I didn't come here for this.

411
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:34,998
I'm going to fit in some Pilates before golf.
I didn't come here for this.

412
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:48,000
I know something that'll
make you feel better.

413
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,768
- A bullet?
- No.

414
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,903
Chinese poker.

415
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,007
I haven't been doing
very good lately.

416
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:59,776
Oh, come on. You're just
having a little moment.

417
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:02,613
A slump. It's called a slump
and it's not getting any better.

418
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:06,922
And it doesn't help to
have a wife who's a jinx.

419
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:12,602
I deal with it as best I can.

420
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:27,137
Oh, this is good, this is good.
We need this field goal.

421
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:32,643
Hughes did very good in the first half.
Sit right here.

422
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,278
Oh, I did very well just now.

423
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,316
So, why didn't you go into the
stock market or something?

424
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:41,817
- It seems like the same thing.
- Stock market's a racket,

425
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:43,854
and I'd rather bet on
professional wrestling.

426
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:47,723
So, why don't you have your
own sports book somewhere?

427
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:51,627
The operators in Costa Rica sound
so nice and happy on the phone.

428
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:53,064
I bet it's beautiful
down there.

429
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:55,000
I went down to
San Jose one time.

430
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,568
It's not what you think when
you think of Costa Rica.

431
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:00,202
Very grim, very sad.

432
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:02,271
But you'd make so much
money from your own book.

433
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:05,675
Sure, yeah, but then I'd
have to live in San Jose.

434
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:07,678
You know, I could be
a lot richer in general

435
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,047
if I'd made most of my
decisions based on money.

436
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:12,848
My hugest defect.

437
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:18,960
No! No! That's what
makes you so... great.

438
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,060
I'm not so great.

439
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:27,698
- You what now?
- It was just hands!

440
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:31,101
With Dink? Are you
out of your mind?

441
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:35,037
God, I'm sorry I ever told you.

442
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,140
That's what you're sorry for?

443
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:40,043
Do you think I should
confess my love

444
00:25:40,044 --> 00:25:42,778
and see if he'll leave Tulip
and run away with me?

445
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,048
Do you have some kind of
fucked up thing with your dad?

446
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,720
No! God, my dad
was my best friend.

447
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:55,158
- We did everything together.
- Can you do me a favor?

448
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,329
Can you make sure Tulip never finds
out it was me who brought you around?

449
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:07,375
- Yes! Go!
- - Go, Berto!

450
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,742
I can't believe you
picked this Berto fight.

451
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:16,212
Oh, come on!
He is a stallion.

452
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:20,020
How could anyone lay odds on him
being out by the fifth round.

453
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,156
Plus, he trains around
the corner from my motel.

454
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:31,127
You could be my new
downtown sports consultant.

455
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:34,798
Sure, if you want me to.

456
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:49,445
Hi.

457
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:53,416
You have no fucking reason
to be out so late with her!

458
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,884
Tulip, every night you go
to bed at nine o'clock.

459
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:57,422
Now, just because
I have a new friend,

460
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:01,091
you're going to call me
up and... tell me...

461
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:02,893
You're making yourself crazy!

462
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:04,862
Come on, you're missing the
best part. Hang up on her.

463
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:07,831
Did I just hear
that little cunt?!

464
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:10,333
Tulip, you're
forcing yourself...

465
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:13,481
Fuck you, Dink!

466
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,783
I have to go home now.

467
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:29,152
She's losing her mind.

468
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:30,853
Just don't tell me
who wins this fight, OK?

469
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:33,257
No, come on. No, no, no. Come on.
Stay for one more round.

470
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:35,991
One more round.
She'll live.

471
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:40,230
Plus, I'm making you money.

472
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,838
I owe this guy Leon
down in Costa Rica, $80,000.

473
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,210
You're going to take this over to
a guy named Rudy at the Paris.

474
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:58,219
Take this to him and I'll be even with Leon.
It's $80,000. Count it.

475
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:03,987
...And then
race fourteen...

476
00:28:03,988 --> 00:28:05,955
No, no, make Frankie do the run.
We need Beth on the phones.

477
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:07,525
Oh what? Now Beth's better
than me on the phones?

478
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:09,191
Well, you said that, not me.

479
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:12,229
Now go fuck yourself, OK?
I never liked you.

480
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,232
It's OK, Dink.
I'll make the run.

481
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:18,934
Oh, for God's sake.
Stop sniffing money.

482
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,509
Jesus, I can't take this.

483
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:37,453
I'm gonna go work out
a little later,

484
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:40,356
and then I'm going to
go home and get a massage.

485
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:43,893
Uh, after you make this drop, you wanna
meet me over at Caesars parking lot?

486
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:45,495
Go get something to eat?

487
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:48,611
Uh-huh, sure.

488
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:35,211
I love you.

489
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:37,380
Oh...

490
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:40,049
So, what?

491
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,853
Never stopped anybody.

492
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:45,357
We had a deal.

493
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:49,497
We had a deal.

494
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:56,869
I can't believe
I have to say this.

495
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,971
All I was supposed to
do is take care of you.

496
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:05,345
And you take care of me.

497
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:10,215
That's why I picked you.

498
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:15,624
That was our deal.

499
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:23,970
I can't believe
you made me say this.

500
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,575
Look at this! Spring training
in lovely Scottsdale, Arizona.

501
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:41,443
Let's go!

502
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:44,250
- Beth.
- Mm-hm?

503
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,961
I have to fire you.

504
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,595
No crying.

505
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:04,133
This has been fun,
but it's just not good.

506
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:07,569
It's just not good. Tulip says
you're coming between us.

507
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:13,143
And she's right. So, do yourself a
favor and just take the money...

508
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,044
Why don't you
do yourself a favor,

509
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,013
and get rid of your
miserable fucking wife.

510
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,382
OK, out of the car.

511
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:24,554
You are so fun,
you love to have fun.

512
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:26,355
You do!
And you're wonderful,

513
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:28,224
and she doesn't want you
to have fun.

514
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:31,361
That's not true.

515
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:35,498
Look, come on.
Just stop crying.

516
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:38,468
Get out.
Get out of the car.

517
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:42,742
- OK!
- I'm a married man.

518
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:48,178
Why are you so afraid
of losing her?

519
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,348
She's not afraid
of losing you...

520
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:53,583
Beth...

521
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:57,554
It doesn't always help when someone
thinks you're the greatest,

522
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:00,526
and you don't think
you're the greatest.

523
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:05,763
Bye Beth.

524
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:08,702
Watch your toes.

525
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:14,671
# There you go baby #

526
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:18,040
# Here and now Well you #

527
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,277
# Left me here So I could #

528
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,079
# Sit and cry #

529
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,715
# Golly gee... #

530
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:30,252
Beth.
Come on, open up.

531
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:35,626
# I guess it doesn't
matter anymore #

532
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:39,662
# Do you remember, baby #

533
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:43,098
# Last September, how you #

534
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:48,704
# Held me tight
Each and every night #

535
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:54,309
# Oh baby,
how you drove me crazy #

536
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:59,356
# But I guess it doesn't
matter anymore #

537
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:11,227
Anyway, to hell with Dink.

538
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:13,162
- Fuck him.
- - Fuck him!

539
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,731
I mean, when you're
in love with somebody

540
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:17,700
you overlook certain things
but there would've been

541
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:20,502
a lot to overlook with Dink.

542
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,440
I mean, Tulip definitely
earns her money.

543
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:25,107
You don't clip
nose hair for money.

544
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:28,143
You clip nose hair for love.

545
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:30,447
Tulip loves him, girl.

546
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:33,868
- You want to hit the head?
- No, I'll wait here.

547
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:56,573
Hey, I just wanted to let you know
that this game is for retards.

548
00:33:56,574 --> 00:34:00,242
- Really?
- Yeah, it always looks like it's just about to fall,

549
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:02,544
but it never does,
that's the hook.

550
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:06,582
Huh. It's so well-designed.

551
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,721
Yeah.

552
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:12,697
OK.

553
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:23,399
Back on the horse?
Go Beth.

554
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,139
No, I was just saving him
from Flip-It.

555
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,573
But he was cute, right?
Sweet.

556
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:33,510
It was nice to talk to somebody
for a minute, who's not...

557
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,310
Yeah, I know.

558
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:37,379
- One of us?
- Yeah, who're you texting?

559
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,517
My shrink. He's got a tip
about a game tomorrow.

560
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:45,559
Hey, your boyfriend's looking over here.
The Flip-It guy.

561
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,428
The rooms here got Toblerone
candy in the minibar.

562
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,399
- Bring me back one in the morning.
- Stop it, shut up.

563
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,901
Bye.

564
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:01,337
I just have to make sure

565
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:03,906
that you got home OK.

566
00:35:03,907 --> 00:35:08,246
- Wait.
- Going down.

567
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:18,288
You should definitely, definitely
take me to your room right now.

568
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,224
Should we just talk
about this for one second?

569
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:22,457
- Why?
- Well, you are a little drunk.

570
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:25,395
Yeah, but it just makes me more
articulate about my feelings.

571
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:27,564
And right now,
I have a huge amount

572
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:29,866
of sexual tension
built up inside of me,

573
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:34,870
and I think you're very, very
handsome and really nice, and...

574
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,439
Can we be done talking now?

575
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,408
Yeah.

576
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,475
- Wait, are you single?
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:43,379
Come on, Ten!

578
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,283
Come on, Ten! Come on, baby!
Come on! Go!

579
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:50,920
Go! Go! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

580
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,993
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Back to one!

581
00:35:56,994 --> 00:35:59,361
Way to go, Dinky!

582
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:03,433
Way to come back
from Santa Anita!

583
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,670
- Yeah!
- Yes!

584
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,938
I didn't bet it.

585
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:09,973
What?

586
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:11,875
No, but you picked
the ten to win.

587
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:14,516
But then I didn't bet it.

588
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:20,851
Just get back to your phones,

589
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,584
and stay out of
my fucking bets.

590
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:24,356
The fucker!

591
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:28,524
One-point-two remaining.

592
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:30,027
They need to go
the length of the floor.

593
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:49,412
Oh, no!
Now I'm down 172.

594
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:51,382
And just for the last
five days, Scotty.

595
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:52,982
And nobody takes it seriously!

596
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:55,752
Where's Frankie?
We gotta make these runs!

597
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:57,687
He's at Celine Dion.

598
00:36:57,688 --> 00:37:02,292
On a Saturday? During the
NCAA Basketball playoffs?

599
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:04,326
That's when he's going
to Celine Dion?

600
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:06,562
During the
NCAA Basketball tournament?

601
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,463
Well, you told him
last week he could go.

602
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:10,465
It's the only show he could
get orchestra seats.

603
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:12,668
How many time does this guy
gotta go see Celine Dion?

604
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:14,403
Dink, maybe I should
just make the run myself.

605
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:16,440
Scotty, will you shut up?
No, we need somebody here

606
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,941
by 11, at least,
or today is a wash.

607
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:21,012
And this day was the only way I
had of making up for this week.

608
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:25,915
So, Jesus fucking Christ, God!

609
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:29,919
- Flagstaff Aaron.
- He's working for Dave the Rave.

610
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,953
- Call Holly.
- Uh...

611
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:33,589
I don't think it's a good idea

612
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,425
to send Holly out
with this kind of money,

613
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:38,493
I think it actually may be a bad idea.
Look, Dink.

614
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:40,097
I can do the run really
fast, get back here...

615
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,364
No, no.
These lines are changing.

616
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:45,637
I need you on the phone.
Just get Holly over here.

617
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,044
- This is baby oil.
- Yeah?

618
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:57,046
Why don't you use sun screen.

619
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,784
Because it screens the sun.

620
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:04,821
OK Holly, this is the $9,000
for the horses at Bally's.

621
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:07,556
- All right.
- Take this $31,000 over to the Golden Nugget

622
00:38:07,557 --> 00:38:09,591
and call me once
you get over there.

623
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:11,094
Gimme the line on Kentucky and
I'll tell you where to put it.

624
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:13,865
- OK.
- All right, hurry please.

625
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:20,370
- Unleashing a furious late kick...
- Get up.

626
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:23,705
...up on the outside, the tenth
lead in the shadow of The Liar.

627
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:26,042
- Mr. Jazz...
- Good?

628
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:27,877
So that's plus 80, right?

629
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:30,379
What line did Holly give
you on the Kentucky game?

630
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,948
She hasn't called yet.

631
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,783
What? What are you
talking about?

632
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:35,883
She hasn't called. I've
been trying her for an hour

633
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:37,753
and she's going
straight to voice mail.

634
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:38,020
You haven't talked
to Holly for an hour,

635
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:40,891
and you're just
telling me right now?

636
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,926
Call her back, Scotty.

637
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:45,962
- Call her back!
- Yeah, all right.

638
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:49,665
And I hope you're
precious Celine Dion

639
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,001
chokes on a wire
coat hanger tonight.

640
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:54,875
Huh?

641
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,475
Nothing. Sorry, man.

642
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,880
Still voice mail.

643
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,716
Dave the Rave's at Bally's.

644
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:08,887
I've been here since, like 11.

645
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:12,921
I ain't seen her, Dinky.

646
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:15,124
She was here.

647
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,826
She was watching the game.

648
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:18,995
She bet Toronto?!

649
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:20,898
Magic, is that
what you just said?

650
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:24,433
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.
- I got her.

651
00:39:24,434 --> 00:39:26,201
Oh, God...

652
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:29,974
Fucking asshole.
Come on, take it.

653
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:32,975
No, you didn't, no, you didn't!

654
00:39:32,976 --> 00:39:34,477
You did not get robbed, Holly!

655
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:36,879
What you did was take
$40,000 of my money,

656
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,850
and go and make a bet for yourself on Toronto.
That is what you did.

657
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:43,518
My shrink said
it was a sure thing.

658
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,925
God.

659
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:50,660
Just come back to the office.

660
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:52,861
I'm never coming to the office.

661
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:56,698
Jesus, Dink.
I should just fucking off myself, I should!

662
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:59,935
Don't do that, don't do that.
Just please,

663
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:03,072
come back to the office, Holly, and we'll
work out some kind of payment plan.

664
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,111
- Don't say it.
- I didn't say anything.

665
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:11,513
I could hear you thinkin' it.

666
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:16,019
Me? I wouldn't send Holly out with
money like that. She's just not...

667
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:21,025
- It's not like me or Frankie.
- Or Beth.

668
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:25,560
Yeah, you have to stay
here and watch the phones.

669
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:28,500
So, you...

670
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,966
...you...

671
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:34,803
...and Celine Dion,
and Beth are all fired.

672
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:37,073
So get out!
Get out!

673
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:40,843
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

674
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:43,882
God damn it!

675
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,261
- No way.
- Tulip, please.

676
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:01,264
Do you think I would even ask
for something like this,

677
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:03,832
unless I really
needed it desperately?

678
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,806
And what do I get?

679
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:11,818
Whatever you want.

680
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,854
OK, I'll get Otis,

681
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:27,556
and everything else goes in a laundry bag.
I'll be right back.

682
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:29,659
And you can really do this?
Just pick up and leave town?

683
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,794
Yes. That's what's so great about
living in a motel and getting fired.

684
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:34,763
If I didn't do this
I'd be crazy.

685
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:37,799
I can hear the logic rattling
around in there somewhere.

686
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,937
Uh-huh. Your trip back is going to be
a lot more fun then your trip out.

687
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:43,128
Of that, I am
completely assured.

688
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:09,799
Hi. What are you doing?

689
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,299
I was about to check out.

690
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,303
Good. This place is a dump.

691
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:18,876
- Where are you moving to?
- New York City.

692
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:23,346
When'd you decide that?

693
00:42:23,347 --> 00:42:25,385
About two hours ago.

694
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:30,657
I need you back.

695
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:37,926
- You were really mean to me.
- I know, I know.

696
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:39,862
I'm sorry,
it couldn't be helped.

697
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:43,165
But the way we were,
it just... wasn't going right.

698
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:48,738
We had to snap out of it,
but I need you back. Now.

699
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,305
And what about Tulip.

700
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:52,375
We worked it out.

701
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:57,879
We came to terms that
we could agree upon.

702
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,216
Unromantic terms.

703
00:43:00,217 --> 00:43:02,789
For me and you, yeah.

704
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,257
So, why do you want me back?

705
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,125
How could you even ask that?

706
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:12,160
Beth, you are
terrific with numbers.

707
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:15,864
You're great on the phone.
People love talking to you.

708
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:19,100
You keep your cool.
I trust you.

709
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:22,104
And you bring me good luck.

710
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:25,808
Beth, you are
crucial to Dink, Inc.

711
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,090
Isn't that enough?

712
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,223
- Hi...
- Is that a loan shark?

713
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:44,894
'Cause you could use me as a human shield,
but I'm not sure I could take him.

714
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:47,796
No...
He's not a loan shark.

715
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:50,098
I know.

716
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,401
Pretty sure that's
the famous Dink.

717
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:54,470
Yeah.

718
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:57,175
Not exactly what
I was picturing.

719
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:01,016
So, where's Otis?

720
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:08,984
Take this.
Put it on shuffle.

721
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:11,821
I thought you were over it.

722
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:15,491
I'm over him, but not over it.

723
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:17,260
I kind of thought
it was the same thing.

724
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:21,163
Yeah, I did too. But I just
found out that it's not.

725
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:24,335
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

726
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:28,037
Well...

727
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:32,010
- Call me sometime?
- I will.

728
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,178
I, I will.

729
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:39,056
Adios, muchacha.

730
00:44:47,056 --> 00:44:49,058
- Is she mad at me?
- No.

731
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:51,127
Not allowed to be.

732
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:52,894
What do you mean,
that was part of the deal

733
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:54,998
for me coming back to work?
She can't be mad at me?

734
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,866
Yeah, sort of.

735
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:58,201
So, what does she
get in the deal?

736
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:01,035
Jesus, how do you
know these things?

737
00:45:01,036 --> 00:45:03,272
Shopping spree?

738
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:06,107
I wish. Face lift.

739
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:08,209
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

740
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,351
I must really
mean a lot to you.

741
00:45:14,351 --> 00:45:16,954
I missed you.

742
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:20,855
Say you missed me, too.

743
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,924
I missed you, too.

744
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:25,896
We're friends, right?

745
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,501
Whatever.

746
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:36,418
I got to stop by and drop off
Jyrki's hamster food at the house.

747
00:45:48,418 --> 00:45:50,919
Go upstairs and say hi.

748
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,393
It's important.

749
00:45:56,393 --> 00:45:58,093
- OK.
- Be nice.

750
00:45:58,094 --> 00:45:59,413
Yeah.

751
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:47,311
Do not fuck my husband.

752
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:51,048
OK.

753
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:56,384
He says you're good luck.

754
00:46:56,385 --> 00:47:00,362
He told me he doesn't
really think you're a jinx.

755
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:10,366
The bag of frozen peas
in the cooler.

756
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,342
Stick it on my face.

757
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:23,182
Sorry.

758
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:38,127
Bethy!

759
00:47:38,128 --> 00:47:40,129
- Did you miss me, sweet stuff?
- Yes.

760
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:43,036
Hey, kid. Welcome
back, welcome back.

761
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:49,705
Five dimes on Miss Israel
and she can't make the top 10?

762
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:53,207
It's so good that you're back,
because things have just not been...

763
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,481
...good.

764
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,417
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing here?

765
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:05,187
Uh... I live here.

766
00:48:05,188 --> 00:48:07,455
That's what the fuck
I'm doing here.

767
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:10,058
- Where should I be?
- I don't know.

768
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:13,227
Taking your clothes off somewhere
until you pay Dink back?

769
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:15,032
Dink and I will work it out.

770
00:48:16,032 --> 00:48:20,672
What? So you're just cool with
stealing his money from him?

771
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:26,107
And you're just cool trying
to steal him from Tulip?

772
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:29,345
Hey, that's not the same thing.

773
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:31,349
Oh, you got that right.

774
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:36,986
Come on, Beth.
It's all good.

775
00:48:36,987 --> 00:48:40,989
We all got away from some kind
of fucking bullshit some place.

776
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,327
And we all came here because
this is where you get a break.

777
00:48:45,327 --> 00:48:48,230
But sometimes,
you got to give one, too.

778
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:50,268
Take a penny, leave a penny.
Know what I mean?

779
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:55,203
I mean, you want to hold
people to a higher standard?

780
00:48:55,204 --> 00:48:57,172
I'd first take
a look in the mirror.

781
00:48:57,173 --> 00:49:02,076
Next thing I'd do is
move some place else.

782
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:04,447
You stay here?

783
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:07,383
You're one of us.

784
00:49:07,384 --> 00:49:09,760
Have a great day, honey.

785
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,460
I spent the whole day,
the whole day with a 103 fever!

786
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:23,399
Now, then KC, I gotta lose on a fumble?
Are you kidding me?

787
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,136
Are you kidding me right now?!

788
00:49:27,137 --> 00:49:29,303
Sunday! All day Sunday.

789
00:49:29,304 --> 00:49:32,306
Sunday night I wanted to
kill myself, I swear to God.

790
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:34,475
And then I gotta
take this game.

791
00:49:34,476 --> 00:49:37,678
We are officially on damage
control conditions right now...

792
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:39,647
- I, I...
- You what?!

793
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:42,083
You what? You what? You were
supposed to bring me luck.

794
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:43,650
- Me?
- That's what you were supposed to bring back.

795
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,552
Like the cat that
came back, but you didn't.

796
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:47,755
- You just brought me bad luck.
- Come on, it was one bet.

797
00:49:47,756 --> 00:49:49,523
Just one bet?
Oh, is that what it was?

798
00:49:49,524 --> 00:49:51,391
- Yeah, it was just one bet!
- What do you know about gaming?

799
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:52,795
Do you think you
understand how this works?

800
00:49:52,796 --> 00:49:55,797
How my business works?
You don't. Get out!

801
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:59,567
Just get out! Get, get out!

802
00:49:59,568 --> 00:50:02,404
Help her out. You, too. Get out!
You, too. Scott!

803
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:05,374
Get out! Get out! Hurry up!
Get your fucking bag!

804
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:09,845
Get out! Get out! Scott, go!
Please! Get out!

805
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,647
My God, what was that?

806
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:14,548
He's been firing everybody
every couple of days.

807
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:16,820
- Only lasts an hour or two.
- Why is he being like this?

808
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:19,587
- It's like he's not Dink.
- That is Dink. That is Dink losing.

809
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:23,225
Bad, like he'd be heading towards broke if
he doesn't pull out of this debt spiral.

810
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:24,758
Well, what do we do?
How do we help him?

811
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:26,527
There's nothing
we can do for him.

812
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:28,295
What do you mean? What are we
going to do if he goes broke?

813
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:29,831
Go and work for somebody else.
Take it easy, Beth.

814
00:50:29,832 --> 00:50:31,599
- Take it easy?
- This happens at some point

815
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,603
and lots of points to everybody.
You should know that by now.

816
00:50:33,604 --> 00:50:36,305
- This is gambling.
- Call this gambling for a reason.

817
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:38,238
Yeah, I just...
I didn't think...

818
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,208
Didn't think what?
That it'd happen to Dink?

819
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:42,378
Yeah, it happens to the good guys, too.
Maybe more, even.

820
00:50:42,379 --> 00:50:44,446
- If anything, you come back.
- Hell yeah.

821
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:46,246
And that's the best
feeling in the world, man.

822
00:50:46,247 --> 00:50:47,682
- Let's grab a date shake.
- All right.

823
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:49,155
You're buying,
you cheap bastard.

824
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,505
You were supposed
to bring it back.

825
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:12,376
Bring what back?
Your luck?

826
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:18,150
I can't do that.
It's not my responsibility.

827
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,755
So, you're just going to leave
me now that I'm falling apart?

828
00:51:26,755 --> 00:51:29,658
Well, I can't stay here when
you're like this. It's too...

829
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:32,794
...depressing.

830
00:51:32,795 --> 00:51:35,733
You are a very selfish person.

831
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:38,332
What?

832
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:42,504
Hey, what do you want me to do?

833
00:51:42,505 --> 00:51:46,341
What do you want me to do?

834
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:49,947
Take it. I accept
your resignation.

835
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:54,816
It's been nice knowing you.
Bye, Beth.

836
00:51:54,817 --> 00:51:57,752
Hey Dink, you sure you want to
be giving away money right now?

837
00:51:57,753 --> 00:52:00,254
Just get out.

838
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:05,826
If you want to quit,
that's fine. OK?

839
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:10,531
Just don't go do one of your
stupid hustles for money.

840
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:14,569
- Mm-hm.
- Just go do something.

841
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,215
Are you done?

842
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:28,222
Cashing them all in, yeah?

843
00:52:45,835 --> 00:52:47,003
Well, hello.

844
00:52:48,003 --> 00:52:50,007
Um, hi.

845
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:54,308
It's Beth. From Las Vegas.

846
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,812
Yeah, I know who Beth is.

847
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:59,849
If I came to New York...

848
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,829
...would you hang out with me?

849
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:16,964
I mean, there are people
with MBAs waiting tables

850
00:53:16,965 --> 00:53:20,035
at the Olive Garden. What is
someone going to hire me to do?

851
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:22,638
How did you finagle
getting your job?

852
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,806
Well, it wasn't exactly
a finagling kind of thing.

853
00:53:24,807 --> 00:53:26,741
Well then, what was it?

854
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:29,278
It's what I've always done.
I went to journalism school,

855
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:30,779
I interned and I got a job.

856
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,314
- Ugh.
- What ugh?

857
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:35,751
I don't understand why
that sounds so crazy to you.

858
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:38,886
It's not crazy. I just
wish that I had a path,

859
00:53:38,887 --> 00:53:41,922
like you do, you know?
You're lucky.

860
00:53:41,923 --> 00:53:44,892
Look, you just got out
of a shitty situation.

861
00:53:44,893 --> 00:53:46,762
- You got fired...
- I didn't get fired.

862
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:51,299
- You quit.
- I don't know what happened.

863
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,834
I gotta say,

864
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:57,007
I don't want to be around
him if he can be like that.

865
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:01,615
I don't want to
see him like that.

866
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:09,417
Gamblers.

867
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:11,553
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

868
00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:14,023
For bitching and moaning.
I'll find something to do.

869
00:54:15,023 --> 00:54:18,359
Six months ago, all I wanted to
do was be a cocktail waitress.

870
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,730
And now you want something more.
That's a good thing, right?

871
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:23,333
Yes, definitely.

872
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:28,470
You're so...
great, Jeremy.

873
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:30,007
Let's just focus
on you and me...

874
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:35,343
...having a
really good time.

875
00:54:35,344 --> 00:54:37,719
I fucking love that plan.

876
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:51,130
Up top!

877
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,835
- Yes!
- - Good shot!

878
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:00,868
Hey, good game, man.

879
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:03,738
You're like
Spud Webb out there.

880
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:05,707
- You play ball?
- Uh-huh.

881
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:08,108
Junior college, I had a
scholarship but I lost it.

882
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:09,012
You play for St. John's?

883
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:14,683
Yep, class of '87.
They're playing tonight.

884
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:17,518
Man, I'd lay some big money on that
game if I could find that action.

885
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,692
- They are a lock.
- Really? You like to bet?

886
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:24,096
On anything that moves.

887
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:30,765
Hi, I'm Beth.

888
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:32,968
Dave Greenberg.

889
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:35,519
Beth.

890
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:52,452
I am not religious,
and I don't want to speculate

891
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:54,722
on what kind of
chosen person I am,

892
00:55:54,723 --> 00:55:56,925
or what kind of power
center is inside of me.

893
00:55:56,926 --> 00:56:01,163
But the truth is the truth,
I needed you and you came.

894
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:04,131
- OK...
- This is temporary right here.

895
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:06,100
I have a much more permanent,

896
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:09,437
more epic situation
that is in the works.

897
00:56:09,438 --> 00:56:11,139
But I'm not at liberty
to discuss it right now.

898
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,674
So, for God's sakes,
do not ask me about it.

899
00:56:13,675 --> 00:56:18,113
So, now, Beth. How do you
suggest I re-imagine my vortex

900
00:56:18,114 --> 00:56:20,214
in a way that indispensably,
includes you.

901
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:22,750
Well, I'm good on the phone

902
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:24,719
and I like going on
pay and collects...

903
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,556
Hey. Yo, Gids.

904
00:56:28,557 --> 00:56:32,093
Why not? I'll give you
six points. Later, fool.

905
00:56:32,094 --> 00:56:34,796
Pay and collect,
some phone, I like it.

906
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:37,233
I like where this is going.
Yes. How's 40 an hour to start?

907
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:40,835
Oh, great. Didn't you
just make a bet?

908
00:56:40,836 --> 00:56:43,239
- Yes.
- So, aren't you going to write it down?

909
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,475
Oh.

910
00:56:46,476 --> 00:56:47,943
I can see there's something
that you're thinking,

911
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:50,178
- but you're not saying.
- Yeah.

912
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,247
Well, there's this guy I know,

913
00:56:52,248 --> 00:56:55,783
and he likes to bet like crazy
and he can't find any action,

914
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,920
and he has friends that want to get down, too.
And I thought, maybe,

915
00:56:57,921 --> 00:57:02,223
I could put them onto you? And, um,
they seem ready to bet, like, a, a lot.

916
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:06,160
- Fun, great. You agent it.
- Me, really?

917
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,795
This'll be a nice thing
on the side for you.

918
00:57:07,796 --> 00:57:09,496
Whatever he loses,
I'll give you 25 percent,

919
00:57:09,497 --> 00:57:11,000
but these guys are
your responsibility.

920
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:13,734
Oh, my God, this is great.

921
00:57:13,735 --> 00:57:17,038
Beth, dude. Your initiative,
it is impressive.

922
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:18,907
- Yes.
- You started working for me,

923
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:21,542
before you started working for me.
That is unprecedented.

924
00:57:21,543 --> 00:57:23,578
You're like a hungry woman
lying on the prowl,

925
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,880
but you listen to things,
and you smell everything.

926
00:57:25,881 --> 00:57:27,617
Look at this line
here on Boston.

927
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:29,750
I'm going to salvage this,
right now.

928
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:32,888
Rosie, 651.

929
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:35,890
Take me 200k Boston...

930
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:40,261
...Rosie, 651.
Right motherfucking now!

931
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:42,863
Thank you. Bang!

932
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:45,100
So, anyway... What?

933
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:47,003
Well, you just made a bet for $200,000
in the middle of our conversation.

934
00:57:48,003 --> 00:57:51,672
- And is there a problem?
- No, but you do not bet like Dink.

935
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:53,575
Listen, I mean no disrespect.

936
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:56,278
Dink is a famous classic.
He is a hero of mine.

937
00:57:56,279 --> 00:57:59,980
He is the '57 Chevy of gambling.

938
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:03,317
But, all modesty aside,
I am the Ferrari.

939
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:05,687
Or if Ferrari made
a super fast tank

940
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:09,691
with laser blasters sticking out.
I would be that of gambling!

941
00:58:09,692 --> 00:58:11,158
We are done for today.

942
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,995
This should be in the
vicinity of $6,000.

943
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:18,133
Assigning bonus,
some clothes, some food.

944
00:58:18,134 --> 00:58:20,301
I don't want you
with the stress.

945
00:58:20,302 --> 00:58:23,671
And it's so exciting. Do you have
any idea how big Rosie's bets are?

946
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:26,607
It's New York, where
gambling is illegal,

947
00:58:26,608 --> 00:58:28,576
and bookmaking is a felony.

948
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:30,780
You know, because of you
I'm finally good at something.

949
00:58:30,781 --> 00:58:33,848
but I can't do it in Las Vegas
because you banned me.

950
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:38,185
Rosie is taking action across state
lines, which of course he is doing,

951
00:58:38,186 --> 00:58:42,656
then you are opening yourself up to a
conspiracy and that's a slam dunk for RICO.

952
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:45,727
Does that sound familiar? Does
that sound like anybody you know?

953
00:58:45,728 --> 00:58:49,296
- You're jealous of Rosie.
- Beth! When you go to jail

954
00:58:49,297 --> 00:58:51,332
it will not be my fault. OK?

955
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:54,704
You sound like your mother.

956
00:58:55,704 --> 00:58:57,639
- Goodbye.
- Oh, come on!

957
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,750
Hi, Dave.

958
00:59:08,751 --> 00:59:10,785
So, how about that
Philly game last night?

959
00:59:10,786 --> 00:59:12,953
You must be happy
to see me, huh?

960
00:59:12,954 --> 00:59:15,961
- What?
- - Thanks a lot.

961
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:22,675
What?

962
00:59:33,675 --> 00:59:37,111
What? Dave you're actually making
us look kind of suspicious.

963
00:59:37,112 --> 00:59:39,081
Well, excuse me, Miss Mata
Hari, for not wanting

964
00:59:39,082 --> 00:59:42,216
to receive illegal cash
in front of cops.

965
00:59:42,217 --> 00:59:43,917
My car's over here.
Come on.

966
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:47,388
Dave Greenberg's a prick.

967
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:49,957
And he never loses.

968
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,693
I like it when
they keep winning.

969
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:53,693
That means when they lose,
they lose huge.

970
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,131
Rosie, do you ever worry about

971
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:59,167
getting caught by the
police or the FBI?

972
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:01,301
Eh, never happens.
We're too cautious.

973
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:03,805
- You're not cautious.
- Well, we're semi-cautious.

974
01:00:03,806 --> 01:00:07,142
No, you're not. Rosie, you play
Guitar Hero with the delivery guys

975
01:00:07,143 --> 01:00:08,911
while you take bets
on the phone.

976
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:11,312
You left our
"who owes who what" cheats

977
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:12,782
in the booth at the Sizzler.

978
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,948
Everybody knows
you're a bookie.

979
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:18,285
I do not like having these
kinds of conversations.

980
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:20,721
And Beth,
I think you know that.

981
01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:24,459
And besides, as far as
what is legal or not legal,

982
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,427
it's about to become a moot point,
but I will not talk about that.

983
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:28,068
Because that, that is a secret!

984
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:33,003
Tell me...

985
01:00:34,003 --> 01:00:36,705
OK, the Curacao thing
is getting very real.

986
01:00:36,706 --> 01:00:38,239
My license, it just
came through down there.

987
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,408
I have an investor that
may cover the setup.

988
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:45,779
My sports book shall
be called, ASAP!

989
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,049
All Serious Action Players!
Completely legal.

990
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,253
- Oh, that's incredible.
- Look at the eight horse.

991
01:00:51,254 --> 01:00:53,821
Where the heck did she come from?
She's going to mess up my Perfecta.

992
01:00:53,822 --> 01:00:56,424
Curacao, that's a beautiful
island in the Caribbean, right?

993
01:00:56,425 --> 01:00:59,228
- Beautiful, legit island.
- Oh... Oh, God.

994
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:03,931
- Come on...
- You got it...

995
01:01:03,932 --> 01:01:05,733
- You got it, you got it...
- Yes!

996
01:01:05,734 --> 01:01:07,202
- There it goes!
- Yes! Yes!

997
01:01:07,203 --> 01:01:09,108
Oh, yes!

998
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:16,343
- Yes! Yes!
- How did you do that?

999
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:18,512
How'd you pick the eight horse to win?
She looked like absolute shit to me.

1000
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:20,983
That was like so surreal and
yesterday it was Cleveland.

1001
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:24,785
- You're back. You are back.
- Two weeks ago, she looked like a mess.

1002
01:01:24,786 --> 01:01:27,123
But I thought she was starting to get
her head around the whole thing.

1003
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:32,893
Ruby Lane, Ruby Lane.
Ruby Lane...

1004
01:01:32,894 --> 01:01:34,895
What does Dink think?

1005
01:01:34,896 --> 01:01:39,200
Well, I'm not really
talking to Dink right now.

1006
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:42,870
Beth, you made a lot of money
in the last couple of months.

1007
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:45,874
- Why don't you just stay here with me?
- And do what?

1008
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:48,010
Continue to have the completely fantastic
time we've been having together.

1009
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:53,480
Look, Jeremy, I don't think you realize what
a huge deal this Curacao thing is for me.

1010
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:58,085
I mean, I'm going to actually
be in charge of something.

1011
01:01:58,086 --> 01:01:59,855
Something that's going to
take you someplace else.

1012
01:01:59,856 --> 01:02:03,795
Yeah, but I'll come back.
I'll miss you.

1013
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:08,062
- So, what about...
- Otis. I know.

1014
01:02:08,063 --> 01:02:10,497
I have to find somewhere
for him to stay.

1015
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:12,902
I'll take care of Otis. I don't
want him to stay with strangers.

1016
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:14,435
- Really?
- Yeah.

1017
01:02:14,436 --> 01:02:17,071
Oh, my God, that would be great.
He loves you.

1018
01:02:17,072 --> 01:02:18,907
- You know that, right?
- And I love him.

1019
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:24,444
Aww...
Otis, you lucky dog.

1020
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:28,183
Now my only problem is finding
someone to do my pay and collects.

1021
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:31,518
Hey. You could do that too.

1022
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,488
- Me?
- Yeah.

1023
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:36,124
You can keep my cut and
feed Otis, and we're even.

1024
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:38,259
It's easy money.

1025
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,568
I'll talk you through
the whole thing.

1026
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:48,335
Hi, Dave.

1027
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:51,313
This is Jeremy...

1028
01:02:58,313 --> 01:03:00,952
Bye.

1029
01:03:02,952 --> 01:03:05,085
So, what's your number?

1030
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:07,120
I'm gonna have a plain burger.

1031
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:09,357
No bun, no sauce,
no nothing on it.

1032
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:10,892
I know.

1033
01:03:10,893 --> 01:03:12,425
It had some barbecue sauce
on it last time,

1034
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,463
and I really don't want
to go through that again.

1035
01:03:14,464 --> 01:03:18,600
So, a very plain burger and
nothing else, and a regular Coke.

1036
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:20,935
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1037
01:03:20,936 --> 01:03:23,437
- Stomach?
- Oh, yeah.

1038
01:03:23,438 --> 01:03:26,640
Why? What's on your mind?
You're doing so good.

1039
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:30,178
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a
little worried about Beth.

1040
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:32,346
Dink.

1041
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:34,616
She's working for that
maniac Rosie in New York.

1042
01:03:34,617 --> 01:03:38,919
I blew up at her and now
she's not calling me back.

1043
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,922
Look, I wasn't going to say
anything, but do you notice

1044
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:44,125
when Beth is around, you
were doing a lot of losing.

1045
01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:47,462
And now that she's gone,
you're doing really good.

1046
01:03:47,463 --> 01:03:50,364
Hey, if anyone's
the jinx, it's Beth.

1047
01:03:50,365 --> 01:03:52,366
But I owe her.

1048
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,201
Owe her for what?

1049
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:56,571
I owe her for messing
everything up.

1050
01:03:56,572 --> 01:04:00,508
I usually just think about how
much money I could've made

1051
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:03,377
if I'd just focused a little
bit more when I was younger.

1052
01:04:03,378 --> 01:04:05,581
And I usually give myself
a hard time about it.

1053
01:04:05,582 --> 01:04:10,051
But now, I'm looking at all the
things I've got to do instead.

1054
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:12,319
I got to be with you.

1055
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,290
And it's not like
I don't appreciate you

1056
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:17,658
on a daily basis, because I do.

1057
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:20,528
But for the first time,
since our wedding,

1058
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:24,000
I look at my situation, and I'm looking
at it from an oddsmaker's perspective.

1059
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,672
And I am a really lucky guy.

1060
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:34,274
And to be honest, a big part
of that is because of Beth.

1061
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:37,210
Hey, how you doin'?

1062
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:39,379
I wanted to say hi.

1063
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,716
And tell you that, um,
I hope you don't think

1064
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:44,584
that we're in some kind of fight,
because I don't think that.

1065
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:46,220
And, just wanted to call...

1066
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:48,689
...and see
how you're doing.

1067
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,426
Um, give me a shout
if you have a minute.

1068
01:04:51,427 --> 01:04:54,662
And I also wanted you to
know that I'm not mad

1069
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:57,132
that you're working
for Rosie in New York.

1070
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:59,299
So, that's about it.

1071
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,234
Call me, I'm at the office,

1072
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:05,305
and hope you're OK
and having fun.

1073
01:05:05,306 --> 01:05:07,579
OK, bye.

1074
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,413
Hello, ASAP?

1075
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:16,452
- Hello, sport?
- Hello, ASAP?

1076
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:20,388
Can you turn the music off!

1077
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:23,256
Hey, there are phones ringing
and you're playing video games

1078
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,292
and... what? Doing coke?!

1079
01:05:25,293 --> 01:05:27,462
Oh, my God,
what are they doing here?

1080
01:05:27,463 --> 01:05:29,696
All the plumbing at their
place is backing up.

1081
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:32,232
What, so you just move them out
of the brothel and into here?

1082
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:34,036
If you think about it
for two seconds, Beth,

1083
01:05:34,037 --> 01:05:37,171
you'll see this saves time
and money for everybody.

1084
01:05:37,172 --> 01:05:39,009
Hey! Where've
you been for four days?

1085
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:43,410
Bethy, I have been in love.
What is wrong with me?

1086
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:46,314
Why is it that all of
my dreams come true?

1087
01:05:46,315 --> 01:05:48,150
Look at this line
here on Cleveland.

1088
01:05:48,151 --> 01:05:50,417
This is terrible.
Who made this line?

1089
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:53,421
Bob made it. Look, Rosie,
when you disappear,

1090
01:05:53,422 --> 01:05:56,323
these fucking assholes you brought
down here just make shitty lines,

1091
01:05:56,324 --> 01:06:00,261
do coke, have sex with 17 year
olds, and steal from you.

1092
01:06:00,262 --> 01:06:02,430
Easy. Beth,
these are my friends.

1093
01:06:02,431 --> 01:06:04,665
Rosie, this was your big move.

1094
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,201
The only important thing you've
ever done in your whole life,

1095
01:06:07,202 --> 01:06:10,203
and you're letting it fucking disintegrate!
What is wrong with you?!

1096
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:13,107
Beth, you are the gum that
holds this all together.

1097
01:06:13,108 --> 01:06:16,544
You put up with a lot, and you
deserve respect for that.

1098
01:06:16,545 --> 01:06:20,047
I'm giving a raise to $5,000
a week, effective last week.

1099
01:06:20,048 --> 01:06:22,186
But just do not tell anybody.

1100
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:26,319
All right, check on Motown!

1101
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,625
Check on the Cuban! Somebody
call HBC and give 20 dimes to...

1102
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:32,097
Fuck! We're getting
buried on this game!

1103
01:06:35,097 --> 01:06:37,397
Hello?

1104
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:39,534
Did you know that
Otis runs in his sleep?

1105
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:42,803
Yes.

1106
01:06:42,804 --> 01:06:48,408
Jeremy, how are you?
I miss you.

1107
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:51,449
- You miss me?
- Of course I do.

1108
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:55,583
Could you tell me
something normal?

1109
01:06:55,584 --> 01:06:57,151
Sure, like what?

1110
01:06:57,152 --> 01:07:00,187
I don't know, about
your day? Anything?

1111
01:07:00,188 --> 01:07:02,622
Have you checked
Greenberg's bets lately?

1112
01:07:02,623 --> 01:07:04,759
No.

1113
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,828
He and his friends
are losing finally.

1114
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:09,596
And big time,
like 75 grand worth.

1115
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:11,598
Really? That's nice.

1116
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,403
I can't get any of those
guys on the phone, though.

1117
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:18,138
You're their only action,
and they're idiot addicts.

1118
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:19,775
They'll call.

1119
01:07:23,846 --> 01:07:26,747
I gotta go.

1120
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:29,616
Rosie's friends are
destroying the place.

1121
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:33,821
Don't worry about Greenberg.

1122
01:07:33,822 --> 01:07:39,161
146, 152, 155 total.

1123
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:47,273
...Minus 13. No, leave it
just at 7 and a half flat.

1124
01:07:51,273 --> 01:07:53,473
Rosie, can you turn it down?!

1125
01:07:53,474 --> 01:07:57,745
I can't Beth. This song
is the rhythm of victory!

1126
01:07:57,746 --> 01:08:01,265
Don't let the rhythm
not get you and move!

1127
01:08:16,265 --> 01:08:20,468
Beth, Dave Greenberg here.
We got a problem.

1128
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:23,537
I, uh... got into some trouble
a couple of years ago.

1129
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:26,840
It's a long story, but my
parole officer called me in.

1130
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:31,312
And he wants to know about you
and who's running your office.

1131
01:08:31,313 --> 01:08:33,813
Now, don't worry
I didn't give you up,

1132
01:08:33,814 --> 01:08:36,216
but this is a fucking mess.

1133
01:08:36,217 --> 01:08:37,951
He's got all the
numbers from my phone,

1134
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:38,921
including yours and Jeremy's.

1135
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:43,291
So, if he calls...
just play dumb.

1136
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:45,792
But whatever you do,
don't call me.

1137
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:48,965
I'll call you.

1138
01:08:49,965 --> 01:08:52,465
It's not a big deal. The
Seattle game's about to start.

1139
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:54,367
Why don't you go upstairs?

1140
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:55,908
It's...

1141
01:08:59,908 --> 01:09:02,742
My life is over,
even if I don't go to jail.

1142
01:09:02,743 --> 01:09:04,311
If I get arrested
on a felony charge,

1143
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:06,278
I am done forever
as a journalist.

1144
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:08,684
I'm 98 percent sure that
Dave Greenberg is lying.

1145
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:10,850
He just doesn't want to pay,
or he can't pay.

1146
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:13,955
If Dave Greenberg has a parole
officer, it does seem plausible

1147
01:09:13,956 --> 01:09:16,792
that he would want to know who Dave's
bookie is, and that Dave would tell him.

1148
01:09:16,793 --> 01:09:20,827
Look! I'm going to...

1149
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:23,230
I'm going to call Dink.

1150
01:09:23,231 --> 01:09:24,863
Wait, what? You're
going to call Dink?

1151
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:26,801
You said you haven't
been talking to him.

1152
01:09:26,802 --> 01:09:31,339
I haven't.
But I'll just... call him.

1153
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,774
- I'll call you back.
- No, no! No.

1154
01:09:32,775 --> 01:09:35,343
Do not call me back.
I am at a payphone.

1155
01:09:35,344 --> 01:09:36,944
Do not call
my phone from Curacao,

1156
01:09:36,945 --> 01:09:39,580
the gambling mecca
of the Caribbean!

1157
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:42,883
No, no. It's not,
not a big deal.

1158
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:44,618
That's just Rosie saying that,

1159
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,320
so you'll forget about it
and go back to work.

1160
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:49,489
Look, I'm sorry
that I abandoned you.

1161
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,926
Now will you please
calm down and talk to me...

1162
01:09:51,927 --> 01:09:54,661
I appreciate your apology.

1163
01:09:54,662 --> 01:09:58,032
But I want you to know this is
a very serious situation, OK?

1164
01:09:58,033 --> 01:10:03,703
You had a felon,
paroled, the FBI...

1165
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:06,674
I've seen go down just
like this in the past,

1166
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:09,977
and I'm not just talking
about my circumstances, OK?

1167
01:10:09,978 --> 01:10:12,947
This is a very big problem.

1168
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:15,515
How is it down there?

1169
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:18,286
What, what the heck's going on?

1170
01:10:18,287 --> 01:10:21,054
I'm earning $5,000 a week.

1171
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:22,957
Beth, you never
cared about money.

1172
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:25,693
I thought you went down there
because it's paradise?

1173
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:28,295
Is it paradise?

1174
01:10:28,296 --> 01:10:31,698
- No.
- Don't cry.

1175
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:34,301
Don't cry, just...

1176
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:37,371
Listen to me, Beth. You are the
book in this New York thing.

1177
01:10:37,372 --> 01:10:39,572
You have got to take
care of your people.

1178
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:42,943
Your decisions are no longer
just about you anymore.

1179
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:46,980
- You have to handle this.
- But I don't know how to handle it.

1180
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:51,021
Yes you do, or you will.

1181
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:55,989
Hold on one second.

1182
01:10:55,990 --> 01:11:00,594
Hey Beth?

1183
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:03,997
Look, it's Dink's mom's
birthday on Thursday.

1184
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:07,468
She was going to come out to Vegas, but she...
she hates flying.

1185
01:11:07,469 --> 01:11:09,404
So, if we come out to
New York, she doesn't

1186
01:11:09,405 --> 01:11:11,805
have to come out here for
her birthday, which...

1187
01:11:11,806 --> 01:11:13,907
- ...she'd love, right honey?
- Yeah.

1188
01:11:13,908 --> 01:11:16,846
We could meet you there.

1189
01:11:18,846 --> 01:11:21,587
You'd... You'd help me?

1190
01:11:25,587 --> 01:11:28,726
Yes, we'll help you help Jeremy.

1191
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:36,563
Hey, you know when you don't need
to be taken care of anymore?

1192
01:11:36,564 --> 01:11:40,041
It's when you decide to start
taking care of someone else.

1193
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,747
You still there Beth?

1194
01:11:51,747 --> 01:11:53,480
Beth, you're being crazy.

1195
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:56,450
It's $75,000 this idiot
Greenberg owes me.

1196
01:11:56,451 --> 01:11:59,687
Who cares? I need you here.
I forgive you the Greenberg.

1197
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:01,755
A clean slate,
you owe me nothing.

1198
01:12:01,756 --> 01:12:03,891
- But you have to stay.
- It's not about the money.

1199
01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:06,693
Well, what's it about?
Jeremy the non-boyfriend?

1200
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:09,996
Jeremy may be in huge
trouble because of me.

1201
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:12,967
He chose to do something not completely
legal in the state of New York.

1202
01:12:12,968 --> 01:12:14,902
You didn't force
him to do that!

1203
01:12:14,903 --> 01:12:17,438
Yeah, well he did it for me!

1204
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:21,575
Come on, Beth! People do
things for themselves.

1205
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:25,513
Yeah, what about saints?
And famously selfless people?

1206
01:12:25,514 --> 01:12:27,047
They do things so people
think that they're saints

1207
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:29,983
or selfless people. People who
do things for themselves,

1208
01:12:29,984 --> 01:12:32,086
being nice,
that's just another racket!

1209
01:12:32,087 --> 01:12:36,090
Now, listen to me, Beth. I forgive the $75,000.
As long as you stay.

1210
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:39,426
- What does that mean?
- It means if you stay,

1211
01:12:39,427 --> 01:12:42,529
you're Beth. My Beth.

1212
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,732
And all is forgiven.

1213
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:49,804
But if you leave, well,
then you're just another

1214
01:12:49,805 --> 01:12:53,176
New York agent on the hook
for her losers losses.

1215
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:56,943
Fuck you, Rosie!

1216
01:12:56,944 --> 01:12:59,746
No, actually, Beth.
Fuck you!

1217
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:02,049
All of your pay
is in the ASAP account.

1218
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:04,551
Which means, I have it!

1219
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:07,121
It's like, what is it?
Is it $60,000, give or take?

1220
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:09,223
So you're just going to
steal my money from me?

1221
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:12,660
Of course not. I'm
going to hold on to it

1222
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:15,795
as collateral,
for your loser's losses.

1223
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:18,933
You wanna go to New York?
Fine.

1224
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:20,968
Give me my Greenberg money!

1225
01:13:20,969 --> 01:13:23,170
Then you get your Beth money!

1226
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:25,171
You know, I am going
to deal with it.

1227
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:26,740
And then I'm going
to come back to you,

1228
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,975
and then I am going to...

1229
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:33,214
...stab you in the groin
artery with a steak knife

1230
01:13:33,215 --> 01:13:38,219
and watch TV while you bleed out,
you fucking horrible person!

1231
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,121
- Come on, let's go.
- Whoa, Beth! I think everyone is saying things here

1232
01:13:40,122 --> 01:13:42,790
that they don't mean!
Except for me!

1233
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:46,729
Beth, you are
being very selfish!

1234
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:51,534
- Safe flight, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1235
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:56,570
- Watch your step.
- Got it, honey.

1236
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:02,108
- Hey.
- We're on the red-eye.

1237
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,111
Does she know
where the guy lives?

1238
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:07,147
Do you know where
Dave Greenberg lives?

1239
01:14:07,148 --> 01:14:11,551
I don't know, but he has to watch New
Jersey games at his cousin's bar.

1240
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:15,221
They play tomorrow night.
He'll be there.

1241
01:14:15,222 --> 01:14:18,959
We'll see you
at the airport, Beth.

1242
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,739
All right.

1243
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,674
- Hey.
- Hey.

1244
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:35,276
- Hi.
- Bethy.

1245
01:14:35,277 --> 01:14:36,296
Hey.

1246
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:58,566
There's 8,000 David
Greenbergs in Long Island.

1247
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:01,268
That's the name he's listed
under, if he's listed at all.

1248
01:15:01,269 --> 01:15:05,072
Why? Why would you
put all your money

1249
01:15:05,073 --> 01:15:06,774
into an account
that Rosie controls?

1250
01:15:06,775 --> 01:15:08,576
No shit, why?

1251
01:15:08,577 --> 01:15:10,712
Well, because it was
earning 11 percent interest.

1252
01:15:10,713 --> 01:15:12,912
Wow. Well,
that's a good reason.

1253
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:15,216
- You must be Dink.
- Yeah. Jeremy, have a seat.

1254
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:17,350
He's cute.

1255
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:20,353
I'm sure you have a lot on
your mind right now, but...

1256
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:23,624
- ...try not to worry.
- Why are you doing this?

1257
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:25,593
We're just here
visiting family.

1258
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:27,827
You already got a
felony conviction,

1259
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:29,629
if this thing doesn't go down
nicely and you're anywhere near by,

1260
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,000
you're going to go to prison for
a lot longer than we would.

1261
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,667
Well, then let's just stop.
Let's just give up, right now.

1262
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:35,936
Anyway, we can't even
find Dave Greenberg...

1263
01:15:35,937 --> 01:15:38,037
I know Greenberg is.

1264
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:40,174
- What?
- You do? Let me see, let me see.

1265
01:15:40,175 --> 01:15:43,611
Massa-fucking-pequa?
How did you...

1266
01:15:43,612 --> 01:15:45,612
I have access to a
government website at work,

1267
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:47,681
and I can get in a lot of
trouble for showing you this,

1268
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:50,751
but that's Greenberg. It's everything.
It's his home address,

1269
01:15:50,752 --> 01:15:53,953
property records, employment records,
phone numbers, family, everything.

1270
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:56,188
I can never lay a hand on this douche, because
of my personal relationship with God,

1271
01:15:56,189 --> 01:15:58,124
but I know two guys about
four stops from here

1272
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,192
who'll come and threaten to
saw his feet off for $900.

1273
01:16:00,193 --> 01:16:02,195
- Yes.
- If you're seriously considering doing something

1274
01:16:02,196 --> 01:16:04,062
like that, I'm going to
take the file and leave.

1275
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:06,201
- Why, is he some kind of cop?
- No, he's a reporter.

1276
01:16:06,202 --> 01:16:08,836
Greenberg has a
felony conviction.

1277
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:10,403
And he's on parole.

1278
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:13,107
That's very bad.

1279
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:15,076
We can't go anywhere
near this guy.

1280
01:16:15,077 --> 01:16:17,711
And if he's working
with the Feds,

1281
01:16:17,712 --> 01:16:20,280
we can't even walk on his lawn
without getting in trouble.

1282
01:16:24,252 --> 01:16:26,754
Thank you very much.
You can keep the change.

1283
01:16:26,755 --> 01:16:28,956
We have to go
back to the hotel.

1284
01:16:28,957 --> 01:16:31,125
You've got to call
this guy on the phone.

1285
01:16:31,126 --> 01:16:33,327
It's the only choice we have.

1286
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:35,275
Come on.

1287
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:50,978
You are going to have to
talk hard to these people.

1288
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:52,945
- Yeah, I know.
- And you don't appreciate the parole officer,

1289
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,714
don't call me,
I'll call you bullshit.

1290
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,251
- I know.
- And whether or not his phone is tapped,

1291
01:16:56,252 --> 01:16:58,285
or not, tell him
you could care less...

1292
01:16:58,286 --> 01:16:59,886
I know, I know.

1293
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:01,024
Where are you going?

1294
01:17:04,024 --> 01:17:05,726
Will you make sure
that I stay assertive?

1295
01:17:05,727 --> 01:17:10,363
Sure. I didn't expect Jeremy
to be such a normal guy.

1296
01:17:10,364 --> 01:17:12,700
I know, he's my first.

1297
01:17:12,701 --> 01:17:14,469
Do you think that's why I brought
him on the brink of federal prison?

1298
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,071
Maybe.

1299
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:20,109
Look, between Frankie and Dink,
it'll get handled, OK?

1300
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:24,317
I'm the only one who can
deal with Dave Greenberg.

1301
01:17:35,323 --> 01:17:37,056
Dave!

1302
01:17:37,057 --> 01:17:39,796
It's Beth.

1303
01:17:41,796 --> 01:17:43,032
Beth,
you're calling me at home.

1304
01:17:44,032 --> 01:17:46,467
You know, we're having my
son's birthday party here.

1305
01:17:46,468 --> 01:17:50,269
What you're doing is the most scumbag
fucking thing you can do in this business.

1306
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:53,439
You and your buddies
win five weeks in a row,

1307
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,109
and get paid the exact
amount on time,

1308
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,911
and now,
the first time you lose,

1309
01:17:58,912 --> 01:18:01,215
you turn your cell phones off?!

1310
01:18:01,216 --> 01:18:03,450
I'll call you back
in five minutes.

1311
01:18:03,451 --> 01:18:05,926
Four minutes!

1312
01:18:11,926 --> 01:18:14,393
Get off the money thing.
Get back on the Fed thing,

1313
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:15,896
it's the only thing
we really care about.

1314
01:18:15,897 --> 01:18:19,233
He's scared.
I can taste it.

1315
01:18:19,234 --> 01:18:21,505
I'm going to make him more
scared of me than the Feds.

1316
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:25,426
I got this.

1317
01:18:54,802 --> 01:18:56,435
- Dave.
- Beth.

1318
01:18:56,436 --> 01:18:58,205
My phone line are still tapped,

1319
01:18:58,206 --> 01:18:59,007
I'm calling you
from the neighbors.

1320
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:01,575
Dave, stop lying
to me right now.

1321
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:03,411
I don't believe a word that's
coming out of your mouth.

1322
01:19:03,412 --> 01:19:05,144
You owe me $75,000.

1323
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:06,979
Hey!

1324
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:10,216
Hey, I owe you $10,000.

1325
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:13,086
Whatever the other guys lost,
whatever they're not paying you,

1326
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:15,988
I am not responsible. If you want,
I'll give you their numbers.

1327
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:18,224
Oh, I have all the
numbers I need, Dave.

1328
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:19,028
I have your
boss's phone number,

1329
01:19:20,028 --> 01:19:21,429
I have your
sister's phone number,

1330
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:25,832
I have your wife's parents
numbers in Great Neck.

1331
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:28,100
And if you don't stop
fucking with me,

1332
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:31,537
I will call each one of them and
tell them what a degenerate you are.

1333
01:19:31,538 --> 01:19:33,474
Christ, where do you get off
calling me a degenerate?

1334
01:19:33,475 --> 01:19:37,044
Dave, Dave, do you think
I'm just some idiot

1335
01:19:37,045 --> 01:19:40,880
running around the street all day, handing
out thousands of dollars in credit limits?

1336
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,216
Is that what you
fucking think I am?!

1337
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:46,185
You don't think that
I work for someone?

1338
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:49,288
Someone who can find out
anything about you,

1339
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:51,390
do anything to you.

1340
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:53,926
Do you really want
to play that guy?

1341
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:58,369
Dave, it's because of me that
you can still walk right now.

1342
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:06,239
Beth, I told you. I have a
parole officer that is on...

1343
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,443
Even if you do have
a parole officer,

1344
01:20:09,444 --> 01:20:11,411
he is not my problem.

1345
01:20:11,412 --> 01:20:14,247
I don't think you get
what's going on here.

1346
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:18,387
Dave, listen to me. Look me
in the eye over the phone.

1347
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:23,658
You're an adult.

1348
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:27,296
And you make decisions.

1349
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:32,165
And those decisions
have consequences,

1350
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:35,434
for you and
for people around you.

1351
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:38,237
When you put your money down,

1352
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,179
you cannot pick and choose which of
your bets count and which ones don't.

1353
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:48,317
'Cause all of your
bets are yours.

1354
01:20:49,317 --> 01:20:51,417
All of them.

1355
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:54,358
Win or lose.

1356
01:20:57,358 --> 01:20:58,429
Dave?

1357
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:02,533
Dave?

1358
01:21:12,105 --> 01:21:15,211
Dave?

1359
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:20,349
You, you're right.

1360
01:21:21,349 --> 01:21:25,618
You're right, but I can't...

1361
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:28,489
I can't pay.

1362
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:30,991
I don't have the money.

1363
01:21:30,992 --> 01:21:34,961
He's crying.
I feel bad.

1364
01:21:34,962 --> 01:21:37,567
No. Go, go, go...

1365
01:21:39,567 --> 01:21:42,402
Dave, be completely honest
with me about the Fed thing

1366
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:45,237
and the parole officer,
right now...

1367
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:48,241
...and I will knock
$10,000 off the debt.

1368
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:50,518
This is a one time only offer.

1369
01:21:57,518 --> 01:22:02,229
I have a parole officer.
That's the truth.

1370
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:13,032
But he doesn't know
anything about you.

1371
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:16,336
That Fed thing,
that's bullshit.

1372
01:22:16,337 --> 01:22:18,772
That's what I thought.

1373
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:24,344
OK. So, now we're done with the
games and you only owe me $65,000.

1374
01:22:24,345 --> 01:22:26,645
So, how are we going
to work this out?

1375
01:22:26,646 --> 01:22:28,515
Do I have to call all your
relatives or have somebody come

1376
01:22:28,516 --> 01:22:30,716
and punch a fucking
sunroof into your head?!

1377
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:32,055
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1378
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:36,122
The only way you're
going to get your money,

1379
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:38,027
is if you reopen my account.

1380
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:43,095
I want to take
New Jersey tonight to win

1381
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:45,564
for $20,000. It is a lock.

1382
01:22:45,565 --> 01:22:48,501
Now, if I win,

1383
01:22:48,502 --> 01:22:51,604
that's $40,000,
and you can have all of it.

1384
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:53,572
Take it or leave it.

1385
01:22:53,573 --> 01:22:55,809
- What?
- Please hold.

1386
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:59,145
What are you doing? Just let it go.
It's Rosie's money.

1387
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:01,515
No, no, no. Look, if I
don't get Rosie his money,

1388
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:03,250
he won't give me my money.

1389
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:05,419
If I hang up now,
I lose everything.

1390
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:08,688
If Dave loses,
I still lose everything.

1391
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:10,659
But if Dave wins...

1392
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:16,228
I see your logic,
but New Jersey?

1393
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:20,200
- New Jersey...
- Wait, if Dave wins will Rosie give me my money?

1394
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:23,739
Yeah, Rosie's a scumbag,
he's not a thief.

1395
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:28,742
OK, I'll do it.

1396
01:23:28,743 --> 01:23:30,677
If I can put you
down for $40,000,

1397
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:32,746
that way you win 80,
and we're even.

1398
01:23:32,747 --> 01:23:36,383
If I win, that makes me up 15.

1399
01:23:36,384 --> 01:23:37,784
I don't think you're
very good at math.

1400
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:40,554
Oh no, I'm good at math.

1401
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:43,322
And I'm even better at
dealing with degenerates.

1402
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:47,260
That $15,000 goes to me for putting
up with your amateur bullshit.

1403
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:51,802
And you're in the clear.
Take it or leave it.

1404
01:23:55,802 --> 01:23:57,841
I'll take it.

1405
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:01,543
New Jersey.

1406
01:24:03,543 --> 01:24:06,278
New Jersey,
desperately trying to hang on

1407
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:08,483
for the upset win
over Los Angeles.

1408
01:24:08,484 --> 01:24:11,318
96-95!

1409
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:14,286
New Jersey has to
play better defense.

1410
01:24:14,287 --> 01:24:17,456
For New Jersey they have
played hard all night long!

1411
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:20,426
Now their lead down to one,
and it is gone...

1412
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:22,863
I can't believe it,
you're kidding me!

1413
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,367
I can't take this.

1414
01:24:27,368 --> 01:24:29,337
Again, a lack of
defense transition.

1415
01:24:29,338 --> 01:24:33,506
You've got to slow
down the basketball.

1416
01:24:33,507 --> 01:24:38,545
Los Angeles with a
97-96 lead over New Jersey!

1417
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:41,413
What are you doing?
Come back and watch!

1418
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:43,617
This is the part
I just can't watch.

1419
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:45,752
I'd rather sit alone in a dark room
for three hours with the phone off

1420
01:24:45,753 --> 01:24:49,194
- after a game.
- Yeah, when you have money on it.

1421
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:56,295
You have money on this game?

1422
01:24:56,296 --> 01:24:59,166
- Mm-hm.
- You bet against me?

1423
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:03,370
No. Bet $70,000 on New Jersey
to win the game out right.

1424
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:04,737
- Who with?
- Rosie.

1425
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:06,273
- Oh, my God...
- My God...

1426
01:25:06,274 --> 01:25:09,809
Why would you do that?
Why?

1427
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:12,245
I don't know.

1428
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:14,848
You can't bet sentimentally.

1429
01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:17,653
You taught me that.

1430
01:25:18,653 --> 01:25:21,254
Here you
see Reedmore in the act,

1431
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:23,857
get stripped and put him at
the free throw line

1432
01:25:23,858 --> 01:25:27,493
and two main free throws, can
win this game for New Jersey.

1433
01:25:27,494 --> 01:25:29,261
Reedmore just got fouled!

1434
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:32,499
Come on! Come on, come on!
Come on!

1435
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,969
Making the play
late in the game.

1436
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:37,571
Come on, we've got
to watch this now.

1437
01:25:37,572 --> 01:25:39,471
Come on, come on.
Watch.

1438
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:41,374
Look, he's gonna get this in.

1439
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,510
Sucks. I just want you to be
prepared if he doesn't...

1440
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:46,845
- Watch, watch...
- ...make it.

1441
01:25:46,846 --> 01:25:49,448
...and at least try
and force overtime.

1442
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:51,850
Reedmore's first...

1443
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:55,822
Yes!

1444
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:59,826
New Jersey, they've had
such a difficult year...

1445
01:25:59,827 --> 01:26:01,661
OK, OK, now make
the second one.

1446
01:26:01,662 --> 01:26:03,898
- I'm going to go sit down.
- No. Dink, you stay here.

1447
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:05,497
They're going to make both.

1448
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:06,900
You've got to protect yourself.

1449
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,734
No, I know he's
going to make it.

1450
01:26:08,735 --> 01:26:10,270
- I know.
- Can't think like that.

1451
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:12,471
Because I deserve this.

1452
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:15,010
- Can't think like that.
- Dink. I have to think like that.

1453
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,545
The chance to put them on
his shoulders and win it.

1454
01:26:19,546 --> 01:26:23,250
To cap off this
miraculous upset,

1455
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:26,752
New Jersey playing
from in front.

1456
01:26:26,753 --> 01:26:30,590
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

1457
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:32,597
We're doomed.

1458
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:56,616
One, two, three...

1459
01:26:56,617 --> 01:26:59,552
# Well I heard about the girl
you've been dancing with #

1460
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:02,488
# All over the neighborhood #

1461
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:05,558
# Tell me why
didn't you ask me baby #

1462
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:08,060
# Or didn't you think I could #

1463
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:11,363
# Well I know that your
partner won't stop aside #

1464
01:27:11,364 --> 01:27:13,966
# I've seen her with
the jerk all night #

1465
01:27:13,967 --> 01:27:16,003
# Why didn't you ask me baby #

1466
01:27:17,003 --> 01:27:19,805
# I would've shown you
how to do it right #

1467
01:27:19,806 --> 01:27:22,575
# Yeah, do it right #

1468
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:25,844
- Ah ha...
- # Do it right #

1469
01:27:25,845 --> 01:27:30,617
# Yeah Do it right #

1470
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:34,787
- Ahh...
- # Twisting #

1471
01:27:34,788 --> 01:27:38,758
# Shakin', shakin',
shakin', shakin' baby #

1472
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:41,894
# Here we go loop de loop #

# Here we go loop de lie #

01:27:47,635 --> 01:27:50,969
# Bend over let me see you

1476
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:53,907
# Bend over let me see you

1477
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:56,910
# Come on let me see you

# Come on let me see you

1479
01:27:59,846 --> 01:28:02,816

# Come on Shake it now baby #
