1
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,906
Yes, Doctor Ye.

2
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,977
A walk? I'd love that.

3
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:29,446
I really wanted to go for a walk too.

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,782
The weather's nice too.

5
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,785
I want to hold hands with you.

6
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:43,860
I really want to see you too.

7
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:49,266
Okay, I'll see you later then.

8
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,775
Bo Young and Doctor Ye
are dating? For real?

9
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,278
She told me to keep it a secret
but she got caught again.

10
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:06,049
Why doesn't she just post a notice
about her new relationship?

11
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:09,853
Wait, did you know all along?

12
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:13,890
What? You acted like a pain because
you were annoyed about them dating?

13
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,660
You even threw away the
bracelet Doctor Ye got her?

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,994
Yeah.

15
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:23,200
Geez, I see why Bo Young has been
acting cold towards you lately.

16
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,870
Does that mean you're not
even friends anymore?

17
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,507
I should apologize

18
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,276
so that we can at least remain friends.

19
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:36,046
I can't just remain a jerk.

20
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:43,653
[Episode 15 - I Thought It Was
Okay for Mothers to Do That.]

21
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,656
Doctor Park took a  holiday today

22
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:49,359
so I need Doctor Kim and Doctor
Park to work harder than usual.

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,393
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

24
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:55,699
By the way, you know that Doctor Ye
is going to be on a TV show, right?

25
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,901
Yes, I heard it'll go on
for three months.

26
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,238
Doctor Ye insisted that he wouldn't do it

27
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:05,675
but the director begged him to do it
for the promotion of this hospital

28
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,644
so he had no choice but to do it.

29
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:12,149
I didn't want to do it because
I'd have to readjust my schedule--

30
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,084
May I give you some advice?

31
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:17,721
Since you've agreed to do it,
do it willingly, Doctor Ye.

32
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:22,659
Other people would fight each other
and go crazy for this TV opportunity.

33
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,496
Wow. If you do this program,
you'll become more famous.

34
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:29,132
I know, right? Doctor Ye's
girlfriend must be happy

35
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:32,068
that his boyfriend is so capable.

36
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:37,607
But, I've never seen you talk on the
phone with your girlfriend before.

37
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,442
Are you really dating?

38
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:43,980
I'm sure they're lovey dovey
and doing just fine.

39
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,316
May I give you some advice?

40
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,518
Please don't make me
repeat the same advice.

41
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,921
I already told you to
mind your own business.

42
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,124
That's right. Stop it already.

43
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:59,095
But I thought the production crew was
coming today. When are they coming?

44
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,232
- There they are.
- What?

45
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,301
Get out there.

46
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,270
Hello.

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,208
This is Doctor Ye. You know him, right?

48
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,211
- Yes.
- Camera.

49
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,979
Cue.

50
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:20,650
Then, I'll explain the most
basic concepts first.

51
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,488
In sling therapy, cognitive
memory is very important.

52
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,557
And this is how it works.

53
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,594
Okay, there are many types of patients

54
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:34,631
and these slings can help all of them.

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,366
He's so cool.

56
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,970
Do you think he'll become famous for
being a handsome physical therapist?

57
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,707
I know, right? He's no joke.

58
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:47,477
But shouldn't we get them some drinks?

59
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,347
- Yes, I'll do that.
- Okay.

60
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:54,217
- That's pretty much it.
- That's all we needed.

61
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,720
- Thank you for your efforts.
- Thank you for your efforts.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,658
But, when you come to the studio
and talk about osteoarthritis exercise

63
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,161
it'd be nice to have another physical
therapist. Do you have anyone?

64
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,665
- Please have these drinks.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,737
It wouldn't be bad for another physical
therapist to do a demonstration.

66
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,975
This person. I think Doctor
Woo would be perfect.

67
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,243
Pardon?

68
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:27,117
Wait, what was that?

69
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,789
What is this? Am I really
going to be on TV?

70
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,792
What do I do? Should I do a face mask?

71
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,400
Then, am I going to be
the demonstration model?

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,304
Yes, I feel like a physical therapist
would show more accurate movements

73
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:49,239
than an average person.

74
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:53,576
Also, can you prepare
a one-minute exercise?

75
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,912
It'd be nice if you can do a segment

76
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:58,181
for the end of the show.

77
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:01,651
We're thinking of uploading
that clip on our homepage too.

78
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,620
Wow. Really?

79
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,723
But, I don't know if I'll do a good job.

80
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,892
You will.

81
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,263
With visuals like yours

82
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:16,099
our program will become quite popular.

83
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,435
No way. That's not true.

84
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,277
What do I do?

85
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:37,687
Thank you, Doctor Ye.
I'm benefiting a lot from my boyfriend.

86
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,255
May I give you some advice?

87
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:43,793
Don't think that this is thanks to me.
This is completely your doing.

88
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:44,861
Pardon?

89
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,198
Do you really think I recommended
you because you're my girlfriend?

90
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:51,968
I recommended you because I think
you're the most hardworking

91
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,938
and skilled physical therapist
in this treatment room.

92
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,650
I see.

93
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,919
Anyway, thank you.

94
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,989
I'll work really hard.

95
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,862
That's right, Mom. I'm going to be on TV.

96
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:23,633
No, I won't become famous.
But this is a good opportunity.

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,071
Yeah. Thanks, Mom. I'll call you later.

98
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,044
It'd be really nice

99
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,281
to be on TV, to be on TV.

100
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:43,720
I can't believe I'm going to be
on TV with Doctor Ye.

101
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,632
- What are you doing?
- What?

102
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,400
Nothing.

103
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:08,611
She's dying of happiness
about being on TV.

104
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:12,882
Don't worry about whether or not
she's happy. Get over her.

105
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:23,326
Shin Min Ho, Senior Kim wants to
pay you back for the meal last time

106
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,896
by treating you to lunch today.
See you on the roof in 30 minutes.

107
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:29,632
Nam Woo, you can come too,
since you know Senior Kim.

108
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,372
Hello.

109
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,942
- It looks good.
- I know, right?

110
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:42,679
Let's take a look at the menu.

111
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,148
- Oh, Nam Woo's coming too.
- Really?

112
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,218
Wow, what should we get?
They all look delicious.

113
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,822
Is lemon cream chicken better?
That one over there.

114
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,892
Or are spicy rice cakes better?

115
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,462
Lemon cream chicken is good though.
Spicy rice cakes are good too.

116
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:04,601
There's a combo with
both dishes included.

117
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:07,403
You're Solomon after all.
I'll take two of these to go.

118
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,639
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

119
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,444
Hey, you were so excited about confessing
to her. Did she get a boyfriend already?

120
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,914
No way. Is that why you were
so irritable for the last few days?

121
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,450
Why did you have to bring this up?

122
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,385
They'll end up finding out anyway.

123
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:26,589
And talking to people about it
helps with the healing process.

124
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,958
- I know from experience.
- That's right, Min Ho, Min Ho.

125
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,828
I've also been in one-sided
love until not long ago.

126
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,930
I did a lot of studying
to get over the pain.

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,301
Do you want to know how
you can get over her quickly?

128
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:42,071
- How I can get over her?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,941
According to a study
from Harvard University

130
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,911
love roots from loneliness.

131
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,679
Especially when your body is lonely.

132
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,681
In other words, when you
lack physical intimacy.

133
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,715
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

134
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:55,852
Basically, if you have physical
intimacy, you won't feel lonely

135
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:59,989
and if you don't feel lonely,
you can get over her quickly.

136
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:04,127
No way. How can he have
physical intimacy without a girl?

137
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:09,999
Who says it has to be a girl?
You can hug and kiss Min Ho.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,069
- That's right.
- What?

139
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:19,676
Okay. I'll let you hug and kiss me.

140
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,380
Do it.

141
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,154
Okay, fine. I can do that for a friend.

142
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,792
I'm kidding.

143
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,528
That's nonsense.

144
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,196
Let's eat.

145
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:43,232
Okay. Let's eat. Eat up.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,768
Wow, this looks good.

147
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:49,639
This is good.

148
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,308
Really? Are you going to be on TV?

149
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:56,813
Yes. I'm on to be on Health Plus on TVM.

150
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,649
- Please remember to watch it.
- Oh, of course.

151
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,018
I'll watch it for sure. Do a good job.

152
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,252
I will.

153
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,858
Doctor Woo, when you're finished

154
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,261
meet me in my office with Doctor Kim.

155
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,796
Okay.

156
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,968
Pardon? You want me to go on the show?

157
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:22,572
But Doctor Ye asked Doctor Woo for help.

158
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:26,342
I know. But when I told the director

159
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:29,145
he told me to send you,
since you're a full-time employee.

160
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,347
That show will go on for three months.

161
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:34,651
But Doctor Woo's contract
will end before then.

162
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,220
A full-time position could
free up before then.

163
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,423
He said that won't happen this year.

164
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:44,193
That means Doctor Woo has to
transfer to another hospital

165
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:49,365
and a doctor from another hospital
can't promote our hospital on TV.

166
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:53,369
He doesn't want to switch
her out midway either.

167
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:57,006
- Oh, I see.
- I'm sorry, Doctor Woo.

168
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,575
That's okay. There's nothing we can do.

169
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:04,480
I don't know. I can't do it.
I feel bad for Doctor Woo.

170
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,384
That's okay, Doctor.
I'm okay. Please do it.

171
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:11,187
But what do I tell Doctor Ye?

172
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,257
He'll definitely say,
"May I give you some advice?"

173
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,494
"Don't interfere in my decisions.",
as he glares at me...

174
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:21,898
like this. I'm too scared to tell him.

175
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:26,169
- I'll tell him then.
- Really?

176
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:28,638
Then can make it sound like

177
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:32,375
you don't want to do it anymore?

178
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,645
I'm afraid Doctor Ye will go to
the director and cause a scene.

179
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,847
Aren't you being too mean to Doctor Woo?

180
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,982
That's okay, Doctor.

181
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:43,252
Sure, I'll tell him that.

182
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,422
I'll be going now.

183
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,393
Wait, Bo Young...

184
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't believe this situation.

185
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:20,590
Geez, what are you saying
all of a sudden?

186
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:25,361
I can't do the show in Bo Young's
place. I feel so bad for her.

187
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:30,066
If you need a full-time employee
to do it, how about Doctor Park?

188
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:35,171
Doctor Park likes to lead
so he'll like being on TV.

189
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,540
Doctor Park doesn't have
the time for that right now.

190
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,343
- He even took a paid holiday.
- Why?

191
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:45,081
You know his wife got fired, right?
It looks like she'll stay at home now

192
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:47,917
so he went to take his mother
back home to the countryside

193
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,520
because she doesn't have to
take care of the twins anymore.

194
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,422
Didn't she move here for good?

195
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,191
Why don't they just live together?

196
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,662
He feels bad because they can't
give her spending money anymore

197
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:03,533
and his wife doesn't want her to stay.

198
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,136
They've never gotten along.

199
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,972
Doctor Park must be very upset.

200
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:11,941
What will he do?

201
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,379
Mom, you're sad, aren't you?

202
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:22,819
I'm sorry. I even asked you to take care
of the twins until elementary school.

203
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:26,022
- But things turned out this way.
- That's okay.

204
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:30,860
I only took care of them because they're
my grandchildren. It's very difficult.

205
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,299
Especially if they're twins.
I'm happy to be free.

206
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,672
But what will you do now? You already
sold your farm before moving here.

207
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:46,542
And I can't give you spending money...

208
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,347
that I used to give you
for taking care of the twins.

209
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:53,749
Hey, don't worry.

210
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,019
I can go to your aunt's and help her out.

211
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:02,758
I won't have to spend as much money
down there, so I can support myself.

212
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:09,232
Plus, I didn't sell the house,
so I have a place to sleep.

213
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,667
Don't worry about me.

214
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,776
- I'll see you at the same time tomorrow.
- Be careful.

215
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,411
Please get back safely.

216
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:27,483
Chief, who's that?

217
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,552
Why does he have a secretary?

218
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:33,990
Don't you know him?
That's Congressman Han Sung Chul.

219
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,626
The one that's always on the news?

220
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:42,231
That's right. First, it was an athlete,
and now it's a congressman.

221
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:45,568
Doctor Ye is really impressive.

222
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:48,170
My boyfriend is that capable

223
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,809
while his girlfriend lost an opportunity
for being a terminal contractor.

224
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,446
In any case, I can't
get a full-time job here.

225
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,715
What do I do now?

226
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,222
Okay.

227
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:15,798
Hello.

228
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:19,669
Oh no, you didn't eat your lunch.

229
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,940
You can't keep skipping meals.
What if you collapse?

230
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,943
I don't have an appetite.

231
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:30,680
But you need to eat
to recover your energy.

232
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,983
In any case, don't skip your meal
tomorrow. Promise me.

233
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:39,455
Since you promised me,
let's begin the examination.

234
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:43,025
Okay, please relax, just like that.

235
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,397
Okay. Please lie down comfortably.

236
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,636
Please hold your breath.
I'll take it now.

237
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,671
Okay, all done.

238
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:59,942
Mother, remember to eat, okay?

239
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,679
I'm worried about that patient.
She keeps skipping meals.

240
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,881
She lost so much weight.

241
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,652
Can't you see that your junior
lost a lot of weight too?

242
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:12,288
I've lost a lot of weight these days.

243
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:15,691
You're right. Our Joo Yong,
Joo Yong's a lot thinner too.

244
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,626
Do you have a worry, Joo Yong, Joo Yong?

245
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,295
No, it's not that.

246
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:23,032
I'm studying really hard
to get into graduate school.

247
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:26,235
I don't have time to eat
properly because of that.

248
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:31,340
Hey, you need to eat while you study.

249
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,245
Okay. I'll buy you
pork belly. It's on me.

250
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:40,716
Is chicken soup with ginseng better for
your recovery? I'll buy you that instead.

251
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:44,687
Is pork belly better? Is chicken
soup with ginseng better?

252
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,990
That's okay. I'm tired of eating out.

253
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,060
I just want to eat my mom's cooking.

254
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,332
Oh, come to think of it, my mom hasn't
given me side dishes in a while.

255
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,934
She usually sends me some every week.

256
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:07,043
Hi, Mom. I want your glass
noodles, cooked beans

257
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:10,046
and grilled short rib patties.
Can you send it to me today?

258
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:13,049
Oh, I'm sorry.

259
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm enjoying the flowers with
my friends today, so I can't.

260
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,156
Really? Then send it to me tomorrow.

261
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:23,893
I have a gathering tomorrow, so I can't.

262
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,662
Then what about the day after?

263
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,398
You have plans? What the heck?

264
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:32,535
I'm studying my ass off
to get into graduate school

265
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:37,006
while you can't make me food
because you're having too much fun?

266
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:39,241
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

267
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,416
This is good. I didn't
want to do the show

268
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,253
but if we do it together,
it'll become a good memory.

269
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:54,590
Um, Doctor Ye.

270
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,494
I don't think I can do the show.

271
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,330
I feel more burdened
the more I think about it.

272
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,870
But I'll be right there with you,
so you don't have to feel burdened.

273
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,573
I thought you were excited
to be on TV, so why...

274
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,308
I was...

275
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,745
but my heart keeps pounding really hard.

276
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:20,116
You even recommended me.

277
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:25,454
I'm sorry for being like this,
but please understand.

278
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,792
Sure. If you feel that burdened,
there's nothing we can do.

279
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,794
Thank you.

280
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,531
- Please eat.
- Okay.

281
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,470
Go inside already.

282
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,141
Go first. I want to see you off.

283
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:48,043
Ugh, you're still so stubborn.

284
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:52,982
- I should go so you can rest.
- Go on. Go on.

285
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,651
I'll go.

286
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,503
Geez.

287
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:21,043
I wish she'd go inside.

288
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,296
What's this?

289
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,166
Oh no...

290
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,402
Mom...

291
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:14,563
Goodness, what do I do?
I can't forget about my babies.

292
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:54,837
To the magpie that came every morning...

293
00:20:55,671 --> 00:21:01,443
and sang before you left.

294
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:09,718
Once I leave, come back...

295
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,391
and comfort my parents.

296
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:22,364
Who will take care of my old parents...

297
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:29,171
after I leave?

298
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:42,951
Why is my trip back to Seoul so long?

299
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:49,992
[From Kim Min Ki's
"The Road to Seoul..."]

300
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,195
Hello?

301
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:57,199
Hello, Doctor Ye. This is the general
affairs office at Shinsun Hospital.

302
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,902
Oh, hello. What is this about?

303
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:04,073
I just called you to remind you that
once your contract ends in two months

304
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:09,078
you'll have to move out of your
dorm in two months as well.

305
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,548
Sure, I'll remember that.

306
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,733
Anyway, thank you.

307
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,435
I'll work really hard.

308
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,539
But my heart keeps pounding really hard.

309
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,509
You even recommended me.

310
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,881
I'm sorry for being like this,
but please understand.

311
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,831
Is something the matter?

312
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,035
Pardon? No.

313
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,140
This coffee's really good.

314
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:43,105
I must have mistaken you
for a friend for a little while

315
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,341
because we were never meant to get along.

316
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,845
I shouldn't have acknowledged you
when you showed up again.

317
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,847
Do you know that, you jerk?

318
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,081
- You're here.
- Yes.

319
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:31,053
I'm really sorry, Bo Young.

320
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,722
You missed a good opportunity
because of me.

321
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,593
That's not true. Don't say
that. I'm really okay.

322
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:41,430
I felt really bad so I did some research.

323
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,533
Do you know Woojoo Hospital?
It's just as big as our hospital.

324
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:50,272
I saw a post saying that a full-time
position freed up at their hospital.

325
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:53,675
- Do you want to apply for it?
- Of course, I do.

326

I'll check it out right now.

327

Look at how happy she is
about a full-time job opportunity.

328
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:09,758
I hope she gets the job this time.

329
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,297
That's right. They say there's always
a way out of the worst situations.

330
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:19,334
I'll get this full-time job
no matter what.

- You're here.
- If you feel any pain or discomfort

please let me know.

If you hold it in, you'll avoid the pain,
which will yield an abnormal result.

I see. By the way, I heard
you're going to be on TV today.

- Pardon?
- I heard from the other doctors.

- Oh, thank you.

and Doctor Kim's first show

You can come right afterward.

Hey.

You should have told him you have
an interview. Why did you lie?

366
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,853
Because I'll be embarrassed
if I don't get the job.

Anyway, keep it a secret, Big Sis.

Pardon?

373
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:49,551
Oh, my mom said she wanted to see me.

374
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:53,121
Then I'll skip the dinner
and drive you there.

375
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:56,692
Don't do that. This dinner is for you.

376
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,596
In any case, I'm sad that I can't
watch the show with you.

377
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,433
I'll watch it afterward.

378
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:38,166
Oh, Nurse Choi, did Patient
Kim Jung Sook wake up?

379
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:41,803
Yes, she's okay now. She was
exhausted due to malnutrition.

380
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,306
- Pardon? Malnutrition?
- Yes.

381
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,541
I noticed that she wasn't
eating for a few days.

382
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,277
I think you should stress
this to her guardian.

383
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:53,281
Tell her to make her eat more
so that she doesn't get sick.

384
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:57,853
But the truth is, she's not eating
because of her guardian.

385
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:01,923
- What do you mean by that?
- Patient Kim Jung Sook is a paraplegic.

386
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:05,927
So her daughter helps her go
everywhere as her guardian

387
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:09,331
but she worries that her daughter
will struggle if she's too heavy.

388
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,801
- Pardon?
- And if she eats, it'll come back out

389
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:16,605
which her daughter will have to clean up.

390
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,508
That's why she hasn't been eating.

391
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:29,217
Hey, Young Chul. It's been
a long time. What is it?

392
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:33,054
I was reminded of you
when I saw your mother today.

393
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:35,857
But why is your mother hospitalized?

394
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,326
What? Hospitalized?

395
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:42,397
Isn't it true? I thought
I saw her at our hospital.

396
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:45,901
- Isn't she hospitalized here?
- What?

397
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,936
I'll call you back.

398
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,347
Why isn't she picking up?

399
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:04,886
Hi, Mom. Are you hospitalized
at Jinsung Hospital?

400
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,223
Wa... wait, how did you know?

401
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,793
Why? Why are you hospitalized?

402
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:15,030
It's not a big deal.
It was a simple procedure

403
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,933
of removing a small
abnormality in my uterus.

404
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:21,036
Why didn't you tell me?
You should have told me.

405
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:25,340
What for? You're busy trying to
get into graduate school.

406
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,012
Why would I worry a kid
who's really busy studying?

407
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:35,650
You still should have told me.

408
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,054
I didn't know that and complained
about you not sending me food.

409
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:42,290
Then, are you okay now?

410
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,494
- Did the surgery go well?
- I'm just fine.

411
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,505
Okay, Mom. Get some rest.

for Patient Kim Jung Sook

413
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:33,675

buy her a healthy juice or a snack?

414
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:37,345
They both sound good to me.
Do what you think is best.

415
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,650
I don't think there's anything
greater than a mother's love.

416
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,120
She didn't eat for days
in fear of troubling her child.

417
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,791
I guess mothers would rather
strain their own bodies

418
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:53,228
than make their children
go through a hard time.

420

Okay.

and he chose a Korean beef place.

- Korean Beef Village?
- Beef?

paying for it, aren't you?

no interest in working here.

intended on hiring anyone anyway

who's really good at disk surgery.

465
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,042
There is. Why?

466
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:12,280
A client of mine wants to
have him do her surgery

467
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,184
but he has so many patients
that she has to wait months.

468
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:20,355
She asked me if you can use
your connections to help her out.

469
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:22,991
Can you do that?

470
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,161
Mom. I told you I'm not in
the position to do those things.

471
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:31,232
Why not? When I said you're a physical
therapist at a huge hospital in Seoul

472
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:35,503
and that you're going to be on TV,
they all said you succeeded.

473
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,606
Make me proud, will you?

474
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:42,410
Succeeded? Does it look like I succeeded?

475
00:37:43,578 --> 00:37:46,180
I can't do the show
because I'm a contractor.

476
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,051
And my contract is almost over,
so I have to quit soon

477
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:54,088
and once I move out of my dorm,
I'll be no different from a beggar.

478
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:57,025
What kind of power do I have
to get her an earlier surgery date?

479
00:37:57,025 --> 00:38:00,828
How can I help anyone else
when I'm struggling myself?

480
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,501
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

481
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,023
Did you arrive in Anseong?

482
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:33,161
Eat lots of good food and have
a fun time with your mother.

483
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,998
I wanted to get a full-time job
so I could act dignified.

484
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,067
It looks like I lost my chance again.

485
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:47,775
Wait, why isn't he at the dinner?

486
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,850
Hey, hurry up already.

487
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,686
Never mind. Go and buy
some cold medicine.

488
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:01,222
You skipped the dinner
by saying you're sick.

489
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:03,858
You're tiring me out.

490
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:26,948
I can't even turn on
the lights if I go home.

491
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,854
I'll stay here and de-stress.

492
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,667
Those bastards shouldn't
fool around with interviews.

493
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,137
Die. Die, die, die!

494
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:57,812
Eating is the best way to de-stress.

495
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:02,283
Die! Die! Die!

496
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:03,718
Look at you.

497
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:16,597
Die.

498
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,301
Die! Die!

499
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,072
Since scoliosis is a type of back pain

500
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,741
isn't that a problem with the back disk?

501
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,778
No. That's why we'll learn
about scoliosis today.

502
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:34,715
We invited a professional
who'll teach us in more detail.

503
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:38,252
Eating is the best way to de-stress.

504
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:41,956
- Wow, that man is so handsome.
- He's really handsome.

505
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,992
I'm a physical therapist, Ye Jae Wook.

506
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,762
That's right.

507
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,299
It's time for Doctor Ye's show.

508
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,801
[He graduated from NYU!
He wrote SCI-level papers!]

509
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:56,170
[He's the youngest national
lecturer of sling therapy.]

510
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,140
That man must be very impressive.

511
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,376
I know, right? If he's on TV,
he must make good money.

512
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,112
I want him as my son-in-law.
He probably has a girlfriend, right?

513
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:07,482
Goodness, I'm sure he does.

514
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,851
They say birds of
a feather flock together.

515
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:13,821
I'm sure he's dating a successful
woman with a great salary.

516
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:16,023
Probably.

517
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:29,003
Bo Young, I'm sorry
I was unreasonable.

518
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:32,807
It seems like I'm burdening you
when I should be helping you instead.

519
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:35,643
But, don't worry too much.

520
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:39,847
I'll do whatever I can to get you
money for a small apartment.

521
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:42,583
Cheer up, my daughter.

522
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,918
You look good on TV, Doctor Ye.

523
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,853
Yes, he doesn't seem nervous either.

524
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:22,690
Can you show us a simple
stretch we can all do?

525
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,060
Wow, Doctor Kim must be coming up.

526
00:42:26,928 --> 00:42:28,629
What's that?

527
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:34,068
We will show you an exercise
for scoliosis prevention.

528
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,771
You like you came from the underworld.

529
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,874
Let's begin. First...

530
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,176
I mean, I'm scared
it'll pop up in my dreams.

531
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,880
Doctor Ye, didn't you
give her some advice?

532
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,884
I did, many times.

533
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,192
I heard that you have to put on a lot
of makeup to look average on TV

534
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,795
so I put on a little more.

535
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:05,132
If you put on anymore, you would have
given the viewers a heart attack.

536
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:09,570
- Is it that bad?
- There goes the hospital's reputation.

537
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:16,110
Hi, Ji Eun. Oh, did you see it?

538
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,812
My makeup?

539
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:21,983
Hey, you wench. I was startled too.

540
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,452
Yeah.

541
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,522
What? Woo Bo Young?

542
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,526
Why?

543
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,930
Bo Young caused a scene
at her interview?

544
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,598
Why?

545
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,136
Oh, really?

546
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:48,643
Okay. Sure, let's talk later.

547
00:43:48,643 --> 00:43:50,678
Doctor Kim.

548
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:53,381
- What did you just say?
- What do you mean?

549
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,951
- Did Doctor Woo have an interview?
- Pardon?

550
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,153
- What did you just say?
- What do you mean?

551
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:02,356
- Did Doctor Woo have an interview?
- Pardon?

552
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:08,896
Bo Young wanted to keep it a secret
in fear or not getting the job.

553
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,133
Oh well. I don't see why
you shouldn't know.

554
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:16,370
Bo Young's contract at our
hospital is almost over

555
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,941
so she went to an interview,
but they had someone in mind.

556
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:25,479
This happened after she lost her TV
opportunity for being a contractor.

557
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:27,882
- What will she do?
- Are you saying...

558
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:31,786
Doctor Woo didn't voluntarily
turn the opportunity down?

559
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:33,154
Pardon?

560
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:44,632
- Yes, Director.
- I saw the show.

561
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:49,537
The broadcast station wants you
to stay on the show for good.

562
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:53,941
- You can do that, right?
- No, I only agreed to three months.

563
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,712
Hey, just think about how it'll promote--

564
00:44:57,712 --> 00:45:02,083
May I give you some advice?
Please don't try to change my mind.

565
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:07,354
I will no longer allow you to pressure
me in such a dogmatic manner.

566
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,656
Yes, it's finally time to rest.

567
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,360
Oh no.

568
00:45:47,128 --> 00:45:52,533
I can't believe Mom did this by herself
when it's so difficult with both of us.

569
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,437
By the way, give Mom a call.

570
00:45:56,437 --> 00:46:01,008
I have a feeling she wants to hear your
voice because she asks about you.

571
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,946
I'll call her later. I'm too tired
from watching the kids all day.

572
00:46:06,547 --> 00:46:08,015
Okay.

573
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,919
By the way, did you cancel the
automatic transfer to your mother?

574
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:13,287
No, not yet.

575
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,990
I told you to cancel it
before the next transfer.

576
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,895
Speaking of which, can't we send her
a little bit of money every month?

577
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:24,265
Are you kidding? We have to live off
of your paychecks from now on.

578
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:28,536
We can barely afford to pay for the kids'
expenses. Cancel it right away.

579
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,171
Fine.

580
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,010
[Transfers]

581
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,447
[Cancel automatic transfer]

582
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:47,855
[The automatic transfer
has been cancelled.]

583
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:54,328
Hey, Jae Hoon.

584
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,699
Professor Seo Dong Gyun's
number? I have it.

585
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:02,336
I'll text it to you when I find it.

586
00:47:05,673 --> 00:47:09,076
I had his business card somewhere.

587
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:28,095
Shi Won, I saved up the spending
money you gave me every month.

588
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:32,766
You said they raised your security
deposit too. It's not much, but use it.

589
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,303
The PIN number is your birthday, okay?

590
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:38,505
Cheer up, my son.

"'Ah.' It was not okay
for mothers to do that."

617
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:25,165
Bo Young's contract at our
hospital is almost over

618
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:30,304
so she went to an interview,
but they had someone in mind.

619
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:36,143
But, why are you going to Anseong?

620
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:37,744
Pardon?

621
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:41,582
Oh, my mom said she wanted to see me.

622
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:46,887
This happened after she lost her TV
opportunity for being a contractor.

623
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:51,692
I don't think I can do the show.

624
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,428
I feel more burdened
the more I think about it.

625
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:15,382
I'd be back from Anseong
at around this time.

626
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,856
My key. I must have
left it in the restaurant.

627
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:25,726
What the heck? There's only 12,000 won.

628
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,428
Her clothes are decent though.

629
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,231
- This?
- Throw those away.

630
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,301
What are you doing?

631
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:36,470
Damn it! Run!

632
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:40,841
Hey, stop right there!

633
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,944
Stop right there!

634
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,517
Hey! I'll kill you!

635
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:13,240
I was really robbed.

636
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,277
I'm sorry. Can't I go home and transfer
it to you? I'll pay for the eggs too.

637
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,780
Do you know how many people
say that and run away?

638
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,616
Forget it. You can't leave until you pay.

639
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,785
I understand.

640
00:53:29,056 --> 00:53:32,459
Why isn't Yoon Joo picking up?

641
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,561
I'm running out of battery.

- What?
- Hey, Cry Baby Bo Young.

644
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,342
Um...

645
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:52,980
About how petty I was to you...

646
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,517
during the weekend trip,
I want to sincerely apologize.

647
00:53:57,517 --> 00:53:59,853
- Forgive me.
- Forget it.

648
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:02,256
Do you think I'll forgive you...

649
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:07,361
I will. Hey, I'll forgive you if you
come here with some money.

650
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:10,330
What? Where are you?

00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:16,703
Hey.

652
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:19,439
What happened to you?

653
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,278
I thought you went down to Anseong.

654
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,690
Doctor Woo, I know
I'm lacking in many ways

655
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,927
but I want to be a comfortable
person whom you can lean on

656
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:43,697
and tell everything to.

657

- It's all wrapped up.
- Great, thank you.

The phone is currently turned off.
Please leave a message--

659
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:26,273
Thanks. I'll wash this
and return it to you later.

660
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:31,578
Hey, why didn't you call Doctor Ye
in such an urgent situation?

661
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,613
How could I do that?

662
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:38,285
Doctor Ye doesn't know about the
interview. He thinks I'm in Anseong.

663
00:55:38,285 --> 00:55:43,457
And how could I let him see me in the
state that I was in? It's embarrassing.

664
00:55:43,457 --> 00:55:47,994
Aren't you embarrassed in front of me?
I thought you were in Anseong too.

665
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:50,597
Why are you telling me the truth?

666
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,432
That's because...

667
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:54,901
it's you.

668
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:58,338
Seeing how I asked for your help
as soon as you called me

669
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:01,074
after we fought as if we'd
never see each other again

670
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:03,910
I must feel comfortable with you.

671
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,979
Let's go inside.

672
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:07,514
Hey.

673
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:12,819
Can you really be happy with Doctor Ye?

674
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:14,421
What?

675
00:56:15,155 --> 00:56:19,159
Can it last long if you feel
uncomfortable with him?

676
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:21,595
If you truly love him and like him

677
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:25,766
shouldn't you be comfortable enough
to show him everything about you?

678
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,236
Just like how you are with me.

679
00:56:29,236 --> 00:56:30,604
What?

680
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:36,610
I was going to try to remain friends

681
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,412
but I can't do that anymore.

682

Hey, what are you saying?

683
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,522
I like you.

684
00:56:49,356 --> 00:56:53,627
I've felt this way for a while
and I wanted to tell you...

685
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:57,931
but when I saw you liking Doctor Ye...

686
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,601
I felt hesitant.

687
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:06,573
But, if you can't call him
in such urgent situations

688
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:08,975
and you feel this
uncomfortable with him...

689
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,447
I can't let you go.

690
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:17,851
Please stop.

691
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:28,862
I clearly asked you to get over her.

00:57:30,764 --> 00:57:34,668
that I can't accept that
Bo Young is dating you.

Bo Young, since we're dating,
let's drop the formalities.

703

- What do you think, Bo Young?
- "Bo Young?" What's this?

Shi Won. Yoon Joo.

- Myung Chul.
- What's wrong with you?

706
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:58,318
If you're so uncomfortable with Doctor Ye
that you can show him your true self

then I won't let you go.

Since I've decided to be
comfortable with you

710
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,096
I'll tell you.
I appreciate your gesture, but I can't.

711

We won't have to date secretly within
the workplace for that much longer.

Follow me.

What's with that face? I wanted to
make a good memory with you.
