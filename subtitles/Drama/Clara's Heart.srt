CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
    WARNER BROS., INC.

2
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,490
CLACK, CLACK, STEP
    ABOUT, THE MAID IS HERE.

3
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,810
MAID IS HERE.

4
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,310
COME BACK LATER.

5
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,810
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TO DO.

6
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,810
BUT YOU GOT YOUR
        "DO NOT DISTURB" SIGN

7
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
ON THE DOOR
        FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT.

8
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
AT LEAST LET ME
            DRAW THE CURTAINS.

9
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
PLEASE DON'T.
JUST LEAVE THEM.

10
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,320
YOU DON'T LIKE
                OUR ISLAND?

11
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,990
HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

12
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,330
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU STILL HERE?

13
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,330
YES, MISS.

14
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,340
I HAVE A RAZOR
ON THE TABLE BY THE BED.

15
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,810
COULD YOU BRING IT
TO ME?

16
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,640
YES, MISS.

17
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,980
[HUMMING]

18
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,830
WE FINALLY
MEET FACE TO FACE

19
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,830
WITH YOU
IN THE BATHTUB

20
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,100
WHERE YOU APPEAR
TO HAVE BEEN DEAD.

21
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,830
I DON'T SEE
WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKE

22
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,800
IF YOU MISSED
A SPOT OR NOT.

23
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
YOU DON'T
LEAVE THE ROOM.

24
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,940
I TELL YOU TRUE,
MISSUS.

25
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,970
YOU GOT TO BUST UP
THE GLOOMY.

26
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,480
THANK YOU.

27
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,310
I ASKED YOU NOT TO OPEN
        THE CURTAINS.

28
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,810
SOMETIME I THINK

29
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I KNOW WHAT'S BEST
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

30
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,220
IT'S A FLAW I'VE
LEARNED TO LIVE WITH.

31
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
I'M HUNGRY.

32
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,830
ARE YOU?

33
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,460
YES. I HAVEN'T EATEN
            A THING ALL DAY.

34
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,800
HOW ABOUT I ORDER YOU UP
SOMETHIN' TO EAT?

35
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,470
ALL RIGHT.

37
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,810
YES. THIS IS CLARA MAYFIELD
IN BUNGALOW B.

38
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,810
COULD YOU SEND ME UP
A TRADITIONAL PLATTER

39
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,810
WITH A SIDE
OF CHO CHO?

40
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,310
I GOT A LADY HERE
GREW UP IN JAMAICA

41
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,180
LONGIN' FOR THE TASTE.

42
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,480
CHA, MAN.
THANK YOU.

43
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,460
COME IN NOW.
FOOD IS READY.

44
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,800
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
WE'LL THROW IT AWAY.

45
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
YOU'RE ON VACATION.

46
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
YOU'RE ALLOWED
A LITTLE CAPRICE.

47
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
THAT LOOKS LIKE
                SCRAMBLED EGGS.

48
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,810
NO. YOU MUST TASTE IT FIRST
BEFORE YOU SAY THAT.

49
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,310
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

50
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,810
GOOD CIGAR.

51
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,980
YOU CAN GET IT FRESH
IN PORT ANTONIO.

52
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,050
MAYBE I'LL HIRE A DRIVER
        AND SEE THE TOWN.

53
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,820
DON'T HIRE A DRIVER.
            JUST TAKE THE BUS.

54
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,620
IT RUNS BY THE HOTEL
            EVERY DAY.

55
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,790
YOU NEED YOUR FEET
            AND A FEW CENTS.

56
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,790
I HAVE TO GO.

57
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,290
THANK YOU, CLARA.

58
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,160
YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND.

59
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,790
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT
            TO BE KIND.

60
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,460
NOW TAKE YOURSELF OUT
        AND BUST UP THE GLOOMY.

61
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,800
EXCUSE ME.

62
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
YEAH?

63
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
DO YOU KNOW
CLARA MAYFIELD?

64
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
SHE LOOKING
    FOR CLARA MAYFIELD.

65
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,170
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

66
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,810
WHERE DID YOU
                GET HER NAME?

67
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,770
I MET HER
AT MY HOTEL.

68
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
MAMA,

69
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,280
THIS LADY DON'T
        KNOW THE SONG.

70
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,650
¶ IN JAMAICA, REMEMBER
    WHEN THE ANGELS FALL ¶

71
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,780
¶ I AS BABYLON,
        BUT MISS CLARA-- ¶

72
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,220
DON'T BE RUDE.

73
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,290
WHAT'S HAPPENED
                TO MISS CLARA

74
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,290
ISN'T THIS
                LADY'S BUSINESS.

75
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,790
IF YOU MUST ASK
                FOR HER,

76
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,960
IT'S BEST TO ASK
                ELSEWHERE.

77
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,800
I WISH I'D KNOWN YOU'D
        BE IN TOWN YESTERDAY.

78
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I WOULD HAVE MET YOU.

79
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,270
NO, REALLY?

80
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,770
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
                COULD IT BE?

81
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,780
WHAT DID YOU DO
YESTERDAY?

82
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,780
I WENT TO CHURCH.
            THEN I CAME HOME,

83
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,780
WROTE LETTERS
                TO MY FRIENDS
                IN BALTIMORE.

84
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
WE LIVE JUST OUTSIDE
BALTIMORE.

85
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,280
NO, REALLY?

86
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,290
MY BEST FRIEND OWNS
        A BEAUTY SALON THERE,

87
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,790
AND OTHER FRIENDS
            WORK FOR HER.

88
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,790
SHALL WE HAVE
                OUR TEA?

89
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,790
YOU DON'T MIND
IF THEY SEE YOU?

90
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
THEY COULD
                DISCHARGE ME.

91
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,030
I'VE LIVED
                THROUGH WORSE.

92
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,800
YOU'RE MARRIED,
AREN'T YOU, CLARA?

93
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,270
YES.

94
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,440
DOES YOUR HUSBAND
WORK IN TOWN?

95
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,270
I'M SORRY. I'M BEING
TOO INQUISITIVE.

96
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
NO, NO. HE WORKS

97
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY
            JUST NOW.

98
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
SO YOU'RE ALONE
RIGHT NOW?

99
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,780
BY CIRCUMSTANCE.

100
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,780
I NEVER ALLOW MYSELF
        TO GET TOO REGRETFUL.

101
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,290
NOBODY WANTS TO BE
            AROUND SOMEONE

102
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,790
WHO SPREADS
        BLACK CLOUDS AND DOOM.

103
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,960
YOU UNDERSTAND
                WHAT I MEAN.

104
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,290
YES, BUT YOU SEE,

105
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,630
MY BABY DIED
IN HER CRIB RECENTLY.

106
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
DIDN'T KNOW
                THE FACT,

107
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,730
BUT I KNEW
                THE SUBSTANCE.

108
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,200
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TERRIBLY RESILIENT.

109
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,540
THAT'LL COME IN TIME.

110
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,950
THANK YOU.

111
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,780
IT'S A FUNNY THING
            ABOUT BEING ALONE.

112
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,280
YOU START TO TALK
            TO YOURSELF.

113
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,290
THEN YOU STOP
                LISTENING,

114
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,390
AND THEN YOU FORGET
            THAT YOU'RE THERE.

115
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,530
I FIND THAT I GET
            INTO SUCH DULLNESS,

116
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,760
BUT YOU LET SOMEBODY
            CALL ME ON THE PHONE

117
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
AND TELL ME
            THEIR TROUBLES--

118
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,270
I CAN SAY
        SUCH MARVELOUS THINGS.

119
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,000
THINGS I DON'T KNOW
        WHERE THEY COME FROM

120
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,110
FALL FROM MY LIPS
        LIKE PIECES OF FRUIT,

121
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,780
AND I MUST PAUSE
            TO WONDER

122
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,280
WHO IS IT
            INSIDE OF ME

123
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,610
I DON'T EVEN
            KNOW IS THERE?

124
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,880
LEE?

125
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,450
OH, BILL.

126
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,450
COME MEET THE MOST
WONDERFUL PERSON.

127
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,260
MOM! DAD!

128
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,430
HI. HI.

129
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,260
HOW
                    YOU DOING?

130
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,270
GREAT. I'M GLAD
        YOU'RE BACK.

131
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,270
OLD GLENDA--
        SHE'S THE PITS.

132
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,270
WELL, WE'RE
LETTING HER GO.

133
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,270
REALLY?

134
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,770
YOU GREW.

135
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,770
HOW MANY BAR-UPS
                YOU DOING?

136
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,210
ABOUT FIVE.

137
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,780
LOOKIN' GOOD.

138
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,280
WHO'S THAT?

139
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,250
DAVID,
                THIS IS CLARA.

140
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,750
CLARA'S GOING TO

141
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,750
BE LIVING WITH US
            FROM NOW ON.

142
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,850
HELLO, DAVID.

143
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,750
YOU DON'T GOT TO
BE AFRAID OF ME.

144
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
ME NOT GONNA BITE YOU...

145
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,160
UNLESS YOU DON'T BEHAVE.

146
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,260
HERE, CLARA.

147
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,760
NO, THANK YOU.
I GOT IT.

148
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,200
OK, BIG GUY.
        CARRY THIS.

149
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,770

        TAUGHT ME THE JOY

295
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,290
OF LIVING FOR SOMEONE
    OTHER THAN MYSELF.

296
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,760
AND YET,
    WHEN HE WAS KILLED,

297
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,760
I CONTINUED TO SLEEP
    AND WAKE AND BREATHE,

298
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
AND IN MY AGONY
        AND MY ANGER

299
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I CONTAMINATED
    ANYONE AND EVERYONE

300
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,770
THAT HAD THE MISFORTUNE
        TO TOUCH ME.

301
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,270
SO AFTER I DEMOLISHED
        MY MARRIAGE,

302
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,270
I TRULY REALIZED

303
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,770
THAT IF I WASN'T
        GOING TO KILL MYSELF,

304
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,780
I HAD TO GET ON
        WITH MY LIVING.

305
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,780
SO ALL RIGHT,
IT'S A SORROW WITHOUT END,

306
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,280
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DIE
    THE REST OF OUR LIVES

307
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,250
TO PROVE THAT WE HURT
    OR THAT WE'RE LONELY.

308
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,920
SO ALL RIGHT.

309
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,260
WELL, THAT'S JUST
            TOO BAD, ISN'T IT?

310
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
I'M TELLING YOU,
                THAT'S IT.

311
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
CAN WE JUST
DROP IT?

312
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,260
I'M NOT DROPPING
                ANYTHING.

313
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,160
EDITH IS GONE.

314
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,260
IT'S NOT ABOUT EDITH.

315
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,270
LET'S STOP BLAMING
        EVERYTHING ON THE BABY.

316
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,270
IT'S JUST FINE
WITH ME.

317
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,270
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DUMP EVERYTHING ON NOW?

318
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,270
HMM?

319
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
IT'S NOT
                THE OTHER WOMEN.

320
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
IT'S NOT ANY ONE THING.

321
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,780
WHAT OTHER WOMEN?

322
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,780
IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM.

323
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,820
IT'S ABOUT US.

324
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,760
I REALIZED TODAY THAT'S
        WHY I GOT PREGNANT.

325
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,260
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
            CHANGE THINGS.

326
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,760
YOU WANT TO KNOW
        THE WORST OF IT, BILL?

327
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
THE WORST OF IT IS

328
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,070
WE'RE NOT EVEN
                FRIENDS ANYMORE.

329
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,930
WHEN WERE WE FRIENDS?
REALLY, WHEN?

330
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,740
ONCE.

331
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,240
THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

332
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,450
I'M TRYING
            TO CHANGE THINGS.

333
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,250
THAT'S FINE, LEE.

334
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,420
THAT HAS REAL MERIT,
BUT DON'T REDESIGN ME.

335
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,930
BLANCHE LOUDON.

336
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,270
OH, CLARA MAYFIELD.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

337
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,240

                LIKE A BABY.

338
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
CHA, MAN,
YOU'RE TO LIE.

339
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
COME AND SEE THE HOUSE.

340
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,740
HOUSE IS HOUSE.
THE TAXI'S WAITING.

341
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
TAXI WILL STAY.
            COME IN.

342
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,080
OH, CLARA. IT'S
            SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

343
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,690
THERE BE THE TORMENT
            OF ME EXISTENCE.

344
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,690

345
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,120
CHA, BOBO. ME NOT A TORMENT
    IN YOUR EXISTENCE.

346
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,030
IN DIS HOUSE DE TORMENT
        IS EVERYONE.

348
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,760
FOR CERTAIN
AS MUCH AS ME TORMENT HER.

349
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,770
WHERE HIM

350
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,730
ONLY ONE PLACE
I CAN THINK OF.

351
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,740
DON'T TALK THAT WAY.

352
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,240
ONLY LOW-CLASS PEOPLE
        TALK THAT WAY.

353
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,410
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.
COME ON.

354
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,740

00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,250
BLANCHE, THIS IS MRS. HART.
THAT'S MR. HART.

358
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,420
MORNIN'.

359
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,750
RICE FOR BREAKFAST?

360
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,250

                    VEGETABLES.

362
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,760
YOU WANT TO GET

363
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,730

                EXPERIMENT.
                YOU SAID OK.

¶ BROWN-SKINNED GIRLS

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,740
¶ BROWN-SKINNED GIRLS-- ¶

369
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
WHERE YOU LEARN
                THAT SONG?

370
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,580

            FROM ME HOMELAND.

373
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,750
SOMEBODY WILL THINK
            YOU LIKE ME.

374
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,750
CLARA, COME, MAN.
LET'S GO.

375
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,750
THE TAXI MAN
GET CHAKA-CHAKA.

376
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,720
WE'RE OFF TO THE WILDS
        OF BALTIMORE

377
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,730
TO HAVE
                A SWEET WEEKEND.

378
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,390
DON'T GET
                INDIGESTION.

379
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,400
GOOD AFTERNOON,
                EVERYONE.

380
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,740
<i> HELLO.</i></i>

381
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,240
<i> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME</i>
        <i> OUT THERE?</i></i>

382
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,240
<i> YES. LET'S GATHER</i>
    <i> AROUND UP HERE, PLEASE.</i></i>

383
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,250
<i> I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU</i>

386
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,520
<i> PETER EPSTEIN.</i></i>

387
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
COME ON IN.
        GET COMFORTABLE.

388
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,790
IT ONLY WORKS
    WHEN I CAN SEE YOUR EYES.

389
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,720
TODAY--LISTEN.
        TODAY, ONE DAY ONLY.

390
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,230
SPECIAL. SPECIAL.

391
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,260
WE ARE GATHERED HERE
        TO BURY SORROW,

392
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,260
NOT TO PRAISE
        AND WALLOW IN IT.

393
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,770
WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
    GATHERED HERE TODAY

394
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,570
TO CELEBRATE LIFE,

395
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,840
ENJOY THE WEATHER, THE DAY,
    THE FOOD, EACH OTHER.

396
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,010
IF ANY OF YOU ARE SO MOVED
        EVEN TO ACT SILLY--

397
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,810
SING SONGS, PLAY GAMES,
    ROLL IN THE GRASS--

398
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,410
YOU CAN DO IT BECAUSE TODAY
    I'M NOT YOUR THERAPIST.

399
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,620
I'M NOT YOUR GROUP LEADER.

400
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,320
NO, I'M A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY

401
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,820
WHO DREAMED OF SINGING
    IN A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND.

402
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,320
IF ANYONE WANTS TO JOIN ME,

403
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,990
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
    I ALMOST SUCCEEDED

404
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
EXCEPT FOR ONE SMALL
        DISABILITY--

405
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,160
I COULDN'T SING.

406
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,170
ALL RIGHT,
        LET'S BREAK, GO,

407
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,500
AND IMMEDIATELY COMMENCE
        TO HAVE FUN.

408
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,340
HI. WHAT'S
                    YOUR NAME?

409
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
SO AFTER MY SINGING CAREER

410
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,310
WENT INTO
THE PORCELAIN FACILITY,

411
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,320
FOR A TIME THERE, I THOUGHT
I WANTED TO BE A RABBI,

412
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,320
BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE
SITTING THROUGH BAR MITZVAHS

413
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,820
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE

414
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,490
OR THINKING OF GOD
AS A THREE-SYLLABLE WORD.

415
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,710
FIRST OF ALL,

416
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,210
LET'S NOT EXCLUDE
            THE WORD GUILT.

417
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,810
MOM?

418
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,810
DAVID, YOU KNOW
        DR. EPSTEIN.

419
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,310
HI. MOM, DAD AND I
WANT TO GO NOW.

420
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
CAN YOU GET A RIDE?

421
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,690
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME
        TO ASK ME THIS.

422
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,320
LET THEM GO.

423
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,590
ALL RIGHT.

424
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,720
GOOD MEETING YOU,
            DAVID.

425
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,320
NICE TO MEET YOU.

426
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,390
AS I WAS SAYING,
        GUILT, IT'S NECESSARY.

427
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,360
IT EXISTS FOR A REASON.

428
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,300
IT EXISTS FOR ANYONE

429
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,100
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
    BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

430
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,640
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE
        THE POLARITY...

431
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,300
WHAT YOU DOING?

432
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,800
TRYING TO FIND MYSELF
AN APARTMENT.

433
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,300
YOU'RE LEAVING?

434
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,810
YOU THINK I WANT TO
GIVE YOU THAT MUCH PLEASURE?

435
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,810
HOW COME
                AN APARTMENT?

436
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,310
SO I GOT SOMEPLACE
TO GO WHEN I'M NOT WORKING

437

I MEAN,
 I<i> AM</i> YOUR FRIEND
 AND EVERYTHING.</i>

883
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,720
BUT OF COURSE.

884
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,050
BUT, DAVID,

885
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:26,890
DON'T
            THE LITTLE GIRLS
            INTEREST YOU YET?

886
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,890
IT'S NOT THAT
THEY DON'T INTEREST ME.

887
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:33,060
I JUST DON'T
INTEREST THEM.

888
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,060
OH.

889
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,400
WELL, SOMETHING
            TELLS ME

890
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,570
THAT VERY, VERY SOON

891
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:46,240
THOSE LITTLE GIRLS
        ARE GOING TO BE
        INTERESTED IN YOU, TOO.

892
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,170
YOU SWEAR?

893
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,340
ABSOLUTELY.

894
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,310
WHAT A STRANGE CHILD
            YOU ARE.

895
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,310
SOMETIME YOU FEEL
            SO STRANGE TO ME

896
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,320
I THINK I DON'T
            KNOW YOU AT ALL.

897
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
OF COURSE
YOU KNOW ME.

898
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,820
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

899
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,820
NOT TRUE.

900
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:12,990
NOBODY EVER
            REALLY KNOWS ANYONE,

901
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:16,000
AND JUST WHEN
            YOU THINK YOU DO,

902
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,170
PEOPLE CHANGE RIGHT
            BEFORE YOUR EYES.

903
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,310
<i> ¶ I HOPE</i>

<i> ¶ JAMMIN' TILL</i>
    <i> THE JAM IS THROUGH ¶</i></i>

910
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:48,320
SO, CLARA'S BOY,

911
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,720
YOU MUSTN'T BE
            FRIGHTENED OF ME.

912
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:55,660
MUST BE CLARA
            TELL YOU SOME
            BAD THINGS ABOUT ME.

913
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,630
I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU.

914
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,130
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

915
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,130
ALL YOU NEED
            TO KNOW, THEN,
            IS THIS--

916
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,640
WHEN MAYFIELD GO,
            DEATH AND ALL
            BE A-FOLLOW.

917
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,540
I'LL GO UPSTAIRS
AND MAKE SOME KOOL-AID.

918
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,470
DON'T MOVE YET.
            JUST STAY
            RIGHT HERE.

919
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,480
WHAT THE HECK.
I'VE GOT SOME TIME.

920
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,480
SO TELL ME
            SOMETHING.

921
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,980
DID SHE TELL YOU
            ABOUT RALPHIE?

922
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,480
I KNOW
            SHE NO TELL YOU.

923
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,980
YEAH? SHE DID.

924
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:26,990
SHE COULDN'T
            TELL YOU
            THE WHOLE STORY.

925
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,490
WHAT DO YOU CARE
ANYWAY, HUH?

926
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,660
ME HAVE ME REASONS
            FOR CARE.

927
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,630
YOU ASK ABOUT RALPHIE.
MAKE CERTAIN YOU DO THAT, MAN.

928
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:29,310
WELCOME, CLARA.

929
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:51,460
YOU...

930
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,970
THEY TOLD ME
            YOU WAS OUTSIDE.

931
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,470
I HAD TO.

932
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,470
WHY?

933
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,970
IT WAS BURNING UP
IN HERE.

934
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,470
I'M NOT USED
TO THE TROPICS.

935
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,480
THEN DORA COME BY
            WITH HER FRIEND.

936
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,540
SHE WAS TRYING
TO JUKE ME UP.

937
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,980
JUST WHAT DID DORA
            TELL YOU?

938
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,980
TO ASK YOU
ABOUT RALPHIE.

939
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,450
WHAT DID I SAY
            ABOUT ASKING
            ABOUT MY PERSON?

940
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,150
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

941
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:19,250
SHE SAY
            ANYTHING ELSE?

942
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,260
NOTHING.

943
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,960
THAT'S IT.
I SWEAR.

944
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,010
CLARA?

945
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,110
YES, DAVID?

946
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,620
NOTHING.

947
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:06,390
¶ GOD HAS SMILED ON ME ¶

948
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:13,000
¶ HE HAS SET ME FREE ¶

949
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,470
¶ GOD HAS SMILED... ¶

950
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,440
NO. YOU STAY HERE.

951
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,870
¶ ON ME ¶

952
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:26,280
¶ HE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME ¶

953
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,280
¶ GOD HAS... ¶

954
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,780
EXCUSE ME.

955
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,780
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
            TO STAY BACK THERE?

956
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:35,290
I WANT TO DO IT, TOO.
I NEED IT.

957
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:38,790
YOUR PARENTS
            WOULD HAVE A COW
            IF THEY KNEW.

958
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:40,290
WHO WOULD FIND OUT?

959
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:41,460
SHH.

960
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:45,960
WHEN I'M HERE,
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF YOU.

961
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,960
YOU TAKE YOURSELF
            BACK THERE
            AND SIT DOWN.

962
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:55,540
¶ HE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME ¶

963
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:02,110
¶ HE IS THE SOURCE
        OF ALL MY JOY ¶

964

                    OF CHRIST.

965
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:05,280
AMEN.

966
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:09,110
THE BODY
                    OF CHRIST.

967
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,450
AMEN.

968
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:15,780
¶ IN THIS BODY OF MINE,

970
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,450
¶ IN THIS BODY OF MINE ¶

01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:24,020
¶ SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE ¶

972
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,590
¶ COUNT YOUR MANY BLESSINGS ¶

973
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:29,600
¶ SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE ¶

974
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,030

01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,270
¶ SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE ¶

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,950
¶ SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE ¶

982
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:53,610

01:11:53,620 --> 01:12:04,960
¶ SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE ¶

984
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,410
I DIDN'T
            MEAN THIS, CLARA.

985
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,250
I DIDN'T DO THIS
            TO HURT YOU.

986
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,940
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

987
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,950
HOW?

988
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:39,420
AFTER THE TRUST
AND FAITH I PUT IN YOU--

989
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:42,420
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

990
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,420
THERE WERE
            SO MANY THINGS.

991
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,420
WHY DID
    ALL THOSE LETTERS
    COME BACK?

992
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,590
DID--DID HE DIE, TOO?

993
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,760
IT'S NONE
            OF YOUR BUSINESS,
            IS IT?

994
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,270
IS IT?

995
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,270
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

996
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,700
THAT IS NONE
            OF YOUR BUSINESS.

997
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,600
I'LL DO ANYTHING
YOU SAY.

998
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:07,640
YOU HAVE RUINED
            OUR FRIENDSHIP,

999
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,940
AND YOU'LL GET OUT.

1000
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,430
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
                LIVING AT HOME
                REGULARLY.

1001
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:36,430
IT SUDDENLY
                DAWNED ON YOU

1002
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,440
STAYING OUT SO MUCH
            MIGHT NOT BE
            THE BEST THING

1003
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,940
FOR A KID
                WHO'S DEPENDENT
                ON A BLACK WOMAN

1004
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,910
WHO'S NOT
                SPEAKING TO HIM.

1005
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:48,410
WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING
        MY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

1006
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:50,410
I SEE DAVID AMPLY.

1007
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:51,910
AMPLY?
                WHAT IS THAT?

1008
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:54,410
AN ACCEPTED WAY
            OF SEEING SOMEONE?

1009
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,420
MAKE YOUR POINT,
        BILL.

1010
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,420
YOU SAY
            YOU ARE STUDYING

1011
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,420
TO BE
            A LAY THERAPIST--

1012
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,550
NO PUN INTENDED.

1013
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,590
DOESN'T IT OCCUR
            TO YOU

1014
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:07,590
PUTTING YOUR CHILD
            IN THERAPY
            WITH A STRANGER

1015
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,090
WILL MAKE HIM
            FEEL MORE SEPARATE?

1016
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,600
IF I THOUGHT THAT,
        WOULD I BE DOING IT?

1017
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,100
PREDICTING
            YOUR MOTIVES

1018
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,570
IS NOT
            SOMETHING I CARE
            TO MAKE BOOK ON.

1019
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:21,570
YOU WANT ME TO PAY
            FOR THIS TREATMENT?

1020
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:23,370
I ONLY WANT
        YOUR SUPPORT.

1021
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:26,110
THAT'S WHY
        I ASKED YOU
        TO COME HERE.

1022
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,580
I WISH I COULD
                BELIEVE THAT.

1023
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:32,050
I CANNOT BELIEVE
    YOU'RE SENDING A CHILD
    INTO THERAPY.

1024
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,210
STAY OUT
                    OF THIS.

1025
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:37,020
MESS UP YOUR OWN LIVES.
    DON'T DRAG HIM INTO IT.

1026
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,520
DON'T TALK TO US
            THAT WAY.

1027
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,520
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME
    LIKE THIS.

1028
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,520
WE HAVE
    A JAMAICAN SAYING--

1029
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:47,090
NOBODY
                    GIVES A DAMN
                    ABOUT THAT.

1030
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,590
I DO.

1031
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,090
STAY OUT
                    OF THIS.

1032
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,060
"THE HIGHER
    THE MONKEY CLIMB,

1033
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,530
THE MORE HE EXPOSE."

1034
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,000
YOU TELL HER
                YOU'RE NOT
                INTERESTED,

1035
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,230
SHE TELLS YOU
                ANYWAY.

1036
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,070
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

1037
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,740
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

1038
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,740
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.

1039
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:10,950
PSYCHIATRISTS JUST
HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND
YOURSELF BETTER.

1040
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:13,410
WILL CLARA TALK
    TO ME AGAIN?

1041
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:17,180
HE MIGHT HELP YOU
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
DISREGARDED HER PRIVACY.

1042
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:20,320
THEY'LL MAKE FUN
OF ME AT SCHOOL.

1043
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,260
DON'T YOU SEE
THAT'S PART
OF THE PROBLEM?

1044
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,720
CAN DR. EPSTEIN
                STRAIGHTEN
                THIS OUT?

1045
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:28,560
I MEAN, LOOK
                WHAT'S HE'S DONE
                FOR YOU.

1046
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,560
BILL, I SWEAR TO GOD--

1047
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,570
YOU LEAVE GOD
    OUT OF THIS MESS.

1048
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:37,070
I'LL MAKE SURE THE CHILD
    GOES TO A PSYCHIATRIST,

1049
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:40,740
BUT YOU LEAVE THIS BOY
    OUT THE MIDDLE.

1050
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:44,310
I REALLY RESENT
                YOUR INTRUSION
                INTO THIS.

1051
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,580
THEN FIRE ME,
    MR. HART.

1052
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,740
HE'S NOT FIRING
        ANYBODY.

1053
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,250
DAVID,
YOU COME WITH ME.

1054
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:13,670
I DON'T BELIEVE
I QUITE FOLLOW YOU, DAVID.

1055
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,570
PHOTOS FROM OLD
            FAMILY ALBUMS.

1056
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,070
YOU AND CLARA?

1057
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:19,570
WE PIN THEM
            ON THE WALL

1058
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:21,570
AND THROW DARTS
            AT THEM.

1059
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,080
WE HAD A 5-3-1
            SCORING SYSTEM.

1060
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,080
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF YOUR FATHER?

1061
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,080
THEY WERE OLD ONES--
            WHEN HE HAD HIS
            MUSTACHE.

1062
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,580
HE HATES THEM.

1063
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:35,050
YOU SWEAR YOU WON'T
            TELL ANYONE WHAT
            I CONFIDED IN YOU

1064
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:38,060
BECAUSE, FRANKLY,
            IF MY DAD FOUND OUT,

1065
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,060
HE'D REALLY
            BE UPSET.

1066
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,060
I'M SURE HE WOULD BE.

1067
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,060
I MEAN,
            HE REALLY THOUGHT

1068
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,060
HE LOOKED
            LIKE A STUD
            IN THAT MUSTACHE.

1069
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:50,570
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

1070
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,570
WHAT ELSE
DID THE TWO OF YOU DO?

1071
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,070
US TWO WHO?

1072
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,570
YOU AND CLARA.

1073
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:58,570
WE DID THINGS
            TOGETHER

1074
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:02,580
WHERE SHE DIDN'T ASK
            AS MANY QUESTIONS
            AS YOU DO.

1075
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,550
OUR TIME'S UP
FOR TODAY.

1076
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:09,480
WHY DON'T I NOT ASK YOU
ANY MORE QUESTIONS
UNTIL NEXT WEEK?

1077
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:14,490
YOU TOLD THAT MAN
THAT WE THROW DARTS
AT PICTURES OF YOUR FATHER?

1078
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:17,490
I TOLD HIM WE HAD
            A SCORING SYSTEM.

1079
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,890
THAT WAS WRONG.

1080
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:23,390
NEVER PUT ME UP
AGAINST YOUR PARENTS,
NOT EVEN IN JEST.

1081
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
YOU TOLD ME TO LIE.

1082
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,070
I KNOW,
BUT I DID NOT MEAN...

1083
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:39,370
THAT MAN MUST THINK
THAT I LOVE BOTH
OF YOUR PARENTS EQUALLY.

1084
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,480
MMM.

1085
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,980
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1086
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,480
YEAH, I SEE.

1087
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,480
NOW, I'M NOT UPSET.

1088
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,980
I JUST GOT
A LITTLE OVEREXCITED.

1089
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:52,990
THERE MUST BE ROOM
FOR MISTAKES WHEN YOU
PLAY GAMES SUCH AS THESE.

1090
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:55,490
I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL
            NEXT TIME.

1091
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,820
NOW, DAVID HART,

1092
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:02,160
WE MUST THINK OF SOMETHING
ABSOLUTELY DEVILISH

1093
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,830
TO TELL THIS MAN
NEXT WEEK.

1094
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,000
YOU REALLY WANT
            TO HEAR THIS?

1095
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
PLEASE.

1096
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,470
WHEN BILL GETS HOME
            FROM WORK,

1097
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:15,970
HE AND LEONA LIKE--
            LIKE TO GET
            DRESSED UP,

1098
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:18,470
IF YOU KNOW
            WHAT I MEAN.

1099
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,470
NO, I'M AFRAID
I DON'T.

1100
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,480
WELL, BILL LIKES
            TO DRESS UP
            LIKE LEONA,

1101
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,480
AND LEONA LIKES
                TO DRESS UP
                LIKE BILL.

1102
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,480
WE'RE TALKING
            INCLUDING UNDERWEAR.

1103
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,980
MM-HMM, AND THEN?

1104
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:32,990
WELL, THEN THEY
            START ACTING
            LIKE EACH OTHER.

1105
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,990
BILL STARTS WAVING
            HIS ARMS LIKE THIS

1106
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,990
AND POURS HER
            A DRINK,

1107
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:40,990
AND LEONA'S IN THIS
            THREE-PIECE SUIT,

1108
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
AND SHE STARTS
            BITCHING ABOUT
            THE MARITIME UNION.

1109
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,470
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THIS
UNLESS YOU SAW THEM?

1110
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:49,470
OH,<i> I</i> NEVER
             SAW THEM,</i>

1111
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,970
BUT CLARA DID ONCE
            BY ACCIDENT.

1112
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:54,970
SO SHE TOLD YOU
THAT SHE SAW THEM?

1113
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,980
NO. SHE WOULDN'T
            DO THAT.

1114
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,480
SEE, I OVERHEARD
            A TELEPHONE
            CONVERSATION

1115
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,310
SHE HAD WITH
            HER FRIEND BLANCHE.

1116
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,490
MRS. HART,
MAY I SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

1117
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:23,800
WHERE ON EARTH
            DID YOU GET
            THAT MATERIAL?

1118
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
I MADE IT UP.

1119
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,470
YOUR FATHER WOULD...

1120
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,470
WHAT?

1121
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,480
I WOULD LOVE
            TO SEE YOUR FATHER

1122
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,640
IN SOME
            OF MY UNDERWEAR.

1123
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,270
HELLO, DAVID.

1124
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:04,300
AREN'T YOU
                DAVID HART?

1125
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,470
UM...

1126
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:08,610
UM, YES. I MEAN--
I MEAN--

1127
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,640
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HESITATE,

1128
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,640
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS DAVID HART.

1129
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,140
I JUST--

1130
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,150
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
             WHO<i> I</i> AM.</i>

1131
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,650
WHO<i> ARE</i> YOU?</i>

1132
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,650
ASHLEY LAFFERTY.
            I JUST MOVED INTO
            THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1133
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,150
OH, SURE. YEAH.

1134
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:26,020
DO YOU
            KNOW ME NOW?

1135
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,960
NO, BUT I'M GLAD
TO MEET YOU.

1136
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,960
I--             I--

1137
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,130
I'M SORRY.      I'M SORRY.
GO AHEAD.       GO AHEAD.

1138
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,630
WHAT WERE YOU
            GOING TO SAY?

1139
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,630
I LIKE YOUR GLASSES.

1140
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:41,000
I WAS AFRAID
            THEY'D MAKE ME
            LOOK LIKE A GEEK.

1141
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,100
OH,
DEFINITELY NOT. NO.

1142
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,300
THANKS.
            THANKS A LOT.

1143
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,140
OH, IS THIS
YOUR DOG?

1144
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,140
NO. IT'S SOME
            STRANGER'S DOG.

1145
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,150
ACTUALLY,
            IT'S MY MOTHER'S
            NEW HUSBAND'S DOG,

1146
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,110
BUT WE SORT OF
            ADOPTED EACH OTHER.

1147
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,120
YOUR MOM
AND YOUR REAL DAD
ARE DIVORCED?

1148
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,120
SURE.

1149
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,120
WHOSE PARENTS
AREN'T DIVORCED, RIGHT?

1150
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,620
RIGHT.

1151
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:08,790
WELL.

1152
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:14,630
UM, YEAH.
SO--SO I'LL SEE YOU, OK?

1153
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,300
BYE.

1154
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,470
BYE.

1155
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,970
WELCOME
        TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1156
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,320
HELLO, DAVID.

1157
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,790
HI, DAVID.

1158
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:47,790
COME IN,
        SWEETHEART.

1159
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,460
COME IN.

1160
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,140
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1161
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,640
SIT DOWN,
        DAVID.

1162
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,610
I GET
                THE FEELING
                I SHOULD STAND.

1163
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:10,780
YOU'LL MAKE US ALL
            LESS UNCOMFORTABLE
            IF YOU SIT, DAVID.

1164
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,010
DAVID, PETER HAS
ACCEPTED AN OFFER

1165
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:18,650
TO RELOCATE THE MAIN BASE
FOR HIS WORKSHOPS
IN CALIFORNIA.

1166
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:22,620
IT'S ALL VERY SUDDEN,
BUT WE'RE LEAVING
IN TWO WEEKS.

1167
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:25,620
AND WE WANT YOU
            TO COME WITH US.

1168
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:28,720
I PREFER, OF COURSE,
    YOU LIVE WITH ME.

1169
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:30,730
YOU GUYS
                ARE JOKING,
                RIGHT?

1170
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:32,230
NO. NO JOKE.

1171
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,730
WOULD CLARA
                BE ABLE TO COME?

1172
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:37,630
CLARA DOESN'T EXPECT
    TO BE BURDENED
    WITH YOU

1173
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,770
FOR THE REST
    OF HER LIFE.

1174
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:40,930
BURDENED?

1175
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:44,440
WHAT WE'RE SAYING
            IS THAT YOU'RE
            A STATISTIC KID,

1176
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,510
BUT WE WANT YOU
            TO BE A HAPPY
            STATISTIC.

1177
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:51,440
BOTH YOUR MOTHER AND I
    WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

1178
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,280
I'M<i> VERY</i> HAPPY.</i>

1179
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,780
I THINK
WE HAVE TO RE-ESTABLISH

1180
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,250
AS NORMAL
A FAMILY ENVIRONMENT
AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU.

1181
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,780
YOU, IN TURN,
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

1182
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:04,790
THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE A FAMILY.

1183
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,390
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
DAVID UNDERSTANDS THIS.

1184
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,520
WHAT?

1185
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,960
THAT WE'RE IN
    AN AWFUL SITUATION

1186
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,430
NOT ENTIRELY
    OF OUR OWN MAKING,

1187
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:17,430
BUT WE LOVE HIM AND
    WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

1188
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,700
WE'LL LET HIM
    THINK ABOUT THIS.

1189
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,000
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

1190
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,570
NOT GOOD.

1191
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,270
WHY NOT, SWEETHEART?

1192
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:27,270
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE
            TO CALIFORNIA,

1193
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,110
AND I DON'T WANT TO
            LIVE WITH YOU.

1194
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:32,880
WHAT, DO YOU WANT
    TO LIVE WITH CLARA?

1195
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:50,930
[REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING]

1196
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:21,620
OH, YES.

1197
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:37,770
LOOKS LIKE DAVID'S
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

1198
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:40,780
DAVID, WE WANT YOU
            TO TALK PATOIS

1199

            OVER THERE.

1200
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,780
OH, NO. ME NOT

1203
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,890
YOU'LL LOVE IT.
            THE GIRLS WILL
            LOVE YOU, TOO.

1204
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:59,390
OK, GIRLS,
            THIS IS THE DAVID

SO, CLARA'S BOY,

1231
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:24,750
YOU HAVING YOURSELF
            A GOOD TIME?

1232
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,250
EXCUSE ME.

1233
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:29,260
ME WANT TO TELL YOU
            SOMETHING FIRST.

1234
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:32,260
ME WILL TELL YOU ABOUT
        THAT SHAMEFUL RALPHIE,

1235
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:36,260
ABOUT HOW HIM WAS FOUL
        AND HOW HIM HURT ME.

1236
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,230
DROP DEAD, BLOOD CLOT.

1237
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,730
YOUR MOUTH DIRTY.

1238
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:41,730
DON'T YOU DARE
            INSULT ME.

1239
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:44,230
TAKE YOUR HANDS
                OFF MY BOY.

1240
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,240
DON'T CALL HIM
YOUR BOY.

1241
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,000
YOUR BOY IS DEAD.

1242
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:51,210
MY BOY IS DEAD
                IS<i> MY</i> BUSINESS.</i>

1243
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,910
TELL HIM WHY.

1244
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,010
DORA, GET OUT.

1245
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:58,480
ME TELL HIM
WHY YOUR BOY DEAD.

1246
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,720
CLARA, YOU MUST
TELL HIM THE TRUTH

1247
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:10,160
ABOUT RALPHIE,
ABOUT THE CLIFF.

1248
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,930
HIM HAVE A RIGHT
TO KNOW!

1249
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:47,890
DAVID.

1250
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,910
SIT DOWN.

1251
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,920
YOU ASKED ME
                ABOUT RALPHIE.

1252
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,220
I THINK
            THE TIME HAS COME

1253
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,390
FOR ME TO TELL YOU.

1254
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:28,930
MY SON RALPHIE...

1255
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:35,230
WAS BEAUTIFUL--

1256
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,240
STRONG AND HANDSOME,

1257
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,970
BIG AS A MAN,

1258
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:43,740
BUT HE WAS
            VERY TROUBLED

1259
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:45,740
ALL HIS LIFE.

1260
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:48,750
NOBODY KNEW
            WHAT TO DO FOR HIM,

1261
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,720
NOT THE DOCTORS,
            NOT THE PRIESTS,

1262
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,720
NOBODY.

1263
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,720
AND WHEN HE WAS 15,

1264
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,520
HE FELL IN LOVE
            WITH DORA CAMBRIDGE.

1265
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,730
SHE PLAYED WITH HIM.

1266
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:05,730
WHEN SHE WAS DONE
            PLAYING WITH HIM,

1267
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,900
SHE THREW HIM AWAY.

1268
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:19,240
AND MY SON RAPED
            DORA CAMBRIDGE.

1269
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:32,220
WHEN I FOUND OUT
            THAT RALPHIE
            HAD RAPED DORA,

1270
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,390
I WENT
            AND CONFRONTED HIM
            ABOUT IT...

1271
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,220
BY TELLING HIM...

1272
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:47,400
THAT HE WAS
            NO LONGER MY SON...

1273
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:51,500
AND THAT
            HE HAD DISGRACED ME.

1274
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,000
AND RALPHIE...

1275
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:03,810
GRABBED ME
            BY THE THROAT.

1276
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:12,980
AND I KEPT TRYING
        TO TELL HIM IT WAS ME.

1277
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:18,650
MY SON BEGAN
        TO TOUCH ME IN A WAY

1278
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:22,560
THAT NO SON SHOULD
        EVER TOUCH HIS MOTHER.

1279
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:30,660
MY SON RAPED ME...

1280
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,470
AND THEN THREW HIMSELF
        OFF A CLIFF...

1281
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,970
INTO THE SEA.

1282
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:52,280
AND I'VE LIVED
            WITH THIS...

1283
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,050
UNTIL I COME TO AMERICA

1284
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,320
AND FOUND YOU.

1285
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,810
HEY, LIPSKY,
        COME ON.

1286
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:33,310
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT,
SCHWARZENEGGER?

1287
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:34,810
LET'S GO.

1288
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:36,810
GO? WHERE
                ARE WE GOING?

1289
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:39,520
THE LENGTH OF THE POOL,
YOU AND ME.

1290
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,280
A RACERINO?

1291
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:42,820
YEAH, A RACERINO.

1292
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,320
FOR WHAT, STUDLY?

1293
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,790
LET'S GO,
OR ARE YOU CHICKEN?

1294
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:49,960
I'M SHAKING ALL OVER.
        CAN'T YOU TELL?

1295
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,260
SAY "READY, SET, GO."

1296
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,290
READY,

1297
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,460
SET, GO!

1298
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,130
COME ON,
GET HIM, LIPSKY!

1299
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,280
CLARA?

1300
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,780
DAVID.

1301
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:27,790
I'VE MADE
A DECISION.

1302
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:32,290
I'VE DECIDED I'M GOING
TO LIVE IN BALTIMORE.

1303
01:35:32,290 --> 01:35:36,290
AH. SO YOU ARE GOING TO
        LIVE WITH YOUR FATHER

1304
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:39,290
TO BE CLOSER TO ME.

1305
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,800
NO.

1306
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,300
NO, NO, NO.

1307
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,800
I THINK A CHILD'S PLACE
        IS WITH THE MOTHER.

1308
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
THEY'RE BOUND
            TO THE MOTHER

1309
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,770
MORE THAN THEY ARE
            BOUND TO FRIENDSHIP.

1310
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:53,770
YOU'RE MORE
THAN MY FRIEND.

1311
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,780
NO. THAT'S WHAT I AM.

1312
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:58,780
BESIDES, WHAT HAPPENS
        IF I GET A WEEKEND JOB?

1313
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:00,780
I'LL COME TO YOU
AFTER SCHOOL.

1314
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:03,780
NO. DON'T YOU SEE
            THE RELATIONSHIP
            HAS CHANGED?

1315
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:05,890
SURE, IT'S CHANGED,

1316
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:09,290
BUT IT'S ALSO JUST
BECOMING WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

1317
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:12,790
NO. IT'S GONE BEYOND
        ALL IT EVER COULD BE.

1318
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:16,290
THAT'S LIFE, CHILD.
            LIFE IS CHANGE.

1319
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:19,100
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1320
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,960
I THINK YOU KNOW.

1321
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:25,800
YOU'LL BE
JUST LIKE MY PARENTS.

1322
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,270
YOU'RE GOING TO DUMP ME
WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH.

1323
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:30,770
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1324
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:33,270
YOU CAN'T COMPARE ME
            WITH THEM.

1325
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,770
NO?

1326
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:36,780
NO. THEY ARE YOUR BLOOD.

1327
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,550
I'M JUST A HOUSEKEEPER
        WHO LOVES YOU.

1328
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:42,110
WHAT ABOUT
WHAT YOU TOLD ME?

1329
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,620
"KNOW THAT YOU CAN
DEPEND ON ME," YOU SAID.

1330
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:47,120
YOU'RE A LIAR.

1331
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:51,120
YOU JUST LOVE ME
BECAUSE YOU HAD NO ONE ELSE.

1332
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,460
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO RALPHIE.

1333
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:56,460
MAYBE HE SAW
YOU WERE A SELFISH PIG,

1334
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,430
THAT JUST CARED
ABOUT YOURSELF.

1335
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,430
THAT'S WHY
HE DID WHAT HE DID.

1336
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:04,430
YOU'RE A NASTY CHILD
        TO CALL<i> ME</i> SELFISH.</i>

1337
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,500
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU.

1338
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,440
YOU MADE ME LOVE YOU.

1339
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,440
NOW YOU'RE DUMPING ME
BECAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

1340
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,940
YOU'LL GET ANOTHER JOB
AND NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

1341
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:19,750
YOU'LL JUST BE A NIGGER
IN THE END.

1342
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:20,270
BYE, CLARA.

1343
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:22,270
GOOD-BYE, MRS. HART.

1344
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:30,270
EXCUSE ME.

1345
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:33,270
I'D LIKE TO SEE
CLARA MAYFIELD, PLEASE.

1346
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,940
COME WITH ME.

01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:39,600
HI, CLARA.

1360
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,770
HELLO, DAVID.

1361
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:47,770
CHILDREN, YOU REMEMBER
I TOLD YOU ABOUT A LITTLE BOY.

1362
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:51,740
WELL, HERE'S THE REMAINS
    OF THE LITTLE BOY.

1363
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,740
HE'S CALLED DAVID.

1364
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,240
YOU SAY HELLO.

1365
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,250
HELLO, DAVID.

1366
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,180
I'LL BE BACK
        IN A MINUTE.

1367
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:03,250
I WANT YOU TO TAKE CLIFFORD
        AND MAKE HIM BEHAVE.

1368
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:05,250
DID YOU
HEAR HIM TALKING?

1369
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:07,750
HE WAS TALKING UP
            A STORM.

1370
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,460
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1371
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:21,770
I CAME TO VISIT MY DAD,
SO I THOUGHT...

1372
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,430
LET'S TALK.

1373
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,740
YOU'RE NOT MAD
THAT I CAME?

1374
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:34,240
CHILD, NO.

1375
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,240
I EXPECTED IT
                AT SOME TIME.

1376
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:43,250
MY, YOU GOT SO BIG.

1377
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:46,080
NOT WEARING
            ANY GLASSES ANYMORE.

1378
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,750
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER
            AND PETER

1379
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,090
AND THE WORKSHOPS
            AND THE RICE
            AND THE VEGETABLES?

1380
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:56,090
MY MOM MAKES
A PRETTY FAIR TOTO.

1381
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:59,060
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT EVERYTHING'S OK.

1382
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:00,430
I'M GLAD. I'M GLAD.

1383
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:09,240
CLARA, SO MANY TIMES
I WANTED TO WRITE YOU

1384
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,740
TO APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT I SAID.

1385
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,240
I KNOW.

1386
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,240
BUT YOU ALWAYS
MADE ME SO UPSET

1387
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:21,410
BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS
RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING.

1388
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,420
I KNOW.

1389
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:34,260
AND I JUST WANTED TO COME
TO LET YOU KNOW I'M OK.

1390
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,060
I'M GLAD YOU DID.

1391
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:46,230
AND I JUST--

1392
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:49,700
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU, CLARA.

1393
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:57,080
I DON'T KNOW.

1394
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:00,240
I KNOW.

1395
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:02,250
BUT YOU SEE, DAVID,

1396
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:06,220
YOU AND I
            ARE BOUND TOGETHER
            BY A SPECIAL FORCE,

1397
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:09,950
AND IT'S A FORCE
            SO PERFECT

1398
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:12,220
THAT IT GOES
            BEYOND BLOOD.

1399
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,960
WELL, I HAVE TO GO.

1400
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,890
YEAH, SO I'LL SEE YOU

1401
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:22,630
THE NEXT TIME
I'M IN BALTIMORE, OK?

1402
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,730
WHETHER YOU SEE ME
            THE NEXT TIME,

1403
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:29,730
OR WHETHER YOU
            EVER SEE ME AGAIN,

1404
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:33,740
YOU MUST
            KNOW THAT NO
            MATTER WHERE I AM,

1405
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:36,240
FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE,

1406
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,410
THAT I WILL CARRY YOU
        RIGHT HERE IN MY HEART
        ALWAYS.
