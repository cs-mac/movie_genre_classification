1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,700
Oh, God.

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
How are you, Richard? Hot enough for you?

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,400
Yeah.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,700
Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,000
You dummy, why don't you watch
where you are going?

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,900
Does this look like 10:00, or like 10:30?

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,900
- Morning, Richard!
- Good morning.

8
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,100
- You are a half hour late.
- Only a half hour?

9
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,000
I am usually 45 minutes late.
I am early today.

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,700
I see.

11
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,500
- Are you going to join me today or what?
- Coming.

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,500
Give me your money and your wallets.

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,000
Get your ass out of here. It is too hot.

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,600
Color me old-fashioned, Rich,
but I just love the park on a Sunday.

15
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,400
I would love it more if we didn't have
to work today. Come on, let's go.

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,300
Let me open that for you, all right?

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Hot enough for you, Larry?

18
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,300
No, Harris, why don't you turn up the heat?

19
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,600
Okay. I'll tell the engineer.

20
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,800
Cheap bastards. Turn off
the air conditioning on the weekends.

21
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,000
- Let's go to the beach.
- No.

22
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
- We are going to be here our whole lives.
- Yeah, I am afraid so.

23
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,400
- I am going to the beach!
- Give me those papers.

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
- The papers are going to the beach.
- We aren't going.

25
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
You want these?
You're coming to the beach.

26
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,500
- I guess we are going to the beach.
- Wilson at the line.

27
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,300
That was beautiful. Replay.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Give me those papers!

29
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,700
- You think it's safe to go in the water?
- No, better not.

30
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,700
- You just ate. You might get cramps.
- I'll risk it.

31
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,800
<i>We'll get back to you with more tunes,
but first we'll hear...</i>

32
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>the latest from Weather Central.</i>

33
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
<i>- What is happening out there, buddy?
- Sizzle, sizzle...</i>

34
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
<i>as the Big Apple becomes the Baked Apple.</i>

35
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
<i>You better believe that these are...</i>

36
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Oh, Christ. Will you shut that thing off?

37
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
<i>... continues before Labor Day weekend.</i>

38
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,300
<i>It is going to be the four "H's":
hot, humid, hazy, and horrible.</i>

39
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
This sucks. I am so unhappy.

40
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,300
- We should be at a real beach.
- There are no more real beaches.

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,100
I mean we could go to Jones Beach
and float around in the hospital waste.

42
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Then again Coney Island is always real nice.

43
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,500
We could go there and watch the fish
disintegrate in front of our eyes.

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Wait a minute. Wait a goddamn...
Hold the phone, buddy! I got it!

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,100
I got the $2 million. Where are your pages?

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
Get your pages.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,800
Oh, my God!
You are not going to believe what you see!

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
- Okay.
- Turn to Page 28.

49
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Right after 27.

50
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
- Got it.
- All right? You got it?

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,900
I want you to turn to Page 41 now.

52
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,100
- I got it.
- Check out line 18.

53
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,900
- Okay?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
- You see it?
- I see it.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
What about it?

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
You are such a stupid piece of rat shit.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
Hot!

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,100
- Watch your step!
- I am being barbecued here!

59
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,000
All right. Okay. All right, buddy
I am going to explain it to you real slow.

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,900
- Good.
- Okay.

61
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,600
There's more than one check issued
on the same life insurance policy claim.

62
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,200
One in December of '87, another in
April of '88, and two more in June.

63
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
- Making any sense?
- Yeah, he died four times.

64
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,800
Yes. According to this, he died four times.

65
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,200
So somebody screwed up.
It wasn't us. Was it?

66
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
No. It wasn't us.

67
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't you see?
We just uncovered a $2 million error.

68
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
We're going to be heroes.
We're going up the corporate ladder.

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,100
- This is good for me.
- Yes, this is good for you.

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,600
- It's good for me, too.
- I'll tell Lomax first thing in the morning.

71
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
- What page is it?
- No, Larry. Let me tell him.

72
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,000
- We'll both tell him.
- Okay. Great!

73
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,800
There is what's- her-name.

74
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,700
Stop staring at her.

75
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,600
You've not shut up about her
for two months.

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,400
- Ask her out already, will you?
- No. I don't know what to say.

77
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,500
She's a summer intern.
She'll be gone in a week.

78
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,700
No, I've no idea what to say.

79
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,900
- Say "Hi, I want to go out with you."
- I can't say that.

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,500
Why not?

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Because there are too many people around.

82
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
It's New York City.
There are always too many people.

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,300
Excuse me, miss.

84
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,300
Oh, shit.

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Good weekend, Bob?

86
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
- You going to say something?
- Shut up.

87
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,000
- You are blowing it.
- Shut...

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,700
Please, shut up, all right?

89
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,400
Thank you.

90
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,700
Okay.

91
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,900
Try witty.

92
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,700
Say, "You know what would look
good on you?"

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,300
- "Me." Huh?
- Oh, please.

94
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,700
- Richard, that is a very good line.
- Enough, look...

95
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
- if I wanted to talk to her, I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her.

96
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
- Would you talk to her?
- Would you stop?

97
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,100
- You want me to talk to her?
- Yes.

98
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
Okay. Shut up.

99
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,500
Excuse me.

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
My aunt is very sick.

101
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,400
What?

102
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Nothing.

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,900
I don't believe this, she's...

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Now, don't flagellate yourself
over this, Richard.

105
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,200
It was a very good effort.
You'll get her next time.

106
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,900
Why did I just say that?
Larry, I don't even have an aunt.

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,100
So what?

108
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Anything going on?

109
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
There are these messages.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,900
And you are late for
the creative sales meeting, Mr. Lomax.

111
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,500
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- Let me get that, sir.

112
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,200
Sammy. Hank. How are you?

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
Richard Parker, sir.

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,300
- Larry Wilson.
- Whatever.

115
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
There's nothing from a Doreena,
a Martha, Judy?

116
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
- No.
- Well, that's their tough luck.

117
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,900
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- What?

118
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,000
There's something
we would like to show you.

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,300
Wait. It's Monday morning.
After lunch, right?

120
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,000
Quite a bit after lunch.

121
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Shoo.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
Yeah, I got it, François.

123
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,800
That's $2.

124
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Rich.

125
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,900
Look at Lomax.

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
God.

127
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,300
My God. Look at her.

128
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
My God.

129
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,200
Jesus. That guy.

130
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,900
Beautiful apartment. House at the beach.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,700
Babes. A boat. A car.

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,300
Do you know how much it costs
to park a car in Manhattan every month?

133
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
- More than my rent.
- I mean, it's only fair.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
His car is a bit bigger than your apartment.

135
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,700
So my apartment is small. It's dark.

136
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,900
It's hot. It's in a high-crime area.
Beats living with Mom and Dad.

137
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,300
All right. Enough.
It's just until I can afford something decent.

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,800
Something without
wall-to-wall cockroaches.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,300
All I have to do is just keep
setting my goals and working hard...

140
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
- I'll be fine.
- You are so naive.

141
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,300
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

142
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,400
Go ahead. Oh, God.

143
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
I hope your aunt feels better.

144
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,800
- What?
- I said...

145
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
She said, "I hope your aunt feels better."

146
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
My aunt? The sick aunt. Yes, she is fine.

147
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,500
They thought it was...

148
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Either get on the elevator or get off.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
I'll be back.

150
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,700
And I lose again.

151
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,600
I won. I have a date.

152
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
- You are kidding.
- No.

153
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,200
Gwen and I, Thursday night,
8:00 p.m., dinner.

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,500
- Fabulous.
- It was the clumsy approach. It worked.

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,300
You are going to want
to borrow my apartment.

156
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,800
No, but thank you. That's sweet.

157
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,500
But I can't do that to you. Thank you.

158
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,800
If she finds out you live with your folks,
you will embarrass yourself.

159
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,300
Yeah, I know, but I can't do that to you.

160
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,200
It is the cockroaches, isn't it?

161
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,300
- Well...
- They scatter when the lights go on.

162
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,600
<i>Mr. Parker, Mr. Lomax will see you now.</i>

163
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
I feel lucky.

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,300
No, I only want the Maserati
if it comes in that jet black.

165
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,600
Look, if you can't do it for me...

166
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,500
I'll just have to take my business
to another dealer.

167
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

168
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,700
So paint it! I mean how hard
can this whole thing be?

169
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,800
Right.

170
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,700
All right. See, that's better.

171
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,500
See how easy it is to do business with me?

172
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
No trade. Strictly cash.

173
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,700
Right.

174
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,800
All right. Good.

175
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,800
Gentlemen, what have you got for me?

176
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,200
As you may or may not know, Mr. Lomax...

177
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Larry and I have been, I mean, working.

178
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,800
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

179
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
What are we supposed to do?

180
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,500
Bet that thing moves, huh? Jesus.

181
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,100
- Put that back.
- It's a beautiful boat.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
You gentlemen were saying...

183
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Yes, well.

184
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,700
As you might have heard...

185
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,500
Larry and I have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system.

186
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
- Right.
- Thanks.

187
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
Sir, it's a very big job.

188
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,300
A big job. We have been working hard.

189
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
A very big job.

190
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,700
I've been at it for quite some time.
Weekends also.

191
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,800
- Weekends, late, and...
- Why don't you show him?

192
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Thank you.

193
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,600
We've got something
you should know about.

194
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,100
- Got them both there?
- Yes. Page 28 and 41.

195
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
You sure these figures are accurate?

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
- Yes.
- Positive.

197
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,800
Yes, sir, Mr. Lomax.

198
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
Bernie.

199
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,200
Call me Bernie.

200
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,000
I mean my father is Mr. Lomax, right?

201
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,100
Okay, Bernie.

202
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,900
- Yes, it's all there in black and white.
- We both worked on this one, Bern.

203
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
"E."

204
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
Bernie.

205
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,800
- Papers.
- Right here, Bernie.

206
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
If anything has to go,
I am glad it's my vision...

207
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
and not the old joystick,
you know what I mean?

208
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
That's computer ink, sir.

209
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Oh, no, you are wrong. Look.

210
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,000
There are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written.

211
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,400
You didn't take into consideration
that it's normal...

212
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
especially when using
a fluctuating COL index to combine...

213
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,200
look here, a package containing
short-term and straight life policies...

214
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,900
in an overall insurance portfolio.

215
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Now you are wasting my time.

216
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,100
Richard worked on that part, sir.

217
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,600
That is true, Bernie.

218
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,300
But if you were to look at the back page,
where the policy indexes are...

219
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,600
you'll notice that the remaining policies...

220
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,700
are dated after
the policy holder died, Bernie.

221
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,600
You are right.

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,600
You are absolutely right.
Gentlemen, this is good work.

223
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
Very, very good work.

224
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,800
Thank you, Bernie.

225
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,700
I hate to say this, but it appears
as if somebody is trying...

226
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,500
to defraud the company.
Perhaps we should check back records.

227
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
Somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy.

228
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
No smoking.

229
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Gentlemen, how long have you two
been working here?

230
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,800
- Nineteen months and a week.
- I am not really sure.

231
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,400
- A little longer, I think.
- Longer? I was here before you.

232
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,600
No, Richard. I trained you.

233
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,500
I came here in January,
you came the end of May.

234
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,100
I trained you.

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,300
Whatever!

236
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,100
What I am saying is that
I think there is a big future here...

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,700
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves.

238
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,400
Thank you.

239
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,700
But I'd like to go over these numbers
with you...

240
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,000
just to make sure
that you've gotten everything.

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The only trouble is if someone is trying to...

242
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
like you said
"smoke it past the wrong guy"...

243
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,600
I'd like to just keep it confidential.

244
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,200
I mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags.

245
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
No, absolutely not.

246
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,200
If you would like, we'll work late.

247
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,400
- Yes, I mean we'll work weekends.
- Weekends are very good for me.

248
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,800
Weekends. Good idea.

249
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,900
Give us plenty of time together,
no distractions.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
It is Labor Day.

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
I got an idea.

252
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,500
How would you two like to come
to my house at the beach?

253
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,700
- Me?
- Us?

254
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,300
Yeah. Hampton Island.

255
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,000
Ever been there? Well, you will love it.

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,200
When we're not working,
there are distractions.

257
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,000
There are women, swimming,
boating, famous people.

258
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,400
Well?

259
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
- Love to!
- Okay.

260
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,300
Good! It's settled.

261
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
We are going to have a good time,
I guarantee.

262
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,600
My secretary will write down
the directions...

263
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,000
- give you the ferry schedule.
- The ferry schedule?

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,300
It's the only way to get there,
unless you have a boat. I don't know.

265
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,900
I have never even been on a boat.

266
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,300
I was once on the Staten Island Ferry
with my folks...

267
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,100
Whatever. You come out Friday night,
you'll have a great time, I guarantee it.

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll even drive you back to the city myself
on Monday. Okay?

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,100
We don't know what to say, Bernie.

270
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
You don't have to say anything.

271
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,900
If you two uncovered what I think
you uncovered...

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,400
old Bernie here owes you both a great deal.
I mean it sincerely.

273
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
Now get out of here. Go on.

274
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,700
He loves us.

275
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,900
The man absolutely loves us.

276
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,300
You have to kill them, Vito.

277
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
Let me explain something to you.

278
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,900
We don't do that anymore.
We are a corporation now.

279
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,100
We are in the market. We invest.

280
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,800
Real estate. Car rentals. Parking lots.

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,300
Parking lots. That's good.

282
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,800
- I understand that, but...
- Didn't I order the walnut dressing?

283
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,100
- Yes, you did.
- Taste that.

284
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Does that taste
anything like walnut dressing? Tell me.

285
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,500
This is the raspberry vinaigrette.

286
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,900
Should I have Paulie go
and talk to the chef?

287
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,800
This goddamn raspberry vinaigrette...

288
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
Excuse me, Vito.

289
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,900
I know how important food is to you,
I mean...

290
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,000
But we've got a problem here.

291
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,200
I give problems. I don't get problems.

292
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,600
How do you propose to handle it?

293
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,500
Let's make it a murder-suicide job. All right?

294
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
Okay, gentlemen?

295
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,100
I'll plant some money, fake a note,
and they can take the rap and...

296
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,900
I won't even have to change the books.

297
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,700
What do you think?

298
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,800
I like it. It's creative.

299
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,100
I am a little rusty. But it'll come back to me.

300
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,900
Okay.

301
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,100
- Do it.
- This is good.

302
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,700
I mean this is really good. Good.

303
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,100
I think we are going to have some fun.

304
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,600
- I have to get going. I really do.
- What, no dessert?

305
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
They do a wonderful crème brûlée here.
It's delicious.

306
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,700
No, gentlemen, I really must be going.
Thanks for dinner, Vito.

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,100
I got to go powder my nose.

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,300
Forget the accident with the two guys.

309
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,700
Take care of Lomax.

310
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
He's getting too careless...

311
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
too greedy.

312
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,500
Besides...

313
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
he's screwing my girlfriend.

314
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,600
But you said we were going to
spend the weekend at the beach!

315
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,500
You heard the conversation.
What am I supposed to do about it?

316
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
- Bernie.
- What?

317
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,000
I told Vito I was going to spend
some time with my mother!

318
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,300
I have to see you, Bernie.

319
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,600
Cut it out.

320
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,000
- What's wrong with you? Wait a minute.
- What?

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,900
- I have an idea.
- What?

322
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
You are on, 9:00 Friday night.
I'll be at the apartment.

323
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,700
Just use your key. All right?

324
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,600
I'll wear something special.

325
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,700
I bet you never had sweet and sour
matzo balls before.

326
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
No.

327
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,300
- I am glad you finally asked me out.
- You are?

328
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
I wish you had asked me out sooner.

329
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,000
Today was my last day at work.
I am going back to college.

330
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
We could still have
this weekend together, right?

331
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I am spending it with my folks.

332
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,400
- Are your folks in town?
- No.

333
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,500
Is this the intimate evening
I promised you, or what?

334
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,900
You think there's anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk...

335
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,200
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks?

336
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,100
- Hey, want to throw her in?
- How you doing?

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,200
I'd invite you to my apartment,
but I have five roommates.

338
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,400
And they are all at home
doing their hair right now.

339
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
That's a lot of hair. But it's clean. I like that.

340
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,800
It's either that or living with my parents,
and I don't think that's a good idea.

341
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,100
I can't blame you. Who'd want
to live with their folks? That's no good.

342
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,100
- Do you have any roommates?
- No. Roommates? No. None.

343
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,800
Why don't we go to your place?

344
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,400
Come on, baby. You're not a woman.
Are you? Tell me the truth.

345
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Okay.

346
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,400
Why are you tiptoeing?

347
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,000
Because...

348
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,900
the people who live downstairs,
they're very light sleepers.

349
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,300
They get angry when I walk.

350
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,200
Why are you whispering?

351
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,300
- Am I?
- Yes.

352
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,100
I am. That's because of the walls.
They are too thin.

353
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,500
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

354
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Look at this teak.
I mean this whole apartment.

355
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
Sort of '60s style.

356
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Yeah. I know.
I've been meaning to redo that for years.

357
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,000
No, I love it. I mean, it's very hip.

358
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,400
I think you have done the place beautifully.

359
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,600
I like it. It's home.

360
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,500
You know, it's a side of you
I never would have expected.

361
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm very impressed.

362
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,700
- Are you?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,100
About what?

364
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
This apartment has got to be expensive.

365
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,500
So obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that...

366
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,900
Is "dump" the word you are groping for?

367
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,400
You didn't like Hymie's Hunan?

368
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,000
- It's a four-star dive.
- It was great. I loved it.

369
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,200
It's just that some men
would try to impress women by...

370
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,300
pretending to be something they are not.

371
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,800
I absolutely agree. That's a terrible way
to begin a relationship.

372
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,500
Pretending to be something you are not.

373
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,700
Oh, God.

374
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to...

375
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,600
but how do you afford a place like this?

376
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
I don't like to brag.

377
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,000
I just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money...

378
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,000
but I've made some wise investments.
I dabble in the stock market.

379
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,200
And of course my parents
were rather well off.

380
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,500
Do you want to sit?

381
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
They passed away?

382
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Yes.

383
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
They must have been young.

384
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,100
Oh, yeah.

385
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,300
I feel I can trust you.

386
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,300
They were in a train accident.

387
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,900
Yeah, I mean I don't know
what it was with trains...

388
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,400
but they just always liked to travel in trains.

389
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
I am sorry.

390
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,700
- How awful for you.
- Yeah.

391
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,200
You know, I always thought trains
were so much safer than planes.

392
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,800
Well, actually, a plane...

393
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,600
fell on the train.

394
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,800
- Richard.
- Gwen.

395
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,000
There's a man in his underwear
in your kitchen.

396
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
He's... He's with me.

397
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,800
He's my butler. But...

398
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,900
- You have a butler?
- Yeah. Don't get him started.

399
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,100
He'll just go away if you just be quiet.

400
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Sorry. I didn't realize you had company.

401
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,300
Good evening, young lady.

402
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,400
That's all right, Monroe.

403
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,500
Yes, will you, please, just go lay out
my navy blue suit for the morning?

404
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Please.

405
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,800
- How about if I lay you out?
- Very well.

406
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,800
- You let your butler talk to you like that?
- Well, he is a vet.

407
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,100
He has got a steel plate in his head.

408
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,100
Gwen, it's not what you think.

409
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,200
Goodbye, Richard.

410
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll grab the bow line.

411
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,400
- Hey, Skeet. How are you doing?
- Hey, Mr. Lomax.

412
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,100
Here you go, my friend.
Buy yourself a girlfriend.

413
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,700
Where have you been, Candy?

414
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
- Hey, Bernie. How about a drink?
- A little bit later.

415
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,900
- Yo, Bernie. The cocktail flag is up.
- A little bit later.

416
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,500
Booze and women.
That is my lifestyle and I love it!

417
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,800
And I!

418
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,700
- George, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Lomax.

419
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,900
What are you doing here?
I fired you last week.

420
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,400
- I just want my $90, okay?
- Bullshit!

421
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,900
You drank my liquor
and the toilets still don't work.

422
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,700
I don't want to see you.

423
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,200
Get out of here!

424
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
You come back again,
I am going to call the cops!

425
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,900
You son of a bitch.

426
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,400
- I am sorry. I think she needs a little B-12.
- Whatever.

427
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
<i>This is Bernie. Leave a message,
I'll get right back to you.</i>

428
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
- Goodbye, Mr. Lomax.
- Bye.

429
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,600
Hello?

430
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,300
Hey, Lomax. It's Paulie.
I just got to the island.

431
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
You are early.

432
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,000
Those schmucks are not coming
until the 6:00 ferry...

433
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,400
- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.

434
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,700
So where is your house?

435
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
It's on the point, top of the dune.

436
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Look, Paulie,
don't kill them while I am around.

437
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,700
Bernie, we are on a phone here.

438
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,500
Right. You are right. Okay, I am sorry.

439
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,700
The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi, okay?

440
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

441
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,700
Oh, God!

442
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,100
Rich. It is leaving. Come on!

443
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,500
I told you we should've taken
a taxi from the station.

444
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,400
- There's another boat in a half hour.
- We'll miss the parties.

445
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
We got it. Excuse me.

446
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,600
- Sorry.
- Coming through.

447
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,100
Don't be ridiculous! What are you doing?
We are not jumping on this boat!

448
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
- Do you hear me?
- Here we go!

449
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Listen to me, Larry, we are not
jumping on this boat!

450
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,800
- Jesus Christ! My elbow!
- Piece of cake!

451
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,500
Thanks, pal.

452
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,300
This ferry isn't leaving. It's docking.

453
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,600
- Okay. We're early.
- You schmuck.

454
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,100
- What is your name?
- What is your name?

455
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,200
- Larry.
- Hi, Larry. I am Michelle.

456
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,700
Come on! Lighten up there, Rich!
We are on our way!

457
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,200
I am so depressed.
I made a fool out of myself last night.

458
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,300
Of course you did.

459
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,800
- I should've stayed home.
- What are you talking about?

460
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,300
We've been summoned to the mountain top.
This is good for your career.

461
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,200
You know, by the time this weekend is over,
I promise you won't even remember...

462
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,100
what's- her-name's name.
I'll get you a drink. Come on.

463
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,200
Look, I'll see you later.

464
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,700
Goodbye, young man. Nice talking to you.

465
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,600
That is good. This is very good.

466
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
- I did not hear you come in.
- I know.

467
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,000
I am real good at that.

468
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,500
- I told you the guys aren't here yet, didn't I?
- You did.

469
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,300
- Good.
- Quite a shack you have here.

470
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,700
It's home.

471
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Can I have a cigarette?

472
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,300
Cigarette.

473
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,500
Sure.

474
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
What was...

475
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Quite a ride, huh, Bern?

476
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Glorious day out, or what?

477
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Where's Bernie?

478
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,500
I got it right here. It says it's the last house
on the point, top of the dune.

479
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,900
Pardon me, Monsignor, sir, could you
tell me where the top of the dune is?

480
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,300
- Bless you, my son.
- Thank you, Father.

481
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,700
Look, we'll find it. Okay.

482
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,100
- You know, it's an island, right?
- How hard can it be?

483
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,300
Excuse me. Is this the way to...

484
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,000
- Yo, is this Bernie Lomax's house?
- Sure is.

485
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,500
Wow.

486
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,300
Holy shit. Look at this.

487
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,200
Come on, Rich.

488
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,200
Oh, beautiful.

489
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,500
Oh, my God. He has got a pool.

490
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,700
He has got a goddamn pool at the beach.
It's heated.

491
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,900
I love this man.

492
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,600
This is inspiring. Look at this view.

493
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,800
- I am getting laid.
- Sure beats Coney Island.

494
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,700
What? Should we just walk in?

495
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,100
No, we'll stand out here all weekend.
Come on, we are houseguests.

496
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,900
Hello! Bernie, we are here.

497
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,500
Amazing.

498
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,400
I am home.

499
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,700
Excellent.

500
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,600
- Admit it. You are glad you came.
- Okay, I admit it.

501
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,600
- We got three days of this ahead of us.
- Oh, yeah. This is something.

502
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,900
I mean a place like this must go for what,
a $1.6 million, $1.7 million. Unfurnished.

503
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,900
- Good God! That's a Lichtenstein!
- What? Where?

504
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,300
Not the piano. The painting. It's an original.

505
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,900
Of course it is.

506
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,100
All of this could be yours,
if you set your goals and work hard.

507
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,400
My old man worked hard.
All they did was give him more work.

508
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,700
Hey, is Bernie around?

509
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,900
Hello. No, haven't seen him.
But we just got here.

510
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,300
We're going to be here all weekend.
We are houseguests.

511
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,600
Tell him Tawny borrowed his boat
to go skiing.

512
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,400
Hi, Tawny. I am horny.

513
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,600
- Hi. Look, don't forget to tell Bernie, okay?
- Okay.

514
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,200
Tawny, you wouldn't happen to know
where Bernie is, would you?

515
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,600
He's probably making the rounds.

516
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Everybody parties from house to house,
but they always end up here. Bye!

517
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,700
- And you didn't want to come.
- I admit it, I was wrong.

518
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Oh, my God.

519
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,600
Nothing but champagne and caviar.
Pierre Jouët.

520
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,200
This guy is my idol.

521
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,100
- Don't open that.
- Why not?

522
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,200
We are houseguests, come on.
You want some?

523
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,200
No, thanks. This is strange.
Where's our host?

524
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,300
You heard Tawny. He's out partying.
Come on.

525
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,800
Let's check out the rest of this joint.

526
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,400
This is fabulous.

527
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,600
I found him. Mr. Lomax.

528
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,500
Bernie! How are you doing? Great place.

529
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,000
I hope you don't mind, but we just
walked in. We didn't know that you...

530
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
Bernie?

531
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
He's sleeping.

532
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,200
Yeah.

533
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
It's not even dark out
and he's out of his skull.

534
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,900
He's been working awfully hard, you know.

535
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,100
Don't slap him. That's your boss.

536
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,000
I know. He's meditating.

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,900
He's not. He's like dead, man.
Come on, let's walk him around.

538
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
We'll get the blood circulating.

539
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,800
There we go. Okay, this way.

540
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,400
Here we go.

541
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
That's it. Move those feet, Bernie.
That's a boy.

542
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,900
- Here you go.
- Get him up.

543
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,900
Carry your weight, here, Richard.

544
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,100
Come on, Bernie.

545
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,700
- Move those feet.
- He's giving me a hernia.

546
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I am losing him. Put him on the couch.

547
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,300
- We can't just leave him like this, you know.
- Come on, Bernie.

548
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Get your hand off me, Bernie.

549
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
I'll make the coffee.

550
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,700
Don't you worry, Mr. Lomax, we'll make
you some coffee, fix you right up.

551
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,400
Tell you what, let's just make you
a little more comfy.

552
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,500
That is better. There you go.

553
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,300
You are dropping things
right out of your pocket here.

554
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,900
You want to come in here for a minute?

555
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,500
- Yeah, look, Rich, is instant okay?
- That's fine.

556
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,100
- Good. What?
- Look what I found in his pocket.

557
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,100
Wow.

558
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Jesus.

559
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,500
I never knew he was into the drug scene.

560
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,400
God. Look how much is here.

561
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,300
This is not recreational. This is a career.

562
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,500
This man needs some help. You know that?

563
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,700
If he's not careful,
he's going to wake up dead.

564
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,600
<i>I watch 20/20. I know the statistics.</i>

565
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,400
I read.

566
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,700
- What?
- Larry, Lomax is dead.

567
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,200
He can't be.

568
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,200
Why do these things always happen to me?

569
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,200
What kind of a host invites you to his house
for the weekend and dies on you?

570
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,500
Why would he do this?
I mean, he had everything.

571
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,400
A house. Cars. Women.

572
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
This is tragic.

573
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't understand why he couldn't wait
until Monday to kill himself.

574
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,600
Look. We have to call the police.

575
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
And how am I going to get back to the city?
He promised me a ride.

576
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,000
Knock it off, Larry. Who cares about a ride?
We are talking death here.

577
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,300
I mean this is just my luck.

578
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,600
I finally catch a break at the office...

579
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,800
finally see some light
at the end of the tunnel and wham! Gone!

580
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Wait a minute. What am I going to tell them?

581
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,900
They might think
we had something to do with it.

582
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,900
I told everyone we were going
to Bernie's house for the weekend.

583
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,300
They were so jealous. I mean, I loved it.

584
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,100
- Now what am I going to tell them?
- I don't know.

585
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Bernie, you should have been on the court.

586
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,900
- What a great day.
- Do you see him?

587
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,100
Where are you?

588
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,300
Bernie, baby, get off your ass.
It's party time!

589
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,300
You should have been out there
sailing with us today.

590
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,300
The sun was fabulous, the wind was
fabulous, we had a great time.

591
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,000
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

592
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,400
Love you, darling, just love you.
You know, you could use a little sun.

593
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
We are going again tomorrow
if you want to go.

594
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,100
Lie on the deck, catch those rays.
Don't worry. I'll help myself.

595
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,200
He's dead.

596
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,500
That's the idea, isn't it? Cheers.

597
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,900
Hi, Bern!

598
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,000
Hey, Bernie.

599
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,700
Hi, Bernie.

600
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,700
Hey, dude. You need to pump some iron.

601
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,800
So, Bernie. What about your Porsche?

602
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
Had a chance to think about my offer?

603
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,200
You know, $30,000 is a more than
decent price for that car.

604
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,100
You just think about it, take your time,
don't rush into anything. See you later.

605
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Excuse me.

606
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,100
You promised me a review...

607
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,500
<i>on the front page
of the Sunday Times book section.</i>

608
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,200
I know, Alice, but he won't bend on it.

609
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,500
He says there's no interest
in the subject matter.

610
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,600
Pardon me. What's the book about?

611
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,600
Whether Sherlock Holmes
and Dr. Watson were secretly married.

612
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,500
- Eyes, nose, and breasts.
- How much?

613
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,300
A little tuck here, little sand there,
a little lift there.

614
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,500
Do I need that much?

615
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,200
These people.
Where did all these people come from?

616
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,600
Floating party. Happens every weekend.

617
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
- Like a drink?
- No, thanks.

618
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah, I'd love some champagne, thanks.

619
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,500
Hey, Bernie. What a radical party.

620
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,800
Got to move your workout
to late tomorrow afternoon, B.

621
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Liza's maid is over for the weekend,
and I had to give her your regular time.

622
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,600
Thanks, Klaus. I got it.

623
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,100
See you, Bern.

624
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,300
Feels good, eh, Bern? You are really loose.

625
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Never seen you this relaxed before.
Keep it up.

626
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,200
I've got to go. Duty calls.

627
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,900
Hey, babe.

628
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,200
Hi, Bernie. I hear you got something for me.

629
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,900
A little present.

630
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,300
Playing games, are we?

631
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,400
It's got to be in here somewhere.

632
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,900
I think I found something.

633
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,200
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

634
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,100
Doesn't anyone realize he's dead?

635
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Okay, Bernie, I'm going to shoot the wad.

636
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,800
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I am going to go $40,000.

637
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,500
No? You'll be begging me.

638
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,200
We have to call the police.

639
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
Here.

640
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,400
- Some of the biggest producers.
- Yeah?

641
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,200
Hello, is this the police? Yes...

642
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,300
I got an idea.

643
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,100
I know it's going to sound funny,
but just hear me out.

644
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No, why is the hair on the back of
my neck starting to stand up?

645
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,500
Okay, now, we could call the police,
we could do that...

646
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,700
but you know where we'd be
spending our weekend...

647
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,200
in some hot police station answering
questions we don't know the answers to.

648
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,300
Now, obviously Bernie felt
he owed us something here...

649
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,600
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company.

650
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,800
That's why he invited us out here
for the weekend in the first place.

651
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,100
It'd be almost disrespectful
not to grant him his final wish.

652
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,500
All I am saying is,
why don't we just pretend he didn't die?

653
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,500
Just for a bit?

654
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,900
I don't believe I am hearing this.

655
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,100
I loved that man. He loved me.

656
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,900
I know he loved you.

657
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,300
He'd want this.

658
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,100
I mean he would really want this.

659
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes, Operator, can you get me
the police, please? Thank you.

660
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,500
Incidentally,
you're a disgusting human being.

661
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,200
Gwen.

662
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,500
- Well, hello, Gwen.
- Wayne. Hi.

663
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,900
<i>Hampton Bay Police Department.</i>

664
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,900
<i>Hello?</i>

665
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,500
It's amazing.

666
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,200
<i>- Hello. Police department.
- I'll call the police.</i>

667
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,600
No, you know, you were right.
Bernie would have wanted it this way.

668
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,600
No, I think we should call the police.

669
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,400
Larry, just give me 10 minutes, okay?

670
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,800
Take 20.

671
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,800
- Hi.
- Hi, Freda.

672
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,300
Darling, you look wonderful.

673
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,300
$45,000.

674
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,600
Plus free tennis lessons.
That's it, take it or leave it.

675
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,700
Is this guy a tough negotiator or what?

676
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,800
Keep the piece of shit.

677
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,700
What a bash.

678
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,700
You animal. You are insatiable.

679
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,000
You slay me, Bernie.

680
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,900
- I've got to talk to you.
- Bernie is a little wasted right now.

681
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,300
Hi. Wait. Okay.

682
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,900
I can't blame you if you
never want to speak to me again.

683
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,300
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to speak to me, either.

684
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,500
But I just want to tell you I am sorry
for being such a jerk last night.

685
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,000
I don't know what got into me.
I hope you can forgive me.

686
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,200
It was kind of funny, seeing your father
in his underwear and everything.

687
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,400
- So you do forgive me?
- No, but it was kind of funny.

688
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,300
I'll never lie again. Honest.

689
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,100
So what are you doing here?

690
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,700
Mr. Lomax invited me and my friend Larry
for the weekend.

691
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
- Moving up in the company?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,400
I saw this great play. Yeah, it's called...

693
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,500
You are on your own for a minute here.

694
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,100
Great writer.

695
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,200
Well, hello.

696
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,900
I'm Larry.

697
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,100
Fuck off, Larry.

698
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,600
Okay.

699
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
By the way, how's your aunt?

700
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,000
- Who?
- Your aunt?

701
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,300
- She passed away.
- I'm sorry.

702
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,500
It's all right.

703
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,600
Didn't you say you'd be spending
this weekend with your parents?

704
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
- Yes, I did. I am. They have a house here.
- Great.

705
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,400
There's Bernie. I wanted to thank him
for my summer job.

706
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,100
I'll be right back.

707
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,500
No!

708
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,300
What?

709
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,500
Nothing.

710
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,900
Go see Bernie about it. Go see Bernie.

711
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,900
- Gwen, darling, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

712
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,900
Have I ever told you
I never liked the name Gwen on you?

713
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,600
To me you'll always be Vanessa.

714
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,200
Her father and I,
we went to Harvard together.

715
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,000
You are probably right. Oh, Bernie.

716
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,100
Here we go, sugar, move it over!
Okay, baby?

717
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
Asshole!

718
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,700
- I don't understand why we've to move him.
- Don't ask. Just move him.

719
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,800
Here we go. Ready?

720
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,800
- I can't believe I'm touching a dead body.
- He was your boss. Come on, let's go.

721
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,100
- What a kidder.
- Bernie, you had a little too much.

722
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,700
Come on, you had too much again,
you big knucklehead.

723
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,400
Come on, let's go.

724
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,900
Come on. He is crazy.

725
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,700
Here we go. Walk it off, big guy.

726
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,000
Nice outfit.

727
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,000
Look even nicer
crumpled up on my floor in the morning.

728
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Polyester doesn't crumple.

729
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,800
- Here we go. That's it, Bernie.
- Hi, Bernie.

730
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,600
- Just like last week, huh?
- Come on.

731
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,800
All right. Okay.

732
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,900
Look me in the eye. $50,000.

733
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,500
Yes! I knew it! Thank you, Bernie!

734
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,500
Thank you so much. This guy is like family.

735
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,900
You are beautiful!

736
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,900
Grab him. Larry.

737
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,900
- Jesus.
- Oh, God.

738
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,000
- Hi, boys. Great view.
- Hello, there. How are you?

739
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,400
I give it an 8.3.

740
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,400
We can't just leave him there, you know.

741
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,200
<i>Girl. Beach. Sand. Surf. Moonlight.
Did you ever see Here to Eternity?</i>

742
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,600
You are right. We better get him.

743
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,500
- Thirty minutes. Then we call the cops.
- Not a second more.

744
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,100
Ladies, how are you?

745
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:27,900
Hi.

746
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,400
Hi.

747
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,500
Are we allowed to talk or anything?

748
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,500
Why did you leave the party?

749
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,700
I just don't feel comfortable
with most of those people.

750
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,500
I don't really know any of those people.
I just know, knew, know Bernie.

751
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,700
Besides, I figure
I can thank Bernie tomorrow.

752
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,400
When there's more privacy.

753
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,100
- Where are we going?
- There's a beautiful view from up there.

754
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Great.

755
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,900
Ever been in a lighthouse before?

756
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,800
No, this is my first time. This is great.

757
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,200
Does anybody live up there?
A lighthouse keeper or someone?

758
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,700
No, It's all automated now. Come on.

759
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,200
That takes some of the romance out of it.

760
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
Does it?

761
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,400
- You all right?
- Yeah.

762
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,400
You're right. This is beautiful.

763
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,800
My God.
You can see the whole island from up here.

764
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,900
I've always wondered
how these things work.

765
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,300
Richard, don't.

766
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,400
- I can't see.
- Watch out for the trap...

767
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
door.

768
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,500
Oh, my God.

769
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,700
- That one works.
- Richard.

770
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,500
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

771
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,600
- Are you sure?
- I fell down a couple of stairs.

772
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,500
- Anything broken?
- Nothing's broken.

773
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,300
- Are you sure?
- A little pain, but I'm all right.

774
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,300
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm good.

775
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,100
Here. Hold on.

776
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,200
The good news is, I can see again.

777
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,300
- I'm so sorry, Richard.
- No, it's okay, really.

778
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,100
I've always wanted a limp.

779
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,700
I must thank you.
This has been a great date.

780
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,800
I hope my major medical covers it.

781
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,300
What?

782
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,700
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh...

783
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,700
but the look on your face
when you fell through the trapdoor.

784
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,700
I think I've got a cracked rib.

785
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,500
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

786
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,300
No, I better not. The way things are going,
I'm gonna break my ass.

787
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,100
You'll be okay.

788
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,000
I've had a crush on you
since the first day I saw you at work.

789
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,500
I'm crazy about you.

790
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,100
This is so right.

791
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,300
Oh, my God. This can't be happening to me.

792
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,900
It's happening to both of us.
You're right. It's so right.

793
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,600
No. This isn't right, it's all wrong.
Not here in the sand.

794
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,900
- What?
- You deserve more than this.

795
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,700
You need music, flowers, candles.
You need...

796
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You need to get out of here.

797
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,900
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious. You could catch a cold.

798
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,900
- Where do you live?
- Dune Walk.

799
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,600
Are you dead, too?

800
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,500
Mister? Hello?

801
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,200
Oh, Jesus. What is it with this place?

802
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,100
How are you? Party's over.
You have to go home now.

803
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,800
- Where's Bernie?
- He's swimming.

804
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,500
I had a wonderful time.
I'm sorry I had to leave so early.

805
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,000
Have fun. See you at the next one. Larry!

806
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,100
Larry, are you in there?

807
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,100
- Come on out, Lar. Right now.
- Go away.

808
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,600
I need to talk to you.

809
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

810
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,000
Bernie is waiting for us.

811
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,400
- Look, Bernie isn't going anywhere, okay?
- I need you, Lar.

812
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,700
Bernie, he needs you, too.

813
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Unbelievable.

814
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,100
How am I supposed to know
that the tide is gonna come up that high?

815
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,900
I don't want to talk about it.

816
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,500
I don't understand why this is becoming
all my fault.

817
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,100
- Did you invite somebody over?
- Of course not.

818
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,100
Somebody's here.

819
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,000
Let's just shove him in the bedroom,
we'll say he's sleeping.

820
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,900
Bernie, you cheat.

821
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,300
Two-timer.

822
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,800
Bernie, open up.

823
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,300
Darn you, Bernie.

824
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,400
Don't do this to me.

825
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,800
Where the hell are you, you son of a bitch?

826
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,500
I got you now, you two-timing bastard.

827
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,700
Who the hell are you? Where's Bernie?

828
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,100
We're Bernie's houseguests. Who are you?

829
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,500
I'm his woman.

830
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,900
And I'll kill him if he's cheating on me.
Now, where the hell is he?

831
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,300
And don't try to cover up for him, either.

832
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,000
- He's not here.
- Haven't seen him.

833
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,600
I don't believe you.

834
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,900
I'm gonna tear this place apart.

835
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,200
- That's his woman?
- I guess so.

836
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,600
Where the hell is he?

837
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,200
- He's in the bedroom.
- Is that so?

838
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,000
He better be alone.

839
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,900
God damn it.

840
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,400
Fun while it lasted, huh?

841
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,600
What difference does it make,
we might as well get this over with.

842
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,800
This is good. She discovers the body,
she calls the police.

843
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,700
Fix me a drink, will you?

844
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,100
I hate it when they scream.

845
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,300
Oh, no!

846
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,800
What gives? She has been up there, what,

847
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,100
I don't get it.

848
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,100
Got a little scotch?

849
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,100
Sure.

850
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,600
- Did everything go okay up there?
- Never been better.

851
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,500
Good.

852
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,500
How do you like that?
The guy gets laid more dead than I do alive.

853
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,900
No, she couldn't have.

854
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,600
He couldn't have.

855
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,500
I get yelled at when I just lay there.

856
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:02,400
Vito, I'm telling you, Lomax is alive.
She was with him for at least half an hour...

857
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,900
<i>- in the bedroom.
- What were they doing in the bedroom?</i>

858
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,900
I'd rather not say.

859
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,900
<i>What the hell happened to Paulie?</i>

860
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,400
Yeah, maybe Paulie
is rustier than we thought, huh?

861
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,400
- What a night.
- Great, isn't it? It isn't over yet.

862
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,500
It is for me. I'm dead. No offense, Bernie.

863
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,000
I just gotta lie down for a minute.

864
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,800
Suit yourself. Whatever you like.
I'm going on to find the next party.

865
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,400
- Just wake me up when you get back.
- Okay, sure.

866
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,800
- Whatever you like.
- Because I got to call the cops.

867
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,800
- Of course you do. In the morning.
- I need a clear head.

868
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,500
Good night, buddy.

869
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,700
Don't forget. Wake me up.

870
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,900
I made these a little sweeter this time.
Okay, Bernie?

871
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,400
God, it's glorious out, huh?

872
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,400
Here we go, my friend.

873
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,000
This should do it.

874
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,000
Okay.

875
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,200
How did you deal with?

876
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,100
Oriental? I think I own that one.

877
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,100
With hotel.

878
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,000
$550.

879
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,200
Give me $600, we'll call it square.

880
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,800
Hey, Bernie, Larry.

881
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,500
Great party last night, Bernie.
Your best ever.

882
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,800
Ladies. Hello. How are you today?

883
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
- Great.
- Fine.

884
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,200
- Are we doing it again today?
- Absolutely. You know we are.

885
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,400
- Great. We'll see you later, guys.
- Bye-bye.

886
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,600
Bye-bye, ladies. We'll see you later.

887
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,000
Is this great or what?

888
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Okay, coming out. My turn.

889
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,600
Shooter now.

890
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,000
Yes! Free parking. $500 for me.

891
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,300
Bastard!

892
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,200
I own it. Okay, that is $24...

893
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,200
I own them all. $46, my friend. Call it $50.

894
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,900
Thank you. My turn. Here we go.

895
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,500
Lucky seven coming out.

896
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
Shit.

897
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,600
One more you get out of jail free.
All right. Fine. Your turn. I'll roll.

898
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,100
Here we go. Coming out.

899
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,400
Community Chest.

900
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,000
Second prize in a beauty contest.

901
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,300
- What are you doing?
- Playing Monopoly. You want to play?

902
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
- No.
- Here we go.

903
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,900
- How did he get down here?
- He walked.

904
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,200
- He walked?
- Say good morning.

905
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh, God. You're just a sick man, Larry.

906
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,500
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30.

907
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,500
You let me sleep till 11:30? I have...

908
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,100
- When did you get a Rolex?
- Oh, this.

909
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,400
- Good God!
- He didn't need it anymore.

910
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,700
That's it. We're gonna go to jail.
They're gonna arrest us.

911
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,300
- I'm calling the cops.
- I wanted to call them yesterday, my friend.

912
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,200
He's very upset. Richard, look.

913
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,400
Let me just say one thing here.
There's no reason to get pissy about this.

914
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,100
Hello.

915
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,800
- Richard?
- It's for you.

916
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,500
- Gwen.
- Hi.

917
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,300
What are you doing here?

918
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,900
I just came by to talk to Bernie.
I didn't get a chance to last night, so...

919
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,700
Oh, no. Bernie and I
are in a very big business meeting.

920
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,800
- Now?
- Yes.

921
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Bernie has such little time,
so can you come back later?

922
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,500
Wait a minute.
What happened to Mr. Romantic?

923
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,400
- Candlelight? Flowers?
- I know. But Bernie is tied up right now.

924
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,200
- It's a bad time.
- What is going on, Richard?

925
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,500
Okay. I'll tell you.

926
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,000
I probably shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but...

927
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
at this point, why not? Mr. Lomax is...

928
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,100
my boss. I work for him
at the insurance company.

929
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,900
Bernie, you're starting to peel.

930
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,200
Better get you out of the sun, huh?

931
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,500
Here we go.

932
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,900
We were really looking forward
to coming out here...

933
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,800
when we got here, Mr. Lomax...

934
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,700
Bernie was...

935
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,700
dead.

936
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,000
Dead.

937
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,400
Like your mother and father were dead.
And your aunt is dead, too?

938
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Different kind of dead.

939
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,400
You son of a bitch. I got you.

940
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,800
Then how come I saw Bernie
with you and your friend at the party?

941
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,400
Because...

942
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,200
You don't believe me?

943
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,400
Okay, I'm gonna prove it to you. Come on.

944
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,900
This is not going to be fun.

945
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,300
I know you think I'm crazy, but...

946
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,900
Well?

947
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,700
Where is Bernie?

948
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,400
Oh, hello.

949
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,500
- Where's Bernie?
- He went for more daiquiri mix.

950
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,800
No, he didn't.

951
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,600
Richard, I don't know what
this game is you're playing...

952
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,300
but this is ridiculous.

953
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,000
- I'm out of here.
- Gwen, I'm not playing any games with you.

954
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,500
I'm telling you the truth! Bernie is here.

955
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,500
Where is Bernie?

956
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,200
What, you bastard, did you do with Bernie?

957
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,200
I'm phoning the police.

958
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,000
There's no dial tone. With 97 buttons...

959
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,700
<i>- Where is your house?
- Where is the off button?</i>

960
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,700
<i>Look, Paulie, just don't kill them
while I'm around.</i>

961
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,700
<i>- Bernie, we're on a phone here.
- You're right.</i>

962
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,100
- Play that back.
- I just got it stopped.

963
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,700
Play it back, please.

964
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,800
<i>Hey, Lomax, it's Paulie.
I just got to the island.</i>

965
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,100
<i>You're early.</i>

966
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,500
<i>Those two schmucks
won't come until the 6:00 ferry...</i>

967
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,200
<i>- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.</i>

968
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,800
<i>- Where is your house?
- It's on the point, top of the dune.</i>

969
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,700
<i>Look, Paulie...</i>

970
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,400
<i>- don't kill them while I'm around.
- Bernie, we're on the phone here.</i>

971
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,300
<i>You're right. I'm sorry.</i>

972
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,300
<i>The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi.</i>

973
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,800
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

974
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,800
We were on the 6:00 ferry.

975
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,100
And we're two schmucks.

976
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,000
- Kill us?
- Lomax?

977
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,100
Bernie is gonna have us killed?

978
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,600
Kill us?

979
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,300
- Why?
- I don't know.

980
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,700
Unless he's the one
whose been stealing from the company.

981
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,000
Son of a bitch. He's gonna kill me!

982
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,200
I liked the guy.

983
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,100
Okay.

984
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,600
He said something about a note, right?

985
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,100
- I know, Richard.
- Let's find it.

986
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Bernie, you lying swine.

987
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,300
Holy crap!

988
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,800
What?

989
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,300
- There's a $100,000 here easy.
- This is the note. Listen.

990
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,800
"Richard Parker and I
stole this money from the company...

991
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,400
- "to pay for my sex change operation."
- What?

992
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,100
That's what it says.

993
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,000
"Now he tells me he loves someone else.
I can't live with that, and neither will he."

994
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,400
It's got my name on it.

995
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,100
Oh, God.

996
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,000
Son of a bitch. It's not bad enough
that he's trying to kill me...

997
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,300
now he's turning me into a drag queen.

998
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,600
Why couldn't he say
you were having the operation?

999
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,000
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, Richard.

1000
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,300
- I've a reputation to protect here.
- For Christ's sakes, Larry!

1001
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,300
No one is going
to have a sex change operation.

1002
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,800
Oh, yeah!

1003
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,400
I got to call the cops.

1004
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,900
<i>- Operator.
- Operator, the police, please.</i>

1005
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,200
<i>You mean Ed?
He's out on the beach somewhere.</i>

1006
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,600
When do you expect Ed back?
It's a bit of an emergency.

1007
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,400
<i>I don't know. Wanna leave a message?</i>

1008
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,800
<i>- Yeah. Help!
- Okay.</i>

1009
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,700
Let's get out of here.

1010
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,700
We have to get off this island,
and maybe not get killed doing it.

1011
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,400
- Wait a minute.
- Tell me you have a brilliant idea.

1012
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,700
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1013
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,700
Lomax told whoever he was talking to
not to kill us if he's around, right?

1014
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,400
But Lomax is dead.
He isn't around anybody anymore.

1015
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,500
I know that. You know that.

1016
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,300
Nobody else knows that.

1017
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,100
Where's Bernie?

1018
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,400
Right there.

1019
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,600
There's no Bernie.

1020
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,900
He's gotta to be, Rich.
I dumped him here myself.

1021
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,000
Where is he?

1022
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,800
- Larry.
- What?

1023
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,900
- Excuse me.
- Hey, kid.

1024
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,600
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

1025
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,300
- You little brat!
- What are you doing?

1026
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,000
Get out of there.

1027
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,400
- What the hell are you doing?
- You can't do that.

1028
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,100
This is private property.

1029
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,600
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah.

1030
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,900
- Shut up.
- Who are you... You lousy...

1031
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,000
You better be gone by the time we get there.

1032
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,000
- Scram! Get out of here!
- You little bastard.

1033
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,500
How'd you like to kiss this?

1034
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,500
- We have bigger problems.
- Kiss my ass.

1035
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,800
- What kind of home training is that?
- He buried all of Bernie.

1036
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,800
Jesus.

1037
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,100
Come on.

1038
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,100
- Good thing for you, you're dead, pal.
- I actually felt sorry for you, you rat shit.

1039
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
He looks good enough. Let's go.

1040
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,000
- Larry.
- What?

1041
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,600
Jesus.

1042
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,500
I never knew he wore a toupee.
You can hardly tell.

1043
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,000
Who cares? What are we gonna do about it?
We can't take him out like this.

1044
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,700
The killer might not know it's Bernie
and shoot us.

1045
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,100
- So long, Lar, it has been fun but not really.
- Goodbye, Rich.

1046
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,200
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1047
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Jesus.

1048
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,000
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1049
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,900
You little bastard.

1050
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,100
- Get back here, you little monster.
- Never mind him.

1051
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,900
I'm gonna rip your gums out!

1052
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,500
- I'm gonna get that little kid.
- What are we gonna do with Bernie?

1053
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,400
Oh, boy.

1054
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,900
Come on, Bernie. Up.

1055
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Put it on him.

1056
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,200
Brilliant.

1057
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,100
- Sambuca on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

1058
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Here we go. Ready. Up.

1059
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,900
You take him down. I'll get the cart.

1060
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,800
Hey, Bernie!

1061
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,300
Bernie, wait a minute.

1062
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,900
- That guy talking to us?
- Who cares? Get out of here.

1063
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1064
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,900
Bernie, come on.

1065
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,300
- Hey, Bernie. Looking good.
- Hi.

1066
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,500
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hello.

1067
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,300
- Great party last night, Bern.
- How are you?

1068
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,700
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1069
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,300
Jesus. He's behind us.

1070
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,300
Shit! Is that the killer?

1071
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,700
How do I know, Richard?
Should I stop and ask him?

1072
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,200
No. Just drive. Just go.

1073
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,000
Bernie, I gotta talk to you.

1074
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,100
- Doesn't this thing go any faster?
- This is it.

1075
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,800
We gotta talk.

1076
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,300
What about our arrangement?

1077
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Come on, Larry. Move it.

1078
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,700
Hey, Bernie. The Maserati.
I painted it black for you.

1079
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,900
The Maserati!

1080
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,400
Ferry's gonna leave.

1081
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,300
Hold it. Wait. Stop this for a second.

1082
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,400
Let's go.

1083
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,200
Rich, grab him. Grab a leg.

1084
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,100
Wait.

1085
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,400
We can't just drag him in.
He's got to look like he's alive.

1086
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,600
Idea.

1087
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,100
Your right leg on three, ready?
Here we go. One, two, three, go.

1088
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,100
Hold the boat!

1089
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,800
Got it? Hold the boat.

1090
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,900
Hold that boat.

1091
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,400
Hold it.

1092
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,900
- Hi, Bern.
- How are you doing?

1093
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,800
Hold the boat!

1094
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,200
Hold the boat, please.

1095
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,100
Hold on. We'll be right there.

1096
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,300
We're coming.

1097
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,700
Come on, Bern.

1098
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,100
Hold it. Hold the boat.

1099
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,200
Shit! What do we do?

1100
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,400
Stop the boat.

1101
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,700
Look at this fool.
He wants to get off, we want to get on.

1102
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,500
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What?

1103
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,300
You don't have to worry about
anybody else murdering you...

1104
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,300
because I'll do it. This was all your fault.

1105
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,800
- We'll die on this crummy island.
- Let me remind you...

1106
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,200
you're the one who did the extra work
on the computer.

1107
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,500
If it wasn't for me
you'd be fired six months ago.

1108
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,100
You can't even work the coffee machine.

1109
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,700
A little brownnosing, ass kissing,
to work our way up that corporate ladder.

1110
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,100
Why can't you be a lazy shit like I am?

1111
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,700
Somebody talk to the captain.

1112
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,700
I've got to get off the boat.

1113
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,300
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

1114
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,600
Please.

1115
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,100
Somebody talk to the captain.

1116
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,800
- I'm sorry, but we're still gonna die.
- Not if Bernie's with us.

1117
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,900
Great, I hope the killer keeps that in mind.

1118
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,300
Larry, please tell me
how we're going to get off this island.

1119
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,200
- We got a boat.
- What boat?

1120
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,500
Lomax's boat.

1121
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,200
- Tawny brought the keys back, remember?
- Right. Okay.

1122
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,300
You go and get them,
I'll stay here with Bernie.

1123
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,900
I'm not going anywhere without Bernie.

1124
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,400
You go back, get the keys.
I'll stay with Bernie.

1125
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,500
We'll all go back to the house.
We'll all get the goddamn keys.

1126
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,500
- We'll all stay with Bernie.
- Fine.

1127
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,700
Hurry up.

1128
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,100
Move it.

1129
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,600
Hold up.

1130
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,400
Okay. The keys.

1131
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,100
- Here they are.
- Got it. Let's go.

1132
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,500
Oh, my God, Richard!

1133
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,900
It's the killer.

1134
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,000
Get the door.

1135
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,800
Quiet.

1136
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,800
- Lock it.
- I can't lock it.

1137
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,700
I only have a key to the boat.

1138
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,800
Kitchen.

1139
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,000
- There's no door. Back door.
- Okay.

1140
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,200
Don't panic.

1141
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,700
Do something, Rich.

1142
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,700
I got Bernie, you get the guy.

1143
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,800
Do something, Rich.

1144
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,800
Get him, Rich.

1145
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,800
You in here, Lomax? You little bastard.

1146
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,600
You jerk.

1147
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,700
Kick me in the ass.

1148
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,400
It's my turn now.

1149
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,300
Got him, Lar.

1150
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,400
There's another one.

1151
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,500
He's got a knife.

1152
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,100
Mr. Lomax.

1153
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,300
What the hell?

1154
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,800
- You can come out now, Rambo.
- You sure, Rich?

1155
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,600
Good job.

1156
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,600
- Two killers.
- Anybody could be the killer.

1157
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,600
- Jesus, we gotta get rid of them.
- Let's shove them in the kitchen pantry.

1158
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,200
I don't know why
I have to carry the heavy guy.

1159
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,000
Get his legs.

1160
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,700
Larry, let me out.

1161
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,900
Here comes Bernie.

1162
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,900
Coming through!

1163
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,000
There it is. Stop.

1164
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,900
Hi, guys.

1165
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:47,500
Ready? On three, here we go.
One, two, three.

1166
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,800
Let's go.

1167
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,100
Okay. Untie us.

1168
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,700
Okay?

1169
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,500
- Give me the keys.
- Have you ever driven a boat before?

1170
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,200
I was born on a boat.

1171
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,500
This is a fancy boat.

1172
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,600
- Push something.
- I am, Richard.

1173
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,900
- Nothing's happening.
- I know.

1174
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,000
- Push something else.
- Something's happening.

1175
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,500
Something's definitely
happening here, huh?

1176
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,700
Wait a minute, hold on.

1177
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

1178
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,400
- I know it's here.
- Just keep pressing those buttons.

1179
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,000
I'm pressing. I pressed that button.

1180
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,200
- Nothing is happening, Larry.
- I know that.

1181
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,500
- Did you try the key?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

1182
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,900
- Try the key again.
- Fine.

1183
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,400
See that?

1184
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,800
- Here we go!
- We're going home. Give it some gas now.

1185
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,000
Giving it gas.

1186
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,600
Gas.

1187
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,900
- Nothing's happening.
- More gas.

1188
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,200
A little more gas.

1189
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,000
We're not moving. Why aren't we moving?

1190
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,300
I don't know.

1191
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:04,000
- Larry, you said you've done this before.
- It's different than my boat, okay?

1192
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,900
Don't panic.

1193
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,500
Stop the boat, Larry.

1194
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,800
Stop!

1195
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,400
Back it up.

1196
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,400
We got it.

1197
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,300
- What's going on?
- That's illegal.

1198
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,400
- What you're doing is illegal.
- You have a nice day now.

1199
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,800
Are you nuts?

1200
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,600
- Got it now. Moving forward. Hold on.
- Oh, shit!

1201
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,100
Sorry, Rich. Coming back.

1202
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,100
Coming around.

1203
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,200
Why is this happening to me?

1204
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,300
Coming back.

1205
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,700
- Here we are.
- Stop the boat. Idiot.

1206
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,500
Stop the boat!

1207
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,600
- Where are the brakes?
- Boats don't have brakes, Captain.

1208
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,200
You're kidding. How do they stop?

1209
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,600
Throw the anchor.

1210
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,700
The anchor, throw it.

1211
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,800
- They're headed for us.
- Here we go.

1212
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,700
Whatever you're doing, don't.

1213
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,300
Sorry.

1214
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,000
You broke my watch.

1215
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,000
Mine still works.

1216
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,300
You better put that thing
back on the dead body.

1217
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,000
Drive the boat, Richard.

1218
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,900
The cops are gonna take
our fat heads to jail.

1219
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,100
My God. Look at them.

1220
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,600
Ladies, how are you?

1221
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,500
Hello, Betty.

1222
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,500
God! Just once, I'd like a woman like that.

1223
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,700
Let's party.

1224
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,100
Turn the boat.

1225
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,200
Watch the fishermen.

1226
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,200
- Watch the wake!
- Duck!

1227
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,900
Watch the wake, Richard!

1228
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
This is tougher than it looks.

1229
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,900
You're doing very well, Richard.

1230
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,000
- Sorry I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

1231
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,300
I've never been chased by a killer before.

1232
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,600
It's all right. You're doing very well.

1233
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,400
- Why is everybody waving at us?
- I'm popular.

1234
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,300
I see.

1235
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,300
Hey, Bernie, showing off again?

1236
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,700
Oh, God. What the hell are those things?

1237
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,300
Those are obviously channel markers.

1238
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,500
Obviously.

1239
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,600
Okay, wise ass, do you know
what side I'm supposed to pass on?

1240
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,400
That I don't know. Just stay close.
What else can happen here?

1241
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,600
I've got no idea.

1242
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,700
- Serpentine.
- Is that close enough?

1243
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,200
Do you hear something?

1244
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,500
- There it's again.
- Yeah.

1245
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,100
- I wonder what that is.
- What is that?

1246
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,200
- Man overboard.
- What?

1247
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,600
Stop the boat.

1248
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,000
He's got nice form.

1249
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
- I don't know.
- I'm trying to drive a boat.

1250
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,100
- You're doing well.
- Trying to get us off this island of hell.

1251
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,100
You had maybe one job to do.
Watch a dead body.

1252
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,600
- Well, let's not argue about it.
- Jesus.

1253
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,500
- You were the one who tied him up.
- Don't blame this all on me.

1254
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,600
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1255
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,600
You've lost my sunglasses.

1256
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,000
What are you doing?

1257
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,900
I haven't got a clue.

1258
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't believe this.

1259
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,600
What?

1260
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,800
We're out of gas.

1261
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,000
Paddling in the Atlantic Ocean...

1262
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,800
- on a dead body.
- I'm getting swimmer's ear.

1263
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,000
This is now the perfect weekend.

1264
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:26,300
It started when I almost broke my leg
jumping on a moving ferry.

1265
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,300
I get to this beautiful beach and my host...
Sorry, he's dead.

1266
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,400
Hampton Island.

1267
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,500
Checkers. Excuse me, sir.
Is this your launch?

1268
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,700
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't rush.

1269
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,100
Come on.

1270
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,200
- Can you put a little snap in it, fellows?
- Okay, Cappy.

1271
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,300
Hold on, you damn fool.

1272
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,100
I fell down a lighthouse.
I had a corpse wash up...

1273
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,300
next to me on the shore.

1274
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,700
And then I find out that my dead boss
is not only a thief, he wants to kill me.

1275
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,600
I almost drown.

1276
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,600
The girl of my dreams
now thinks I'm a raving lunatic.

1277
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,300
You mean what's- her-name?

1278
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,700
And, now, we're going back
to the house of death.

1279
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,900
- Great weekend, huh?
- Great weekend!

1280
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,200
Just get here as fast as you can.
Thanks, Ed.

1281
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,300
Police is on the way.

1282
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,900
Can just lock ourselves in
until they get here?

1283
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,300
I hate it when he stares at me like that.

1284
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,600
Let's go.

1285
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,800
Put him in his bathroom.

1286
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,600
- Bernie's picked up a little weight.
- What do you expect?

1287
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,600
He's been soaking in the ocean
for two hours.

1288
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,900
Made a damn good float though.

1289
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,000
Are you in here?

1290
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,200
It's Gwen.

1291
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,800
Hi, Gwen.

1292
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,500
You've got to be the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

1293
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,100
You told me Bernie was dead, right?

1294
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,900
I just saw you with him.

1295
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,900
What's your explanation this time?

1296
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,400
I don't mean to be rude,
but get the hell out of here.

1297
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,700
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what is going on.

1298
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,700
Listen to me!

1299
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:32,000
You're in danger here,
leave unless you want to get shot.

1300
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,600
Lomax is dead,
somebody is trying to kill us.

1301
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,600
Can we stay at your house
until the cops come or what?

1302
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,200
It's just Bernie.

1303
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,800
Gwen, listen to me.

1304
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,900
We didn't do this to him.
Do we look like we could kill someone?

1305
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,100
Honey, have a drink, relax. You'll be fine.

1306
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,800
Let me rephrase that.
Do I look like I could kill someone?

1307
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,500
What is going on in there?

1308
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,800
- Which one of you bastards hit me?
- Son of a bitch.

1309
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,400
You want to get your butt kicked?

1310
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,500
I can explain.

1311
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,400
Company.

1312
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,500
I didn't see anything.
I was looking at my watch.

1313
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,100
I'm blind.

1314
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,100
It's empty.

1315
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,400
That's right. But this ain't.

1316
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,200
Run!

1317
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,600
Move it! This way!

1318
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,600
It's locked.

1319
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,000
What are you doing?
We're friends of Bernie's.

1320
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,700
I hate Bernie's friends.

1321
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
This way.

1322
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,400
To the bedroom.

1323
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,600
Come on, let's go. Up.

1324
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,200
You're dead meat, you little bastards.

1325
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,300
Now I'm really mad!

1326
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,100
Wait.

1327
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,500
- What?
- You take Gwen, you go hide...

1328
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,600
I'll let him chase me,
you try and call the cops, okay?

1329
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,900
Okay? That's it? No arguments?

1330
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,000
I'll get you all, one by one.

1331
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,200
There's no place to hide.

1332
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,900
I'm gonna die.

1333
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,200
You kicked me, you bastard.

1334
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,000
Shit! Out of bullets.

1335
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,700
Sit the hell down.

1336
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,200
Hang on, Lar.

1337
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,000
- Coming.
- I got him.

1338
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,100
Get off.

1339
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,300
- Hang on, Lar.
- I got him.

1340
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,100
Stand up. Fight like a man.
Come on. Put them up, you chicken.

1341
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,900
Watch this, Richard.

1342
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,800
All right, Lar.

1343
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,200
Fists of steel.

1344
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,000
Bernie, let go of me.

1345
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,500
I always liked you, Bernie.

1346
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,900
I got it, thanks.

1347
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,600
Just a little closer. Just get the two of us.

1348
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,300
Get the handshake in, okay?

1349
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,400
Wait a minute. I think I blinked. Did I blink?
I think I blinked a second there.

1350
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,400
- He blinked.
- He blinked. I saw him.

1351
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,900
Make sure he's wrapped up good.

1352
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,200
Wait a minute.

1353
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:16,000
I didn't kill him. He's not dead.

1354
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,200
I tried to kill him.

1355
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,100
Look at him. He's alive.

1356
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,800
- He's not dead. He's alive.
- Move it.

1357
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,700
That man is alive!

1358
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,800
Now what?

1359
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,600
Now I'm gonna take a week off.

1360
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,600
You're taking a vacation?
The man who won't take a coffee break?

1361
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,100
Gwen just invited me to stay with her.
What should I say?

1362
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:40,400
You're kidding me. You invited him?
You fool. That's fabulous.

1363
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,400
You deserve it, Richard.
The company owes you.

1364
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,800
Just a couple of days
until Gwen leaves for school.

1365
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,500
There's plenty of room
if you want to stay, Lar.

1366
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:52,100
Me? Oh, no, thanks.
I'll just tough it out here at Bernie's.

1367
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,100
I hear the party Saturday night is
better than Friday, actually.

1368
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,400
What is going on?

1369
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,100
- What's happened?
- Didn't you hear? Bernie Lomax got killed.

1370
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,400
- No.
- Yeah.

1371
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,900
- Did you go to that party last night?
- No.

1372
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,700
Lawrence, you done real good.
I'm proud of you.

1373
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,500
Yeah, I did okay, huh? Surprised myself.

1374
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,000
You did great, Rich.

1375
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,900
Hi, Bernie. See you at the party tonight.

1376
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,400
What?

1377
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,400
What did she say?

1378
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,000
Mister, can I bury you?

1379
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,900
Great!
