1
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:29,569
Sheriff's office. How can I help?

2
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:32,404
Like I said, I hadn't heard
from this woman, all right?

3
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,376
Problems? What the hell you talking...

4
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:37,415
You guys come and fuckin'
raid my house at 2 in the morning.

5
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,244
You don't even give me
a chance to get my stuff.

6
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:41,409
Throw me out? Throw me out
of my own fuckin' house?

7
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:43,350
It's not your house, Joleen.
It's your boyfriend's house.

8
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,853
That's the reason he's in jail
and you're not.

9
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:46,618
You didn't even
give me a chance to get my stuff.

10
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,089
You can come
and get your stuff later.

11
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:51,755
So we fine here? Can I go?

12
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:54,129
I don't know about being fine,
but I can't hold you, so...

13
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:56,725
Great. Where's my daughter?

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,291
Do you even have
anywhere to take her?

15
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,204
Yeah, I got a lot of places to go to.
I got a lot of options.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,373
Did you ever think maybe Tara'd
be better off with a more stable relative?

17
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,037
- I know she has a father somewhere.
- No.

18
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:10,743
- Just until you get on your feet.
- Just my brother, okay?

19
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,149
- Your brother.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,210
What about your parents?

21
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:18,123
- No parents.
- No parents?

22
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,318
No. All deceased. Where's Tara?

23
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:22,658
Joleen, I know you have a father
because we talked...

24
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:25,365
That man's got nothing to do
with any of this, all right?

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,266
- Joleen, I'm just trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

26
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,634
Can't you get that?
I don't need your help.

27
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,172
- We're fine!
- You're not fine!

28
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:36,042
You think being dragged out
in the middle of the night is fine?

29
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,510
What about Tara?
Moving all over the place,

30
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,017
missing school, having people
talk about her mother is fine?

31
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,877
- Okay, I've had enough.
- Oh, here we go again.

32
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:47,649
Just drag her out
into the middle of this shit again.

33
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:50,625
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take my daughter to school.

34
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,754
You know what then? Then I'm gonna
find us a wonderful place to live, okay?

35
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,798
And I have a lot of options,
by the way, okay?

36
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:58,266
Thank you. Thanks for your help,
but I don't need it.

37
00:01:58,332 --> 00:01:59,698
Tara, let's go!

38
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,430
Come on. Let's go.

39
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:10,713
This is James.

40
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,646
James. Yeah.

41
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,343
Speedy. Right.

42
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,409
Is Mr. Carvel there?

43
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,684
Okay. Well, could you just tell him

44
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:23,661
I-I can't come into work today
on account of my back?

45
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,220
Still... I know.

46
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,391
Okay.

47
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,906
How ya doin', huh? Look at your hair.

48
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:45,178
It's so long. You need a haircut.

49
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,482
You look tired.

50
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:51,354
Well, it's been a shit
couple of days, all right?

51
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,225
Have you gone to jail, too?

52
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,161
Jail? No, James.

53
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,759
- Why would I go to jail? God!
- I don't know.

54
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,670
- Why would I go to jail?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:08,968
This whole thing's got nothing
to do with me, all right?

56
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,705
Okay.

57
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:18,077
- At all.
- Okay.

58
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,711
Got nothing to do
with that shit, all right?

59
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:23,317
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Put your seatbelt on.

60
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:51,247
Tell 'em we got Joleen.
Joleen's coming back.

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,587
Let's go, James. Come on.

62
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:56,288
We currently have
a suspect in custody.

63
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:59,058
It's regarding the marijuana grow...

64
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,093
I brought my brother.

65
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,661
Hey, I'll try to watch my step.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

66
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:08,833
Come on. I just wanna get some
of my shit, if it's not too much to ask.

67
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,173
Are you gonna be calm?

68
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,213
<i>We got marijuana out back.</i>

69
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,770
I hope you guys are proud of yourselves.
A bunch of big men in here.

70
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,010
Just get your stuff, Joleen.

71
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,611
Everybody's fine putting
a little girl out on the street.

72
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:22,747
Where's my coffee can?

73
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,122
Where's my goddamn coffee can?

74
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,093
The last thing you need
is coffee, Joleen.

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,791
You know what I'm talking about.
Last night, when you guys came in here,

76
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,957
there was a goddamn coffee can
on top of that fridge!

77
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,365
It has my money in it.

78
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:39,705
- Bob, did you see this alleged coffee can?
- No.

79
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:43,212
Pretty sure a girl like you can figure out
another way to make some money.

80
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:45,748
Fuck you. Come on, James.

81
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,345
<i>The DEA's discovered</i>

82
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:53,548
<i>quite a few marijuana plants
out there as well.</i>

83
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,887
<i>And there's also marijuana paraphernalia.</i>

84
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,894
<i>DEA says
it goes all the way out there...</i>

85
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:10,409
<i>Marijuana cultivation
all the way down on the left side.</i>

86
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:13,444
<i>DEA's got another grow...</i>

87
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,913
<i>- James!
- about another half acre up there.</i>

88
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:23,211
Let's go. Thanks a lot.

89
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:31,728
Anybody looking?

90
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,287
Uh, no.

91
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,672
All right. Let's go.

92
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,239
What are you looking at?

93
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,298
Can I stay at your house?

94
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,100
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

95
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,974
Tara! Hey, put it in gear! Let's go!

96
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,909
I'll see you later. Bye.

97
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,468
Bye.

98
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:33,654
Today is the first day
of the rest of your whole goddamn life.

99
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,721
Moving again?

100
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,131
<i>Are you all right, miss?</i>

101
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:45,905
<i>I'm really frightened to death.</i>

102
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:49,380
<i>But otherwise all right.</i>

103
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:56,087
Uncle James,
you're creeping me out.

104
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:58,350
Hey, you be nice to Uncle James.

105
00:06:58,422 --> 00:07:01,053
- James, where do you keep your hangers?
- What?

106
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,220
The hangers.
God, this place is some mess.

107
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,287
I should've brought
some of my furniture.

108
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,458
And we're gonna need another pillow
for Tara, by the way.

109
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:10,332
I'm not sleeping in the same bed
as you, Mom.

110
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,806
You know, you could really start
unpacking some of your own shit

111
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:15,671
instead of sitting there
and pretending to do your homework.

112
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,145
I'm not pretending to do my homework.
I'm pretending not to hate my life.

113
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,272
Well, you're not doing
a very good job of pretending.

114
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,408
Well, maybe I'm not applying myself.

115
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:26,079
I don't need this kind of shit
from you right now, Tara!

116
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,247
What kind of shit do you need
from me right now, Mom?

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,314
God, what do you want from me?

118
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,326
God, Tara!

119
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:36,193
Fuck it!

120
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:40,097
<i>Take it easy, baby face.</i>

121
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:09,464
There are hangers in there.
I'm not gonna use them.

122
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,832
How old do I look to you, James?

123
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,474
I don't know.

124
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,413
That is not the right answer.

125
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:27,576
Then what is the right answer?

126
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,313
Here's a rule, okay?

127
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:32,848
You should listen up, because maybe
you'll find a woman for yourself.

128
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:37,293
When a woman asks you
how old she is,

129
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,232
you think,
What age does she want to be?

130
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,032
And then you say that number.

131
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:48,197
That's the right answer.

132
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,873
You look 25.

133
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,584
Ya think?

134
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,418
Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:12,568
25.

136
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,402
<i># What it's all about #</i>

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,234
<i># I can't believe #</i>

138
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,780
<i># That woman done burnt me out #</i>

139
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,379
Don't say it.

140
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:34,048
All right.

141
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,785
- How do I look?
- Great.

142
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,190
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,822
- It's... You look great.
- Aren't you a little old for that shirt?

144
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,832
Didn't I just say "Don't say it"?
I think I did.

145
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,800
You're gonna watch her?

146
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,097
- Yeah.
- Okay.

147
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,469
- Where are you going at least?
- Out.

148
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,941
Oh, my God. That's him.

149
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,000
All right. Wish me luck.

150
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:56,173
- Bye.
- Bye.

151
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:01,318
Have a really wonderful time, Mom.

158
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:50,866
Wait. Wait.

159
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:53,432
Just for fun? Wait.

160
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:56,071
We can say
it's the alcohol talking later.

161
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:59,378
But just for fun, just...
just say you love me.

162
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,351
Come on. Just say it.

163
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:05,652
Doesn't have to mean anything.

164
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,988
- I love you.
- Do you?

165
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:10,027
I love your jeans.

166
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:12,392
- Don't say that.
- I love your pants.

167
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,694
- Say it. Just say it.
- I love your underpants.

168
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:17,234
- Say it.
- I love you.

169
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,632
Yeah?

170
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,831
Who's the man
who always brings you flowers?

171
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:22,236
You.

172
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:27,234
Baby! Mmm!

173
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,745
Whoa. Wait. Wait.

174
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:36,311
Cool your jets. Hang on.
I'll be right back.

175
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,858
I'll be right back, okay?

176
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,675
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

177
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:02,981
Christ, what kind of flophouse
you runnin' here, Jojo?

178
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:08,149
I didn't mean to cramp your style, Sly.

179
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,419
Come on. Come on.

180
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,550
Hey.

181
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,390
Hey, get any sleep?

182
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:47,954
No.

183
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:56,543
You know, we should've asked you
if we could stay here.

184
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,600
I should've done that.

185
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,836
You asked.

186
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:04,109
You... You called me up.

187
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:06,209
No, James.

188
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,777
I remember.

189
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:12,884
It was 2:00 in the morning.
The cops were going through everything.

190
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,056
I told you. I didn't ask you.

191
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,701
Well, anyway,
I'm glad you guys are here.

192
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,365
Jeez.

193
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,535
You know, James,
when people treat you bad,

194
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,672
you shouldn't turn around and be nice.

195
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,710
That's not how it works.

196
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,949
You're a good guy.

197
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,352
You should start standing up for yourself.

198
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:50,199
We're not with Dad anymore.

199
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,694
What's Dad got to do with this?

200
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,104
Nothin'.

201
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:04,110
Hey, you remember this?

202
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,477
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

203
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:12,547
That's the day we left the farm.

204
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:15,890
He beat the shit out of me that night.

205
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,662
Look at her.

206
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,206
She's growing up so fast.

207
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:35,313
I really screwed it up this time.

208
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,318
This is a good place for her.

209
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:54,565
I'm just trying to say thank you, James.

210
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,835
Yeah. It's...

211
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:02,570
It's okay.

212
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:15,346
Yeah.

213
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:23,229
Hey.

214
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,471
Um, I wouldn't go in there just...

215
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:31,133
just yet, okay?

216
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,777
Where's Mom?

217
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:36,312
What?

218
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:38,371
She's not here.

219
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:41,712
Did she leave a note or anything?

220
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:43,778
Did you see anything here?

221
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:47,122
She probably went out for smokes.
I gotta go.

222
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,185
I'm late for work. Sorry.

223
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,560
Hey, how you gonna get to school?

224
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:54,896
Um, I'll just wait for her.

225
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,958
Okay. Bye.

226
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:39,404
All right. That's lunch!

227
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:48,391
So, Speedy, you have any idea

228
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:52,419
where I could buy
about 2 acres worth of weed?

229
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:59,066
Don't worry. I'm not gonna let
any of these other morons in on it.

230
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,005
So what's she up to?

231
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,474
Joleen in jail?

232
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,107
She and Tara are staying at my place.

233
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,945
What? Oh, shit, man!

234
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,714
You gotta have me over!

235
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,221
Hey, Danni.

236
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,316
You wanna have lunch
with a couple of handsome guys?

237
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,826
Sure. Point 'em out for me.

238
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:25,991
Ha!

239
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:28,933
I know you love a man in a uniform.

240
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,436
She ain't bad.

241
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:37,499
You got trouble out there.

242
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:40,878
He's on the other side right now.

243
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:04,033
Joleen?

244
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,647
What?

245
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:30,120
These are yours.

246
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,429
Did you see Mom?

247
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:34,092
No.

248
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,729
Hey, Tara?

249
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,809
Hey, come on.

250
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,212
She says she's got a plan.

251
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,552
She says she'll be back
for your birthday.

252
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,388
That's... That's, uh,
just a month from now, right?

253
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,516
It won't be so bad, you know?
Come on.

254
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,893
l-l... I'll do whatever you want to do.

255
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:05,902
You... You tell me what to do,
and I'll do it, okay?

256
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,396
We'll have fun.

257
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,630
You know, l-l...

258
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:17,839
I'm gonna need a ride to school...

259
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,882
from now on.

260
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,250
I can get a ride back here,

261
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:25,789
but you're gonna
have to drive me to school.

262
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,786
What about the bus?

263
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,090
The bus doesn't come out here.

264
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:34,598
Anyway, the bus sucks.

265
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,931
I-I guess you could ride my bike
if you want.

266
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,235
I'm not riding your stupid bike.

267
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:45,642
I can barely touch the pedals.

268
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,838
You can drive my mom's car.

269
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,074
I don't... I don't drive, though.

270
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:56,648
And I don't think she would be
too happy about that, either.

271
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:02,022
Then I guess I'll just sit here
in your shitty apartment

272
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:03,722
until my mom comes back!

273
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,196
Where are the gears?

274
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,005
There are no gears, Uncle James.
It's an automatic.

275
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,708
It's way easier driving without gears.

276
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:24,209
You just drive.

277
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:31,094
R is reverse.

278
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:32,490
Let's go.

279
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:41,003
This is it. Here. Here!

280
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,471
Oh. Sorry.

281
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,909
Okay, Tara.

282
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,713
Have a nice... day.

283
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,729
Higher. Higher.

284
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:07,595
Set them there by the jungle gym.

285
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,973
I've never seen you drive before.

286
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,533
Oh, yeah.

287
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,943
You know Tara. She...
She had to get to school, so...

288
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:25,281
What about her mother?
Why didn't she take her?

289
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,289
Oh, she's gonna be gone for a while.

290
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,557
Well, where has she gone?

291
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,459
I don't know.

292
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,599
Don't worry.
I'm... I'm taking care of Tara.

293
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,765
James, look, I think it's great
that you're trying,

294
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,774
but you gotta watch it.

295
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:52,645
You're gonna get yourself
in all sorts of shit here.

296
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,045
I don't know what else to do.

297
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:08,329
You want something else?
I can make something else.

298
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:10,331
There's nothing here anyway.

299
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,503
What do you want to do tonight?

300
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,785
Can we go look for Mom tomorrow?

301
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:40,695
After my work.

302
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:43,257
No. In the morning.

303
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:45,897
Well, we can't do that.

304
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:48,907
I've... I've gotta go to work,
and you've got school, too.

305
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,711
Well, you just asked me
what I wanted to do.

306
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:55,470
Yeah, but l-l...

307
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:57,778
So you didn't mean it?

308
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,251
I want to look for Mom tomorrow.

309
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:09,092
This is James.

310
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,754
James.

311
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:12,856
Yeah. Speedy. Right.

312
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:16,131
Is Mr. Carvel there?

313
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:18,364
Okay. Well, could you tell him,

314
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:22,674
uh, that I can't come into work today
because of my back?

315
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:26,181
Just... What's that? Yeah.

316
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:29,446
I-I know. Okay.

317
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:34,889
Can we go?

318
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:40,195
Uncle James?

319
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:44,262
Yeah.

320
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:53,698
Barbara!

321
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:58,407
<i>What?</i>

322
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:02,487
And what are you two
doing here in the middle of the day?

323
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:06,057
- We're looking for Joleen.
- Joleen?

324
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:08,058
Well, she's not here.

325
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:09,923
Isn't she with Warren?

326
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:13,933
Warren's in jail, Mrs. Bergen,
if you didn't know already.

327
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:17,231
- He was arrested for growing pot.
- No. No. He would've called.

328
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:20,171
Have you seen my mom?
That's all we're asking.

329
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:24,906
Tara, you know I don't ever
speak to your mother.

330
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,228
Warren, you know where they might be?

331
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,424
Do you even know you're in jail?

332
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:52,139
It's your fault she left
in the first place, Warren.

333
00:26:52,204 --> 00:26:54,140
This whole thing is your fault.

334
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:56,177
I'm just wondering how long
this has been going on.

335
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,236
That's what I'd like to know.

336
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,540
Do you know what Mom would call you?

337
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,752
She had a name for you
when it was just me and her talking.

338
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,053
She'd say it, and we'd laugh.

339
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,597
Do you know what it was?

340
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:20,264
I don't believe you.

341
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,839
What was it?

342
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,845
Tara, what did she call me?

343
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:31,849
Tara, get back here, you little shit!

344
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:35,114
What did she call me? Tara!

345
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,656
- Uh-oh.
- Shit.

346
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,439
Hey!

347
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,999
Give me your helmet.

348
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,009
You're done.

349
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:08,481
- Why aren't you in school?
- I overslept.

350
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:11,023
- Come on. I'll drive you right now.
- No, no, no.

351
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:14,082
'Cause I'm too late already.
It's not like I have an excuse.

352
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:17,288
- It's not like I'm sick or anything.
- Tara, you gotta go to school.

353
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,627
Well, why aren't you at work?

354
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:22,793
I got fired.

355
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,430
Was it 'cause you were late today?

356
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:28,664
No, no. It's...

357
00:29:30,274 --> 00:29:32,541
It's not just today.

358
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:38,281
If you want me to go to school,
I'll get ready,

359
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,844
and then you can drive me, okay?

360
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:04,705
Hey. All right if we come in?

361
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:06,270
Yeah.

362
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:18,229
You, uh, mind if we sit down and talk?

363
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:21,094
- Go ahead.
- I need to talk to Joleen, too.

364
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:23,098
This concerns her.

365
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:25,761
Oh, she's not here right now.

366
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,167
Oh.

367
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:29,502
Where might she be?

368
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:31,508
I don't know.

369
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,146
She said she'll be back
in about a month.

370
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:40,049
Everything's fine here, okay?

371
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,745
What day is it today?

372
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,482
Friday.

373
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,789
A school day.

374
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,065
James, why isn't Tara in school today?

375
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,966
We... We overslept.

376
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:08,074
Yeah. l... We...
We've had a lot going on lately.

377
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,310
Yeah, I know.

378
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:14,345
This is important.
This woman's from Social Services.

379
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,823
This is the part of my job I really hate.

380
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,260
Tara needs a proper guardian,
and with Joleen gone,

381
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:23,925
I'm not so sure that it's here with you.

382
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm sorry.

383
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:37,648
He's probably right, if you think about it.

384
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,506
Don't you think?

385
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,016
Tara?

386
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,353
It's... It's not forever, you know?

387
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:52,953
I-I promise.

388
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:55,261
Okay, let's do it.

389
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:01,227
Hey, don't worry about paying rent
or anything for a while.

390
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:04,102
You've been fucked over enough lately.

391
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,439
Go down into the basement.

392
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:13,946
Okay, here it is.
You're welcome to it.

393
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:16,248
Obviously not deluxe accommodations,

394
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:19,984
but you got runnin' water,
you got a place to hang your clothes.

395
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:24,360
That's the mattress here?

396
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:27,227
Oh, yeah. I tried to pump it up for you.

397
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,064
This damn thing...
My arm about fell off.

398
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,194
Jesus Christ.

399
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:34,329
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey, how about this?

400
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:39,608
How about we throw a party tonight
in honor of your moving in here?

401
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:41,806
We do it up huge.

402
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:45,649
- Are you sure Sharon's gonna be...
- Don't worry about Sharon.

403
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:47,948
- I wear the pants in this...
- Randall!

404
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,387
- What, honey?
- Get your ass up here!

405
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:52,287
Okay, sweetie. I'm coming.

406
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:55,055
- Now!
- All right. I gotta go.

407
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,689
- You fuckin' deaf? Randall!
- Yeah, man. Just make yourself comfy.

408
00:33:57,762 --> 00:33:59,390
- Now!
- Okay, baby.

409
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:01,991
Here I come.

410
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:03,559
Oh. Sorry.

411
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:09,602
Is this a fucking joint?

412
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,303
Now, honey...

413
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:14,314
Sweet pea? Honey bunch?

414
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,478
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

415
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:38,505
Whew.

416
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:42,034
Oh, shit!

417
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,707
Speedy Reedy.

418
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,784
Hey.

419
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:52,846
So, what, you're living here now?

420
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:56,692
Yeah, I'm in the basement
just since today.

421
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:59,196
What about Tara?

422
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:04,170
Oh, uh, they said I wasn't
a proper guardian.

423
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,498
Just, you know...

424
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:08,061
- Social Services?
- Yeah.

425
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:09,402
Yeah.

426
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:13,037
Hey, Speedy, get your ass in here!

427
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,741
Go ahead. I'll go sit with Sharon.
Where is she at?

428
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,649
In the kitchen, I think.
She didn't wanna play quarters.

429
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,706
No kidding.

430
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,845
- My God!
- Hey.

431
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,445
Hi, Danni.

432
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,957
Your fanny is uncanny.

433
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,153
Very funny, Randall.

434
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,426
"Your fanny"...

435
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,663
Hey, come on, Speedster.

436
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,297
Sit down, man.

437
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,744
Sit down here under the vacancy sign.

438
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,076
That's it. Okay.

439
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,312
Speedy!

440
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,445
Speedy! Speedy! Speedy!

441
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,615
Speedy! Speedy! Speedy!

442
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:57,989
Speedy! Speedy!

443
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,432
Really?

444
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,738
You think that'll work?

445
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,637
Mmm, I don't know.

446
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:16,476
I'll give it a shot for you.

447
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:20,545
- He's pretty angry.
- Yeah.

448
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:22,608
Yeah, well, fuck him, all right?

449
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:25,451
I'll talk to him on Monday.
I'll lay it on thick.

450
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:30,190
He's Christian or Jewish or something
prone to guilt, but I'll just...

451
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,993
We'll get your job back. Don't worry.

452
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:38,565
Hey, maybe I can just
get another job, you know?

453
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:40,798
Well, yeah, if you can.

454
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:43,536
There's gotta be places, right?

455
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:45,270
Sure.

456
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,041
Joleen would know what to do, you know?

457
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:55,715
We should hold off till she gets back,
ask her what to do.

458
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,156
She'll know.

459
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:02,027
Speedy, you gotta wake up, man.

460
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,725
You've seen the last of her.
Joleen is gone.

461
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:06,562
No, Randall. I told you.

462
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:10,162
She sent a letter,
sent money and everything.

463
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,172
She says she's got a plan.

464
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:14,140
She's gonna be back
for Tara's birthday.

465
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:16,541
Okay, well, I'm on your side.

466
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:19,102
Uh, and, actually, you're lucky

467
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:22,516
because you don't have to
look after that kid anymore, so...

468
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:28,321
I think I'm gonna get going.

469
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,952
Danni, what? The night's a puppy.

470
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:34,521
Yeah, well, my boys aren't gonna wait
for me if I'm slow in the morning, are they?

471
00:37:34,596 --> 00:37:37,363
See, now, that right there
is another reason why you're lucky.

472
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:39,425
Jeez!

473
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,800
Don't go gettin' dramatic on me now.

474
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,897
Randall, shut up
and help me get him to bed.

475
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,463
You okay?

476
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,873
- Yeah.
- Come on.

477
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:49,812
- Oh, God.
- It's harder than I thought.

478
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:52,247
- Come on.
- Thanks, Danni.

479
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:59,413
Okay, watch your head now.

480
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,587
Jesus, Randall,
you're making him sleep down here?

481
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:06,098
Well, where should we have him sleep?
In bed with me and Sharon?

482
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:08,794
Joleen's coming back
on Tara's birthday.

483
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:12,236
Oh, yeah. Sure she is, pal.

484
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,903
- She is.
- Get your head up on that pillow there.

485
00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:19,741
- Why don't you go? I can look after him.
- That's what she said.

486
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,677
Oh. Okay.

487
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,346
- Jeez.
- Here, honey. Roll over.

488
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,196
- How's that feel?
- It's good.

489
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:37,754
Feels good?

490
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,232
Yeah.

491
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,703
You miss that girl, don't you?

492
00:38:58,718 --> 00:39:02,989
She's a good kid. She's a good kid.

493
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,656
I wanted to...
I wanted to... to tell her, you know?

494
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:11,133
But I couldn't.
I didn't know... the words to say it,

495
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,504
so all I could do was,
you know, make it fun,

496
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,511
but... I couldn't even do that.

497
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,240
James, it's not your fault.

498
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:26,680
Danni?

499
00:39:26,748 --> 00:39:28,741
Yes, honey.

500
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,757
Can you go now, please?

501
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:48,132
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.

502
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,631
Okay.

503
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:10,297
Give me a call
when you feel like it, okay?

504
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,400
Please open the door.

505
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,238
Darlene, what did I tell you
about blocking the door?

506
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,921
Tara, you have a visitor.

507
00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:36,651
Happy birthday.

508
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:51,696
Why don't you open your present?

509
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:56,275
The other girls will just take it.

510
00:41:56,343 --> 00:41:58,712
They go through my stuff at night.

511
00:41:59,714 --> 00:42:01,707
I never sleep.

512
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:08,722
A woman at the foster place
is talking to me about adoption.

513
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:18,330
Maybe Joleen is just...

514
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,972
delayed wherever she's at.

515
00:42:23,038 --> 00:42:27,138
The woman said I might get
a family who has a regular house.

516
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,310
She said they might have a kids' room,

517
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,375
might have a dog.

518
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,678
I don't even like dogs.

519
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,717
I don't care.

520
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:45,691
I could just close my door.

521
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:06,754
It's almost 6:00.

522
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:10,759
I should, uh, get you back, you know?

523
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:14,820
I'm not going back there.

524
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:20,766
Can I stay with you?

525
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,732
We can't.

526
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:27,174
It'll just be for tonight.

527
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:55,200
<i>God!</i>

528
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:02,079
- I'll see you guys.
- Not gonna tell us her name?

529
00:44:02,144 --> 00:44:04,445
- Randall!
- Sorry, sweetie.

530
00:44:04,515 --> 00:44:07,112
No, it's not like that.
I'm, uh, just going out.

531
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:09,849
Whatever, Speedy,
but can you just call Danni back?

532
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:12,084
'Cause I'm not
your personal answering service.

533
00:44:12,156 --> 00:44:13,887
Yeah.

534
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,687
Have fun out there.

535
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,496
Say you could go
anywhere in the world right now...

536
00:44:57,505 --> 00:44:59,498
I don't care.

Really?

557
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:32,198
That's not that much.

558
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,263
How far could we go?

559
00:47:35,307 --> 00:47:37,471
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

560
00:47:39,078 --> 00:47:41,072
We could go to Mexico.

561
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:43,345
Isn't that where you go
in this sort of situation?

562
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:45,181
Mexico?

563
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:47,448
Yeah. Like in the movies.

564
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:51,427
I don't think we have enough
to get that far.

565
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:55,030
Well, we need fake names.

566
00:47:55,096 --> 00:47:57,623
You know, so we don't get caught.

567
00:47:57,698 --> 00:48:02,037
I'll be Nicole,
and I want to be 13 years old,

568
00:48:02,103 --> 00:48:04,802
'cause being 12 is stupid.

569
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:08,210
Yeah. Okay.

570
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:11,738
Yeah, yeah. I'll be, uh... I'll be Randall.

571
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:16,415
No. You have to be my dad.
Otherwise, it'll look weird to people.

572
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:20,220
So I'll call you Dad,
and you call me Nicole.

573
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,287
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Nicole.

574
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,534
So where are we going to, Dad?

575
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,301
You ever been to a farm?

576
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,275
A real one?

577
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:41,974
We can go to my dad's farm.
I think we have enough to get there.

578
00:48:44,015 --> 00:48:45,951
The farm where you and Mom grew up?

579
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:47,509
Yeah.

580
00:48:51,456 --> 00:48:55,328
Mom said she'd rather die
than go back there.

581
00:48:57,463 --> 00:49:00,196
There's horses.
You ever seen a horse?

582
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:03,569
At a fair once. Brown one.

583
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:05,868
You could ride it for a dollar.

584
00:49:06,873 --> 00:49:09,036
How long a ride?

585
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:12,310
I don't know.
I lost my dollar at the ring toss.

586
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:15,510
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

587
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:17,074
Okay.

588
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:23,182
Nicole.

589
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:31,358
So there's this guy in a cabin,

590
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:34,427
and he's got a hole in his roof,
and it's raining.

591
00:49:34,502 --> 00:49:37,441
And, uh, a traveler is walking by,

592
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:39,840
and he says, "Hey,
you got a hole up in your roof.

593
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:43,940
Water's gettin' in.
Why don't you patch that up?"

594
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:47,179
He says, "Well, can't do it now
'cause it's raining."

595
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:50,984
He says, "Well, why don't you
patch it up when it's not raining?"

596
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:55,928
And he said, "Well, when it's not raining,
then no water's coming through."

597
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,197
Does it have a punch line?

598
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,028
That's the joke.

599
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,431
It's bad.

600
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:37,437
Let's go!

601
00:50:37,504 --> 00:50:39,440
Hey, don't look.

602
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:50,812
If you tell them in the right order,
they're a lot funnier, you know?

603
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:55,350
Well...

604
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,546
Tara!

605
00:51:33,396 --> 00:51:34,888
Hey!

606
00:51:58,925 --> 00:52:00,827
Tara?

607
00:54:09,897 --> 00:54:11,730
I'm so cold.

608
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,827
<i>Aren't you a little old for that shirt?</i>

609
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:16,373
<i>What kind of shit do you need
from me right now, Mom?</i>

610
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:18,774
<i>I'm not pretending
to do my homework.</i>

611
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,142
<i>I'm pretending not to hate my life.</i>

612
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:23,204
<i>Where are you going, at least?</i>

613
00:55:05,858 --> 00:55:07,554
Shit!

614
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:12,089
You need a hand?

615
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:32,745
<i># I sleep all day #</i>

616
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:34,119
<i># Out all night #</i>

617
00:55:34,189 --> 00:55:36,888

618

<i># I don't think that's actin' right #</i>

619
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:40,920
- Hi.
- What the man said is

620
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:43,559
he'd give me some money
to do some work for him back there.

621
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,295
Oh. Cool.

622
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:48,805
You gonna be all right
hanging out here?

623
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:51,035
Sure.

624
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:54,771
There's three kids over there
you can play with.

625
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:05,814
Mmm.

626
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:07,882
All right. I'm off to work, then.

627
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,986
Bye.

628
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,419
Hey, come on.

629
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:58,964
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

630
01:01:59,037 --> 01:02:02,670
Come on now. Come on.

631
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,074
Come on.

632
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:09,811
Come on.

633
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,585
Make it.

634
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:24,258
Come on. Come on.

635
01:02:25,297 --> 01:02:27,860
Come on.

636
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:33,305
Take her out to pasture.

637
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:35,309
Get rid of this, and then you can go.

638
01:02:41,414 --> 01:02:43,008
Hey, Dad.

639
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:47,354
This is my daughter Nicole.

640
01:02:48,923 --> 01:02:53,297
Well, isn't this a surprise?

641
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,971
State bird in California is the quail.

642
01:03:02,037 --> 01:03:04,440
State bird's a quail.

643
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:08,503
You got the brown bear on the flag.

644
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:11,982
What else do I know about California?

645
01:03:12,048 --> 01:03:15,249
House looks good. Looks the same.

646
01:03:16,753 --> 01:03:18,814
Joleen's got a house.

647
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:21,519
We got a house in the country.

648
01:03:22,726 --> 01:03:24,491
A country house?

649
01:03:24,561 --> 01:03:27,499
- That's right.
- Well!

650
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:35,239
We're more in the city part...
Nicole and me.

651
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,507
And Nicole's mother.

652
01:03:42,313 --> 01:03:44,715
I don't notice a ring on your finger.

653
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:48,314
I-I lost it... a while back.

654
01:03:48,386 --> 01:03:50,049
What about the missus?

655
01:03:51,857 --> 01:03:54,260
Did you lose her, too?

656
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:56,626
No, Dad.

657
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:08,777
So what's the big mystery?

658
01:04:10,577 --> 01:04:12,843
She's in New York.

659
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:15,377
In New York, huh?

660
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,852
It's for her job.

661
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,014
It's in computers.

662
01:04:20,087 --> 01:04:22,854
So we thought we'd take this time,

663
01:04:22,924 --> 01:04:25,828
you know, come out here for a vacation.

664
01:04:25,894 --> 01:04:27,385
Hmm.

665
01:04:27,462 --> 01:04:30,902
Nicole's never been
to a real farm before.

666
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:35,031
So, when her mother gets back,
we'll meet up and, uh,

667
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,268
take it from there.

668
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,667
Joleen's living the good life, huh,

669
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:42,804
in her magnificent country estate?

670
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,408
I-I didn't say estate.

671
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:59,933
She still livin' with that one guy?
What was his name?

672
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,960
You know,
the one that knocked her up.

673
01:05:06,238 --> 01:05:07,729
No.

674
01:05:10,942 --> 01:05:12,935
What about the kid?

675
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:16,609
She end up having it?

676
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:19,711
I never heard...

677
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,159
so you can imagine I'm kind of curious.

678
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:30,487
No.

679
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:35,801
Well, I got the one, though, right, Nicole?

680
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,862
One grandkid's better than none.

681
01:05:42,177 --> 01:05:44,545
Well, you two better hit the sack.

682
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:47,014
Got an early rise tomorrow.

683
01:05:49,784 --> 01:05:51,879
How's she on dishes?

684
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:55,117
Fine, I guess.

685
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,682
Good.

686
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:16,144
Rise and shine.

687
01:06:16,212 --> 01:06:18,479
Rise and shine.

688
01:08:58,987 --> 01:09:00,718
- Hey.
- Hey.

689
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:02,725
This is Jack.

690
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:06,221
Your mom named him that
when he was young.

691
01:09:08,364 --> 01:09:11,393
But you're a big boy now, aren't you? Huh?

692
01:09:13,703 --> 01:09:15,935
Hey, you wanna see something?

693
01:09:22,312 --> 01:09:24,305
He likes apples.

694
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:29,848
Can I try?

695
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,321
Yeah.

696
01:09:36,394 --> 01:09:40,095
- He's letting me do it.
- What are you doing?

697
01:09:40,164 --> 01:09:41,758
Feeding apples.

698
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:45,637
- Did I say for you to do that?
- No, I was just...

699
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:48,836
- I was showing Nicole how to...
- What happens if my horses get colic?

700
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:52,005
You know how to take care of him
if he gets colic?

701
01:09:54,913 --> 01:09:57,350
Then maybe you should ask me

702
01:09:57,417 --> 01:10:00,082
before you start
shoving food in his mouth.

703
01:10:02,356 --> 01:10:04,349
It was my idea.

704
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,430
I figured that.

705
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:40,257
James didn't go to school much, either.

706
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:42,459
- Right, James?
- Right.

707
01:10:42,532 --> 01:10:45,505
Had him working full time

708
01:10:45,569 --> 01:10:48,700
when he was just, uh,
a little bit older than you.

709
01:10:49,939 --> 01:10:54,643
It's not like they lost their star pupil
or anything, is it, James, huh?

710
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:58,014
Idiot.

711
01:11:50,672 --> 01:11:53,838
See ya.

712
01:12:36,888 --> 01:12:38,824
I'm sorry.

713
01:12:46,298 --> 01:12:47,892
Nicole?

714
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:59,673
Guess it was my mom's dress,
wasn't it?

715
01:13:56,907 --> 01:14:00,142
Come on! Come on! Feed the cattle.

716
01:14:22,968 --> 01:14:26,373
Can't you see
that that doesn't work that way?

717
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:29,275
You didn't coil with the lay again!

718
01:14:29,342 --> 01:14:31,005
Well, I tried.

719
01:14:31,077 --> 01:14:33,514
And don't get smart with me,

720
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:36,314
you little shit!

721
01:14:37,318 --> 01:14:41,725
- Have you... Show me yours again.
- Dad, it's getting to be suppertime.

722
01:14:42,723 --> 01:14:45,890
Not until Nicole here learns
how to coil a rope properly

723
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,091
instead of running her dirty trap
all the time!

724
01:14:49,163 --> 01:14:52,898
Come on!
And go with the lay of this.

725
01:14:55,203 --> 01:14:58,699
Give me that. Go into the lay!

726
01:15:29,741 --> 01:15:31,233
Nicole.

727
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:35,247
Nicole, come on! Get up!

728
01:15:35,313 --> 01:15:36,805
What?

729
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:18,187
My hand is completely full of blisters.

730
01:16:27,269 --> 01:16:29,763
Here. Here, let me take a look.

731
01:16:37,046 --> 01:16:39,244
Hyah! Get in there!

732
01:16:39,315 --> 01:16:40,978
Go on! Go on!

733
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:43,248
Why'd you bring us here?

734
01:16:48,959 --> 01:16:50,952
I thought you'd like it.

735
01:16:55,432 --> 01:16:57,960
And we were out of money.

736
01:17:00,672 --> 01:17:04,476
I didn't know where else to go.

737
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:07,106
There's so many other places
we could've gone.

738
01:17:07,178 --> 01:17:09,171
I mean, Mom said she would
never come back here.

739
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,584
- Not in a million years.
- Shh. Don't, Tara. Don't talk like that.

740
01:17:12,652 --> 01:17:15,920
It's... It's fine. Usually, he's...

741
01:17:15,987 --> 01:17:17,923
- The way he talked to us?
- Yeah.

742
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,584
- And the way he treated you?
- Listen...

743
01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:22,290
- It's not fine.
- Hey, don't... don't... don't be loud, okay?

744
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:25,596
You gotta... You gotta be quiet.
Usually, he's fine.

745
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:29,105
It was him and your mom
that always had the problems.

746
01:17:29,168 --> 01:17:32,437
Now, he's... he's a particular
kind of... kind of man,

747
01:17:32,506 --> 01:17:37,005
but if you just keep your mouth shut
and just do the work, then it's fine.

748
01:17:37,077 --> 01:17:40,539
But your mom... she just never did.

749
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:44,419
One day, she met this guy,
and he tried to take her away.

750
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:47,855
Dad found out,
and he took it real hard.

751
01:17:47,923 --> 01:17:50,827
Finally, after a few months,
it got so bad between 'em,

752
01:17:50,893 --> 01:17:52,988
she was on me and on me to go,

753
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:55,965
and so, finally, I just... I said, "Okay,"

754
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:58,161
and we snuck out
in the middle of the night.

755
01:17:59,635 --> 01:18:01,936
- Now we're back.
- But, hey,

756
01:18:02,005 --> 01:18:04,373
don't... don't take it wrong, okay?

757
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:08,609
It's... It's Joleen that he's always
had the problem with.

758
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:10,739
You know?
And we won't be here long anyway.

759
01:18:10,814 --> 01:18:13,411
- You promise?
- Yeah.

760
01:18:13,483 --> 01:18:17,014
Yeah, look, if we do the work now,

761
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:20,789
then maybe he'll even give us
some money for the road.

762
01:18:28,099 --> 01:18:30,126
I wonder what happened to that guy.

763
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:31,533
Who?

764
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:36,736
The man Mom was gonna
run off with, you know?

765
01:18:40,646 --> 01:18:44,051
I don't know. He just...
He never came back.

766
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,816
I wonder what would've happened
if she had gone with him.

767
01:19:02,268 --> 01:19:04,330
Excuse me.

768
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:06,897
Hi, I'm... I'm Joleen Reedy.

769
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:11,312
- My daughter, Tara Reedy, is missing.
- I gotta call you back.

770
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:14,715
If you hear anything, can you just call me
from this number here?

771
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,550
Where the hell have you been?
How nice of you to show up.

772
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,990
I'll take it from here.
So was that your plan, Joleen, hmm?

773
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,288
Just completely abandon Tara
so she could go

774
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:25,419
straight exactly
into what I was afraid of for her...

775
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:26,792
Child Services?

776
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:29,595
I mean, who the hell knows
where she's at now?

777
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:32,660
- Please tell me something!
- I don't know.

778
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:35,332
I don't know what to say, okay?

779
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:36,736
I don't.

780
01:19:36,807 --> 01:19:38,743
I don't. You... You're it, okay?

781
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:41,803
I fucked up... I fucked up, and I can't...

782
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:43,905
I can't take it back.

783
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,747
My number. You can just
call me if you hear anything.

784
01:19:46,817 --> 01:19:51,088
Joleen, you, uh...
you got someplace to stay?

785
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,021
What about a job?

786
01:19:55,092 --> 01:19:57,085
I'm working on it.

787
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:09,536
<i>The Voyager spacecraft</i>

788
01:20:09,608 --> 01:20:13,139
<i>has been exploring
uncharted territory for some time,</i>

789
01:20:13,212 --> 01:20:16,582
<i>but now it's really
going into the great beyond.</i>

790
01:20:16,648 --> 01:20:19,051
<i>Launched in 1977,</i>

791
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:23,219
<i>Voyager has now traveled
more than 13 billion kilometers...</i>

792
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:26,126
<i>well beyond the most distant planet.</i>

793
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:28,459
<i>Voyager is, in fact, right on the edge</i>

794
01:20:28,528 --> 01:20:31,831
<i>of stepping into interstellar space.</i>

795
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:36,432
<i>What it should meet there is something
called the "termination shock."</i>

796
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:39,441
<i>This is a shock wave
where the tenuous messages</i>

797
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:42,946
<i>of the solar wind particles
ejected by our sun</i>

798
01:20:43,011 --> 01:20:47,247
<i>run into the cosmic wind particles
floating through deep space.</i>

799
01:20:47,315 --> 01:20:50,219
<i>In fact, according to some new research,</i>

800
01:20:50,286 --> 01:20:53,725
<i>Voyager may have already
hit this shock wave.</i>

801
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:56,852
<i>This week, two groups
announced their latest results</i>

802
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:58,451
<i>from instruments aboard the space...</i>

803
01:20:58,527 --> 01:21:01,328
Dad, I don't know if I said it,
but it's real nice...

804
01:21:01,397 --> 01:21:03,196
you lettin' us stay here.

805
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:05,965
So thanks.

806
01:21:06,035 --> 01:21:09,008
But, uh, work, you know...

807
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:12,671
It's... It's real... real hard.

808
01:21:13,877 --> 01:21:16,474
You don't have to tell me.

809
01:21:16,547 --> 01:21:18,346
Especially for Nicole.

810
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:21,354
<i>- Welcome back to the show.
- Thank you.</i>

811
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:24,756
And this... this was gonna be a vacation.

812
01:21:25,823 --> 01:21:27,816
That was the original plan.

813
01:21:27,892 --> 01:21:30,329
Yeah, well, hoop-di-doo.

814
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,366
Are you kidding?

815
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:35,368
So I think, uh...

816
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:41,942
we're probably gonna have to move on now.

817
01:21:43,742 --> 01:21:45,678
And I was also thinkin'

818
01:21:45,744 --> 01:21:51,382
maybe you could give us some money
for the work that we did here.

819
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,944
Think that might be fair.

820
01:22:06,467 --> 01:22:09,838
I just want some money, that's all.

821
01:22:09,904 --> 01:22:13,241
Who is Tara?

822
01:22:14,243 --> 01:22:17,340
<i>Well beyond the most distant planet.</i>

823
01:22:19,247 --> 01:22:21,240
Before you came here,

824
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:23,844
I got a little social visit...

825
01:22:23,919 --> 01:22:25,912
these guys from the sheriff's.

826
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:31,722
And they told me a whole story
about a kid named Tara.

827
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:36,933
That's not Tara.

828
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:40,060
That's Nicole, and she's my daughter.

829
01:22:40,137 --> 01:22:41,537
Oh, bullshit!

830
01:22:43,173 --> 01:22:45,541
Imagine the tree you'd be hanging from

831
01:22:45,608 --> 01:22:48,547
if I'd have called that sheriff on this.

832
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:51,139
And where would she be?

833
01:22:57,822 --> 01:23:00,760
So as long as you're doing
all that thinking,

834
01:23:00,825 --> 01:23:03,057
why don't you think about that?

835
01:23:03,128 --> 01:23:07,570
And don't you go telling me
what you think is fair!

836
01:23:11,704 --> 01:23:13,901
You little prick!

837
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:22,005
Hey, what's wrong?

838
01:24:24,048 --> 01:24:25,381
Nothing.

839
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:28,283
We're fine for now, okay?
Let me figure something out.

840
01:24:28,353 --> 01:24:29,821
Get to work!

841
01:24:29,888 --> 01:24:32,017
And you,

842
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:34,219
get up and get to it,

843
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:36,855
or I'll beat your ass into next week!

844
01:24:36,928 --> 01:24:39,525
What is this?

845
01:24:39,599 --> 01:24:41,968
Are you playing games with me?

846
01:24:42,034 --> 01:24:45,974
Lettin' the horses stand in
their own manure till they get thrush!

847
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:50,070
Was that your idea?
Now get your ass in there!

848
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:55,173
I can't...

849
01:24:55,249 --> 01:24:57,378
You don't think I can hear you?

850
01:24:57,451 --> 01:24:58,943
You don't think I can hear you?

851
01:25:01,254 --> 01:25:03,190
Now say something.

852
01:25:03,257 --> 01:25:06,024
Now you clean up that shit!

853
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:11,567
I don't wanna see that ornery face
that you put on while you're doing it!

854
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:13,900
Dad, she wasn't being ornery.
She was just trying to help.

855
01:25:13,968 --> 01:25:15,163
Huh?

856
01:25:15,236 --> 01:25:17,707
You don't know shit about shit!

857
01:25:17,773 --> 01:25:19,868
You stay down, James!

858
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:25,741
Don't you fuckin' look at me, boy!
I'll split your head open like a pumpkin!

859
01:25:25,814 --> 01:25:29,048
Ya hear me?

860
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:31,783
You put your eyes on the floor.

861
01:25:34,658 --> 01:25:36,560
Hmm!

862
01:25:36,626 --> 01:25:38,493
You think I can't break you?

863
01:25:38,562 --> 01:25:40,225
I'll break every last one of ya.

864
01:25:42,265 --> 01:25:45,295
And I'll break you of that city-shit attitude!

865
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:47,601
Your dirty sister and your whore of a mother

866
01:25:47,672 --> 01:25:49,973
tried to teach both of ya!

867
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,977
But it won't happen again.

868
01:25:52,043 --> 01:25:55,174
Now get down there
and clean that shit up!

869
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:01,680
You don't think I can strike you?

870
01:26:01,752 --> 01:26:03,244
- No!
- You little piece of trash!

871
01:26:03,322 --> 01:26:04,882
- Sorry!
- Huh?

872
01:26:04,957 --> 01:26:08,418
I'll spank you like I spank every horse here!

873
01:26:08,495 --> 01:26:11,729
- Don't you fuckin' touch her!
- Aah!

874
01:26:11,798 --> 01:26:13,563
You didn't break me!

875
01:26:14,667 --> 01:26:16,102
You didn't break me!

876
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:18,732
You're never breaking her!

877
01:26:18,805 --> 01:26:20,775
You hear me?

878
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,331
Never!

879
01:26:36,857 --> 01:26:39,556
You piece of shit.

880
01:26:41,962 --> 01:26:44,399
You piece of shit.

881
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,330
You...

882
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:51,309
You ruined everything.

883
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:53,936
You ruin everything!

884
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:06,881
I want to go home.

885
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:30,846
Aw, shit!

886
01:29:30,912 --> 01:29:32,848
Detective Woll speaking.

887
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:35,817
<i>- Detective Woll?
- Yep, that's me.</i>

888
01:29:35,883 --> 01:29:39,288
Hi. It's, uh... It's James... Reedy.

889
01:29:39,353 --> 01:29:42,291
James, uh, where are you?

890
01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:45,995
I'm at my dad's ranch.

891
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:48,824
But, uh...

892
01:29:50,566 --> 01:29:53,129
Yeah, he's... he's dead. l...

893
01:29:53,201 --> 01:29:56,298
<i>l- I killed him.</i>

894
01:30:00,443 --> 01:30:02,436
I didn't know what else to do.

895
01:30:02,512 --> 01:30:04,881
You know, he... he was going
after Tara, so...

896
01:30:04,948 --> 01:30:07,475
Oh, ok-okay. Is... Is Tara all right?

897
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:11,753
Yeah. She... She's fine, but...

898
01:30:11,822 --> 01:30:14,988
Look, I know... I know the cops here.
They're not gonna believe me.

899
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,964
They're gonna take her,
so I didn't... I didn't know what to do.

900
01:30:18,028 --> 01:30:20,089
<i>James, you listen up.</i>

901
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:23,434
<i>For the record, we never had
this conversation, all right?</i>

902
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,768
Now, I can't promise you anything,

903
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,138
but if you'll bring Tara back here
and turn yourself in,

904
01:30:28,206 --> 01:30:31,269
<i>I'll do my best for you.</i>

905
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:33,176
<i>All right?</i>

906
01:30:35,414 --> 01:30:38,147
Okay. What... What about Tara?

907
01:30:38,216 --> 01:30:40,779
<i>I'll get Joleen. Don't worry about it.</i>

908
01:30:43,322 --> 01:30:45,383
<i>James...</i>

909
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,950
Okay.

910
01:30:48,427 --> 01:30:49,919
Yeah.

911
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:07,742
Hey.

912
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:12,177
Hey.

913
01:31:19,261 --> 01:31:21,254
Where are we going?

914
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:25,766
You're goin' home, and to your mom.

915
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,970
My mom? Where is she?

916
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,639
She's in Westmoreland,
waiting at the police station.

917
01:31:37,414 --> 01:31:39,350
What's gonna happen to you?

918
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:44,050
Can't be any worse
than it's been, you know?

919
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:50,491
Before now,

920
01:31:50,561 --> 01:31:53,328
it's like I've been living in a dream.

921
01:31:55,366 --> 01:31:57,165
Bad dreams.

922
01:31:57,235 --> 01:31:59,729
Sleepwalking.

923
01:32:01,306 --> 01:32:03,971
But you helped me.

924
01:32:04,043 --> 01:32:06,536
Woke me up.

925
01:32:06,612 --> 01:32:09,847
- I did?
- Yeah.

926
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:11,408
You did.

927
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:19,127
Do me a favor.

928
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,052
Yeah. Sure.

929
01:32:22,129 --> 01:32:24,065
When you see her,

930
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:28,733
tell her...

931
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:34,601
tell her

932
01:32:34,676 --> 01:32:39,277
"This is the first day of the rest of her life."

933
01:32:39,347 --> 01:32:43,287
Okay? It wasn't before, but now it is.

934
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:45,776
Okay.

935
01:32:49,091 --> 01:32:51,186
Why don't you tell her?

936
01:32:53,996 --> 01:32:57,163
This is one you tell, okay?

937
01:33:00,904 --> 01:33:02,737
All right.

938
01:33:07,711 --> 01:33:09,874
You know, you're not an idiot.

939
01:33:15,419 --> 01:33:18,449
You're not an idiot,
like he would always call you.

940
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,803
Tara. Tara!

941
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:10,139
- Oh, shit!
- James!

942
01:34:10,212 --> 01:34:12,649
Jesus Christ.

943
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:17,054
Oh, God!

944
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,682
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, baby.

945
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:22,521
I'm so sorry!

946
01:34:22,592 --> 01:34:25,530
Oh, baby!

947
01:34:25,595 --> 01:34:28,829
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

948
01:34:28,898 --> 01:34:31,461
Tell me you're okay.
Tell me you're okay!

949
01:34:31,534 --> 01:34:34,199
- I'm okay.
- Yes? Where is James?

950
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:35,637
Where is he?

951
01:34:35,706 --> 01:34:37,368
- Where is he?
- Gone.

952
01:34:37,441 --> 01:34:38,636
Oh, shit!

953
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:41,579
Where is he, baby? Where did he go?

954
01:34:41,645 --> 01:34:44,583
- I don't know.
- Did he say anything?

955
01:34:44,648 --> 01:34:48,053
Yeah. Yeah, he said, um...

956
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:50,613
He said that...

957
01:34:51,856 --> 01:34:55,956
today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

958
01:34:56,061 --> 01:34:59,500
I repeat, all Westmoreland,
put a scan in the area for a blue Buick.

959
01:34:59,564 --> 01:35:03,402
- My life?
- Yeah, that's what he told me. Yeah.

960
01:37:47,078 --> 01:37:50,677
<i># Come on, come out #</i>

961
01:37:50,748 --> 01:37:54,814
