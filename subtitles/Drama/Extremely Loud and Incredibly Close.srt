1
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:31,843
<i>There are more people alive now
than have died in all of human history.</i>

2
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,354
<i>But the number of dead people
is increasing.</i>

3
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:40,393
<i>One day, there isn't going to be
any room to bury anyone any more.</i>

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,361
<i>So, what about skyscrapers
for dead people that were built down?</i>

5
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:51,404
<i>They could be underneath the skyscrapers
for living people that are built up.</i>

6
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,949
<i>You could bury people
100 floors down..</i>

7
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,541
<i>and a whole dead world
could be underneath the living one.</i>

8
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:08,087
father of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us all with the gift of..

9
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,803
Doesn't anybody know
there isn't anybody in the coffin?

10
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,593
We should've filled it with his shoes
or something.

11
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,976
It's like a pretend funeral.

12
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,641
For a goldfish or something.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,525
This is just what it is, Oskar.

14
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,653
It doesn't make sense.

15
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,785
<i>What if you could ride an elevator
down to visit your dead relatives..</i>

16
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,038
<i>just like you take the bridge
to see your friends in Brooklyn..</i>

17
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,416
<i>or the ferry to Staten Island?</i>

18
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,579
<i>Dad once told me that New York
used to have a Sixth Borough..</i>

19
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,089
<i>right next to Manhattan.</i>

20
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,466
<i>But you can't visit that any more..</i>

21
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:51,264
<i>because it floated away
and no one knows where it is.</i>

22
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,259
Okay, you think you're so smart?

23
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,724
Let's find the Sixth Borough.

24
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,849
Okay.

25
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,234
And? What?

26
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,861
"And what" what?

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,441
What am I supposed to find?

28
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,821
What are the clues?

29
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,361
Mm.

30
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,119
<i>He shrugged his shoulders like he had
no idea what I was talking about.</i>

31
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,197
<i>I loved that.</i>

32
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,418
<i>This was my favorite game
Dad and I would play.</i>

33
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,125
<i>We called it
"Reconnaissance Expedition."</i>

34
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,211
I found something from every decade
in the 20th Century.

35
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,137
You rock.

36
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,307
He rocks!

37
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:46,816
<i>The search for the Sixth Borough
was the greatest expedition ever.</i>

38
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,943
All right, I've got
amateur entomologist, Francophile..

39
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,403
amateur archeologist,
computer consultant.

40
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,943
Why "amateur" everything?

41
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,531
It's a compliment.

42
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,321
Amateur pacifist?

43
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,582
"Pacifist."
- Amateur inventor.

44
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,493
Inventor. Good one.

45
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,876
Okay, you're all set.

46
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,342
<i>Dad designed my expeditions
so I would have to talk to people..</i>

47
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,012
<i>which he knew
I had a hard time doing.</i>

48
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,061
What do you want?

49
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,037
What do you think?

50
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,789
Could be useful.

51
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,793
Can't you even tell me
if I'm on the right track?

52
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,875
But if you don't tell me,
how can I ever be right'?

53
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,504
Well, another way of looking at it is..

54
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,218
how can you ever be wrong?

55
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,637
Mm?

56
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,904
There you go. Thank you very much.

57
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,169
<i>Central Park didn't used to be
where it is now.</i>

58
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,627
<i>Dad said it used to rest
in the center of the Sixth Borough.</i>

59
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,589
Enormous hooks were driven
deep into the ground..

60
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,005
and the park was pulled by
all the people of New York..

61
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,642
like a rug across the floor,
from the Sixth Borough into Manhattan.

62
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,654
I found something. Over!

63
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,861
What area, Oskar? Over!

64
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,069
Zone E-3. Over!

65
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,209
<i>Dad said it's only because
of the clues in Central Park..</i>

66
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,371
<i>that we know
the Sixth Borough existed at all.</i>

67
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,429
Where's this from?

68
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,513
Oh, that was my father's.
Grandma gave it to me when I was little.

69
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,143
Never had much use for it.

70
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,814
What's this?

71
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,395
Oh. Grandma's old home movies.

72
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,938
Haven't seen these in years.

73
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,163
Do you know what your father
looked like?

74
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,579
Nope, not a clue.

75
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,630
Here's what I do know:

76
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,632
He was from Dresden,
which was in Germany..

77
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,052
went through some really bad stuff..

78
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,429
and decided he wasn't up
to having a family.

79
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,179
- That's it?
- That's it.

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,558
Did you always want to be a jeweler?

81
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,446
I might have liked
to have been a scientist.

82
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,730
I'll never know.

83
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,194
Why is that?

84
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,485
Because I'm a jeweler.

85
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,201
Strawberry Fields.

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,044
Belvedere Castle.

87
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,546
What's he looking for?

88
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,798
Well, when he finds it, let him tell you.

89
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,504
Gonna send him all over the park..

90
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,216
and he'll have to talk to
every single person he meets.

91
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,472
It'll be the greatest
Reconnaissance Expedition.

92
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,882
Don't make it so hard on him.

93
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,766
If it was easy,
this wouldn't be worth finding.

94
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,348
And what kind of adult
is he gonna turn into?

95
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,388
I don't know.
That's what I have you for.

96
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,899
He'll be one of those guys who falls
in love with the very first bossy..

97
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,526
- Watch it.
- I mean, beautiful..

98
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,234
flaxen-haired lady
who tells him what to do.

99
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,069
- Like write the check?
- Oh..

100
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,575
- How much?
- It's the last one. It's 71.40.

101
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,737
- $71.40.
- Where are you going?

102
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,415
Bedtime!

103
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,702
Was there really a Sixth Borough?

104
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,673
Well, as with anything, if you want
to believe, you can find reasons to.

105
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,957
What reasons?

106
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,255
The clues, of course.

107
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,465
What clues?

108
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,425
What clues? The clues!

109
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,012
The peculiar fossil record
of Central Park.

110
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:33,347
The incongruous pH balance
of that reservoir.

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,517
And that brings us to the swings.

112
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,604
According to the paper of record, ahem..

113
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,696
a note was found beneath
one of those swings in Central Park.

114
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,112
And because of many scientific tests..

115
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,498
which you are too young
and I am too simple to understand..

116
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,251
they were able to determine
that the note must have been written..

117
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,204
in the Sixth Borough.

118
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,664
What did it say?

119
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,376
What a fantastic question.

120
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,964
Let's find out.

121
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,468
Ah.. It doesn't say.
It ought to, but it doesn't.

122
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,386
- Can I see that?
- You want to see what?

123
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,975
Wanna see this? No?

124
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,732
<i>That was the last conversation
we ever had.</i>

125
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,644
- Give it!
- It's behind you, behind you! Hold on.

126
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,210
<i>The next time I heard
my dad's voice..</i>

127
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,922
<i>was when I got home from school
that morning on the worst day.</i>

128
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,005
Spaz!

129
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,808
<i>Because of what was going on,
they let us out of school early.</i>

130
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,685
<i>Again, that's the incident,
that's what we are hearing.</i>

131
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,190
This is terrible.

132
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,195
You're not supposed to smoke in the lobby.
You'll get in trouble.

133
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,694
There's no such thing as trouble today.
Where are your parents?

134
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,200
Is anybody downtown?

135
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,704
My mom's at work.
My dad's at a meeting somewhere.

136
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,115
Anyway, it's none of your business,
dip shiitake.

137
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,033
Eff you, Oskar.

138
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,703
Succotash my ball sack.

139
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,421
Oh, God.

140
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,737
<i>Message one,

142
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,413
<i>If you're there, darling, pick up.</i>

143
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,876
<i>Ugh. I just tried the office,
but no one was picking up.</i>

144
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,254
<i>Uh, listen, uh, something's happened.
I'm okay.</i>

145
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,088
<i>They're telling us to stay where we are
and wait for the firemen.</i>

146
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,510
<i>I'm sure it's fine. I'll give you another call
when I have a better idea of what's going on.</i>

147
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,850
<i>I wanted to let you know that I'm okay
and not to worry..</i>

148
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,727
<i>and I'll call again soon.
All right, bye-bye.</i>

149
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,269
<i>Message

It's me again.</i>

<i>It's pretty chaotic. Firemen
are supposed to be coming. What..</i>

156
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,800
<i>If the sun were to explode..</i>

157
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,140
<i>you wouldn't even know
about it for eight minutes..</i>

158
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,475
<i>because that's how long it takes
for light to travel to us.</i>

159
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,687
<i>For eight minutes,
the world would still be bright..</i>

160
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,026
<i>and it would still feel warm.</i>

161
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,571
<i>It was a year since my dad died..</i>

162
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,247
<i>and I could feel
my eight minutes with him..</i>

163
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,836
<i>were running out.</i>

164
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,332
<i>Democrats argued
that Estrada is too conservative..</i>

165
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,585
<i>and not answering all
of their questions.</i>

166
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,373
<i>Estrada was first nominated
for the position in May, 2001.</i>

167
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,885
<i>The Bush administration has asked
for a 4.2 percent increase
in military spending..</i>

168
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:19,223
<i>- -from 365 billion dollars
to 380 billion dollars.</i>

169
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,259
<i>That figure does not include..</i>

170
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,744
<i>I hadn't gone into
my dad's closet since the worst day.</i>

171
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,085
<i>Mom hadn't touched his stuff.</i>

172
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,876
<i>It was all there.</i>

173
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,264
Oskar! You okay?

174
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,401
This is Oskar Schell.

175
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,610
Grandma? Grandma, are you awake?

176
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,901
Over.

177
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,826
Grandma?

178
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,290
<i>It's Grandma. Uh, what is it, sweetheart?
Can't you sleep?</i>

179
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,339
<i>Do you want me to come over? Over.</i>

180
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,672
Did Dad ever mention a special key
to you, Grandma? Over.

181
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,302
<i>A special key?</i>

182
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,598
<i>I don't think so, no.
A special key? What for?</i>

183
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,097
<i>What was this special key for?</i>

184
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,306
<i>Over.</i>

185
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,602
Ls the Renter home? Over.

186
00:16:55,765 --> 00:17:00,145
<i>The Renter? No, no,
he's never home this early. Over.</i>

187
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,734
<i>Grandma
had rented a room to a man..</i>

188
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,774
<i>three weeks after the worst day.</i>

189
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,912
Why is the Renter's door always
closed? And why can I never meet him?

190
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,196
He likes quiet.

191
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,616
Why can't you tell me
anything about him?

192
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,913
He's someone I knew in the old country.
Now play.

193
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,251
How long will he be here?

194
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,967
He never stays any place for long.

195
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,927
Is he dangerous?

196
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:38,475
If you ever see him, don't say anything.

197
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,646
He can get very angry. Now play.

198
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,911
<i>What have you found, Oskar? Over.</i>

199
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,495
<i>Oskar, are you still there?</i>

200
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,292
<i>Oskar?</i>

201
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,965
It's for some kind of lockbox.

202
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:07,254
It's not like any of these.
It's thicker, harder to break.

203
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,511
But it's not for a fixed
safe, I don't think.

204
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,810
Could be a safe deposit box,
post office box.

205
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,810
It's old. Maybe 20, 30 years old.

206
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,940
How can I find the company
that made it?

207
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,316
Anyone could've made it.

208
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,603
Then how do I find the lock that it fits?

209
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,774
I'm afraid I can't help you there, unless you
wanna try it in anything you come across.

210
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,820
You never know what a key's gonna fit. There
are a million different possibilities.

211
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,499
That's what I love about keys.
They all open something.

212
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,626
Just one.

213
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,832
Shouldn't you be in school?

214
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,627
It's Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

215
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,629
<i>Lie number two.</i>

216
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,676
<i>I started counting my lies earlier that
morning when I told Mom I had a fever.</i>

217
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,349
I don't wanna potentially infect
a multitude of people at school.

218
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,805
I could be a walking pathogen.

219
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,186
I thought Martin Luther King's birthday
was in January.

220
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,355
It used to be. They changed it.

221
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,734
<i>That was lie number three.</i>

222
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,986
Hold on, Oskar.

223
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,067
Who's "Black"?
On the envelope?

224
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,369
Anybody you know?

225
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,580
Could be somebody who knows
something about the key.

226
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,909
Thanks for being
such a great locksmith.

227
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,922
What do you need these for?

228
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,508
A project on the census.

229
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,010
<i>Lie number four.</i>

230
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,507
Why aren't you in school?

231
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,511
- They said I know too much already.
- Ah.

232
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,018
Black, Black, Black.

233
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,058
<i>Well, "Black" was definitely a person.
Probably.</i>

234
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,437
<i>If "Black" was a person, he or she
must have known Dad somehow.</i>

235
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,105
Four-hundred-seventy-two.

236
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:53,777
<i>But how?
And how was I going to find him/her?</i>

237
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,113
<i>Was this a Reconnaissance
Expedition?</i>

238
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,948
Lagos, Nigeria. And it drifted..

239
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,126
<i>Dad's expeditions
always included a journey.</i>

240
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,624
2278.3 nautical miles.

241
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,126
Brazil!

242
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,130
<i>And he always planned them,
down to the smallest details.</i>

243
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,549
Five miles an hour.

244
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,131
Seven hundred.

245
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,972
<i>What else could it be?</i>

246
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,350
<i>If there was a key,
there was a lock.</i>

247
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,767
<i>If there was a name,
there was a person.</i>

248
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,236
I'm home.

249
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,623
<i>There had to be a lock.</i>

250
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,997
<i>I would find it because
he wanted me to find it.</i>

251
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,792
Q-56. Q-56. Q-56.

252
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:56,173
<i>And I would find it because it was the only
way I could stretch my 8 minutes with him.</i>

253
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,139
<i>Maybe I could stretch them forever.</i>

254
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:20,698
<i>I put together a backpack of vital
things I would need for my survival.</i>

255
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,626
<i>An Israeli gas mask Grandma bought me
two weeks after the worst day.</i>

256
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,834
<i>My tambourine to help keep me calm.</i>

257
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,712
<i>Binoculars, obviously.</i>

258
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,721
<i>I had to travel light
to be as quick as possible.</i>

259
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,851
<i>My expedition journal.</i>

260
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,062
<i>My father's father's camera.</i>

261
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:53,480
<i>A Brief History Of Time, by Stephen
Hawking, that my dad used to read to me.</i>

262
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,698
<i>Cell phone.</i>

263
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,534
<i>Fig Newtons, which I love.</i>

264
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,702
<i>The key, obviously.</i>

265
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,914
<i>And my father's message
to not stop looking.</i>

266
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,082
<i>And I wouldn't, not ever.</i>

267
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,598
Hey.

268
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,943
Where you going?

269
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,903
Out.

270
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,234
Where?

271
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,576
I told you, to the comic book convention
with Minch. Be back later.

272
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,864
<i>Lie number five.
Except for the "be back later" part.</i>

273
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,830
Well, leave your cell phone on.
Check in with me every hour, okay?

274
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,453
I mean it.

275
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,092
<i>I didn't know what
was waiting for me.</i>

276
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,630
<i>Although my stomach hurt
and my eyes were watering..</i>

277
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,597
<i>I made up my mind that nothing,
nothing was going to stop me.</i>

278
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,386
<i>Not even me.</i>

279
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,984
<i>First up, Abby Black,
Fort Greene, Brooklyn.</i>

280
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,613
<i>Because public transportation
makes me panicky, I walked.</i>

281
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,121
<i>I've always had a hard time
doing certain things.</i>

282
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,492
The elevator works, genius.

283
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,160
I know, retard.

284
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,171
<i>But the worst day
made the list of things a lot longer.</i>

285
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,130
<i>- Old people..</i>
- Ah!

286
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,510
<i>Running people..</i>

287
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,050
<i>airplanes..</i>

288
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,431
<i>tall things..</i>

289
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,972
<i>things you can get stuck in.</i>

290
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,682
<i>Loud things.</i>

291
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,347
<i>- Screaming, crying.</i>
- Aah!

292
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,852
<i>- People with bad teeth..</i>
- Ha-ha-ha!

293
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,519
<i>Bags without owners, shoes without
owners, children without parents..</i>

294
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,655
<i>ringing things, smoking things,
people eating meat..</i>

295
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,985
<i>people looking up.</i>

296
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,525
<i>Towers, tunnels, speeding things..</i>

297
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,869
<i>loud things, things with lights,
things with wings.</i>

298
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,332
<i>Bridges make me especially panicky.</i>

299
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,647
- Come on, try.
<i>- I</i> can't try.

300
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,317
<i>If you don't try, you'll never know.</i>

301
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,691
- So try.
- Don't be disappointed with me!

302
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,827
Come on. Take your juice.

303
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,324
You know, Grandma brought me
to these swings.

304
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,036
My favorite..

305
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,129
was one, two..

306
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,248
the third from the right..

307
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,506
because I thought it would go higher
than any other one.

308
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,805
So when everyone had gone home..

309
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,928
I'd swing.

310
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,644
It was just me and the swings.

311
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,393
I'd do a lot of thinking up here,
especially when I learned how to pump.

312
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,860
I would go as high as I could go..

313
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,283
until I couldn't go any higher..

314
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,278
and then I would jump.

315
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,037
Ah! And for a moment,
I would feel as free as a bird.

316
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,919
You should give it a whirl, Oskar.

317
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,456
It might change the way
you look at things.

318
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,623
It's not safe.

319
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,797
You don't have to jump.

320
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,097
Can we go home now?

321
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,325
<i>Fort Greene.</i>

322
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,420
<i>Fort Greene.</i>

323
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,673
Fort Greene!

324
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:33,889
Fort Greene! Fort Greene!

325
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,859
- What are you doing?
- Hello. My name is Oskar Schell.

326
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,773
Did you know my father,
Thomas Schell?

327
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,195
- You are Abby Black?
- Uh, yeah.

328
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,073
I'm sure people
tell you this constantly..

329
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,618
but if you look under "incredibly
beautiful" in the dictionary..

330
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,457
there's a picture of you.

331
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,747
Abby, I'm trying to say something here.

332
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,507
- What are you doing?
- Would it be okay if I came in?

333
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,095
- Now is really not a good time.
- Why not'?

334
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,596
I'm in the middle of something.

335
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,848
I'm going upstairs to get this done.

336
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,101
- Me too.
- And you can do whatever..

337
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,431
What kind of something?

338
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,061
- Is that any of your business?
- Is that a rhetorical question?

339
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,810
<i>I had to get in there.</i>

340
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,362
I'm extremely thirsty!

341
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,068
<i>Lie number seven.</i>

342
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,780
What do you want to drink?

343
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,161
Iced coffee with half-and-half, please.

344
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,745
You coming?

345
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,378
I love this.

346
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,305
- So did I.
- How much do you know about elephants?

347
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,807
Hardly anything.

348
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,512
I know quite a lot.

349
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,677
Loxodonta Africana.

350
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,768
There's this woman who spent
the past 10 years in the Congo..

351
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,480
making recordings of elephant calls
to learn how they communicate.

352
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,485
Abby! Where is everything?

353
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,238
This past year, she started to play them
back to the elephants.

354
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,117
What's fascinating
is that she played back..

355
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,778
the call of a dead elephant to family
members, and they remembered.

356
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,497
They approached the Jeep,
the speaker.

357
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,580
I wonder what they were feeling
when they heard those calls.

358
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,834
I don't know.

359
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,624
I'm walking out of here. I will
call you back in 15 minutes, all right?

360
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,962
Did they cry?

361
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,170
Only humans can cry tears,
did you know that?

362
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,139
Even the elephant
in the picture is crying.

363
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,473
It looks like it, but it was probably
manipulated in Photoshop.

364
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,483
Don't cry.

365
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,867
Hey, Bob, how are you?
I'm great, I'm great.

366
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,198
How's the family? Awesome.

367
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,363
We're awesome, we're doing great.

368
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,034
So listen. Meet me at the office
at 3:00, okay?

369
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,380
- Who's that?
- My husband.

370
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,254
You must think this is very odd.

371
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,677
Oh, I think a lot of things are odd.

372
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,884
People tell me I'm very odd all the time.

373
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,050
I got tested once to see
if I had Asperger's disease.

374
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,388
Dad said it's for people who are smarter
than everybody else but can't run straight.

375
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,894
Tests weren't definitive.

376
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,019
Are you sure you didn't know him?
Thomas Schell?

377
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,861
He was in the building.

378
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,701
In 9/11.

379
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,416
I'm trying to find a lock for this key
that was in the envelope..

380
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,201
that once belonged to my father.

381
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,709
I'm sorry, I don't know anything
about the key or your father.

382
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,170
Can I borrow that?

383
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,927
You're welcome to it.

384
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,804
I thought you really liked it.

385
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,437
Lots of things will be different
around here.

386
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,229
Can I kiss you?

387
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:01,403
You're a sweet boy, but I don't think
that would be a good idea.

388
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,040
Can I take your picture
so I can remember you?

389
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,435
How was the comic convention?

390
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,988
Were you there the whole day?

391
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,988
Can you unlock the door, please?

392
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,999
Oskar, can you open the door, please?

393
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,789
Oskar?

394
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,340
Do you hear me, Oskar?
Let me in, please.

395
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,707
Oskar, please, let me in.

396
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,226
Why do you wanna come in?

397
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,391
To tell you that I love you.

398
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,071
<i>Look, I
was hoping you would be home.</i>

399
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,406
<i>I don't know if you
heard about what happened..</i>

400
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,367
<i>but I wanted you to know
I'm okay.</i>

401
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,250
<i>Everything is fine. We're still waiting
to find out what we're supposed to do.</i>

402
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,787
<i>It's pretty chaotic. Firemen are
supposed to be coming. What..</i>

403
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:23,969
<i>Message three,
September 11 th, 9:58 a.m.</i>

404
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,691
<i>Having survived
what is an extraordinary event..</i>

405
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,983
<i>the collapse of two towers.</i>

406
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,787
<i>As we said earlier in our report,
110 stories each.</i>

407
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,493
<i>I will tell you that what fell..</i>

408
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,789
Oskar?

409
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,960
Oskar!

410
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,962
Oskar?

411
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,842
Are you all right?

412
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,719
Yeah.

413
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,608
They let you out of school early.

414
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,062
Yeah.

415
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,314
Do you know what happened?

416
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,946
Yeah.

417
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,659
Your mother will be home soon.

418
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:41,163
You want to just wait here
until she comes?

419
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,666
I guess so.

420
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,176
Do you want me to wait here with you?

421
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,554
It's okay.

422
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,559
You're sure?

423
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,687
Positive.

424
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,935
You're sure?

425
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,595
Oskar. Oskar!

426
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,931
Oskar. Oskar!

427
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,498
Did your fa.. Did your father call'?

428
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,216
Are there any messages
on the machine?

429
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,428
Thank you.

430

Mom, I don't know,
I've already told you everything I know.

440
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,019
Hospitals, the police,
and any number I can find.

441
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,356
I only missed one of the calls.

442
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,650
No, I don't want you to come over.

443
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,362
I don't want to make any of this any
bigger for Oskar than it already is.

444
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,195
Uh, I'll call you if I need you, okay?

<i>Recording</i>.

446
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:27,916
Hi, you've reached the Schell residence.
Today is Tuesday, September 11th.

447
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,331
Here's today's fact of the day:

448
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,584
It is so cold in Yakutia,
that breath instantly freezes..

449
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,626
with a crackling sound they call
"the whispering of the stars."

450
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,839
<i>Hi, you've reached
the Schell resid..</i>

451
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,812
<i>Now no one will
ever have to listen to them like I did.</i>

452
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,364
<i>Just like nothing ever happened.</i>

453
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:19,460
<i>Every time I left our apartment,
I became a little lighter..</i>

454
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,254
<i>because I was getting
closer to Dad.</i>

455
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:29,015
<i>But I also got a little heavier,
because I was further from Mom.</i>

456
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,237
Why are you looking at me like that?

457
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,533
- Like how?
- Like I did something wrong.

458
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,495
- Do you have your cell phone?
- Right here.

459
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,708
I love you.

460
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,692
<i>Maybe she was waiting
there until I left.</i>

461
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,574
<i>Or maybe she'd already walked away.</i>

462
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,616
<i>Maybe she was just talking too quietly
for me to hear.</i>

463
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,929
<i>Hazelle Black
lived in Hamilton Heights.</i>

464
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,304
Gonna worry <i>about.</i>

465
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,465
Come on, come on.

466
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:35,762
<i>If you know the Lord is keepin' you
Why don't you sing and shout?</i>

467
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,145
Hey!

468
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:44,154
Dear God, I just ask that
you would watch over little Oskar..

469
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,111
and I pray, oh, God,
for a miracle for him.

470
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:52,996
And that you keep him safe and in
your loving arms as he goes on his way.

471
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,952
Amen.

472
00:42:56,324 --> 00:43:00,420
Remember, every day is a miracle.

473
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,671
I don't believe in miracles.

474
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,458
Finding what this key fits..

475
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,340
would be a miracle.

476
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:18,142
<i>I started with
a key with no lock.</i>

477
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,682
<i>And I designed a system
I thought fit the problem.</i>

478
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,483
<i>I broke everything down
into the smallest parts..</i>

479
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:32,202
<i>and tried to think of each person
as a number in a gigantic equation.</i>

480
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,869
It could be for a safe deposit box
or a lockbox.

481
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,829
It's old. Can I try it to see
if it fits something?

482
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,792
<i>But it wasn't working.</i>

483
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:52,214
<i>Because people aren't like numbers.
They're more like letters.</i>

484
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,804
<i>And those letters
want to become stories.</i>

485
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,638
<i>And Dad said that stories
need to be shared.</i>

486
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,822
That's it, leg, leg, leg, leg!

487
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,820
<i>I had anticipated a six-minute visit
with each person named Black..</i>

488
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,410
<i>but they were never
just six minutes.</i>

489
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,379
<i>Everyone took more time
than I had planned for..</i>

490
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,430
<i>to try and comfort me
and make me feel better about my dad.</i>

491
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,592
<i>And to tell me their stories.</i>

492
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:51,448
<i>But I didn't want to feel better
and I didn't want friends.</i>

493
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,276
Tae Kwon Do, museum,
comic book convention.

494
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,286
<i>I just wanted the lock.</i>

495
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,955
Point two five divided by 65..

496
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,788
156 days divided by 52
equals three years.

497
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,874
<i>I wasn't getting any
closer to my dad.</i>

498
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,624
<i>I was losing him.</i>

499
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,960
<i>What are you, some kind of asshole?</i>

500
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,758
Dickass!

501
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:19,134
Shiitake! All of you
in this stupid fukozowa building!

502
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,440
<i>It must be a very confusing day.</i>

503
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,650
<i>I'll call you right back.</i>

504
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,154
<i>Message four, Septem..</i>

505
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,460
Oskar, what's wrong?

506
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,049
Do you promise not to bury me
when I die?

507
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,385
It's the middle of the night, Oskar.

508
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,549
Do you promise not to bury me
when I die?

509
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,353
You are not going to die.

510
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,521
You are going to live a long, long life.

511
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,561
You sure you love me?

512
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,023
Completely sure.

513
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,197
Then put me in one of those
mausoleum thingies above the ground.

514
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,039
Oh.

515
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,534
Okay, we need to talk.

516
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,503
About my mausoleum?

517
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,627
No.

518
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,676
About what's been going on.

519
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,176
Why do you find it so hard
to talk to me?

520
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,396
In case you haven't noticed,
half the time, you're asleep.

521
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,058
And the other half the time,
you forget the first half.

522
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,899
You're what they call in the law
"in abstentia". An absent parent.

523
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,234
- That was mean.
- Which part?

524
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:57,857
All of it.

525
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,243
Dad used to say,
"The truth will set you free."

526
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,746
Well, Dad's not here.

527
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,783
- It's just the two of us.
- More like one and a quarter of us..

528
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,249
- ..to be mathematically accurate.
- Don't walk out of this room, Oskar!

529
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,255
- What if I die tomorrow?
- You're not going to die tomorrow.

530
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,587
Dad didn't think he was
gonna die tomorrow either.

531
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,050
- It's not gonna happen to you.
- How do you know what's going to happen?

532
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,213
You know nothing.
You buried an empty box!

533
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,758
That's not the point!
His memory is there!

534
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,929
It's exactly the point. Dad was just cells.
Now they're on rooftops, and the rivers..

535
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,187
Oskar!

536
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,442
And the lungs of millions of people
who breathe him every time they breathe!

537
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,194
- That's not how it works!
- How do you know how it works?

538
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,606
You don't know anything
about atoms or molecules.

539
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,150
He might even be part of the
dog shit in Central Park!

540
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,784
That is enough. Stop it.

541
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,285
Excuse me, dog feces.

542
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,162
- Stop it!
- But it's the truth!

543
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,291
Why can't I say the truth? Just because Dad
died doesn't mean you can be illogical.

544
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,749
- It has to make sense!
- Not everything makes sense, Oskar!

545
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,629
There's not an answer for everything!

546
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,837
You're just stupid!
It's completely nonsensical!

547
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,510
It's just a box! An empty box!

548
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,672
I know it's an empty box! I know this.

549
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,968
But I did it for me, and I did it for you
so we could at least try..

550
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,977
and say goodbye to him..

551
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:13,649
because he's gone, Oskar,
he's gone and he's not coming back.

552
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:14,980
Never.

553
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,146
I don't know why a man flew a plane
into a building.

554
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,986
I don't know why my husband is dead.

555
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,322
But no matter how you try, Oskar,
it's never gonna make sense..

556
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:28,456
because it doesn't,
it doesn't make sense!

557
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,664
Fukozowa you!
You don't know anything!

558
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,399
Why did you lie to me?

559
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,860
What are you talking about?

560
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,736
Where were you?

561
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,030
Where was I when?

562
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,529
That day, the worst day.

563
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,868
You know I was at work.

564
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,251
There was no one here.

565
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,287
I wish I had been.

566
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,215
But it wasn't possible.

567
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,589
You should've made it possible!

568
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,301
I can't make the impossible possible.

569
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,634
I wish it were you.

570
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,599
I wish it were you in the building
instead of him.

571
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,401
So do I.

572
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,257
I didn't really mean that.

573
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,767
Yes, you did.

574
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,782
Go back to bed.

575
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,313
- Hey.
<i>- Linda?</i>

576
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,271
Yeah, I've been trying to reach you.
I'm on my way home. I'm coming home.

577
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,776
Thomas, can you hear me?

578
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,812
<i>Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

579
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,156
Ugh, this is unbelievable.
Are you watching this?

580
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,784
<i>Listen to me, other people want to use the
phone, so I don't have too much time.</i>

581
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,287
Listen to me, I'm gonna be home
in about 20 minutes.

582
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,868
<i>No, you listen to me.
I'm in the World Trade Center.</i>

583
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,331
What do you.. What do you mean,
you're in the World Trade Center?

584
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,587
<i>I had a meeting.
But I'm gonna be okay.</i>

585
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,124
<i>They're telling us to stay where we are.
We broke a window to let in some air.</i>

586
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,338
Where are you?

587
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,844
<i>I'm on the 106th ﬂoor.
There's about 50 of us up here.</i>

588
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,140
You.. You listen to me,
you come home right now.

589
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,644
<i>It's gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

590
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,596
- No..
- <i>Where is Oskar?</i>

591
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,892
Oskar's on his way home, but you listen
to me, you come home right now.

592
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:47,564
<i>I will.
I will call and I will tell him.</i>

593
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,448
Tell him what?

594
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:53,362
<i>I'll.. I'll tell him,
ahem, what's happening.</i>

595
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,747
<i>I'll tell him what's happening.
We've been told to wait where we are.</i>

596
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:01,661
<i>The firemen are on their way. And we're all fine.
We've been told to wait.</i>

597
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,953
Thomas?

598
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,464
<i>- That's what we're gonna do.
- Thomas..</i>

599
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,670
<i>Okay?</i>

600
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,755
No, it's not okay. Listen to me.

601
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,214
- Yeah.
- Thomas.

602
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,880
You need to listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.

603
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,300
You need to find a stairwell.
Do you hear me?

604
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,891
- Yes.
- Find the stairs and you come home.

605
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,191
<i>Linda, honey, I've gotta go.
Other people need to use the phone.</i>

606
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,603
<i>I'm gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

607
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,863
Stop saying that. Just find the stairs.

608
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:32,025
<i>Linda, listen to me.
You do everything to make my life better.</i>

609
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,865
<i>I want you to know that
I absolutely love you.</i>

610
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,030
<i>I absolutely love you.</i>

611
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,794
Don't stop talking to me.
Just stay talking to me.

612
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,579
<i>I'm gonna try to call you again
in a few min..</i>

613
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,293
Please, just stay talking to me..

614
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:55,013
<i>This is unconfirmed,
but we are getting information..</i>

615
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,674
<i>from an employee
of United Airlines.</i>

616
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,811
<i>Again, we want to emphasize this is
unconfirmed, but there is speculation.</i>

617
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,132
Grandma, are you awake?

618
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,259
Over.

619
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,067
Grandma, please wake up. Over.

620
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,653
Please.

621
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,442
Over.

622
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,417
Grandma?

623
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,112
I know someone is in there.

624
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:22,153
I won't hurt you. I'm only 4 years old.

625
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,663
<i>Lie number 64.</i>

626
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,008
Who are you?

627
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:51,015
I'm Oskar Schell, Grandma's grandson.
Do you know where my grandma is?

628
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,187
Out? This time of night?

629
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,527
Do you know where?
It's kind of a matter of life and death.

630
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,454
Are you a stranger?

631
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,414
Technically?

632
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,630
I wouldn't go into a stranger's bedroom.

633
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,903
How come you don't speak?

634
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,782
Are your vocal cords
damaged or something?

635
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,780
Or did something scare you to death?

636
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,372
Cool.

637
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,004
When was the last time you spoke?

638
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,507
Do you ever try to talk?

639
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,469
Why don't you try to say
something to me?

640
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,304
Go on.

641
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:11,138
"“My name is the Renter."

642
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,806
Do you have a criminal record?

643
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,733
Mm. Maybe you hurt people for a living?

644
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,691
Well, what's your story then?

645
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:43,594
<i>I had to tell someone.
I couldn't keep it a secret any more.</i>

646
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,550
Can I tell you my story?

647
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,303
My father died at 9/11.

648
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,273
After he died, I wouldn't go
into his room for a year..

649
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,355
because it was too hard
and it always made me wanna cry.

650
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:03,489
<i>But one day, I had completely heavy
boots and I went into his room anyway.</i>

651
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,992
I miss doing Tae Kwon Do with him
because it made me laugh.

652
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,325
<i>When I went into his closet
where his clothes and stuff were..</i>

653
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,240
I reached up to get his old camera
with the brown case..

654
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,125
<i>and I broke a blue vase.</i>

655
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,578
<i>Inside was an envelope
with "Black" written on it.</i>

656
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,246
And I knew that Dad had left something..

657
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,007
somewhere for me
that the key opened and I had to find.

658
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,634
<i>So I take it to Walt the locksmith..
..I get from Stan the doorman..</i>

659
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,261
Some kind of lockbox.

660
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,758
<i>For all the five boroughs.</i>

661
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,720
I count there are 472 people
with the last name "Black."

662
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:34,557
There are 216 different addresses. Some
of the Blacks live together, obviously.

663
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,394
I calculate if I go to two
every Saturday plus holidays..

664
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,935
minus my Hamlet school play rehearsals,
it'll take me about three years..

665
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,776
to go through all of them. But that's what I'll do.
Go to every person named Black..

666
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,282
and find out what the key fits
and what Dad needed me to find.

667
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,818
<i>The very best possible plan.</i>

668
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,497
I divided the people by zones and I
really had to tell my mother another lie.

669
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,454
She wouldn't understand
how I need to find what the key fit..

670
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,710
that would help me
make sense of things..

671
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,964
like him being killed by people
who didn't even know him at all!

672
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,375
<i>And I see some people
who don't speak English..</i>

673
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,135
Hazelle Black, who's all prayered up
and spoke to God.

674
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,342
<i>If she spoke to God, how come she
didn't tell him not to kill her son..</i>

675
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,177
not to let people
fly planes into buildings.

676
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,966
Maybe she spoke to a different God
than them!

677
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,682
<i>I meet</i> a <i>man, who is</i> a <i>woman who is</i>
a <i>man,</i> a <i>woman all at the same time</i>

678
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,017
I didn't wanna get near him/her,
because she/he scared me..

679
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,477
because she/he was so different.

680
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,609
I still wondered if she had a VJ
or peniscillin, but what does it matter?

681
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,817
What would this place be like
if everybody had the same haircut?

682
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,482
I see Mr. Black, who hasn't heard
a sound in 24 years.

683
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,193
Which I can understand,
because I miss Dad's voice that much.

684
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,077
<i>Like when he would say
"Are you up yet?" or..</i>

685
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,579
Let's go do something.

686
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,331
<i>I see the twin brothers
who paint together.</i>

687
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:40,040
And there's a shed that just has
to be a clue, but it's just a shed!

688
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,954
<i>And Astrid Black,
who has the same drawing..</i>

689
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,464
<i>of the same person
over and over and over again!</i>

690
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,172
<i>Boris Black, the doorman, who was once
a schoolteacher in Russia..</i>

691
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,383
<i>but now says his brain is dying.
Ramos Black, who has a coin collection..</i>

692
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,422
<i>but doesn't have enough money
to eat every day!</i>

693
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,593
<i>Alan Black has a view of Gramercy Park
but not a key to it..</i>

694
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,807
<i>which he says is worse
than looking at a brick wall.</i>

695
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,562
I feel like I'm looking
at a brick wall..

696
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,065
because I tried the key
in 148 different places..

697
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:05,228
but the key didn't fit
and open anything Dad needed me to find.

698
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,566
So that I'd know without him
everything is all right.

699
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,821
Then let's leave it there.

700
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,857
I still feel scared every time
I go into a strange place.

701
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,244
I'm so scared I have to hold myself around
my waist or I think I'll just break apart!

702
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,201
But I never forget what I heard him
tell Mom about the Sixth Borough:

703
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:18,866
<i>That if things were easy to find..</i>

704
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,625
They wouldn't be worth finding.

705
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,537
<i>But I'm still scared every time I leave
home, every time I hear a door open.</i>

706
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,627
And I don't know a single thing
that I didn't know when I started..

707
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,792
<i>except I miss my dad
more than ever..</i>

708
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,633
<i>even though the whole point
was to stop missing him at all!</i>

709
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,229
It hurts too much.

710
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,190
Sometimes I think I might do
something really bad.

711
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,632
Like you to what?

712
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,422
<i>No way. Absolutely not. No, no, no.</i>

713
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,808
Sure. Next Saturday, 7 a.m.

714
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:10,148
<i>I got there 23 minutes,
37 seconds early just in case.</i>

715
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,245
<i>I didn't know if I
wanted him to be there.</i>

716
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,369
<i>I didn't even know
if I didn't want him to be there.</i>

717
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,996
<i>I'd give it the day to find out.</i>

718
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,221
If you're coming with me,
there are rules.

719
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:46,105
You are allotted two bathroom breaks,
one 19-minute stop for eating.

720
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,186
And sightseeing is strictly prohibited..

721
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,442
although sites of historical merit
may be noted.

722
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:55,819
Also, there's a list of 15 simple questions
about yourself I'd like you to answer.

723
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,325
Come on.

724
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:10,913
Rule number four is keep up.
I can't stop and wait every two minutes.

725
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,897
Jean Black is in Zone H,
map grid AQ-16.

726
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:33,060
It's in the Rockaways, 11.3 miles.
This way.

727
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,163
I don't take the train. It's not safe.

728
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,121
It's an obvious target.
All public transportation is.

729
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:51,082
You can get blown to pieces
by people who don't even know you.

730
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,419
Oh, no.

731
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,975
<i>He said, "I can't walk that far."</i>

732
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:10,059
<i>He said if I wanted him to go with me, it
would have to be on the bus or a train.</i>

733
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,065
<i>- And the train was a lot faster.</i>..

734
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,775
<i>- "Anyway, there's nothing to be</i>-".

735
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,563
It's easy for you to say!

736
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,734
<i>Which actually.. it wasn't.</i>

737
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:10,495
"Think about nothing."
That's an oxymoron, like, "now, then."

738
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:14,378
<i>An oxymoron is when two words
contradict each other.</i>

739
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,672
<i>My father and I used to have
oxymoron wars.</i>

740
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,008
Seriously funny. Sah!

741
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,964
Deafening silence. Fwa, fwa!

742
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,253
Original copies.

743
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,468
Found missing!

744
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,307
"Student teacher"?

745
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,312
Liquid gas.

746
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,024
Clearly confused.

747
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,397
- Living dead!
- Oh!

748
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,104
"Almost exactly."

749
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,944
Genuine imitation.

750
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,613
- Accidentally on purpose.
- Aah.

751
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,820
Jumbo shrimp.

752
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,767
<i>And even though
he never said a word..</i>

753
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:19,150
<i>for the first time since Dad died,
I felt like I had someone to talk to.</i>

754
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,163
No one's there.

755
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,083
Ring it again and I'll kill you!

756
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,834
- What are you doing?
- Get out of there!

757
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,228
Hey, you!

758
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,024
What are you doing with that camera?

759
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,569
So how come you stopped talking?

760
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,538
I did some extensive research.

761
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,450
You know, it's medically impossible
to stop talking..

762
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,587
unless your vocal cords
are taken out or cut..

763
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:24,045
or diseased with carcinoma
of the larynx or something.

764
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:28,171
It said, "Otherwise,
it is a hysterical reaction.."

765
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,464
to a singularly traumatic event..

766
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,804
in which the person makes
a psychological decision not to speak..

767
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:36,846
"..because speaking would
re-create the event."

768
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,147
Just thought you should know.

769
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:59,334
Wait! I can't cross this!
The bridge isn't safe.

770
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,419
I might fall through.

771
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,849
I can't read what
you're writing from there.

772
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:33,451
<i>He wrote, "if you cross the bridge,
I'll tell you my story."</i>

773
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:38,532
Wait for me! Don't go too far!
Wait for me!

774
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:43,457
<i>He also wrote,
"Let's take a break and we'll talk."</i>

775
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,798
We can't! We only just started.

776
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,973
Wait here.

777
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,068
Don't leave me!

778
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:18,871
Hello?

779
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,315
Did you hear me?

780
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,357
There's no one here!

781
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,115
You promised not to leave me.

782
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,616
What's he saying?

783
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,998
Okay. Uh..

784
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:52,086
He's saying,
"I have lived in many places.."

785
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,676
but I was born in Germany.

786
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,598
After the war, I got married.

787
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:05,771
There was a child,
but I was too afraid to be a father.

788
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:12,069
When I was a young boy,
I was in a bomb shelter with my parents.

789
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:17,483
"A bomb exploded,
and they were both killed."

790
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,526
Is that why you stopped talking?

791
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,870
I'll get you a soda, kid.

792
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,665
Is that when you stopped talking?

793
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,814
I want you to come with me
from now on.

794
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,957
<i>And he shrugged the way Dad did.</i>

795
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,996
<i>I loved that.</i>

796
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:00,752
<i>A month of Saturdays and Sundays
he'd come with me..</i>

797
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,922
<i>and we'd seen 37 more Blacks.</i>

798
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,016
No, no, no!

799
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,397
You have to watch what you're doing.

800
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,730
Cassidy Black doesn't live in Glendale.
She lives in Woodhaven.

801
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,770
Here, let me help you.

802
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,907
<i>Aurelia Black lives in Whitestone.</i>

803
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,152
<i>Baz Black lives in Flushing.</i>

804
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,949
<i>Bea Black lives in Rosedale.</i>

805
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,157
<i>B.G. Black lives in Sunnyside.
Got it?</i>

806
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,963
Tomorrow we can make it
to Amara Black..

807
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,591
in zone JJ, map grid AN-50,
Mill Basin.

808
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,635
Rule number seven,
nothing gets in the way of the search.

809
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,707
Hello, my name is Oskar Schell.
My father..

810
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,166
Wrong way!

811
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,232
Enjoying that?

812
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:55,580
You know, I don't say anything when you
walk too slowly because you can't help it.

813
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,494
And I don't say anything when you go
to the bathroom three times an hour..

814
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,254
because I know you need to.

815
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,256
But you could eat a little faster!

816
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,919
It was James Black,
Don Black, Amos Black..

817
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:09,256
Guthrie Black,
and all three Ben Blacks.

818
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,049
Pointless.

819
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,178
We're not finished.

820
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,932
Hey, guys, I got a wife and kid
to get home to.

821
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,610
Please! Just give me a minute.

822
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,485
Right.

823
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,454
Ben Black.

824
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,551
Guthrie Black.

825
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,551
Amos Black.

826
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,497
Do you really expect me
to go out there and see what I..

827
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,912
Hey, kid, you need a master key.

828
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,375
I can't!

829
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,374
If I ask you a question,
will you tell me the truth?

830
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,381
Even if it will hurt me?

831
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,884
Do you think the key fits a lock?

832
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:03,554
Really?

833
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,527
I mean really?

834
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,076
And do you think we'll find the lock?

835
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,886
I'm not so sure either.

836
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,441
There's something I've got to show you.

837
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:02,076
<i>I couldn't be sure,
so I didn't say anything.</i>

838
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,457
<i>But I felt it all the time.</i>

839
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:08,995
<i>The way he walked,
the way he shrugged his shoulders..</i>

840
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,290
<i>the way my grandmother
wouldn't talk about him.</i>

841
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:15,175
<i>He must be my grandfather.</i>

842
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,523
My mom is out.

843
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:12,892
This way.

844
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,834
You can sit on my bed.

845
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,513
I printed these out from the Internet.

846
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,415
This is probably him.

847
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,497
Or it might be him.

848
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,379
He's dressed like he was.

849
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:19,883
When I magnify it until the dots are so
big it stops looking like a person..

850
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,636
sometimes I can see glasses on him.

851
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,132
Or I think I can.

852
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,808
Probably the other kids
see their dads too.

853
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,657
This is what I want to show you.

854
01:21:55,911 --> 01:22:00,587
On the worst day, my dad left six messages
on this answering machine.

855
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,926
No one else
has ever heard them but me.

856
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,479
Especially not her.

857
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:21,855
The first message was at 8:56.

858
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,281
I was still waiting to be let into school.

859
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,319
<i>I was playing with
Minch, wasting time.</i>

860
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,782
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

861
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:34,288
<i>I just tried the office,
but no one was picking up.</i>

862
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,374
<i>Uh, listen, uh, something's happened.
I'm okay.</i>

863
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,876
<i>They're telling us to
stay where we are.</i>

864
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,837
The second message was at 9:12.

865
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,130
<i>I was in class by then.</i>

866
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,469
parallelogram.

867
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,551
Okay, so, you take the beautiful,
magical parallelogram..

868
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,345
and you'll cut it into two beautiful..

869
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,058
<i>It's me again.</i>

870
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,222
<i>Hello?</i>

871
01:22:57,556 --> 01:23:00,560
<i>Sorry, look,
I was hoping you would be home.</i>

872
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,603
<i>I don't know if you heard
about what happened..</i>

873
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,488
<i>but I just wanted you to know
that I'm okay.</i>

874
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,742
<i>Everything is fine. We're still waiting
to find out what we're supposed to do.</i>

875
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,950
<i>It's pretty chaotic.
Firemen are supposed to be coming. What..</i>

876
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:19,211
The third message was at 9:58.

877
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,005
A bunch of us were walking home
with Minch's mom..

878
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,587
who said something was happening,
but didn't say what.

879
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:29,760
<i>I stopped at a deli at the corner of
92nd and Broadway to get a Juicy Juice.</i>

880
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:33,927
<i>I know I was there at that exact time
because I saved the receipt.</i>

881
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,891
It had the time on it.

882
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,731
<i>Hello?</i>

883
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,559
<i>Hello?</i>

884
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:44,899
<i>Hello?</i>

885
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,316
<i>Hello?</i>

886
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,449
I have to play you all of them.

887
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,287
The fourth message was at 10:07.

888
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:06,425
Given that the average walking speed for
a child my age is 4.4 feet per second..

889
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:10,137
and that it was 9 minutes
between those two messages..

890
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:14,721
I calculated that I walked 2376 feet..

891
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,636
<i>putting me in front of
the United Church on Broadway.</i>

892
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,680
I know this because
I went back and measured.

893
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,816
<i>It's me.</i>

894
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,319
<i>I was hoping you were home.</i>

895
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:32,284
<i>I really, really wanted to talk to you
I wanted to explain to you..</i>

896
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,451
<i>Wait, wait, no, no, I'm just gonna be
another minute, I'm sorry.</i>

897
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:38,950
<i>I can't use the phone for very long.</i>

898
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,122
<i>So I wanted to tell you..</i>

899
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,837
<i>how much I love you.</i>

900
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,502
<i>I wanted to tell you
how much I love you.</i>

901
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,265
The fifth message was at 10:17.

902
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,643
I was talking to Stan the doorman
when Dad left this.

903
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:00,933
<i>Are you there?</i>

904
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:07,273
<i>Are you there?
Please, pick up if you're there.</i>

905
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,858
No.

906
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:13,025
There's one more message.
The sixth message.

907
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,702
Ten twenty-seven.

908
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,774
Hey! Wait a minute!

909
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,652
What are you doing?

910
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,488
Who said things
should be getting better?

911
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:30,916
So that's it?

912
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,140
Hey!

913
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,012
Unh! You wanna go, so go!

914
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,230
I always knew you were my grandfather.

915
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:53,314
But if you think we'll miss you after you
go now, don't worry, because we won't!

916
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,772
In fact, I should be saying thank you!

917
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,693
My dad was the greatest dad in the world
because you were the worst!

918
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,611
My dad went to
Bronx Science High School..

919
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:06,282
where he was manager of the baseball
team and science editor of the paper!

920
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:10,294
When he graduated, he went to Rutgers,
where he majored in biochemistry.

921
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:13,001
He met my mom in a bookstore,
and he asked her to marry him..

922
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:16,292
in Norwalk, Connecticut. And every
summer, we'd go back to Toby Pond..

923
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,210
and he would ask her
to marry him again.

924
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,380
The day I was born, he pressed leaves
between wax paper..

925
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,675
<i>and they still hang in the bedroom
window. He wanted to be a scientist..</i>

926
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,310
<i>but he became a jeweler
to earn money for our family.</i>

927
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:30,348
He loved the smell of gasoline.
He hated tomatoes.

928
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:32,687
He never talked to me like I was a kid.

929
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:36,228
So, in a way,
your boots are heavier than mine.

930
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,649
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Um..

931
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,817
Hello. My name is Oskar Schell.

932
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:08,487
<i>Oskar? This is Abby Black.</i>

933
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:13,659
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

934
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,345
It's Oskar Schell! I'm here!

935
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,599
Oskar, you've grown.

936
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:37,190
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

937
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,314
I don't take rides from strangers.

938
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:43,856
That's a good rule,
but we're not entirely strangers.

939
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,698
Get in.

940
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:57,669
I told you when you were here before
I didn't know anything about the key.

941
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,124
But you do.

942
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,002
Well, my husband..

943
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:06,470
ex-husband, had the estate sale
you mentioned..

944
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,630
so I think you should talk to him.

945
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,344
Where's your ex-husband?

946
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:13,511
At work. I'm gonna take you to him now.

947
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,186
On Sunday night?

948
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:18,185
It's Monday morning in Japan.

949
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,797
Okay. He said you should
come right up.

950
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,547
32nd ﬂoor.

951
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,177
Aren't you coming?

952
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,843
I'll wait here.

953
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,443
Good luck.

954
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:54,327
Come in.

955
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:04,329
Hello.

956
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:06,210
Hello.

957
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,675
What can I do for you?
What's going on?

958
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,919
Do you know my father?

959
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,338
Your father? Who's your father?

960
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,215
Thomas Schell.

961
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,936
I don't think so.
I don't know any Schells.

962
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,014
He died at 9/11.

963
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:28,524
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- I found an envelope with your name on it..

964
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,109
and I thought it was your wife,
who I know now is your ex-wife..

965
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,865
but she didn't know
anything about it..

966
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,197
and there was a man
yelling from the other room.

967
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,284
- What do you know about my father?
- When was this?

968
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:42,291
Three months and 17 days,
eight hours..

969
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,954
16 minutes,
11, and now 12 seconds ago.

970
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,041
And tonight, at 7:42:46 p. m..

971
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:52,381
I found a newspaper clipping where
my dad had circled "not stop looking"..

972
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,922
and I found a telephone number
on the back.

973
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:57,098
And the number was for Abby Black.

974
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:02,141
That was me. At the house.

975
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,272
I was moving out.

976
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,229
- I know.
- Hm.

977
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,779
What was so special
about the envelope?

978
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,448
Can I see that?

979
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:28,212
Was there anything written
on the envelope?

980
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,294
It said "Black."

981
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,840
And did you find it in a blue vase?

982
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,762
Hm?

983
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:42,265
I don't believe it.

984
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,354
This is truly the most amazing thing.

985
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,766
I have been looking for this key..

986
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,525
for more than a year.

987
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:52,771
I've spent months trying
to find the lock that it fits.

988
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:56,282
- Then we've been looking for each other.
- What does it open?

989
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:58,363
A safe-deposit box.

990
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,369
What's it got to do with my dad?

991
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:01,950
With your dad?

992
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:06,869
I found it in my dad's closet, and since he's
dead, I couldn't ask him what it meant..

993
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,753
so I had to go find out for myself.

994
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,340
Well, uh..

995
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,879
my dad passed away too.

996
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,260
A couple of years ago.

997
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:22,683
He, um..

998
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:24,264
He went in for a..

999
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,977
checkup and, um.. Ahem.

1000
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:34,988
Anyway..

1001
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:41,244
next thing you know,
doctor says he has two months to live.

1002
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:50,913
I needed to figure out what to do
with his things, his books, his furniture.

1003
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:54,003
- Didn't you want to keep them?
- I didn't want any of it.

1004
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,919
<i>I had an estate sale.</i>

1005
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,798
<i>My father and I weren't
exactly close.</i>

1006
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:06,515
He spent his last couple of months
writing to everyone..

1007
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,852
cousins, business partners,
people I'd never heard of.

1008
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,105
He wrote about all the things
he wanted to do but never did..

1009
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:16,568
and all the things he did do
but didn't want to.

1010
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,867
Shared all the things
he never shared with me.

1011
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:28,412
You know, all the
things that I wanted to know about him.

1012
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,707
Do you need a hug?

1013
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:34,581
I'll be okay, thanks.

1014
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,833
Didn't he write a letter to you?

1015
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,553
Yeah, but I was afraid to open it.

1016
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:43,056
I would have been extremely curious.

1017
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:45,888
Well, my wife told me
I was being ridiculous.

1018
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:49,771
- Childish.
- But you were his child.

1019
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,736
I was afraid it was gonna be
some sort of confessional.

1020
01:36:56,894 --> 01:37:00,068
<i>I was hoping he would tell me
he was sorry..</i>

1021
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,366
<i>or that he loved me.</i>

1022
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:05,908
<i>Or something personal about us,
but he didn't.</i>

1023
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:10,750
At the end of the letter, he says:

1024
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:14,253
"There's something that I want you
to have in the blue vase.."

1025
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,255
on the shelf in the bedroom.

1026
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:19,418
<i>"I think you'll understand why
I wanted you to have it. ".</i>

1027
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,256
But I had sold the blue vase!
Or I..

1028
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:29,770
Actually, I gave it away to your dad,
I guess, before I'd opened the letter.

1029
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,764
So that's why I've been trying to find it.

1030
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,682
You met my dad?

1031
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,938
I guess so.

1032
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:38,193
Do you remember him?

1033
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,774
Uh, he mentioned something
about an anniversary.

1034
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,276
<i>September 14th.</i>

1035
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:49,615
<i>And that he had a surprise
planned for your mom.</i>

1036
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:50,828
Happy anniversary.

1037
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,412
<i>Something about a fancy restaurant.</i>

1038
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:54,911
His tuxedo.

1039
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:56,455
Without the key, I was stuck.

1040
01:37:58,164 --> 01:37:59,882
That's why you needed to find my dad.

1041
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:03,716
But I didn't know how to find him.
I didn't even know his name.

1042
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,174
For a few weeks, I'd wander over
to my dad's neighborhood..

1043
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,842
<i>hoping that I'd bump into him.</i>

1044
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:12,387
<i>I put up signs saying that the guy
who got the vase at the estate sale</i>

1045
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,430
at 75th Street,
please come contact me.

1046
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:18,443
<i>But that was a week after..</i>

1047
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:22,485
<i>well, you know, September 11th</i>

1048
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:27,156
<i>and people were putting up
posters everywhere.</i>

1049
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,181
Well..

1050
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,644
you don't have to look any more.

1051
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:26,386
I'm sorry, I know you've been looking
for something and this isn't it.

1052
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:27,887
It's okay.

1053
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,054
Let's you and I go to the bank.

1054
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,639
We'll find out what it is together,
we'll share it.

1055
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:38,140
You're nice. But no, thank you.

1056
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:47,782
Hey, you're gonna be
all right there?

1057
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:52,161
Can I tell you something
I never told anybody else?

1058
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,038
Sure.

1059
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:04,837
On that day, they let us out of school
basically as soon as we got there.

1060
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:06,588
I walked home.

1061
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:11,298
My friend told me he would call, so I went
to look at the answering machine.

1062
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:13,049
There were all these messages.

1063
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:14,767
From your friend?

1064
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:16,932
From my dad.

1065
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,056
He was in the building.

1066
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,939
But there's something
I've never told anyone.

1067
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:26,650
Not anybody else, not anybody ever.

1068
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,949
The phone rang.

1069
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,279
Oh, God.

1070
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:00,688
I couldn't pick up the phone.
I just couldn't do it.

1071
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:03,941
It rang, and rang, and rang,
and I couldn't move.

1072
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:28,674
I wanted to pick it up, but I couldn't.
I just couldn't.

1073
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:33,217
<i>The answering machine came on.
There was a beep.</i>

1074
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,177
<i>Message
six, September 11, 10:27 a.m.</i>

1075
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:37,683
<i>Then I heard Dad's voice.</i>

1076
01:41:39,135 --> 01:41:40,352
<i>Are you there?</i>

1077
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:42,555
<i>"Are you there?"</i>

1078
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,352
<i>- "Are you there?"</i>
<i>- Are you there?</i>

1079
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:47,018
Are you there?."

1080
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:53,858
He needed me and I couldn't pick it up.

1081
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:56,740
I was scared. I just couldn't do it.

1082
01:41:57,361 --> 01:42:02,868
"Are you there?" He asked nine times.
I know because I've counted.

1083
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:06,087
And why didn't he say "Anyone"?

1084
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:11,384
"Is anyone there?"
"You" is just one person.

1085
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:14,011
I think he knew I was there.

1086
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:17,678
Maybe he kept saying it to give me time
to be brave enough to pick up.

1087
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:23,934
The longest space is between the third
and the fourth, which is 15 seconds.

1088
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:25,222
<i>Are you there?</i>

1089
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,063
You can hear people
in the background crying.

1090
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:30,232
<i>- Are you there?
- You can hear helicopters.</i>

1091
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:31,737
<i>Are you there?</i>

1092
01:42:31,896 --> 01:42:34,069
<i>You can hear glass breaking.</i>

1093
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:36,074
<i>Are you there? Are you the..</i>

1094
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:38,448
<i>Then it cut off.</i>

1095
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,522
Do you forgive me?

1096
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:12,437
Forgive you?

1097
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:16,107
For what?
For not being able to pick up?

1098
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:20,448
For not being able to tell anyone.

1099
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,613
Oh..

1100
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:26,867
Of course I forgive you.

1101
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:33,666
I can't tell you how much better
that makes me feel.

1102
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:39,631
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1103
01:43:50,808 --> 01:43:51,980
I've got to go.

1104
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:14,753
Thank you.

1105
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:25,176
What's he doing?

1106
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,515
Oskar!

1107
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:43,796
Hey, give it to me,
give it to me, give it to me.

1108
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:51,262
It's okay, it's okay, give that to me.

1109
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:54,477
Give it to me, give it to me,
give it to me, it's okay.

1110
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:59,020
Let go, let go, let go.

1111
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:03,612
It's okay, I got it. It's all right.
Let go. Let go, let go, baby.

1112
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:07,620
Let it go, let it go, it's all right.
It's all right, let it go, let it go.

1113
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:12,121
Let it go. It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's okay.

1114
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:16,963
I promise I'll be better soon, I promise!
I'll be normal!

1115
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:20,628
That is the last thing that I would want.
You are perfect.

1116
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:25,508
I tried incredibly hard, Mom. I don't know
how I could have tried any harder.

1117
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,218
I know you did.

1118
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:30,142
I know you did. I know you did.

1119
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:32,895
- You don't know.
- I do.

1120
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,976
But you really don't know, Mom.

1121
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:39,485
I know how proud your dad would
have been that you didn't stop looking.

1122
01:46:41,437 --> 01:46:44,691
Sweetie, do you think I would ever
let you out of my sight?

1123
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:47,861
Do you think I would let
anything happen to you?

1124
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:49,995
I always knew where you were.

1125
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,576
Always.

1126
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,248
You did?

1127
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:57,169
When Stan the doorman told me about
all the phone books you said you needed..

1128
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:02,550
for a school project on the census,
I knew you were up to something.

1129
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:05,006
How?

1130
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:09,007
The census
isn't for another seven years.

1131
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:18,061
So I went into your room
and I tried to think like you did.

1132
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,726
I wanted to understand.

1133
01:47:21,352 --> 01:47:22,854
You were snooping on me?

1134
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:27,195
I was searching for you.

1135
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:36,075
<i>I found your Enchanted Forest game
with the list of the Blacks.</i>

1136
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:38,790
<i>I saw your index system
of the five boroughs.</i>

1137
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:40,045
<i>My CZI.</i>

1138
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:41,626
Your CZI?

1139
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:44,091
Collapsible Zone Index.

1140
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:46,877
<i>I saw how you used the last
four digits of the phone numbers.</i>

1141
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:48,387
I thought that was clever.

1142
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:50,218
<i>That was very clever.</i>

1143
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:53,224
I made my own map.

1144
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,557
And I marked up all your zones.

1145
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:57,638
One hundred and four.

1146
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,937
216 addresses.

1147
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:04,065
472 people named Black.

1148
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:08,066
<i>I made a list of all the people
you were going to see that weekend.</i>

1149
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:09,950
<i>I called the ones
you'd already been to..</i>

1150
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:13,488
<i>and I went and met the ones
you were going to go see.</i>

1151
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:15,122
<i>- You did?</i>
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

1152
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:18,079
- All of them?
- Mm-hm.

1153
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:23,001
<i>So since my husband's death, my son
has been searching all over the city..</i>

1154
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:26,838
with a key he thinks might be a clue,
so he's very..

1155
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,095
Um.. Oh. Um..

1156
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:31,927
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much. Um..

1157
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:36,094
So, when he comes,
he took this entire map and he..

1158
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:38,437
Thank you.

1159
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,273
Thank you very much.

1160
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:43,934
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1161
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:47,230
Um.. Oh.

1162
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:48,818
Thank you.

1163
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:50,824
<i>Hector Black sure liked to hug.</i>

1164
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:52,985
<i>He hugged me 17 times.</i>

1165
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:55,780
I wanted to get away,
but he just kept on hugging.

1166
01:48:59,575 --> 01:49:03,296
And he feels that it's somehow
related to his father's death.

1167
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,456
I know, it's sad. It's a sad story.

1168
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,965
I liked Elaine Black
and her five noisy kids.

1169
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:22,101
<i>Did you get a drawing?</i>

1170
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:24,024
<i>Dozens.</i>

1171
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:36,905
So when he comes, maybe you guys
could let him sit on that and he could..

1172
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:52,090
<i>And what about Leigh-Anne Black?</i>

1173
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:54,129
<i>She yelled at me to go away.</i>

1174
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:56,173
Yeah, me too.

1175
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:59,059
Whether or not you had
any connection to..

1176
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:03,681
Go. Please, get out of here. Go!

1177
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:06,858
Lona Black had an amazing story.

1178
01:50:07,226 --> 01:50:09,695
I thought Lona Black
would burst into tears.

1179
01:50:10,187 --> 01:50:14,658
He's gonna be fine. Just a few questions,
that's all he's gonna need.

1180
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:16,697
You sure you're okay with this?

1181
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:22,658
- She was fine when I got there.
- Oh, yeah?

1182
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:30,712
I knew how long it would take you to
get from Eleanor Black's in Astoria to..

1183
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,876
Harlan Black's in Bushwick.

1184
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:36,384
I'm really sorry about your father.

1185
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,185
- Mom, it's that boy!
- It's that boy!

1186
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:47,391
I think our moms look kind of similar,
don't you?

1187
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:54,402
- So you knew about the key.
- Mm-hm.

1188
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,906
I knew you had to go
make sense of things.

1189
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,945
And I got to go with you.

1190
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:02,455
You weren't ever worried
I was gonna be raped..

1191
01:51:02,614 --> 01:51:05,163
or killed or strangled or stabbed
or something?

1192
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:06,747
<i>Every hour of every day.</i>

1193
01:51:09,288 --> 01:51:11,086
<i>I couldn't breathe until
the door closed.</i>

1194
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:13,000
- Hey.
- I'm home.

1195
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,963
I thought only Dad could think like me.

1196
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:20,258
Me too.

1197
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:25,429
So many of them had lost
something or somebody, Mom.

1198
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:27,348
Just like us.

1199
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:33,570
What do you miss about him?

1200
01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:39,826
Oh, I miss so many things about him.

1201
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:43,990
I miss how he could tell the weather
just by touching the window.

1202
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:47,500
When he would come
in the house and yell:

1203
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:50,128
"What's everybody doing?"

1204
01:51:56,877 --> 01:52:00,131
I miss how he would stick his entire arm
into the coffee beans at Fairway..

1205
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:01,799
- ..because he liked how it felt.
- Ah.

1206
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:05,845
That would make me so angry because
everyone in the store was watching him.

1207
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:10,482
- Were they?
- Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

1208
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:17,026
I miss his voice.

1209
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:22,407
I miss his voice telling me he loves me.

1210
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,242
Me too.

1211
01:52:29,493 --> 01:52:31,211
- Mom?
- Mm?

1212
01:52:32,037 --> 01:52:35,166
It's okay if you fall in love again.
If you want to.

1213
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,420
Oh.

1214
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:44,433
I'll never fall in love for the first time again.
Nobody can be him.

1215
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:45,808
Nobody.

1216
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:53,020
He told me. He said:

1217
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:56,687
"I really love your mother.
She's such a good girl."

1218
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:13,708
Morn?

1219
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,135
I don't tell you I love you
enough times, do I?

1220
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,258
Oh.

1221
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:26,641
Yes, you do.

1222
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:29,053
On, baby.

1223
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:32,564
You do.

1224
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:47,908
Stairs are broken.

1225
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,290
You're going to school awful early.

1226
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:53,744
There isn't any school today,
it's Presidents' Day.

1227
01:53:54,578 --> 01:53:56,251
I thought that was in February.

1228
01:53:56,872 --> 01:53:58,795
They changed it.

1229
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:00,960
Mm.

1230
01:54:42,167 --> 01:54:44,886
I'd written a letter
to the people I'd met.

1231
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:50,889
<i>"Dear Mister or Missus or Miss.."</i>

1232
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:55,473
<i>or Abby or Hazelle
or Tommy or Elaine..</i>

1233
01:54:55,639 --> 01:54:58,142
<i>or anybody I'd met
whose last name is Black.</i>

1234
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:01,357
<i>You might remember me.</i>

1235
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:03,651
<i>My name is Oskar Schell.</i>

1236
01:55:04,648 --> 01:55:07,322
<i>I came to visit you to see if you could
help me find the lock..</i>

1237
01:55:07,484 --> 01:55:09,953
<i>that fit the key I thought
my father had left me.</i>

1238
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,666
<i>Most of you were very helpful
and nice to me.</i>

1239
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:17,203
<i>I want to thank you for that.</i>

1240
01:55:17,786 --> 01:55:20,835
<i>And I want to thank you
for the horse ride you gave me..</i>

1241
01:55:20,997 --> 01:55:23,841
<i>and for Taylor's picture
of me and my key.</i>

1242
01:55:25,001 --> 01:55:28,505
<i>You might want to know,
the key wasn't meant for me.</i>

1243
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:32,259
<i>It was meant for a Mr.
William Black..</i>

1244
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:35,555
<i>who maybe needed it
even more than I did.</i>

1245
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:38,690
<i>I was disappointed, obviously..</i>

1246
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:42,186
<i>but I'm honestly glad
that it's where it belongs.</i>

1247
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:44,563
<i>And I'm even glad
to have my disappointment..</i>

1248
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:48,283
<i>which is much better
than having nothing.</i>

1249
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:54,953
<i>My dad told me that New York once had
a Sixth Borough that ﬂoated away.</i>

1250
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:58,042
<i>They tried to save it,
but they couldn't..</i>

1251
01:55:58,243 --> 01:56:00,541
<i>and it's never coming back.</i>

1252
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:03,465
<i>As much as I want him to..</i>

1253
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:06,710
<i>my dad is never coming back.</i>

1254
01:56:07,127 --> 01:56:11,758
<i>And I thought I couldn't live
without him, but now I know I can.</i>

1255
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:15,310
<i>I think that would
make my dad proud..</i>

1256
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:18,639
<i>"..which is all I ever wanted."</i>

1257
01:57:00,889 --> 01:57:03,483
<i>I got the Renter's address
from Grandma..</i>

1258
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:08,193
<i>and although I wanted to say, "You
selfish butthead," and, "Fukozowa you"..</i>

1259
01:57:08,355 --> 01:57:09,402
<i>I didn't.</i>

1260
01:57:11,983 --> 01:57:14,077
<i>I asked him to come home.</i>

1261
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:10,292
<i>"Congratulations, Oskar."</i>

1262
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:14,255
<i>With unbelievable bravery,
and wisdom far beyond your years..</i>

1263
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:18,008
<i>you have solved
Reconnaissance Expedition Number Six.</i>

1264
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,521
<i>You have proven both the existence
of the Sixth Borough..</i>

1265
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:25,353
<i>and your own excellence.</i>

1266
01:58:26,141 --> 01:58:30,442
<i>Wherever they now are, the people
of the Sixth Borough celebrate you.</i>

1267
01:58:31,146 --> 01:58:32,693
<i>And so do I.</i>

1268
01:58:33,023 --> 01:58:35,196
<i>"Now it's time to go home."</i>

1269
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:40,302
One..

1270
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:20,770
