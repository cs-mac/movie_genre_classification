1
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,840
But, Hannah, how can you defend him?

2
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,960
But I'm not defending him.

3
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,410
You can hardly forget that your husband
is my friend because of you.

4
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,630
And I don't throw my friends away so quickly.

5
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,820
No matter what happens,
even if Jimwere killed in an airplane crash,

6
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,390
I would never, ever go back to Bowden.

7
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,780
That's clear.

8
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,740
And poor Bowden knows absolutely that he
cannot prevent you from loving another man.

9
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,350
He is not stupid.

10
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,570
Then why is he trying to prevent our divorce?

11
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,530
Because, under such circumstances,
it's only natural...

12
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,180
that people imagine- or at least hope-

13
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,680
to have some possibility of power.

14
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,440
Hans Jonas is on the phone.

15
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,210
Not now, later. I'll call him back.

16
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,850
Oh, Mary, they are beautiful.
Thank you.

17
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,300
I don't know how you can believe
anything he says these days.

18
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,610
Well, you trusted him enough
to be married with him for 15 years.

19
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,260
I never trusted him.

20
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,520
It's Professor Miller calling from Connecticut.
He said it's urgent.

21
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,940
- He has some questions about your syllabus.
- Phone appointment-

22
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,470
tomorrow, please.

23
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,820
And unplug that phone.

24
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,920
Look, Mary, either you are willing to take men
as they are, or you must live alone.

25
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,300
- You won't change Jim either.
- I don't want to change Jim. He's perfect.

26
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,490
Perfect?

27
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,980
The men in your novels are not perfect.

28
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,560
Why do you expect the real ones
to be any better?

29
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,600
- That was Heinrich.
- Oh, no.

30
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,750
That's the one phone call I would have taken.

31
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,700
He said not to disturb you
when your darling Mary is here.

32
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,340
- When will he be home?
- He's spending the night up there.

33
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,450
He has to meet a student early in the morning.

34
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,030
Thanks, Lotte.

35
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,710
No student meets early in the morning.

36
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,230
- Mary, don't start.
- I would be far too jealous for your charming Heinrich.

37
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,920
- It's fine.
- Well, I suppose we can't all be wild Berliners like you.

38
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,030
Wild because we don't marry all our lovers?

39
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,020
Oh, I didn't marry all of them.

40
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,180
But almost.

41
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,430
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

42
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
We don't have to talk about it right away.

43
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,720
Haven't you read the newspaper?

44
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,600
From beginning to end, Frau Professor.

45
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,480
They want his trial to be in Jerusalem!

46
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,700
Why else would the Mossad have kidnapped him?

47
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,440
You think that's right?

48
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,050
They should have shot him
on the spot in Buenos Aires.

49
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,700
But then of course...

50
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,000
You forgot to say hello.

51
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,030
Hello.

52
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,990
<i>The investigation has revealed...</i>

53
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,220
<i>that Adolf Eichmann's escape
from Germany to South America...</i>

54
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,510
<i>was made possible with a Red Cross passport
that the Vatican helped him obtain.</i>

55
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,200
No! The pope would never help a Nazi escape.

56
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,230
No, he helped him because he was such a good Catholic.

57
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,580
But God didn't let him get away.

58
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,540
God didn't. But the Germans did.

59
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,910
You'll see. They won't try to extradite him.

60
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,260
<i>The former SS officer...</i>

61
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,980
<i>followed what was secretly known
in espionage circles as the ratline.</i>

62
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,010
<i>Eichmann received his forged identification
and passport in Genoa,</i>

63
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,280
<i>and then he boarded an Italian ship to Buenos Aires.</i>

64
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,270
"You will perhaps understand
why I want to attend Eichmann's trial.

65
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,380
I left Germany in 1933, and I missed Nuremberg.

66
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,420
I never saw a Nazi"-

67
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,640
Oh, wait.

68
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,330
"I never saw 'these people' in the flesh"?

69
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,830
"People in the flesh."

70
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,320
- I think that's better.
- Better, yes.

71
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,920
Isn't it incredible that <i>the</i> Hannah Arendt
is offering to report for us?

72
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,410
It would be a privilege to have a German-Jewish émigré
of such high standing cover the trial.

73
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,360
- There's no doubt about that.
- Who is she to be offering?

74
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,250
She should be begging to write for the <i>New Yorker,</i>
like everyone else.

75
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,160
Frances, she wrote <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism.</i>

76
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,740
Catchy title.

77
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,150
One of the most important books
of the 20th century.

78
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,570
Read it.

79
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,330
She's not one of those European philosophers, is she?

80
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,940
She was the first person to write about the Third Reich
in the context of Western civilization.

81
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,560
It was brilliant, but abstract.

82
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,660
I understand why she wants to go.

83
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,540
Philosophers don't make deadlines.

84
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,420
Call now.

85
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,610
Do it.

86
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,560
Do you really have to do this?

87
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,090
You remember how shocked we were

88
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,470
when we heard the awful news from Europe...

89
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,920
How destroyed you were?

90
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,720
I'd never forgive myself
if I didn't take this opportunity.

91
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,860
You told everyone how smart and brave I was
to escape from Gurs.

92
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,470
And so you were, my love.

93
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Many women stayed for fear
their husbands wouldn't find them

94
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,580
if they left the camp.

95
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,270
I'd have found you anywhere.

96
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,260
Maybe not.

97
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,910
While it was still summer and warm...

98
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,480
we hoped it would soon be over.

99
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,360
But then...

100
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,080
The waiting...

101
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,460
More and more women let themselves go,
stopped combing their hair...

102
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,140
Stopped washing themselves.

103
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,330
Just lay there on their straw sacks.

104
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,600
I tried to encourage them.

105
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,790
Sometimes I was strict, sometimes friendly.

106
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,390
But then, one evening...

107
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,380
it had rained all day
and the straw sacks were falling apart.

108
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,330
I suddenly lost my courage.

109
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,140
I was so tired.

110
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,710
So tired...

111
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,700
that I wanted to leave

112
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,780
the world

113
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,340
that I so loved.

114
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,250
And in that instant...

115
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,900
I saw you in front of me.

116
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,590
How you'd look for me, and...

117
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,770
not find me.

118
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,140
Now do you understand
why I don't want you to go?

119
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,740
<i>Summis cum gratulationibus.</i>

120
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,150
Hannah... great! You asked them?

121
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,960
And they just said yes?

122
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,950
Yes. Simple as that.

123
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,680
Everything's simple for a genius.

124
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,260
Don't exaggerate.

125
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,250
I hope you're still teaching next term.

126
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,740
You will hear all about that
when the tribe comes over.

127
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,930
You know,

128
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,920
- I almost dread this trip.
- I wish I could accompany you.

129
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,960
Oh Hans, that would be so nice.

130
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,600
Need a light, Mrs. Arendt?

131
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,980
- Oh, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

132
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,840
Nixon's usually an unrepentant bulldog,
but he's lost his nerve.

133
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,410
He's like a frightened schoolboy
wanting to be liked.

134
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,480
He's even trying to get Kennedy's approval.

135
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,630
Nixon is a liar. It's a strategy.
He only cares about his career.

136
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,780
- That's why he's going to win.
- No. Nixon calculates.

137
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,890
But Kennedy is young and handsome and inspiring,

138
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,300
and that is what matters
when the ships are down.

139
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,610
"Chips." Hannah, "chips," not "ships."

140
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh, that must be Hans and Lore.

141
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,070
All right then: "chips."

142
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,250
English can only be a second-rate fiddle for us.

143
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,860
If you want to hear Hannah play her Stradivarius,
you should learn German.

144
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,010
- She asked me to correct her.
- <i>Ah, at last!</i>

145
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,810
Impossible. Must have been someone else.

146
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,460
- Our train was late.
- Of course.

147
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,260
We know that excuse.

148
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,990
<i>Coats off. Everyone's here.</i>

149
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,790
<i>Great that you made it.</i>

150
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,620
Meet the latest member of the tribe.
Professor Miller, Hans and Lore Jonas.

151
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,240
- Such a pleasure to finally meet you.
- Professor Miller, it's an honor.

152
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,350
Hannah tells me you're her oldest and dearest friend.

153
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,690
The oldest for sure, but not the dearest.

154
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,260
- Oh, Heinrich is much older than me.
- And much better looking.

155
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,880
Did you already know each other back in Germany?

156
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,560
Thomas, I said "old friend."
In Europe that means we met more than 10 minutes ago.

157
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,710
They met in the '20s as students of Heidegger,
the <i>Hosenmatz</i> philosopher.

158
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,860
Don't say my name in the same breath as that Nazi.

159
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,970
Not here, Hans!

160
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,110
So, you were all students
of the confounding Martin Heidegger.

161
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,260
Oh, I didn't even finish high school.

162
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,570
But aren't you a professor at Bard?

163
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,010
Original thinkers don't need degrees, Professor Miller.

164
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,450
To Hannah,

165
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,750
in honor of her trip to Jerusalem.

166
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,560
Oh, thank you, Hans.

167
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,470
It's not a vacation, Hans.

168
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,740
Lotte, champagne.

169
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,540
So I heard so much about you.

170
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,460
I am honored that a colleague from my university...

171
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,490
has this great opportunity
to be an eyewitness to history.

172
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,560
- We'll miss you.
- Oh, thank you.

173
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,140
- Yes, really.
- Thank you.

174
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,090
It is just wonderful, Hannah, that you,

175
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,160
one of us, will be present for this great trial.

176
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,810
This is not a grand trial. It's illegal.

177
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,840
The kidnapping by the Israeli secret service was illegal!

178
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,950
Israel has a sacred right to try a Nazi
for crimes against the Jewish people.

179
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,910
Sacred right? Hans, you're <i>meshugga.</i>

180
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,590
- But most of the survivors live there.
- Precisely.

181
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,850
And they want to see this criminal face to face.

182
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,510
- Face to face!
- Excuse me.

183
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,460
They'll all be dragged into court!

184
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,460
They'll be witnesses.

185
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,530
- It'll take years.
- This trial...

186
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,860
So much smoke!

187
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,490
- Do you understand anything?
- I thought you were the German speaker.

188
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,490
Well, I can read it perfectly,
but they're speaking so fast.

189
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,830
The State of Israel didn't even exist back then.

190
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,090
Unfortunately.

191
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,550
Or they'd have declared war on Hitler
like England and France.

192
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,540
But nevertheless, we were there!

193
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,890
We did our duty and volunteered for the British Army
to fight the Nazis.

194
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,620
We were in the Jewish Brigade in '44.

195
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,910
- Me and many brave men from Israel.
- They know that.

196
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,640
Heinrich doesn't know what it means

197
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
to take up arms to defend his convictions.

198
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,550
He had to emigrate because of them!

199
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,560
So did many others. Doesn't mean much.

200
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,510
No one doubts your bravery, Hans.

201
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,620
Hannah always says she admired you as a soldier.

202
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,610
Not just as a soldier.

203
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,800
<i>Lotte!</i>

204
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,030
Eichmann should have been tried in Nuremberg,
but he escaped.

205
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,060
- <i>That makes him an outlaw, a pirate.</i>
- Tell us what they're saying.

206
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,900
I'm sure you'd prefer to hear it from Hannah.

207
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,590
So he should be tried by an international court.

208
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,510
- No such thing.
- Precisely!

209
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,780
If the case proceeds as you predict...

210
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,460
He's just one of those passionate
ex-communists from Berlin.

211
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,350
- Jewish?
- No.

212
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,300
But he followed Rosa Luxemburg to the end.

213
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,550
Oh, so of course that's better than a PhD.

214
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,600
You can't put history on trial.
You can only try one man.

215
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,050
Indeed. One man on trial. For murder.

216
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,320
Strange pair.

217
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,970
<i>Yes. For murder.</i>

218
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,090
They're fantastic.
The happiest married couple in the world.

219
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,740
<i>And that has to be proven...</i>

220
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,850
Whatever you're saying,
I agree with all of you.

221
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,060
Everybody, English now. Please.

222
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,830
Sorry, Mary.

223
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,130
<i>Good health.</i>

224
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,790
See you soon.

225
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,890
- Adieu, Charlotte.
- Adieu.

226
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,080
- Thank you, dear.
- See you soon.

227
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,540
We were too hard on Hans.
Tell him I'm sorry.

228
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,570
- You say that every time.
- I know.

229
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,570
- See you on campus.
- Oh, it was great having you, Thomas. Bye.

230
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,280
- Bye...
- Take care now in that awful storm.

231
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,050
It's terrible.

232
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,310
It's so much fun

233
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,880
to light a fire under Hans' sacred little behind.

234
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,800
Especially as he's so happy to send you to hell!

235
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,180
Oh... you.

236
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,130
Hannah!

237
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,270
Here:

238
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,890
In his inaugural speech, he thanked the Führer.

239
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,430
PARTY MEMBER HEIDEGGER...

240
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,460
Then they sang the Horst-Wessel-Lied.

241
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,910
Hello, "Klaps."

242
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,720
Hello, "Stups."

243
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,940
Are you coming with me?

244
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,180
Hannah! My Hannah!

245
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,050
Jerusalem...

246
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,240
your love.

247
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,660
Yes.

248
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,990
And how's my Heinrich?

249
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,830
- Is he good to you?
- Yes.

250
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,680
Sometimes too good.

251
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,700
I miss arguing with him.

252
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,390
I can no longer see my way
through the maze of modern life.

253
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,550
He argued with me about this trip.

254
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,040
He's afraid it will send me back

255
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,110
to the "dark times."

256
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,220
This trial is very important for us.

257
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,670
And you're strong, my Hannah.
You always were.

258
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,020
And brave.

259
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,710
Very brave.

260
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,850
Tell me how you are.

261
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,270
- How's your heart?
- Not too good.

262
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,650
It's never gotten used
to the world we live in.

263
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,130
Israel has aged faster than you,
my little Hannah.

264
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,170
I always thought you'd have many children.

265
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,970
Oh, Jenny. At first we were too poor,

266
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,420
and when we had the money,

267
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,040
we were too old.

268
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,380
Many people here are poor
but they still have children.

269
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,070
Children are important for such a young country.

270
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,840
It was about time you visited us.

271
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,710
- She's not visiting.
- You see?

272
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,470
He's throwing me out already!

273
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm only sorry that your visit
is thanks to this wild predator.

274
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,390
That's why he's being displayed in a cage.

275
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,730
- A cage?
- Made of glass.

276
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,570
To protect him from us.

277
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,360
<i>The high court!</i>

278
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,710
<i>When I stand before you here, judges of Israel,</i>

279
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,670
to bring charges against Adolf Eichmann,

280
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,230
I am not standing alone.

281
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,880
With me are six million accusers.

282
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,830
<i>But they cannot rise</i>

283
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,180
<i>or point towards him in the dock.</i>

284
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,590
<i>They cannot cry, "I accuse him!"</i>

285
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,350
For their ashes have been scattered
over the hills of Auschwitz

286
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,340
and in the fields of Treblinka,

287
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,040
and thrown into the rivers of Poland.

288
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,140
<i>Their graves are to be found</i>

289
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,030
<i>throughout Europe.</i>

290
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,670
<i>Their blood cries to heaven,</i>

291
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,780
<i>but we cannot hear their voices.</i>

292
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,110
And Hausner parades around

293
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,610
as if he's competing with Eichmann
for the leading role in a play.

294
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,450
His opening speech was bound to be dramatic.

295
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,490
In the spirit of Ben-Gurion?

296
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,370
He's behind all this, isn't he?

297
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,060
Israel has to be very careful
that this doesn't become a show trial.

298
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,390
That's my Hannah! Just wait a bit.

299
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,960
And try to understand Ben-Gurion.

300
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:26,840
Our young people refuse to confront
what you call the "dark times."

301
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,020
Either they're ashamed of their parents
who didn't fight or protect themselves,

302
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,630
or they accuse them
of having behaved dishonorably.

303
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,170
They think only criminals or whores
could have survived the camps.

304
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,160
And you believe Hausner
can make them understand

305
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,500
what their parents have suffered?

306
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,680
Be a little patient with us.

307
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,440
<i>Yes, I read here that during the transport</i>

308
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,860
<i>15 people died.</i>

309
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,170
<i>I can only say that these records</i>

310
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,120
<i>were not the responsibility of department 4B-4.</i>

311
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,620
<i>They are from the local authorities,
according to their guidelines.</i>

312
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,730
<i>It says here that the order
was given by the Reichsführer.</i>

313
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,710
<i>But tell me, why do you have the officer-
to be the officer transferring this order?</i>

314
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,710
<i>Why Eichmann?</i>

315
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:32,120
<i>Does the Reichsführer have no other
way of contacting but Eichmann?</i>

316
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,150
<i>The document makes it clear</i>

317
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,260
<i>that the local police, or headquarters thereof,</i>

318
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,560
<i>made the request to Section 4B-4.</i>

319
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,740
<i>Thus I received the matter
for its continued processing</i>

320
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,900
<i>and dealt with it in an intermediate capacity.</i>

321
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,070
<i>As I was ordered to do.
I had to follow orders.</i>

322
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,220
<i>But it was you who decided</i>

323
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,410
<i>how many people were to be put
into each railway car, no?</i>

324
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,330
<i>I had orders.</i>

325
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,740
<i>Whether people were killed or not,</i>

326
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,550
<i>orders had to be executed.</i>

327
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,660
<i>In line with administrative procedure.</i>

328
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,420
<i>I was only responsible
for a small part of this.</i>

329
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,770
<i>The other parts that were necessary
until one of these trains rolled out</i>

330
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,640
<i>were carried out by another department.</i>

331
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,170
<i>Mr. Chairman, I have the feeling
I'm being grilled here</i>

332
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,320
<i>until the steak is done.</i>

333
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,090
<i>Because of charges...</i>

334
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:45,190
<i>that are impossible to substantiate.</i>

335
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,410
Now you've finally heard the predator.

336
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,570
Are you all right?

337
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,020
Yes, I'm fine.

338
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,940
Good.

339
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,330
Good.

340
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Well...

341
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,200
He's so different than I imagined.

342
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,190
He was with the SS.
They're scary creatures.

343
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,840
But he's not.

344
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,100
That's precisely it.

345
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,020
He sits in his glass box

346
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,530
like a ghost...

347
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,670
A ghost who happens to have a cold.

348
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,550
He's not spooky at all.

349
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,970
He's a nobody.

350
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,420
He speaks in this awful bureaucratic language.

351
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,760
He suddenly says things like:

352
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,410
"I feel like a rump steak
that's being grilled..."

353
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,100
Incredible!

354
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,120
Waiter! I assume you don't want a steak now.

355
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,820
Trying to cheer me up?

356
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,540
"One notices the intention and is displeased."

357
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,770
"One feels the intention and is displeased."

358
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,340
"What pleases you is permitted..."

359
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,490
- Also from Tasso.
- "What behooves you is permitted..."

360
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,130
"If you would like to learn what behooves one,

361
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,400
you have only to ask a noble lady..."

362
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,280
My father was a tailor in Berlin.

363
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,270
He always quoted Faust as he shaved.

364
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,420
Mephistopheles was his favorite.

365
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,100
"Blood is a very special juice."

366
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,870
Eichmann.

367
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,290
Eichmann is no Mephistopheles.

368
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,820
<i>My father was 58.
My mother- she was 43.</i>

369
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,730
<i>My brother, who was 22. I was 21.</i>

370
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,850
<i>My sister was 19.</i>

371
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,030
<i>My brother was 16.</i>

372
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,140
<i>My other brother was 14.</i>

373
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,100
<i>Sister was eight.
And the little brother was five.</i>

374
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,900
<i>We trying to keep together
and go along on the road,</i>

375
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,320
<i>what have been told by this brave SS.</i>

376
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,430
<i>And who remains of your family members?</i>

377
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,580
<i>Only myself.</i>

378
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,180
<i>When we were counted later on,</i>

379
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,950
<i>200 or 210 of us remained</i>

380
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,090
<i>of the 1200 who'd been transported.</i>

381
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,290
<i>The next ones were all gassed.</i>

382
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,740
<i>Those who arrived just after us,</i>

383
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,930
<i>they were all gassed.</i>

384
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,420
<i>It was...</i>

385
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,540
<i>Excuse me...</i>

386
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,910
<i>Please try...</i>

387
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,060
<i>Please try...</i>

388
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,510
<i>And this was power-</i>

389
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,500
<i>the unnatural power above nature,</i>

390
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,800
<i>which sustained me.</i>

391
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,980
<i>So that after the period of Auschwitz-</i>

392
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:11,090
<i>two years in Auschwitz-
when I was a Muslim,</i>

393
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,620
<i>to withstand-</i>

394
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,390
<i>Mr. De-Nur. Please.
Please listen to Mr. Hausner.</i>

395
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,340
<i>Be calm, please.</i>

396
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,480
<i>Please remain where you are.</i>

397
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,940
<i>Everyone remain where they are.</i>

398
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,010
Madam, your phone call to America has gone through.

399
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,010
Oh, thank you.

400
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,830
<i>If you could see how they try
to stay calm while testifying...</i>

401
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:23,930
Most of the stories have nothing to do
with Eichmann as an individual.

402
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,820
But we both knew from the start

403
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,810
that the trial would be more about history
than the deeds of one man.

404
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,230
But it's still dreadful.

405
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,610
Oh, my little girl from far away.

406
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,450
<i>Three minutes are over.</i>

407
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,180
<i>Three minutes already.</i>

408
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,030
This is costing a fortune!
I've got to go.

409
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,210
Yes. See you soon.

410
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,380
<i>Oh, they wanted a central organization,</i>

411
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,080
<i>which would be the spokesman of Hungarian Jewry.</i>

412
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,530
<i>Well, it doesn't matter
at what meeting this was,</i>

413
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,790
<i>but did they say how many members
such a committee should have,</i>

414
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,210
<i>which would be responsible to the Germans?</i>

415
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,930
<i>They told us...</i>

416
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:16,240
<i>that about four or five persons
should constitute that representative body.</i>

417
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
<i>They didn't call it Judenrat.</i>

418
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,270
<i>And, uh, this also calmed us down,</i>

419
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,300
<i>because we knew already...</i>

420
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,020
<i>what was the purpose of the Judenrat.</i>

421
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,630
<i>To what extent...</i>

422
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,390
<i>did you report about the situation
to the communities and the provinces,</i>

423
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,120
<i>those who were deported?</i>

424
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,540
<i>There was no such possibility,</i>

425
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,690
<i>because by the time I obtained this information,</i>

426
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,720
<i>and by the time we realized what Auschwitz was,</i>

427
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,020
<i>uh, the eastern part of Hungary...</i>

428
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,900
<i>and the northeastern part-</i>

429
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,700
<i>this comprised these 300,000 people-</i>

430
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,320
<i>they had received news from us.</i>

431
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,030
<i>They had known the fate,
but what could we have done?</i>

432
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,740
<i>What could we have done?</i>

433
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,420
<i>Remove him from the courtroom. Quickly!</i>

434
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,530
<i>You are a cowardly dog. A dog!</i>

435
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:24,090
<i>Remain seated if you want to stay here.</i>

436
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,030
<i>An officer swears an oath of allegiance.</i>

437
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,940
<i>If he breaks this oath,</i>

438
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,390
<i>then he is a rogue.</i>

439
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,700
<i>I still hold this view.</i>

440
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,240
<i>I have taken an oath here
to tell the truth.</i>

441
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,340
<i>That was how I viewed things then, too:</i>

442
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,150
<i>An oath is an oath.</i>

443
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,600
<i>Do you believe that anyone
who swore allegiance would,</i>

444
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,490
<i>after Hitler's death,</i>

445
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,560
<i>be released from his oath of allegiance?</i>

446
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,400
<i>After Hitler's death?</i>

447
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,170
<i>Of course.
Everyone would automatically be released.</i>

448
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,850
<i>When interrogated by the police you said</i>

449
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,150
<i>that if the Führer had told you
your father was a traitor,</i>

450
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,350
<i>you would have shot him yourself.</i>

451
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,180
- <i>If he had been a traitor, yes...</i>
- <i>No, if the Führer had told you so.</i>

452
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,750
- <i>Would you have shot your own father?</i>
- <i>Assuming he had proven this.</i>

453
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,660
<i>Had he proven it,
I'd have been obliged by my oath.</i>

454
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,850
<i>Was it proven to you
that the Jews had to be exterminated?</i>

455
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,580
<i>I didn't exterminate them.</i>

456
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,490
<i>Did you never feel any conflict</i>

457
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,760
<i>between your duty and your conscience?</i>

458
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,330
<i>One could call it a state of being split.</i>

459
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,780
- <i>Split?</i>
- <i>Yes...</i>

460
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,430
<i>A conscious split state</i>

461
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,070
<i>where one could flee from one side to the other.</i>

462
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,650
- <i>One's conscience was to be abandoned?</i>
- <i>Sorry?</i>

463
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,410
<i>One's personal conscience was to be abandoned?</i>

464
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,480
<i>You could say that.</i>

465
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,750
<i>If there had been more civil courage,</i>

466
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,010
<i>things could have been different.</i>

467
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,440
- <i>Am I right? Answer...</i>
- <i>If civil courage...</i>

468
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,730
<i>had been hierarchically organized,
then yes, absolutely.</i>

469
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,500
<i>So this was not destiny.</i>

470
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,570
<i>It was not inevitable.</i>

471
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,570
<i>It was a question of human behavior.</i>

472
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,800
<i>A question of human behavior.</i>

473
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,210
<i>And of course it was...</i>

474
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,020
<i>It was wartime, upheaval...</i>

475
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,130
<i>Everyone thought, "It's useless to resist..."</i>

476
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,010
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>A drop on a hot stone that evaporates</i>

477
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,810
<i>without purpose or success or...</i>

478
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,160
<i>or failure or anything.</i>

479
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,420
<i>It was connected</i>

480
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,840
<i>to the times, I think.</i>

481
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,210
<i>To the times, how children were raised,</i>

482
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,330
<i>with ideological education,</i>

483
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,710
<i>rigid discipline, that sort of thing.</i>

484
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,460
Eichmann not an anti-Semite? That's nonsense!

485
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,310
You heard him. He was obeying the law.

486
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,990
He'd have obeyed any law.

487
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,030
Oh, please! Anyone in the Party,

488
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,520
let alone the SS,
was a committed and vicious anti-Semite.

489
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,130
He swears he never personally harmed a Jew.

490
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,820
So he claims!

491
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,200
Isn't it interesting

492
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,470
that a man who did everything
a murderous system asked of him,

493
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,150
who even seems eager

494
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,080
to give precise details of his fine work,

495
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,910
that this man insists

496
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,640
he personally has nothing against Jews?

497
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,090
- He's lying!
- False. He is not.

498
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,630
You're falling for this?

499
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,980
He claims he didn't know
where the trains were going.

500
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,120
- You believe that too?
- Knowing that was irrelevant for him.

501
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,700
He transported people to their deaths,

502
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,840
but didn't feel responsible for it.

503
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,190
Once the trains were in motion
his work was done.

504
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,180
So he can say he's free of guilt

505
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,830
despite what happened to the people he transported?

506
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,790
Yes. That's how he sees it.
He's a bureaucrat.

507
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,290
Your quest for truth is admirable,
but this time you've gone too far!

508
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:23,580
But Kurt, you can't deny the huge difference

509
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,810
between the unspeakable horror of the deeds

510
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,960
and the mediocrity of the man.

511
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,310
Don't worry, Rahel.

512
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,340
Hannah and I always argued like this.

513
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,290
I'm just afraid she'll make a lot of people angry.

514
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,360
That's her nature.

515
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,080
- But after finishing our bloody duels...
- We always found a way to make up.

516
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,450
Hey. Kurt, no!

517
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,100
Think of your heart.

518
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,680
I know. I'm not getting any younger.

519
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,860
That's why I wish
you wouldn't leave me so quickly.

520
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,700
I'm never very far from you.

521
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,810
Never.

522
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,810
What's in there?

523
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,610
Transcripts of the trial.

524
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,070
Six tapes of Eichmann's questioning.

525
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,450
I could have them shipped to New York.

526
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,410
I have to start reading at once.

527
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,140
Bring Heinrich along next time.

528
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,690
You're home!

529
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,490
What about your classes?

530
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,180
Canceled! I said it's an emergency.

531
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,860
Thank you, Freddy.

532
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,050
Thank you.

533
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,190
- How good to be home.
- Four pounds.

534
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,570
Can't you see it?

535
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,830
I starved myself for you.

536
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,970
Look at my homework over there.

537
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,620
You're taking a few days off.

538
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,920
Stups, I have 2000 pages to read
before the semester starts.

539
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,800
Don't exaggerate, Frau Professor.

540
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,870
From Mary?

541
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,410
No.

542
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,410
From me.

543
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,490
Stups! That's the wrong pile.

544
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,450
Miller begged me to take over another class.

545
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:38,210
Someone's ill or getting a divorce
or something typically American like that.

546
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,630
My head's spinning as it is.

547
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,160
You have to learn to say no.
But only to others, of course.

548
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,310
Hannah.

549
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,830
Yes?

550
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,830
Here.

551
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,860
Hello, Mr. Shawn.

552
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,400
Uh, she's not in right now.
She should be back soon.

553
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,620
Yes, certainly. I will give her the message.

554
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,310
Well?

555
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,810
That polite Mr. Shawn didn't say as much,

556
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:16,260
but I guess he's curious to know
when you'll deliver the articles.

557
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,600
There's not even a verdict yet.

558
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,910
Yes...

559
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,620
How dare that Mr. Shawn call you at all?

560
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,750
I don't think he can imagine

561
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,440
that so celebrated a writer as you

562
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,050
is so busy fighting her papers
and hasn't written a word.

563
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:36,730
But Monsieur here would have
finished the articles long ago.

564
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,370
Without a doubt.

565
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,760
- Thank you.
- Frau Professor.

566
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,440
You can also use my office.

567
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,090
You are too kind, sir!

568
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,620
You just have to move my pipe-stand.

569
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,850
Your doctor will like that.

570
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,690
People in glass houses...

571
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,050
How can you leave me like that?
No hug, no kiss?

572
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,900
Never disturb a great philosopher
when they're thinking.

573
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,620
But they can't think without kisses.

574
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,440
You can put it here.

575
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,320
- Thank you, Freddy.
- You're welcome.

576
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,780
From Israel.

577
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,810
At least 500 new pages from the court.

578
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,720
I'll sort them for you later.

579
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,400
I'm so lucky to have you, Lotte.

580
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,620
I'd never be such good friends
with my own daughter.

581
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,510
My father always says God gave us family,

582
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:11,230
but thank God we can choose our friends.

583
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,500
Well...

584
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,500
Interesting theory.

585
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,070
- You think I'd have chosen Charlotte?
- Oh, I forgot. She called earlier.

586
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,100
She wanted Heinrich's new number at Bard.

587
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,750
Did you give it to her?

588
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,520
Unfortunately, I couldn't find it.

589
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,620
Careful, Lotte. She's a psychoanalyst
and can probably read your mind...

590
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,380
- Should I take these away again?
- Please.

591
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,460
Thanks.

592
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,730
<i>They slept as if dead.</i>

593
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,890
<i>Someone came in and called out:</i>

594
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,800
<i>Quick now, the SS are coming back.</i>

595
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,370
<i>I had two friends beside me.</i>

596
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,670
<i>Once a week the infamous
Dr. Mengele selection was held.</i>

597
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,820
<i>The rumor that Dr. Mengele had arrived was enough</i>

598
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,460
<i>to spread fear and terror throughout the camp.</i>

599
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:26,650
<i>...confess his guilt...</i>

600

<i>of what I term civil courage,</i>

602
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,320
<i>then some things would have turned out differently.</i>

PHILOSOPHY FACULTY
PROF. DR. M. HEIDEGGER

604
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,420
Miss Arendt.

605
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,680
You say you want me to teach you how to think.

606
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,820
Thinking

607
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,590
is a lonely business.

608
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,540
Every time I even write a sex scene,
I have you horribly on my conscience,

609
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,800
as if you're tugging at my elbow saying, "Stop."

610
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,910
- I have no problem with sex.
- I'm afraid you'll think I'm an exhibitionist or something.

611
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,200
Well, you are.

612
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,160
But you've written your first book
without a hint of memoir.

613
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,080
It's pure fiction, is it?

614
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,350
- Is that a left-handed compliment or just straight criticism?
- No!

615
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,770
I think you've written beautifully balanced sentences,

616
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,420
and I think at times it's hilariously funny.

617
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,810
You have never been this positive.

618
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,310
- Did you hate all my other books?
- Mary!

619
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,870
- Well!
- You can't take a compliment.

620
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,760
- No.
- Hannah!

621
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,140
You are my heroine!

622
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,470
I thank you.
The German Department thanks you.

623
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,210
We all thank you.

624
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,850
Oh, God. Ask him for a raise.

625
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,580
You see,

626
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,690
Western tradition

627
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,950
mistakenly assumes

628
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,210
that the greatest evils of mankind

629
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,440
arise from selfishness.

630
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:18,550
But in our century,
evil has proven to be more radical

631
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,280
than was previously thought.

632
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,690
And we now know

633
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,270
that the truest evil,

634
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,690
the radical evil,

635
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,990
has nothing to do

636
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,710
with selfishness or any such understandable,
sinful motives.

637
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,480
Instead, it is based on the following phenomenon:

638
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:41,660
making human beings superfluous as human beings.

639
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,190
The entire concentration camp system was designed

640
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,110
to convince the prisoners

641
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,950
they were unnecessary

642
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,800
before they were murdered.

643
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,990
In the concentration camps men were taught

644
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,130
that punishment was not connected to a crime,

645
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,970
that exploitation wouldn't profit anyone,

646
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,760
and that work produced no results.

647
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,950
The camp is a place

648
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,410
where every activity and human impulse

649
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,290
is senseless.

650
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:27,010
Where, in other words,
senselessness is daily produced anew.

651
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,930
So, to summarize:

652
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,150
If it is true

653
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,080
that in the final stage of totalitarianism,

654
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,680
an absolute evil emerges,

655
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,180
absolute as it no longer relates to human motives,

656
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,590
then it is equally true

657
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,130
that without it,

658
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,050
without totalitarianism,

659
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,310
we would never have known

660
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,960
the truly radical nature of evil.

661
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,380
What time is it?

662
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,030
The second hour has begun.
You know what that means.

663
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,060
Thank you.

664
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,210
- Thank you.
- May I ask you a personal question?

665
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,470
You can try.

666
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,850
Were you in a camp?

667
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,690
I had the opportunity

668
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,070
to spend some time in a French detention camp
called Gurs.

669
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,480
But weren't the French on your side?

670
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,670
In the beginning. They took us in.

671
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,510
But when the Germans invaded France
on May 10, 1940,

672
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,310
our French friends put us into detention camps.

673
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,840
We became a new kind of human being,

674
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,460
put into concentration camps by our enemies

675
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,410
and into detention camps by our friends.

676
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,640
How did you escape?

677
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,780
My husband and I were lucky
to receive a visa to America.

678
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,230
A visa. Not a passport.
We were stateless for 18 years.

679
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,580
And what was your first impression of America?

680
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,980
Paradise.

681
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,160
Do you understand?

682
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,700
Hannah!

683
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,230
Just a moment, please.

684
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,610
How did you find-

685
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,220
Who found-

686
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,870
Charlotte.

687
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,670
My class. They are waiting.

688
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,630
I'll take over.

689
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,280
No, but, Mary, it's-

690
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,000
It's advanced German class.

691
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,720
They will be delighted to speak English again.
Go. Go. Go.

692
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,980
Dearest.

693
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,200
Don't cry.

694
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,660
I spoke to the doctor.

695
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,580
He said you only have a fifty percent chance.

696
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,330
Don't forget the other fifty percent.

697
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,400
What were you speaking to your students about?

698
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,170
About us.

699
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,020
I understand.

700
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,440
Thank you for the message.

701
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,940
Yes.

702
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,930
- Hannah?
- Yes.

703
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,080
They're hanging Eichmann.

704
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,340
- And so they should.
- They should?

705
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,300
But that's not justice.

706
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,400
The punishment's not enough?

707
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,790
The punishment can only give
an appearance of justice.

708
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,940
There are no real punishments for his deeds.

709
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,820
That's why it'd be braver to let him live.

710
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,580
Now the verdict's in,

711
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,380
you can stop avoiding your <i>New Yorker</i> friends.

712
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,330
Not until you've recovered.

713
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,410
You haven't written a line
since my slight collapse.

714
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,090
Wrong. I've made some notes.

715
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,360
A brain aneurysm isn't a "slight collapse" either.

716
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,200
You could have died.

717
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,160
But Eichmann is a monster.

718
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,690
And when I say monster,
I don't mean Satan.

719
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:37,030
You don't need to be smart or powerful
to behave like a monster.

720
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,020
You're being too simplistic.

721
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,710
What's new about the Eichmann phenomenon

722
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,480
is that there are so many just like him.

723
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,170
He's a terrifyingly normal human being.

724
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,660
Not all normal people were head of department 4B-4

725
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,320
at the Reich Security Office

726
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,610
charged with the extermination of Europe's Jews.

727
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,580
You're right there.

728
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,150
But he considered himself an obedient servant of Germany

729
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,570
who had to obey the Führer's orders.

730
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,250
"My loyalty is my honor."

731
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,140
The Führer's orders became the law.

732
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,130
He didn't feel guilty in the sense of the indictment.

733
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,580
He behaved according to the law.

734
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,150
It's been proven that Eichmann pursued the Final Solution

735
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,390
even after Himmler had long since forbidden it.

736
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,730
And why? He wanted to finish <i>his</i> work.

737
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,100
Don't you see that every law,

738
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,400
every commandment was turned upside down.

739
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,980
It was not "Thou shalt not kill,"

740
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,670
but "Thou must kill."

741
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,820
To do your duty,
goodness was a temptation you had to resist.

742
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,080
Great.

743
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,240
So no one is responsible or guilty.

744
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,030
Every sane person knows murder is wrong.

745
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:47,760
Then most Europeans,
including many of our friends,

746
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,560
- went insane overnight.
- Heidegger was your friend.

747
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,410
- Hans!
- He wasn't our only disappointment.

748
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,060
You can't write like this for the <i>New Yorker.</i>

749
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,540
- You cannot!
- Hans, the glass door!

750
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,700
It's all too abstract. And confusing.

751
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,840
They don't want a philosophy lesson.

752
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,800
They have to know what the Nazi Eichmann did.

753
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:12,690
Oh, Hemingway was just an ambulance driver, Thomas.

754
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,980
As a writer, he was nothing more
than the premature ejaculator of the 20th century.

755
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,520
Oh, you just hate him
because he wrote like a real man.

756
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,130
- Do you want to forgive him?
- That's absurd.

757
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,050
I'm glad he'll be hanged.

758
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,500
So, here's to Heinrich's recovery.

759
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,390
- Well, come on.
- Yeah. To Heinrich.

760
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,420
- Come over, please.
- To his health. We drink to his health.

761
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,000
- A very good idea.
- Here, Hans. To Heinrich.

762
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,070
Cheers.

763
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,720
Stups, here's to you.

764
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,560
No more kissing. Except for me.

765
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,900
Why was Hans so furious with me?

766
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,200
He's in love with you.
Has been ever since he was a student.

767
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,930
Nonsense.

768
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,760
He hates Heidegger more for stealing your heart
than for joining the Party.

769
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,530
Then he should hate you even more.

770
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,870
Maybe he does.

771
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,210
Celebrating my health

772
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,280
is exhausting.

773
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,510
I'm off to bed.

774
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,390
<i>Thinking</i>

775
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,500
<i>does not bring knowledge,</i>

776
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,000
<i>as do the sciences.</i>

777
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,870
Thinking

778
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,680
does not produce usable,

779
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,410
practical wisdom.

780
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,750
Thinking...

781
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,780
does not solve the riddles of the universe.

782
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,810
Thinking does not

783
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,730
endow us with the power to act.

784
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,940
We live

785
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,330
because we are alive.

786
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,510
And we think...

787
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,390
because we are thinking beings.

788
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,000
<i>We are so used to considering</i>

789
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,000
reason and passion as opposites,

790
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,150
that the idea of passionate thinking,

791
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,720
where thinking and being alive
are one and the same,

792
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,940
is terrifying for me.

793
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,470
- Excuse me.
- No. Hannah!

794
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:37,850
Tolstoy wrote <i>War and Peace</i> in less time.

795
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,360
- Hello?
- Mrs. Arendt.

796
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,430
Bill Shawn here.

797
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,350
Is this a good time to talk?
I mean, are you busy?

798
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,850
Yes. Why?

799
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:31,460
- <i>Can I be of any help?</i>
- How?

800
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:36,610
Perhaps if you've finished the first article,
I could have a look.

801
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,950
Mr. Shawn, I don't deliver in pieces.

802
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:44,820
O-Of course. I do realize what
an enormous task this is...

803
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,510
and wanted to let you know how much
we're looking forward to the results.

804
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:52,390
Well, then perhaps I should get back to it
instead of chatting on the phone.

805
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:55,230
Or did you want to pressure me with a deadline?

806
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:58,990
No, of course not.
Take as long as you need.

807
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,530
<i>Thank you.</i>

808
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,680
Bye.

809
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,390
What's the matter with you?
Have you fallen in love with her, or what?

810
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,430
Oh, God, no.

811
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:34,050
<i>You claim you weren't a normal recipient of orders.</i>

812
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,160
<i>You thought about what you were doing.</i>

813
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,000
<i>Didn't you say that?</i>

814
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,390
- <i>I don't believe so, no.</i>
- <i>You didn't think about it?</i>

815
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,990
- <i>Sorry?</i>
- <i>You didn't think about it?</i>

816
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,110
<i>You were an imbecile?</i>

817
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,250
- <i>You didn't think at all?</i>
- <i>Think?</i>

818
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,360
<i>Yes.</i>

819
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:51,990
<i>Of course I thought about what I was doing.</i>

820
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,520
<i>You were not an imbecile?</i>

821
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,690
Are you sure you can go?

822
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,640
You've got everyone so worried,
they'll have a wheelchair waiting.

823
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,030
I'm sure some lovely women will be very eager

824
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,170
to push you around.

825
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,820
No one can push me around like you.

826
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,830
Lotte...

827
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,710
Take good care of her.

828
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,640
Thanks.

829
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,910
Listen to this.

830
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,100
I've changed the paragraph.

831
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,280
"Evil is supposed to be something demonic.

832
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,810
Its incarnation is Satan.

833
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,390
But in the case of Eichmann,

834
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:54,690
one could find no such trace of satanic 'greatness.'

835
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:57,420
He was simply unable to think."

836
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:00,600
- That's great.
- It's better, right?

837
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,790
Yes...

838
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,210
<i>Voilà, monsieur.</i>

839
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,930
"From a humdrum life without significance and consequence,

840
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,230
the wind had blown Adolf Eichmann into history."

841
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:46,410
Fascinating choice. It begins so poetically.

842
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,530
A bit over the top.

843
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:50,640
"A leaf in the whirlwind of time,

844
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,170
he was blown into the marching columns
of the 1,000-year Reich."

845
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,810
Twice in a row with a wind metaphor?

846
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,240
But listen to this.

847
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,380
"It was sheer thoughtlessness.

848
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,040
Something by no means identical with stupidity...

849
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,030
that predisposed him to become...

850
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,220
one of the greatest criminals of the 20th century.

851
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,750
He was simply unable to think."

852
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,470
That's original.

853
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,430
This here is also quite original.

854
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,930
They'll have our heads for this:

855
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,390
"Wherever Jews lived,

856
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,420
there were recognized Jewish leaders,

857
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,420
and this leadership, almost without exception,

858
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,900
cooperated in one way or another,
for one reason or another,

859
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:37,370
with the Nazis.

860
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,550
The whole truth is...

861
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,970
that if the Jewish people had really been
unorganized and leaderless,

862
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,350
there would have been chaos
and plenty of misery,

863
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,430
but the total number of victims
would hardly have been...

864
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:52,190
between four and a half
and six million people."

865
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,720
Jewish leaders testified at the trial.
It had to be mentioned.

866
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,520
- She's blaming the victims.
- That's not true, Fran.

867
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,170
She clearly makes a distinction
between the powerlessness of the victims...

868
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,620
and the dubious choices
of some of their leaders.

869
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,740
"Clearly"? Don't exaggerate.

870
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,920
The whole section is only 10 pages
out of almost 300.

871
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,650
Them's fighting words, Bill.

872
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,000
You better make sure
she's got her facts straight,

873
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,140
or we'll be needing bodyguards-

874
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,260
for her and for us.

875
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,290
She doesn't strike me as someone
who's off on the facts.

876
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,670
But as for the grammar-

877
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,850
What you have written is simply brilliant.

878
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:39,310
I suggest that it be broken up
into five articles.

879
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,450
- Five?
- If I give it that much space,

880
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,800
it will entail very few changes.

881
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,400
I spoke with your editor, and he told me
the book will come out directly afterwards.

882
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:51,400
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

883
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,980
- Shall we?
- Sure.

884
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,270
This is Greek, right?

885
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:08,680
<i>"Einai."</i> It means "to be,"
in the sense of existence.

886
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,710
But, of course, you realize that most
of our readers don't understand Greek.

887
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,000
They should learn.

888
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,230
There is really only one section...

889
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,380
that-

890
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,190
worries us a bit.

891
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:34,490
Oh, today you say "us," and not "me"?

892
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,870
Invoking your army, Mr. Shawn?

893
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,870
Yes.

894
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,280
Maybe I am.

895
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,420
It's this description of the Jewish leaders.

896
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,390
Their relationship with Eichmann's office
was very important.

897
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:51,040
- I think I made that quite clear.
- Yes, of course,

898
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,990
but you do offer a kind of interpretation
of your own...

899
01:07:56,070 --> 01:08:00,640
- that might be- that might disturb just a bit.
- That is incorrect.

900
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,590
I purposely did not attempt to analyze...

901
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,710
or to explain their behavior.

902
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,390
"To a Jew,

903
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:15,070
this role of the Jewish leaders
in the destruction of their own people...

904
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,840
is undoubtedly the darkest chapter
of the whole dark story."

905
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,940
Now that could count as a kind of interpretation.

906
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,590
But it's a fact.

907
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,280
- Finally.
- I can't wait to read it.

908
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,740
How do you like it?

909
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,390
"How"?

910
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:02,500
"How" is an assumption.
You should ask me <i>if</i> I like it.

911
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,050
<i>You have no right to bring these issues
out in public.</i>

912
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,630
<i>You don't know what you're talking about.
I will cancel-</i>

913
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,850
"Only 10 pages."

914
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,930
That makes a hundred phone calls per page.

915
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,380
So far.

916
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,490
<i>...is crap!</i>

917
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,860
Just ignore them...

918
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,700
You'll drive yourself crazy.

919
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,890
But Shawn's response in the <i>New Yorker</i>
is very convincing.

920
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,920
- Should I send it to you?
- What response?

921
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,460
<i>To that vicious article in</i>
The New York Times.

922
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,150
Oh, you mean that!

923
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,830
Forget it.

924
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,140
<i>Tell me how Heinrich is doing.</i>

925
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,280
Charlotte cooks for him every evening.

926
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:28,860
Please tell her that Heinrich
can only eat meat twice a week.

927
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,210
Yes.

928
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,190
Hello... My darling.

929
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,690
- <i>You're all the rage around here.</i>
- Hello, Stups.

930
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,610
Let's not waste time on that.

931
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,530
<i>The Israeli prosecutor is flying here</i>

932
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,950
<i>to speak to survivors in New York.</i>

933
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:49,020
Listen to the <i>Daily News</i> headline:

934
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,010
"Prosecutor Answers...

935
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,770
Hannah Arendt's Bizarre Defense of Eichmann."

936
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,230
- <i>On the frontpage!</i>
- All just a tempest in a tea cup.

937
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:02,190
This is no tempest. It's a hurricane, Hannah.

938
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,150
<i>Tell me what's for dinner.</i>

939
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,140
Spinach,

940
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,060
whole wheat bread and water.

941
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,870
<i>It's good you're not here in New York.</i>

942
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,050
They are all accusing you

943
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,590
of having defended Eichmann, Hannah.

944
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:22,770
Stups, it's just a few articles in a magazine.

945
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,080
<i>My dear,</i>

946
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,190
you are really naive.

947
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,210
She thinks her sarcasm will protect her.

948
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,510
It only shows me her vulnerability.

949
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:49,000
She tries to detach herself from the story

950
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,150
but ends up bringing it closer to her.

951
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,370
Wrong, completely wrong.

952
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,680
- It's not about her.
- But where is she...

953
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,980
when she writes about this Nazi and his crimes?

954
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,930
She has the right to feel pain,
and to show it.

955
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,890
That would be shameless.
And quite out of character.

956
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:12,650
You have to be aware that
if she represses so much pain,

957
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,110
it will eventually overwhelm her.

958
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,070
And you too.

959
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,490
Professor Heidegger is here for you.

960
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,400
Thanks.

961
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,710
Time is mysterious:

962
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,440
it can return and transform everything.

963
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,900
As I saw you again and you stood there
in your beautiful dress

964
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:21,540
I knew that this would be the beginning
of something new for us.

965
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,700
Please stop a moment.

966
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,610
I wasn't sure if I should come.

967
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:32,060
There is no greater invitation to love
than to love first:

968
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,440
<i>"Nulla est enim maior</i>

969
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,980
<i>ad amorem invitatio quam prevenire amando."</i>

970
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,510
St. Augustine.

971
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,660
Your last letter grieved me.

972
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,040
How could you believe all that slander?

973
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:52,300
After I read your first rector's speech
I was sick to my stomach.

974
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,950
I couldn't believe it.

975
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,250
The man who'd taught me to think
was behaving like a fool.

976
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:03,660
I know they were bitter years for you,
full of misery, hardship and helplessness.

977
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,820
But they weren't easy for me either.

978
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,580
Martin, I came here because I want to understand.

979
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,620
Hannah...

980
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,920
I'm like the lad who dreams
and knows not what he does.

981
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:23,060
I have no talent nor experience with politics,

982
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,160
but now I have learned and in the future

983
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:30,470
I want to learn even more.

984
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,610
Then why not bring this to an end
and explain yourself in public?

985
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,570
You're the toast of the town.

986
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,460
Mary. Hello.

987
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,410
Oh, my goodness, it's good to see you. Here.

988
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:07,760
- Oh, beautiful.
- They're from Jim.

989
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,790
He sends his love.
He can't wait to meet you.

990
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:14,010
- Well, when will I finally meet him?
- Well, we'll sort something out.

991
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,590
- How was the trip?
- Oh, my goodness. It was great, but I'm starving.

992
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:23,150
You should come to the talk.

993
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,950
You can't do that.

994
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:31,600
- You have to follow the rules.
- Oh, why? Nobody else does.

995
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,600
But what do you want me to discuss?

996
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,730
There has not been one single critique
of what I actually wrote.

997
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,420
Did you really have no idea
there would be such a furious reaction?

998
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:50,110
Oh, Hannah. Not even a little?

999
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:53,110
You did take a certain tone,
not the usual one.

1000
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:56,290
Untrue. The tone is quite normal for me.

1001
01:15:56,370 --> 01:16:00,210
Well, for you, yes, but no one's ever dared to be
the least bit ironic about the situation.

1002
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:03,050
- You are trying to distract me.
- Never.

1003
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,730
See?

1004
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,390
I'm telling you, it is useless.

1005
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,990
I'm sure half of them
haven't even read the book.

1006
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,530
Exactly. And that is why
you should speak publicly about it.

1007
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,530
- No.
- Yes. Expose their hypocrisy.

1008
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,600
Force them to a real discussion.

1009
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,290
I refuse to explain myself to these dimwits.

1010
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,030
In the silent dialogue with myself...

1011
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:42,570
I am alone.

1012
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,600
- You have a very good memory.
- <i>Ja.</i>

1013
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,900
Terrible accent.

1014
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:51,940
If I win, do you promise to answer me
a terribly personal question?

1015
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,740
You won't win-

1016
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,930
If I can promise you anything.

1017
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,760
So-

1018
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,520
Was he the greatest love of your life?

1019
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,440
- Who?
- You know.

1020
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,360
Your secret king of thinking.

1021
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,890
No. He was not.

1022
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:19,310
That is Heinrich.

1023
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:22,460
All right then. Uh, fill in the blank.

1024
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,450
"Heidegger was the greatest-

1025
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,800
in my entire life."

1026
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:31,520
Oh, come on. I won't tell anybody.

1027
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,980
There are some things...

1028
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:38,320
that are stronger than a single human being.

1029
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:46,420
And did you read the book? You read it?
I can't believe it. I bet she doesn't even show up.

1030
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,380
The worst mistake was to criticize the Jews...

1031
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,520
while the mass murderer
was sitting there in the dock.

1032
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:54,680
Yeah, and to describe this murderer as a clown.

1033
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,130
A foolish little servant of Hitler
who didn't have a mind of his own.

1034
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,860
And yet she says he's normal.

1035
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,470
That's Hannah Arendt.
All cleverness and no feeling.

1036
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,390
I love that line in your article, Norman.

1037
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:08,470
I trust you've all read Norman's incisive rebuttal.

1038
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,270
- What's it called?
- "The Perversity of Brilliance."

1039
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:14,110
"The Perversity of Brilliance."
You were more fair than she had any right to expect.

1040
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,990
Now, of course, she's shocked.

1041
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,560
Oh, nonsense. She lives
for such intellectual sensations.

1042
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,970
And she's far too smart not to realize
the scandal she would provoke...

1043
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,940
by attacking the Jewish leaders.

1044
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,470
- Exactly.
- Last time we met, you were begging her to teach at your department.

1045
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,310
Well, won't make that mistake again.

1046
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:34,880
You're all treating Hannah Arendt
like a suspect in a police court...

1047
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,990
instead of a respected political thinker.

1048
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:42,030
Please, Bill, no one has attacked
Hannah Eichmann's character.

1049
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:45,100
Your review of Hannah's work
proves that you're too hysterical...

1050
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,060
to write a single coherent sentence.

1051
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:51,960
And that charming little slip of the tongue
proves that Lionel has lost his power of speech as well.

1052
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:56,000
You're so smitten with Arendt's European pretensions.

1053
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,850
She could defend Himmler himself,
and you'd go along.

1054
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,030
Oh, down, Norman. Down.
Your fangs are showing.

1055
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:03,250
Almost no one here has even read the articles.

1056
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,910
Some of us tried, but couldn't bear to go on.

1057
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,520
Well, of course you couldn't.
Hannah doesn't write soap operas.

1058
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,550
And, of course, it would be too much
to expect Ms. Arendt...

1059
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:13,320
to report on Eichmann's actual trial.

1060
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,580
She had to come up with something
more interesting than that.

1061
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,280
Who does she think she is? Aristotle?

1062
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:22,580
Unlike all of you,
Hannah was actually forced into exile.

1063
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,720
She was held in a brutal detention camp.

1064
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:26,680
Isn't it admirable that she is the only one...

1065
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,640
who can discuss this subject
without beating her breast?

1066
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:33,480
And why do you think that is?
Because she's smarter than people with feelings?

1067
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,930
Well, in your case, Norman,
being smarter is easy.

1068
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,360
She's more courageous than you are.

1069
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:42,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

1070
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:47,800
there will be plenty of time for discussion
after our speakers have presented.

1071
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,180
Settle down so we can begin.

1072
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,320
Ms. Arendt?

1073
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,400
Siegfried!

1074
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,950
- You remember me?
- Of course.

1075
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,800
You were in Kurt Blumenfeld's Zionist group in Berlin.

1076
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,250
It's hard to believe that you were once a Zionist.

1077
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:13,400
The Israeli secret service didn't send you
to discuss my youthful folly.

1078
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:18,270
I'm here to request that you stop the publication
of your book about Adolf Eichmann.

1079
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:22,190
The State of Israel bought four plane tickets
to tell me that?

1080
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,910
You must have money to burn

1081
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,370
to waste it like that.

1082
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,090
It's incomprehensible that you, a Jew,

1083
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,940
could tell such lies about your people.

1084
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,980
You describe a book I never wrote.

1085
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,010
A book that will never be allowed in Israel.

1086
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:43,960
And won't appear anywhere else either
if you have any decency left.

1087
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,570
You ban books,

1088
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,490
and lecture me about decency!

1089
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,360
- I'm warning you.
- Wrong. You're threatening me.

1090
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:59,860
We wanted to ask Kurt Blumenfeld
to reason with you,

1091
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,160
but his doctor said he's dying.

1092
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,890
And we didn't want to be that cruel.

1093
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,110
I thought you knew.

1094
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:56,230
Rivka, why didn't you let me know sooner?

1095
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:58,460
Kurt didn't want that.

1096
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:22,110
Kurt.

1097
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,610
What are you doing to me, my dear!

1098
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,250
This time you've gone too far.

1099
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,130
Let's not argue today.

1100
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,590
The cruelty...

1101
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,510
and ruthlessness you show.

1102
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:03,510
You won't think that when you've read it.

1103
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,960
I tried to.

1104
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:13,220
Since when did you listen to others about me?

1105
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,410
You have no love for Israel?

1106
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,780
No love for your own people?

1107
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,690
I can't laugh with you anymore.

1108
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:34,990
But Kurt, you know me.
I've never loved any people.

1109
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:38,410
Why should I love the Jews?

1110
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,410
I only love my friends.

1111
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,740
That's the only love I'm capable of.

1112
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,620
Kurt...

1113
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,720
I love you.

1114
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,270
These think your articles are terrific.

1115
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:49,490
These think you're absolutely wrong
and should never have written a word.

1116
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:52,130
Anyone I know?

1117
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,780
Yes. A few friends.

1118
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,890
And these want you dead.

1119
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,320
Some of them are quite colorful.

1120
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,810
I'll get it.

1121
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,600
- Oh, Lotte...
- Come in.

1122
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,950
- Am I too late?
- No.

1123
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:16,370
Good.

1124
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,080
Oh, Hannah, I didn't know...

1125
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,430
Lore, how nice to see you.

1126
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,770
I came to help Lotte.

1127
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:32,460
No, no, first come and sit with me.

1128
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,640
Here.

1129
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,710
You were here yesterday?

1130
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:45,820
I didn't want to leave Lotte here alone.

1131
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,200
- Thanks.
- It goes without saying.

1132
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,580
- How's Hans?
- He...

1133
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,070
Why didn't he come?

1134
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:57,030
He doesn't feel well.

1135
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:59,920
Oh, God!

1136
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,900
- What does it say?
- Oh, nothing.

1137
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,580
Come here, Lotte. Read it to us.

1138
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,420
"Your picture is of a face hard as rock...

1139
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,800
and cold as ice in the North Pole.

1140
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,950
Contempt hovers on the lips,
and an iron brutality is seen in the eyes.

1141
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:29,020
I felt that that page
on which your picture is on...

1142
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,780
contaminated the whole of the review.

1143
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:37,120
I put on a glove. I felt it revolting
to put my bare hand on that page.

1144
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,000
Ripped it out from the review,

1145
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,340
and not wanting to give it the...

1146
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:45,150
dignity of burning it,

1147
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:47,490
I threw it in the garbage can.

1148
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,900
I do not carry hatred in my heart,

1149
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:53,360
nor do I take delight in vengeance,

1150
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:56,170
but this I know:

1151
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:59,350
that the souls of our six million martyrs,
whom you desecrated,

1152
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,650
will swarm about you day and night.

1153
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,700
They will give you no rest.

1154
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:08,690
It cannot be otherwise."

1155
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,390
It's sweet of you...

1156
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,570
to stay with me this evening.

1157
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,250
You had such a bad day.

1158
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:52,570
When I was a child my father was very sick.

1159
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:55,600
He died when I was seven.

1160
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:00,410
After a long fight.

1161
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,170
I only knew him as a sick man.

1162
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,740
And in the dream where he appears

1163
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,660
he is healthy.

1164
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,460
He's handsome.

1165
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:21,610
He looks at me and he says:
I love you.

1166
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:44,340
- What are you doing with the letters?
- Answering them.

1167
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,030
No, you will not.

1168
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,750
If you start, this will never end.

1169
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,360
I've hurt these people badly.
I have to take that seriously.

1170
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:58,310
We've been here 20 years
and I'm not packing my bags ever again.

1171
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,190
They won't kick you out
because of a few articles!

1172
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,190
Are you so sure about that?

1173
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,060
The nice, old man on the 10th floor
said to give you this right away.

1174
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:18,170
Thank you, Freddy.

1175
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,610
DAMN YOU TO HELL,
YOU NAZI WHORE

1176
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,730
We've discussed it at length
and arrived at a unanimous decision.

1177
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:56,800
We respectfully advise you
to relinquish your teaching obligations.

1178
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,680
Under no circumstances will I give up my classes.

1179
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,290
You may not have enough students
who are willing to study with you.

1180
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:08,090
Perhaps you have not been in communication
with your own students,

1181
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,810
but I'm entirely oversubscribed at the moment.

1182
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,770
And because of the extraordinary support of the students,

1183
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:18,530
I've decided to accept their invitation,
and I will speak publicly...

1184
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:21,910
about the hysterical reactions to my report.

1185
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:25,870
That's Hannah Arendt, all arrogance and no feeling.

1186
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:04,420
Perhaps just for today you will allow me
to smoke immediately.

1187
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,270
When the <i>New Yorker</i> sent me...

1188
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:28,720
to report on the trial of Adolf Eichmann,

1189
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,800
I assumed...

1190
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,220
that a courtroom had only one interest-

1191
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,750
to fulfill the demands of justice.

1192
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:43,200
This was not a simple task,

1193
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,000
because the court that tried Eichmann
was confronted with a crime...

1194
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,460
it could not find in the law books...

1195
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:56,480
and a criminal whose like was unknown
in any court prior to the Nuremberg trials.

1196
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:01,290
But still, the court...

1197
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:07,470
had to define Eichmann
as a man on trial for his deeds.

1198
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:10,780
There was no system on trial,

1199
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,190
no history, no ism,

1200
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,950
not even anti-Semitism,

1201
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,950
but only a person.

1202
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:24,020
The trouble with a Nazi criminal like Eichmann...

1203
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:29,510
was that he insisted on renouncing
all personal qualities...

1204
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:34,240
as if there was nobody left to be
either punished or forgiven.

1205
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:38,420
He protested time and again,

1206
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,920
contrary to the prosecution's assertions,

1207
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,870
that he had never done anything
out of his own initiative,

1208
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:51,480
that he had no intentions whatsoever,
good or bad,

1209
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:55,820
that he had only obeyed orders.

1210
01:33:57,130 --> 01:34:01,010
This... typical Nazi plea...

1211
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,410
makes it clear that the greatest evil in the world...

1212
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,790
is the evil committed by nobodies-

1213
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,720
evil committed by men without motive,

1214
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,780
without convictions,
without wicked hearts or demonic wills.

1215
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:20,820
By human beings who refuse to be persons.

1216
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,920
And it is this phenomenon...

1217
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:29,490
that I have called the banality of evil.

1218
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:32,340
Ms. Arendt.

1219
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:36,330
You're avoiding the most important part
of the controversy.

1220
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:38,550
You claimed that less Jews would have died...

1221
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,750
if their leaders hadn't cooperated.

1222
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:44,390
This issue came up in the trial.
I reported on it,

1223
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:47,350
and I had to clarify
the role of those Jewish leaders...

1224
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:50,580
who participated directly in Eichmann's activities.

1225
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,830
You blame the Jewish people
for their own destruction.

1226
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,450
I never blamed the Jewish people!

1227
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,480
Resistance was impossible.

1228
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,700
But perhaps...

1229
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:10,970
there is something in between resistance...

1230
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,390
and cooperation.

1231
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,070
And only in that sense do I say...

1232
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:22,490
that maybe some of the Jewish leaders
might have behaved differently.

1233
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:28,710
It is profoundly important...

1234
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:30,970
to ask these questions,

1235
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,540
because the role of the Jewish leaders...

1236
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,350
gives the most striking insight...

1237
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,760
into the totality of the moral collapse...

1238
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:44,490
that the Nazis caused
in respectable European society.

1239
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:49,520
And not only in Germany,
but in almost all countries.

1240
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,360
Not only among the persecutors.

1241
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,890
But also among the victims.

1242
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,570
Yes?

1243
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:04,610
The persecution was aimed at the Jews.

1244
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:09,910
Why do you describe Eichmann's offenses
as crimes against humanity?

1245
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,520
Because Jews are human,

1246
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:19,500
the very status the Nazis tried to deny them.

1247
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:25,040
A crime against them is by definition
a crime against humanity.

1248
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,600
I am, of course, as you know, a Jew.

1249
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:33,140
And I've been attacked for being a self-hating Jew...

1250
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:37,060
who defends Nazis and scorns her own people.

1251
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,660
This is not an argument.

1252
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:45,690
That is a character assassination.

1253
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:50,080
I wrote no defense of Eichmann.

1254
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,340
But I did try to reconcile...

1255
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:54,410
the shocking mediocrity of the man...

1256
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:57,030
with his staggering deeds.

1257
01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:02,250
Trying to understand is not the same as forgiveness.

1258
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:05,970
I see it as my responsibility to understand.

1259
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:10,970
It is the responsibility of anyone
who dares to put pen to paper on the subject.

1260
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:15,610
Since Socrates and Plato,

1261
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,800
we usually call thinking...

1262
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,790
"to be engaged in that silent dialogue
between me and myself."

1263
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:28,440
In refusing to be a person,
Eichmann utterly surrendered...

1264
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,740
that single most defining human quality:

1265
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:35,190
that of being able to think.

1266
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:41,870
And consequently, he was no longer capable
of making moral judgments.

1267
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,950
This inability to think...

1268
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:48,710
created the possibility for many ordinary men...

1269
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:51,740
to commit evil deeds on a gigantic scale,

1270
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,320
the like of which one had never seen before.

1271
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,080
It is true.

1272
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:01,530
I have considered these questions
in a philosophical way.

1273
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:06,410
The manifestation of the wind of thought...

1274
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:08,830
is not knowledge,

1275
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:13,510
but the ability to tell right from wrong,

1276
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,470
beautiful from ugly.

1277
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:18,620
And I hope...

1278
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:24,350
that thinking gives people the strength...

1279
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:29,180
to prevent catastrophes in these rare moments...

1280
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,910
when the chips are down.

1281
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,630
Thank you.

1282
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:29,890
Ms. Arendt.

1283
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,430
Could we please-

1284
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:35,760
Hans, if I'd known you were here...

1285
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,950
I came...

1286
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,100
in the insane hope you would listen to reason.

1287
01:39:44,110 --> 01:39:46,400
But you will never change.

1288
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:51,590
Hannah, between your arrogance

1289
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:56,780
and your ignorance,
your hopeless ignorance about Jewish affairs,

1290
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:59,040
you turn a court trial

1291
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,880
into a philosophy lesson.

1292
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,680
Hans, not now. I'm exhausted.

1293
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:08,900
You behave like a superior German intellectual
who looks down on us Jews.

1294
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:13,830
And you accuse us of being accomplices to the Shoah.

1295
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:20,310
You never accepted that the Germans
shamefully betrayed you.

1296
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:24,070
They kicked you out
and would have killed you if they could.

1297
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:27,720
Your friend Eichmann was responsible
for the transports from Gurs.

1298
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,100
If you hadn't been lucky enough
to escape on time...

1299
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,600
you'd have shared the same fate
as the women who stayed.

1300
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:35,900
Stop!

1301
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,510
They were all deported. All deported to...

1302
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:42,160
Stop it, Hans.

1303
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:52,560
As of today...

1304
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:55,750
I am finished with Heidegger's favorite student.

1305
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,270
Everyone is trying to prove me wrong.

1306
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,080
But no one noticed my one real mistake.

1307
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:42,410
Evil cannot be both banal and radical at once.

1308
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:46,520
Evil is only ever extreme.

1309
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:49,710
It's never radical.

1310
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:56,230
Only good can be profound and radical.

1311
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,640
Would you have written about the trial
if you'd known what would happen?

1312
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,160
Yes.

1313
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,380
I would have written about it.

1314
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:30,640
Maybe I had to find out
who my real friends were.

1315
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,210
Kurt was your friend.
He still would be.

1316
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:38,970
Kurt was my family.
