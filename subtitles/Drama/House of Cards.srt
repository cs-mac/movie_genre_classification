1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,672
Stay, girl.

2
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
All right. Carry on, Burnett.

3
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,914
All things pass. Nothing lasts for ever.

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,632
She was a good bitch.

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,591
She had a good life, and there are some things
one prefers to do oneself.

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,755
Actually, that's a service one would like
to be available on the National Health.

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,037
Or indeed compulsory.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,556
Well, compulsory for some.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,592
<i>The young king there</i>

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,077
<i>under the watchful eye of the Prime Minister,</i>

11
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,994
<i>his guide and mentor in so many ways.</i>

12
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,632
What a rigmarole!

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,031
A full state funeral now.

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,193
The woman simply hung around too long.

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,312
Better a quick exit than clinging
to the wreckage of a lost career.

16
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,072
Some people seem to lack all sense of timing.

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,356
<i>The Prime Minister...</i>
<i>clearly moved at the passing</i>

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,514
<i>of Britain's longest-serving</i>
<i>and first woman prime minister.</i>

19
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,149
<i>Speaking earlier today, he said...</i>

20
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,678
<i>A remarkable life</i>
<i>and a remarkable and inspiring career.</i>

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,631
<i>This is and will remain a momentous day</i>
<i>in the history of our great country.</i>

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,349
- What else could I say?
- Certainly not the truth.

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,076
They'll ask for a statue
on Parliament Square next!

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,274
I want to erase that woman
from the public memory, Elizabeth.

25
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,909
I want to wipe her off the board.

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,790
I want to be the greatest prime minister
since Churchill.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,071
You will be, Francis.

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,235
I want to do something about Europe
before I go. I've left my mark on England.

29
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,869
I want to leave my mark on the world.

30
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,314
- Over here, sir.
- Over here, sir.

31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,749
- Thank you, sir.
- One more before you go.

32
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,675
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,832
Ah, Prime Minister!

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,113
Right, sir, this one first,
then this one, and that's the Cyprus file.

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,470
I thought you might like
to glance through the paper.

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,916
Thank you, Barry.
That's very thoughtful of you

37
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,118
People are so very unappreciative, aren't they?

38
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,275
They do not understand what I have done
and what I may do for my country.

39
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,151
Or the burdens you've had to bear
for their sake. They understand nothing.

40
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,678
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
to have a thankless child!"

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,834
Francis, this afternoon you said,
"Before I go..."

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,390
You've never said that before.

43
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,993
We all have to go sooner or later, Elizabeth.

44
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>Daddy.</i>

45
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,199
Daddy!

46
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,192
But not yet.

47
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,635
No, not yet.
Far too many things I want to do first.

48
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,315
It's time you considered your own needs.

49
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,271
Not what you can do for your country,
but what your country can do for you.

50
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,909
We need a little pension plan.

51
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,549
There's a man I'd like you to meet.

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,713
His name is Nures. He's a Turkish Cypriot.

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,395
He's given generously to the party funds.

54
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,916
He genuinely wants to help.

55
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,437
- I think he's one of us.
- Thank you, Elizabeth.

56
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,554
How do you feel about me now?
Like a force of nature, perhaps?

57
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,191
I've been here so long now that,
love me or hate me,

58
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,956
it's hard for you to imagine
anyone else in my place.

59
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,193
Isn't it?

60
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,671
<i>But there are some who dream of little else.</i>

61
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,312
<i>My honourable friends, of course.</i>
<i>My loyal ministers, my cabinet.</i>

62
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,315
<i>Tom Makepeace, Foreign Secretary,</i>
<i>an honourable man.</i>

63
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,189
<i>Bullock, Capstick, Ravenscourt,</i>

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,352
<i>Sparrowhawk, Crowe -</i>

65
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,036
<i>all honourable men</i>
<i>until they sniff out any weakness.</i>

66
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,709
<i>And then the younger generation -</i>

67
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,111
<i>Rayner, Polecutt, Wolfin.</i>

68
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,749
<i>Best kept on the leash and muzzled!</i>

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,594
<i>John Rayner looks as if he'd worry sheep!</i>

70
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,551
This latest report does feature a number of cases

71
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,235
where there seem to be real grievances,

72
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,915
and we need to pay special attention...

73
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,552
It's time to ginger things up,
remind them who's the leader of the pack,

74
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,953
select a scapegoat and enact a token mounting.
Who shall it be?

75
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,393
Geoffrey?

76
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,509
Little Geoffrey Booza Pitt?

77
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,239
No, not Geoffrey. Not this time.

78
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,592
We cannot be seen to condemn the very old
to disability or illness.

79
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,229
Let's start with Betsy Bourke.

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,395
..hospital area managers, making sure
that this situation can never arise again.

81
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,315
We must make it clear
we are not abandoning the elderly.

82
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,475
Of course not! That's why we brought in
age insurance. If they pay, they're OK.

83
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,635
If not, well, it's no skin off our noses.

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,269
Damage limitation again, Betsy?

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,957
I'd rather see it as an opportunity
to reaffirm some basic principles.

86
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,353
The principle here being
the right to live for ever in perfect health?

87
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,792
- Politics is about making choices.
- Of course it is!

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,277
And treating each other like human beings.

89
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,595
We can't throw old people out of hospital
because they can't pay for treatment!

90
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,395
We need a safety net. It's unarguable.

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,990
Nothing's unarguable, Tom.

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,391
Nothing's unthinkable.

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,157
We have too many old people in Britain.
Let's not shy away from the problem.

94
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,751
What are you suggesting, John?
Euthanasia at 65?

95
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,152
- Of course not, Prime Minister.
- I'm very relieved.

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,750
I saw beggars on the street yesterday.

97
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,432
I thought the Vagrancy Act
had cleared that nuisance off our streets.

98
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,069
There are still problems, Prime Minister.

99
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,709
I don't want to hear about your problems.

100
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,915
I had hoped in this area, as in others,

101
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,030
we could have grasped the nettle
and challenged the culture of dependency.

102
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,590
I'm very disappointed, Betsy.

103
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,471
Prime Minister, if we abandon
the last remaining safeguards in our system,

104
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,109
we'll be the pariahs of Europe!

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,795
More than one way of being European.

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,919
Thank you. Thank you allvery much.

107
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,231
We'll talk soon, Betsy.

108
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,400
Betsy.

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,749
- He can be such a bastard.
- I know.

110
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,115
I thought I'd given him what he wanted.

111
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,797
He just likes playing games.
Your turn today, someone else's tomorrow.

112
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,431
You'll be back on the mantelpiece, Betsy.
Trust me.

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,990
You're a good friend, Geoffrey.

114
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,152
I should think so too.

115
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,598
If at any time you felt inclined
for something a little bit closer than that...

116
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,315
You know how I've always fancied you!

117
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,156
Geoffrey Booza Pitt, you're an impossible man!

118
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,840
No, no.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,992
Quite feasible.

120
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,073
Quite feasible in every way. Believe me.

121
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,513
- Come in, Geoffrey.

122
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,872
- Prime Minister.
- How's Betsy?

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,437
She's quite upset. She called you a bastard.

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,751
I've been called worse.

125
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,311
That was all about John Rayner
and Tom Makepeace.

126
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,473
Flushing them out of cover into open ground.

127
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,838
- Each of them sees himself as leader.
- You don't?

128
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,240
No. Rayner doesn't have the intellect,
Makepeace doesn't have the guts.

129
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,394
Having so little of either myself,
it isn't for me to comment.

130
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,075
They're a couple of sanctimonious shits.

131
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,039
Yes. Just put the word about discreetly.

132
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,193
The PM is contemplating a cabinet reshuffle.

133
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Not a purge, just two or three key posts.

134
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,677
Absolutely no question
of giving up the leadership in the near future.

135
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,958
It might be time to put a bit of stick about.

136
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,394
Order!

137
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,591
Mr Graham Glass.

138
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,275
Will the Prime Minister tell us the latest
manufacturing unemployment figures?

139
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,591
Hear, hear!

140
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,354
Come on!

141
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,396
I put them on your desk this morning,
Prime Minister.

142
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,794
I thank the Honourable Gentleman
for allowing me to confirm

143
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,273
that the unemployment figures
are down again this month.

144
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,474
A complete vindication
of this government's economic policies.

145
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,032
Yes, but what are the actual figures?
Does he know what they are?

146
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,832
He doesn't know.

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,595
He doesn't care.

148
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,114
Order!

149
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,399
Order!

150
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,269
Madam Speaker,
if the Honourable Gentleman is too busy

151
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,832
to look up the figures for himself,
I am very happy to tell him

152
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,034
that the exact figure is 1,875,403.

153
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,432
That's as of the first of this month, of course.

154
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,277
Time's up. Statement from the Prime Minister.

155
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,515
Next month, the Greek and Turkish presidents
of Cyprus will meet in Britain

156
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,755
to sign the peace settlement
that has eluded all parties for over a generation.

157
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,038
This peace treaty has been made available

158
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,717
through the initiatives
your Prime Minister was able to set in motion

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,511
and follow through in some of
the toughest and most intricate negotiations

160
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,552
in recent years.

161
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,879
And thanks is due too
to my Right Honourable Friend,

162
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,074
the Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs

163
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,712
who has, of necessity, been loaded down
with much of the donkey work,

164
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,395
and I am very grateful to him.

165
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,832
Cyprus has a particular significance for me,

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,710
if the House will permit me
to be personal for a moment.

167
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,116
I spent three crucial years
on that beautiful island at a very troubled time.

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,712
It would hardly be an exaggeration
to say that I grew up there.

169
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,475
Right Honourable and Honourable Members
will forgive me this once, I hope,

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,633
if I find it a little difficult to concentrate

171
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,315
on trivial domestic squabbles today.

172
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,430
There is a world elsewhere.

173
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,869
And I'm very proud to have helped

174
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,509
to change that world for good...

175
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,472
..and for ever.

176
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,592
Hear, hear!

177
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
Brilliant.

178
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,309
Not one of your better days, Barry.

179
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,997
I'm sure I put the file on your desk, Francis.
It must have slipped your mind.

180
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,754
Anyway, you gave him the figures.
How did you do that?

181
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,711
I made them up, but I'd prefer
not to live quite so dangerously in future!

182
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,472
- Brilliant, FU. Awesome.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.

183
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,193
Claire! How are you? Did you enjoy that?

184
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,754
It was an outrageous performance.
Tom Makepeace must be quite rightly furious.

185
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,429
He still puts on one hell of a good show.

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,910
Better than anyone. Such a star!

187
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,273
At one moment I thought he'd lost the plot,
then he stormed back.

188
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,030
- Was that real or just for effect?
- Never underestimate him.

189
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,716
- I never would, Geoffrey.
- Good. He's talent-spotting.

190
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,679
He might like the look of your...CV.

191
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,872
Prime Minister!

192
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,509
Tom. You didn't mind, I hope?

193
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,195
You agreed I would make the statement.

194
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,355
Did I? I'm so sorry. I haven't hurt your feelings?
I mentioned your contribution.

195
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,991
"Donkey work"?
The ideas and initiatives were mine.

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,153
I did 90% of the negotiations in bloody person!

197
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,109
This is too important an issue
for wounded vanity, Tom.

198
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,672
But I won't hold it against you.
You've done tremendous work on this.

199
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,320
Good man!

200
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,475
He is a good man too. Very able, honest,
but a bit too ambitious for his own good.

201
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,998
I shouldn't have roughed him up like that,
but I just can't resist it.

202
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,313
Enough of that.
Can't fritter all our time away in Westminster.

203
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,996
None of the real business of the world
gets settled there.

204
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,520
Oh, excellent! Jolly good shot!

205
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,954
It's the turn of the wrist, Mrs Urquhart.

206
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,594
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be such an aficionado, Mr Nures.

207
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,753
I adore cricket. I adore everything English.

208
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,435
Cricket at Lord's, Oxford, Glyndebourne.

209
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,990
Not enough Wagner for me.

210
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,677
And English women especially.
England has the best women in the world.

211
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,957
You're too kind.

212
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,312
Thank you, Corder. So sorry to keep you waiting.

213
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,512
What's the score?

214
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,592
206 for 3.

215
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,156
- Jolly good.
- Francis, this is Mr Nures.

216
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,956
He's been very generous
with his donations to party funds.

217
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,114
Mr Nures, I'm delighted to meet you.
I am very grateful.

218
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,749
It is I who am grateful, Mr Urquhart.

219
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,915
You have created the climate
in which a man of vision can express himself fully.

220
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,074
England is the best country now
for the merchant adventurer.

221
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,233
I feel at home here. I love what you're doing.

222
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,040
I see it as a new Elizabethan age -

223
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,920
the splendour here, the squalor there.

224
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,760
Life in all its rich complexity.

225
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,199
Lovely shot!

226
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,633
- Thank you, Mr Nures.
- I was telling Mr Nures about our dream.

227
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,953
The Urquhart Trust. We'd love to endow
a chair at Oxford or Cambridge.

228
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,629
Far beyond our personal means.

229
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,192
Nothing's impossible,
but nothing will come of nothing, huh?

230
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,910
I'd like to have a talk with you
about my native land.

231
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,634
Of course.

232
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,073
Please.

233
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,391
The Cyprus settlement.

234
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,950
Historic, as you rightly say.

235
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,589
Just a few loose ends to tie up.

236
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,434
The exact nature of the sea boundaries.

237
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,834
Just a few fish? What if there were oil?

238
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,239
The seismic survey failed
to show up anything out of the ordinary.

239
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,393
I have better information. It's very exciting.

240
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,280
There is a rich concentration of oil,

241
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,909
but only in one particular area.

242
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,555
A company with which I'm associated
did some drillings in that part 30 years ago.

243
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,715
What we learned from that,
combined with the findings of this recent survey,

244
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,874
you see a very rare
and poignant business opportunity.

245
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,829
Interestingly enough,
it's on the disputed borderline.

246
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,313
So I'm in a position to help you
so you can help both our countries.

247
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,557
You are in a position, I believe,
to be able to help me and help yourself.

248
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,954
Go on.

249
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,114
There will be an arbitration panel
of five international judges.

250
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,352
The Turks nominated
a Malaysian and an Egyptian.

251
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,470
The Greeks nominated a Frenchman
and a Serb. Naturally, they'll split 50/50.

252
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,396
But the chairman with the casting vote
will be a British judge.

253
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,392
Am I right?

254
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,075
You are remarkably well informed.

255
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,473
What can I say?
Knowledge is the name of the game.

256
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,195
If the oil fell into the Greek sector,

257
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,353
they'll give the drilling rights to the French,

258
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,311
but if it came into the Turkish sector,
all sorts of good things become possible.

259
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,554
For your country, for my country.
For me and for you.

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,880
Everybody needs a little nest egg.

261
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,680
I couldn't countenance any irregularity.

262
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,352
No, no. Of course not.

263
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,276
A judge must be absolutely incorruptible,
absolutely impartial.

264
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,759
But you can advise on the appointment
of the chairman of the panel.

265
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,110
The selection should be made
most carefully, I think.

266
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,351
It will be, Mr Nures.

267
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,753
The Urquhart Trust.
It sounds a very noble concept.

268
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
It is a very noble concept, Mr Nures.

269
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,070
- And one very close to my heart.
- It's your baby, am I right, Mrs Urquhart?

270
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,029
My husband is a little too busy
to attend to the details.

271
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,192
I think I understand.

272
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,875
English understatement. Crazy about it!

273
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,509
Mrs Urquhart, do you know Cyprus?

274
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,831
No, I've never been there.

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,311
<i>A beautiful country, as your husband knows.</i>

276
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,032
I remember it very well.

277
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,030
I'm expecting him now,
but we're going out quite soon.

278
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,237
- I'll certainly tell him. Hold on.

279
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,035
- Here he is.
- God, what a day!

280
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,112
Claire Carlsen.

281
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,920
Right.

282
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,400
Hello?

283
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,114
Oh, yes?

284
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,036
No, I'd better see it myself.

285
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,471
I'll come straight over.

286
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,672
- Sorry.
- Tom!

287
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,470
I'll be there. It won't take long. Another cock-up.

288
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,109
I'll meet you there. I won't be late.

289
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,749
Fine. Well, off you go, then!

290
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,072
Oh, your smell!

291
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,391
- Amazing!
- And yours!

292
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,116
I didn't think you'd come.

293
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,399
I was desperate to see you, be with you.
That malevolent old man!

294
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,596
I know. I know.

295
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,678
Come on.

296
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,790
How does he get away with it?

297
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,636
Because we let him think
he can do anything he likes.

298
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,589
He's got to go. If he won't go gently,
he'll have to be pushed.

299
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,229
You could do it. You should do it.

300
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,709
God, I want you so much!

301
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,280
Come on, then. Have me.

302
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,715
<i>Claire Carlsen, member for Box Hill.</i>

303
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,349
She's married to Bjorn Carlsen.

304
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,512
All that money.

305
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,149
A very ambitious girlie...woman.

306
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,312
Sorry. Woman.

307
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,473
Tom Makepeace is seeing to her bodily needs?

308
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,314
- They're at it like rabbits.
- Really?

309
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,513
Makes one feel exhausted to think about it.

310
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,672
I don't know.

311
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,915
I take very little interest professionally
or personally in politicians' private lives,

312
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,359
but several of your colleagues
are rather rum coves in that respect,

313
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,309
yourself not least,
if I may put it that way as an old friend?

314
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,280
Ah.

315
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,829
- Evening, Rayner. Evening, Wolfin.
- Evening, Sir Bruce.

316
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,876
Nasty eyes that man's got.

317
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,315
Still, "Sir Bruce". Can't take that away.

318
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,269
People say
there's not a lot of satisfaction in a knighthood,

319
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,909
but most of those people haven't got one.

320
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,551
- I bet you'd like one.
- I'd adore one. Absolute bliss.

321
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,229
"Sir Geoffrey Booza Pitt."

322
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,631
What a mouthful!

323
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,760
It won't happen, though.
Basically, I'm just a chorus boy.

324
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,389
Now, what do you want?

325
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,075
You want to go to the House of Lords.

326
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,235
I'd be very honoured to serve my country
in that capacity. Yes, I admit to that.

327
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,393
Bruce, you'll have to be much nicer to FU.

328
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,916
I'm extremely nice to him.

329
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,597
My leading articles are tremendously
warm and sympathetic to the chap.

330
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,198
But when 70% of the electorate
have had enough of him and say so,

331
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,432
the nation's leading newspaper can't ignore it.

332
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,798
Of course it's time for him to go.
Everyone knows it.

333
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,151
He knows it, doesn't he?

334
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,518
He thinks he's indestructible and perhaps he is.

335
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,712
No one is, Geoffrey.

336
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,995
Look at what happened to Margaret.

337
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,310
No one is indestructible.

338
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,840
No hold-ups ahead.
We should be back in London by nine, sir.

339
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,634
Make sure your seat belt's fastened, sir.

340
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,351
Tosser!

341
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,074
Yeah!

342
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,559
- Wanker!
- Let's have some fun!

343
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,314
John!

344
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,280
You wankers! Right, who wants some?

345
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,355
- You...
- Shut up!

346
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,796
- Shit! I thought he had a gun.
- They were all armed.

347
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,952
Self-defence.

348
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,635
I take it you are up for this?

349
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,836
- Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, guv.
- Right.

350
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,792
Oh, God!

351
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,872
Don't go yet.

352
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,839
I have to. I shouldn't be here at all.

353
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,638
Hilary's got a launch party for her new book.

354
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,996
I promised to be there.

355
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,632
Come on, then.

356
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,917
Get your knickers on.

357
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,710
You're missing
all those little sausages on sticks.

358
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,552
What is it?

359
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,712
I hate this flat.

360
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,680
Why?

361
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,230
Because it's a company flat?

362
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,392
Because it's his?

363
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,670
You don't like my husband
subsidising your sex life?

364
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,473
It's a safe house. It's...anonymous.

365
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,036
Like what we do here...

366
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,192
isn't real.

367
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,355
What we do here seems very real to me.

368
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,552
What are you saying?

369
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,313
- Are you saying you want to stop this?
- No!

370
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,472
Don't ever say that.

371
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,280
You know I'm desperate about you.

372
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,629
You'd better have a good scrub down
before you clock on.

373
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,077
<i>"Horizon" next, but now over</i>
<i>to Sonia Stevens in the BBC newsroom.</i>

374
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,711
<i>Reports are coming in</i>
<i>of a shooting incident on the M14,</i>

375
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,880
<i>described as an assassination attempt</i>
<i>on the Prime Minister.</i>

376
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
Tom!

377
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,639
<i>Mr Urquhart's car was rammed</i>
<i>and forced off the road.</i>

378
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:16,080
<i>Mr Urquhart sustained head injuries,</i>

379
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,515
<i>As soon as we have any more news,</i>
<i>we'll let you know.</i>

380
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,797
I'd better go up there.

381
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,117
Not from here. Go home.

382
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,040
- People will be phoning you.
- Yes.

383
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,789
Mr Urquhart!

384
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,549
Mr Urquhart, welcome back.

385
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,909
You're in hospital. You're OK.

386
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,592
You're doing fine.

387
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,869
I'm very glad to hear that.

388
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,751
Oh, yes. I remember now.

389
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,112
Thank you very much.

390
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,559
- I think this could be it, John.
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

391
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,189
It's too bloody soon. We're not ready.

392
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,751
- Hello. Heard the news. Shocking!
- No comment.

393
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,912
No comment?

394
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,151
I'm sorry. Sir Bruce.

395
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,789
I'm too upset to focus properly.

396
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,475
Deeply shocked. Gravely concerned.

397
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,112
This kind of lawless behaviour,
happy to see it promptly dealt with.

398
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,355
Our thoughts are with Francis Urquhart tonight,
praying for his speedy recovery.

399
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,753
Yes, I'm sure they are.
After all, you're not ready yet, are you?

400
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,992
I was doing my duty.

401
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,436
I was carrying out orders.

402
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,069
I have absolutely no misgivings.

403
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,232
Nor did I have then.

404
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,880
Francis?

405
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,555
They were terrorists. Simple as that.

406
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,837
The men in the van?

407
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,032
What van?

408
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,196
- On the motorway.
- I had to shoot them.

409
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,669
There was an olive tree there.

410
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,869
I remember the olive tree burning.

411
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,029
Francis, I think you should rest.

412
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,111
You're not really making much sense, to be frank.

413
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,195
It all seems perfectly clear to me.

414
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,795
Cyprus is back on the map.

415
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,109
Cyprus is back on the agenda.

416
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,631
We're going to make a little history, Elizabeth.

417
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,871
Yes, my dear, we are.

418
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,836
I think I will rest now.

419
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,672
It was awfully good of you to come, Elizabeth.

420
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,716
Mrs Urquhart, a man outside
says he's Sir Henry Ponsonby.

421
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,874
He's probably telling the truth.
Does he want to see my husband?

422
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,193
I told him it's only the immediate family,
but he wasn't happy.

423
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,829
He says he's the Cabinet Secretary.

424
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,239
He seems to think it gives him special rights.

425
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,830
I'll have a word with him.

426
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,431
And, Nurse, my husband seems a little confused.

427
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,753
It's important that he speaks to no one
until he's more himself.

428
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,674
I'll make sure he's not disturbed.

429
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,160
Thank you.

430
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,353
Elizabeth!

431
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,035
I came as soon as I could. How is he?

432
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,672
They say he's doing very well.
Not up to seeing you, though, I'm afraid.

433
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,597
What happened, Henry?

434
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,789
I was on my way to the country
when I got the call. I've heard nothing yet.

435
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,795
I say! I wonder if you'd mind
waiting outside for a moment?

436
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,952
Yes, I would.

437
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,316
Oh. Shall we?

438
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,597
National Health Service hospital, of course.

439
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,109
Extraordinary places, aren't they?

440
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,752
I've heard that a National Health
teaching hospital is the only place to be

441
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,389
if you've got something wrong with you.

442
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,950
Really? I must remember that.

443
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,270
About this motorway thing...

444
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,760
Yes.

445
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,320
Well...

446
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,316
It's not at all clear, but it does seem possible
that it was a bit of a nonsense.

447
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,156
Security a little over-zealous
in reading the rubric.

448
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,597
You mean they shot three innocent motorists?

449
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,229
Innocent's a tricky adjective, I find.

450
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,873
Apparently these chaps weren't model citizens.

451
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,991
Anyway, I gather
Commander Corder has matters in hand.

452
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,153
- He's handling the internal investigation.
- Good.

453
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,118
Yes, quite.

454
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,229
Always distasteful, these things.

455
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,240
He's going to be all right, then? Francis?

456
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,517
Oh, yes, they say so.

457
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,672
I'm glad to hear it.

458
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,832
Tricky times.

459
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,032
Look, Henry...

460
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,795
This may seem brutally practical,

461
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,751
but I've been thinking about what we'd do
if something happened to Francis.

462
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,831
Or if something didn't.

463
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,469
Death or retirement, in short.

464
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,112
What do you mean?

465
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,559
Well...a prime minister's salary
is laughably small.

466
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,953
And a prime minister's pension
must be practically negligible.

467
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,511
And yet one notices that ex-prime ministers...

468
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,431
How shall I put it?

469
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,437
..aren't actually short of the odd few million.

470
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,357
Would it be naive of me to ask how this happens?

471
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,036
It can't all come
from writing one's memoirs, can it?

472
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,192
Hardly that.

473
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,278
It is assumed that the incumbent PM
will make his own arrangements

474
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,909
for a comfortable retirement.

475
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,916
The Prime Minister is usually in a unique position
to make such arrangements.

476
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,313
Sometimes the PM may prefer
to leave some of these arrangements

477
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,989
to members of his or her family.

478
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,391
I thought that was it.

479
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,598
Well, do let me know if I can be of any help.

480
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,640
Thanks.

481
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,629
I am chairing this cabinet meeting

482
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,271
purely as Foreign Secretary
and Deputy Prime Minister.

483
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,911
The Prime Minister
is making a complete recovery.

484
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,154
I'm sure we'd like to minute our good wishes
for his speedy return.

485
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,395
And may I just say that none of us could think
of a better man to take his place?

486
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,716
Temporarily, of course.

487
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,351
Do we have more information
on the shooting incident?

488
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,991
I've had an informal report
from Commander Corder.

489
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,518
The men were criminals and armed,
but it wasn't a terrorist attack.

490
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,197
Road rage, apparently.
The bastards got more than they bargained for.

491
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,070
Commander Corder should be
the subject of any investigation.

492
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,835
It's clear there should be a full inquiry.

493
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,639
Absolutely.

494
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,309
But I've just told you what it'll say.

495
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,995
I know the PM will say the same.

496
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,755
Do you? Thank you, Home Secretary.

497
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,191
Next business.

498
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,153
Ponsonby and Makepeace and no one else?

499
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,950
- No one else.
- Not even little Geoffrey Booza Pitt?

500
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,830
No one. We did say
you weren't able to receive visitors.

501
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,710
Nevertheless, they should have come.
Mark of respect.

502
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,554
I have perceived a faint neglect of late.

503
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,679
No matter. Heads will roll.

504
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,831
That bloody little Private Secretary of mine
for a start.

505
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,516
I'll get myself someone with a little bit of spark.

506
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,479
- I see you're feeling better.
- Yes, I am.

507
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,109
Did I give you cause for concern?

508
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,954
You did. An intimation of mortality.

509
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,830
- I was talking about Cyprus, wasn't I?
- Yes, you were.

510
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,469
Francis, I think Mr Nures is right.

511
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,635
We have a wonderful opportunity to do something
for ourselves and our country.

512
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,431
We should do business with Mr Nures.
He'll be a wonderful, necessary man.

513
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,399
- Yes, we'll see.

514
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,952
- Are you ready, Mr Urquhart?
- Indeed I am. Wheel that thing away!

515
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,349
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

516
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,991
Thank you very much.
You've been most kind. Elizabeth!

517
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,480
Goodbye.

518
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,195
Doctor, thank you so much. Thank you.

519
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,195
I'm not going to risk
being photographed in a wheelchair.

520
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,353
- What the hell is this, Barry?
- Age Concern.

521
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,989
We thought it was rather a cute idea.

522
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,989
They brought you a birthday card, sir.

523
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,675
I'm not terribly interested in birthdays.

524
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,480
Very kind, but I have a lot of work to do.

525
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,633
Many happy returns, Prime Minister,

526
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,191
on the occasion of your 65th birthday tomorrow.

527
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,750
Welcome from all of us

528
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,230
to the third age!

529
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,392
Yes, thank you.

530
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,156
# Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

531
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,595
# Happy birthday, Prime Minister

532
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,111
# Happy birthday to you #

533
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,072
Thank you very much. I really am most touched.

534
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,352
Smile, please!

535
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,553
So you thought that was a cute idea, Barry?

536
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,918
Well, it came from one of the girls in the office.

537
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,276
Not from the opposition?

538
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,911
You have become a liability!
Have you seen the papers?

539
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,549
Lots of good coverage, your birthday...

540
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,713
"Our pensioner Prime Minister. Time to FO, FU."

541
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,233
And three profiles of Tom Makepeace,
"the man most likely to succeed".

542
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,393
- That's good coverage?
- Don't be oversensitive.

543
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,077
- It's good-humoured stuff, I'd say.
- Would you indeed? Would you indeed?

544
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,509
I can't work bloody miracles.

545
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,794
And in his feeble way, the man is right.

546
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,429
He can't work bloody miracles.

547
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,035
Nor can I turn the clock back

548
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,669
or halt time or undo what is done.

549
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,196
But I can bloody well go on.

550
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,832
As long as I have strength and will,
I can do everything I need to do.

551
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,949
- Come in, Geoffrey.
- Is this all right?

552
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,319
FU? They said you were asking for me.

553
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,949
Yes, of course it's all right, Geoffrey.

554
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,040
- How's your poor head?
- Apparently I'm mending very well.

555
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,510
It's rather painful. Pain is tiring.

556
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,233
At least it hasn't spoiled your good looks.

557
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,150
A small scar on the temple
can be quite distinguished.

558
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,509
Makepeace chaired the cabinet, did he?

559
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,155
- What was he like?
- Very statesmanlike and responsible.

560
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,831
I tried to tempt him into a little aria,
but it was no go.

561
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,993
Everyone came on
like Little Goody Two-Shoes.

562
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,279
They kept saying,
"I'm sure that's what HE would have wanted."

563
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,912
It's funny how what you would have wanted
is exactly what THEY want.

564
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,950
They have no idea what I want

565
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,271
or what I can still do.

566
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,791
I'm appointing
a new Parliamentary Private Secretary.

567
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,952
Excellent idea.

568
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,592
Barry Crumb has been neither use
nor ornament for quite some time.

569
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,229
God knows where he gets his hair done!

570
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,152
I have a thought or two if you haven't decided.

571
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,352
You have? Good.

572
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,989
It's your birthday party tomorrow.

573
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,951
I don't anticipate it with any enthusiasm.
It's another reminder of increasing age.

574
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,152
Bollocks to that!

575
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,438
A man is as young as he feels and you know it.

576
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,712
You can still see any of them off.
Look at the fear in their eyes!

577
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,351
You're still the biggest swinging dick
in Westminster, FU.

578
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,155
If one's allowed to put it that way.

579
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,871
- General and Mrs Baum.
- General, nice to see you.

580
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,509
Like the sodding Sun King, Wolf!

581
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,195
I wonder how long he thinks he's got.

582
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,750
The longer the better for us.

583
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,435
Let Makepeace flower and fade a bit.

584
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,678
- Evening, Tom.
- Hello there. How are you?

585
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,870
What a limp prick that man is!

586
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,754
Hello, Sarah. I was hoping you'd be here.

587
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,554
- I hate this dressing up.
- Ghastly!

588
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,070
Yes, well, absolutely.

589
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,231
- Good evening, sir. How are you?
- Very much better.

590
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,871
- Mr Nures, how nice to see you.
- Excuse me, please.

591
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,555
Good of you to visit. You must be busy.

592
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,235
- For you, I'd drop everything.
- Really?

593
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,274
A very glittering occasion. Very nice.
And you, Mrs Urquhart, drop-dead gorgeous.

594
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,750
Thank you very much.

595
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,755
Isn't that Sir Clive Watling,
the Border Arbitration Chairman,

596
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,389
on whom so many of our hopes depend?

597
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,234
- I believe it is.
- I'd like to meet him.

598
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,633
I don't think that's a good idea.
I want to keep you all for myself.

599
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,793
Sir Clive, I've wanted to meet you for so long.

600
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,475
The best international jurist in Europe!

601
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,111
I hear it everywhere.
You must be very much in demand.

602
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,030
I am pretty busy at the moment.

603
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,672
And now this Cyprus business.
Let's go over there. Come along, Henry.

604
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,872
I'm delighted that a British judge
has been chosen to chair the panel.

605
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,509
Are you quite happy with everything?

606
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,195
Such as your fellow judges on the panel?

607
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,876
Broadly speaking.
Saladier will be difficult, no doubt.

608
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,556
- He always is.
- Be as rough as you like with Saladier.

609
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,394
We'd have no problem with that.

610
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,712
We're not too keen on the French at the moment.

611
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,758
I see.

612
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,435
This is an exceptionally prestigious task.

613
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,197
Whoever does this and gets it right
goes straight into the history books

614
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,353
with a peerage and the usual box of tricks.

615
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,991
- Mr Urquhart...
- You're not interested in baubles.

616
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,030
Nor am I. But in this case,
you may just have to submit with a good grace.

617
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,120
You spoke of...getting it right.

618
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,069
You do understand the limits?

619
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,757
A distinction exists between
international politics and international law.

620
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,120
Of course, which you will negotiate
with your unrivalled acumen and wisdom.

621
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,031
These sea boundaries
may prove to be absolutely crucial.

622
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,552
Yes. I see.

623
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,072
Well, that all seems quite excellent to me.

624
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,189
Let's join the party, shall we?

625
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,071
You approve our choice?

626
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,471
Utterly incorruptible,

627
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,791
absolutely impartial.

628
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,954
He just can't stand Frenchmen,
and who can blame him for that?

629
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,992
Ravishing, yeah?

630
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,192
He's never here.

631
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,353
You know her, don't you? Of course you do.

632
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,514
She used to help out
with your research in foreign affairs.

633
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,878
- Is that her husband?
- Yes, I think it is.

634
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,236
Bjorn Carlsen.

635
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,352
Someone told me that man's worth 200 million.
Can that be right?

636
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,517
He's got all that money and can't
keep his wife on the straight and narrow.

637
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,149
Have you heard anything about that?

638
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,471
No. No, I haven't.

639
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,838
Shags like a rattlesnake - that's what I heard.

640
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,471
Ambitious with it too. Mind you, I could be wrong.

641
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,711
Excuse me, Geoffrey.

642
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,271
1900, right. That one...

643
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,396
It's very different with me.

644
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,989
Would you excuse me just for a moment?
I'll be right back.

645
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,393
- Sarah, how lovely to see you.
- And you.

646
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,792
- How are the girls?
- Quite young ladies now.

647
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,952
Be in touch.

648
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,396
- Prime Minister.
- Mrs Carlsen.

649
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,950
It's lovely of you to invite us.

650
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,592
We're pleased that you could both come.
Your husband must be very busy.

651
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,831
Yes, he is.

652
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,358
Has Geoffrey Booza Pitt said anything to you
about me, Mr Urquhart?

653
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,912
He mentions you from time to time.
I can't recall anything specific.

654
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,154
He thinks very highly of you,
as does everyone else, it seems.

655
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,200
I understand you might be looking
for a new PPS quite soon.

656
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,680
Yes.

657
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,760
And?

658
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,437
I'm sure this isn't the form,
but I'd like you to consider me for the job.

659
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,877
I'd love to do it and I think I'd do it very well.

660
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,912
Well, Mrs Carlsen, it's very kind of you
to make yourself available.

661
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,549
Will you let me think about this?

662
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,189
I don't have to decide straightaway.

663
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,795
I'm sorry. It's very cheeky of me.

664
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,392
Indeed it is,
but you've done yourself no harm by it.

665
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,149
You'll have to excuse me now.

666
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,312
Yes, of course.

667
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,280
Thank you for listening.

668
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,640
No, no.

669
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,272
Not this one.

670
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,869
You might very well think that.

671
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,475
I couldn't possibly comment.
