1
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:46,886
No crystal or china.
I hate white-picket-fence stuff.

2
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,426
Great shirt.
Where'd you get your sense of style?

3
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:54,761
When I met him, he was wearing polyester
and dating women.

4
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:58,168
- I didn't know who Jackson Pollock was.
- Thanks for helping, Monty.

5
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,900
So, guys, you've been together two years?

6
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,542
What's the appropriate gift
for this anniversary?

7
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:06,601
Tupperware?

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,841
Hair weaves? Tummy tucks?

9
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:17,756
Come on, Brandon, get up and dance.

10
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,892
Are you crazy?

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,331
Oh, God.

12
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:30,494
- Who's hungry? We just made it.
- Spanakopitas!

13
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,162
- No, thanks.
- No?

14
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,230
Quit smoking. It'll kill you.

15
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,568
That's a nice haircut.

16
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:39,269
It's much, much better.

17
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,945
Go to the kitchen.

18
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,912
- What'd your aunt say?
- You don't wanna know.

19
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,288
Why'd you pull away from me like that?

20
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,760
- I feel awkward around your mother.
- She doesn't care, Brandon.

21
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:58,421
She's not like your mother.

22
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,132
He's Jewish?

23
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:03,269
Half-Jewish, half-Greek.

24
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,772
We thought this would go great
in the living room. What about here?

25
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,269
You're not putting that here.

26
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:21,749
This always happens to me.
Quick, go get a broom.

27
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,721
The clock can't stay.

28
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,782
It won't stay. Trust me.

29
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,894
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking...

30
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,822
sixteen years ago.

31
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,299
You stopped smoking 16 years ago?

32
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:38,868
Are you joking?

33
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,470
Ready?

34
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,542
Happy birthday, Brandon.

35
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,773
- I don't believe it.
- That's Patrick...

36
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,007
here, and that's Violet.

37
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,878
- God, they're beautiful.
- I got one more surprise.

38
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,441
- What?
- Come on.

39
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,223
Look who's here.

40
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,159
Surprise!

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,089
Brandon, how old are you?

42
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,500
You are so bad.

43
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:14,571
- Happy birthday.
- Did you know?

44
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,464
No.

45
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,042
- Brandon.
- Rodney.

46
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,204
I got him.

47
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,773
You kidding?

48
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,511
- Fantastic.
- The whole family's here. Andrew.

49
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,853
- Can I push the dog off the raft?
- No, that's not a nice thing to do.

50
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:33,984
- It would be fun though.
- Fun for you, not for the dog.

51
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,460
Nick!

52
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:48,472
I'm off to England. Financing came through.

53
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:52,010
What's wrong?

54
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,206
You better get a test.

55
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,044
- Why?
- That flu...

56
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,975
wasn't the flu.

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,251
I got it.

58
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,212
You tested positive?

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,348
Yep.

60
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:09,920
How?

61
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,259
Dave said it happened before we met.

62
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,431
- You won't leave me, will you?
- No.

63
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,434
I won't leave you.

64
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:40,623
Better not use my razor
if you want to stay negative.

65
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,326
- Look at yourself.
- "Look at yourself."

66
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,467
- What do you see, girl?
- "What do you see, girl?"

67
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,332
- Do you see the body of a woman?
- "Body of a woman?"

68
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,811
- The temple of creation and motherhood?
- Your lunch is served.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
The flesh of Eve that man,
since Adam, has profaned?

70
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,780
That body was meant for begetting children.

71
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,412
It was not meant for the lust of men.

72
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,253
- "The lust of men."
- Want more children, Lilith?

73
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,952
"I want more children.

74
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,585
"A lot more children."

75
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:29,004
There's a really good scene coming up.

76
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,706
If you won't kill him, I will.

77
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,160
I got a meeting I've got to get to.

78
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,299
He joked about them.

79
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:03,308
Said if we ran into dinosaurs on Mars,
Renee should take care of them.

80
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:06,268
If nothing else works, maybe gas?

81
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:40,039
Are you crazy? You should be in bed.

82
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,483
Come on back to the house.

83
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,553
Why? So you can leave again?

84
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,596
Do you want to get sick again?

85
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,992
Dave said that your T-cells are up, so just...

86
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,824
come on back.

87
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,390
Nicky, Brandon's here.

88
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:31,356
I thought you weren't due back
until tomorrow.

89
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,023
Obviously.

90
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,264
Miss Texas-at-Large,
meet Brandon Theis, famous director.

91
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,796
My pleasure.

92
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:41,534
He's just returned from another one of his...

93
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,408
business trips.

94
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:44,738
Outside.

95
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,373
Hello, Brandon.

96
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,578
- Nick, come on in. The water's good.
- I'll be in later.

97
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,191
- What's with all these freaks?
- You never liked my friends.

98
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,627
Tony is practically living here in my house.

99
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,186
It's my house, too.

100
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:08,260
- What?
- Who negotiated the deal?

101
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,033
Who designed it?

102
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,836
You stayed eight years without paying for...

103
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:13,895
Stayed here?

104
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:18,535
My financial planning saved your ass
and this house. You owe me.

105
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,679
- You're out of control.
- Yeah, really?

106
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:21,907
Really?

107
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,481
Fine, we'll divide it in half.

108
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,645
I'll take this side...

109
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:29,716
with the freaks.

110
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,260
Don't park there.

111
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,273
Who's this?

112
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:55,378
- Zack. He's helping me on my film.
- And you're helping him with his homework.

113
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:58,245
- Knock it off.
- Are you due for a midlife crisis?

114
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:01,719
Excuse me, your car
is blocking my side of the drive.

115
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,187
So either move it, or I'll have it towed.

116
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,161
That does it. I want you out.

117
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:19,129
Hey, wait.

118
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:20,928
Stop!

119
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:28,046
Where is he taking them?

120
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:31,215
I sold them.

121
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,943
- To who?
- "Whom." It was an auction. I don't know.

122
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,817
- You get them back.
- I can't.

123
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,517
Opala. Hi, baby.

124
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,282
Fucking asshole, you are not taking Opala.

125
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:43,386
She is my dog. You gave her to me.

126
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:45,931
I don't care. You're not taking her.

127
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:46,988
Fine.

128
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,664
You know, you should never cross a Greek.

129
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,530
We're fair, but we are merciless.

130
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,616
Oh, no!

131
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:17,760
Sorry, Houdini.

132
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:21,856
Oh, man.

133
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:25,231
Houdini, sit.

134
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,129
Stay. Good boy.

135
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:33,439
Oh, man. Damn it.

136
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:42,245
Shoot.

137
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:55,067
Christmas season is usually big
box-office season for the film industry.

138
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:58,228
But storms across the nation
have literally frozen ticket sales.

139
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,795
Captive audiences across the nation have...

140
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,846
Donald, what's happening?

141
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,910
Tony, sorry I'm late.

142
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,687
Third time this week.

143
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:19,088
You do it again, you'll get off a week.

144
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,456
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Chad, what's happening?

145
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,962
It's Chuck, not Chad.

146
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,060
Well at least it isn't Chip.

147
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:39,243
All right, don't bust a gut.
Go to a lighter weight.

148
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:49,614
Fuck!

149
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,195
- Now will you do it?
- Do what?

150
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,598
Nick, you're dropping things.
You're forgetting things.

151
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,137
Listen to Dave. Do the scan.

152
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:28,752
You look like you caught your balls
in your zipper, Dr. Dave.

153
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,797
I've fought everything else off
for three years.

154
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,229
It's PML?

155
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:35,790
Yes.

156
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:40,397
Let's see these little fuckers.

157
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,803
There's a lesion here and here.

158
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,106
They're advanced.

159
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,745
I have 10 days till I croak, right?

160
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,482
- But it could also be several months.
- We've had this conversation.

161
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,792
How long before I become a rutabaga?

162
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,450
Any vision problems?

163
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:07,096
My right eye
is like I'm looking through a tampon.

164
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,759
So...

165
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:13,432
it will be like Jim?

166
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,173
Yes. It will be like Jim.

167
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:21,144
Do you know what I always said
I'd do if I got PML?

168
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,740
I remember.

169
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,075
Time for Plan B.

170
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,944
My driving days is over.

171
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,990
- Sure about this?
- I thought about it a long time.

172
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,620
I'm not going to die blind,
demented and lying in my own shit.

173
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,721
I'm here for you, no matter what.

174
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:39,787
I know.

175
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,666
Hello, this is Nick.
Can I speak to my mother?

176
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,097
- What can I do?
- You're doing it.

177
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:50,698
Amalia? I need you to meet me at my place.

178
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,743
Yeah. Now.

179
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,618
- Find your passport?
- Right here.

180
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,753
We're going to the airport from work, right?

181
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,349
Okay, let me see.

182
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,327
Hello.

183
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,035
Nick?

184
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:27,838
Good guess.

185
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,642
What's up?

186
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,915
My headaches won't go away.

187
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,543
Yes?

188
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:39,384
And I've lost my keys for the tenth time.

189
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:43,088
You called Dave?

190
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,424
He wants me to take more tests.
He's given me pills.

191
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,093
- You taking them?
- Yes.

192
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,701
Maybe you should try a sleeping pill.

193
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,238
Right.

194
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,176
Feel like dropping by?

195
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:06,976
- I can't.
- Why not?

196
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:11,581
I'm going out of town.
Jesus, you haven't called in a year.

197
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:13,658
Right, and you have?

198
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,862
I don't need this right now.

199
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,989
You haven't changed a bit.

200
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,564
Have a safe trip.

201
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,399
Who was that?

202
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,006
Was it Nick?

203
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,479
What did he want?

204
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:36,810
Nothing.

205
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,581
I can't believe you even talk to him.

206
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,520
He'd only call if he were extremely upset.

207
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,452
After what he did, why would you care?

208
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,217
You know why.

209
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:55,265
Bet you're happy the blue screen's over.
That dog's a nightmare.

210
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,665
That trainer's useless.

211
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,967
We should've used the guy from
West Hollywood Dog Training Academy.

212
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,435
Nope.

213
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,506
Dead.

214
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:11,707
Dull.

215
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,674
Dead.

216
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,077
Never.

217
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,346
Dead.

218
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:18,817
Might as well be dead. Dead.

219
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:23,319
Christ, Monty.

220
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:25,486
Now we're in trouble.

221
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,530
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey, sweetie.

222
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:34,205
- Where is he?
- He's in the office.

223
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:40,011
- Hello, doomed one.
- Monty Tipton, please.

224
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,907
You are wearing black.
It's a fiesta, not a funeral.

225
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:47,510
You taught me black was slimming,
but whatever. One fat pig coming right up.

226
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,417
You're looking good, girl.

227
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:52,048
We needed a party animal
to liven things up. Monty!

228
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,682
- Nick.
- Drop everything.

229
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,056
- Now?
- Yeah.

230
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,324
- I gotta go.
- It's a command performance. Now!

231
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,730
I got him.

232
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,230
Good month.

233
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:06,896
You look great.

234
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,198
- I can't believe you're sick.
- Who knew?

235
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,106
You should see my headshot.

236
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,178
Now you can get me a Tylenol commercial.

237
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,372
So, who can I call?

238
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,417
We're doing okay, right, Tim?

239
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,714
We'll probably need a bouncer.

240
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:23,812
A few single straight men are coming.

241
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,016
Single and straight, in this house?

242
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,183
Johnny.

243
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:29,193
Get the hair out of your face.

244
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,356
- You called your father?
- Next.

245
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,261
- Call him.
- The jerk would never come.

246
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,856
Tim Bergen, Nick's partner.

247
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,128
You did call Brandon?

248
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:40,400
Fuck, no. I'll pretend you didn't say that,
so we can stay friends.

249
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,269
- You've got to.
- No, forget it. End of story.

250
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,572
This won't be an unhappy occasion.

251
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,044
You haven't said a word.

252
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,450
What's up?

253
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,956
Good morning, Danielle.

254
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,359
I'll get you some coffee.

255
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:06,922
- Anybody seen the animal trainer?
- Stuck on the freeway. He's on his way.

256
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,328
So what do we think of Samantha Frank?

257
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,596
She's a vacuum with nipples.

258
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,303
- Amalia, let me help you.
- I can do it.

259
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:21,846
- I'll take one.
- I can do it.

260
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,680
What's all that?

261
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,044
You said a lot of people were coming.

262
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,420
My God, she dropped the groceries all over.

263
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,192
Look at this.

264
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,360
Let's clean it up. Come on.

265
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:49,833
There must be something.
Chemotherapy, something?

266
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,276
Take this. Nothing works.
It's the same thing Jim had.

267
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,540
There's nothing they can do.

268
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,384
I need you to be strong for me.
I'm counting on you. Come on.

269
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,115
Amalia.

270
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,453
- We knew this day was coming.
- No, not today.

271
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,489
Please, not today.

272
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,824
- I'm in shock.
- We all are.

273
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,494
- Shouldn't somebody tell Brandon?
- No.

274
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,593
Nick's got enough problems.

275
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:20,765
Excuse me.

276
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,465
Yes, he called.

277
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,138
Get here as...

278
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:29,409
Fifteen minutes would be great.
That's the other line.

279
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,115
What is this huge oatmeal for?

280
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:34,979
Who's gonna eat this?

281
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:38,120
And you got two, just to be sure?

282
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:39,884
Nick.

283
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,951
There's a limousine outside.

284
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,461
It's the Harts. Don't worry about that.

285
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:47,761
Bill, how are you? Good to see you.

286
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,898
- Sara.
- We heard on the way to the airport.

287
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:54,871
- That house. I wish I was going with you.
- So do we.

288
00:19:55,908 --> 00:20:00,038
Since you're the first people here,
you'll know everybody who's here.

289
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,640
- Are you feeding this dog?
- Of course.

290
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,947
I know you want to keep it small and cute.
This is my mother.

291
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,650
Anybody home?

292
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:13,087
Mrs. Bingham and son.
So glad you could make it.

293
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,759
- Oh, you.
- You don't look sick.

294
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,626
- Missed you.
- You do.

295
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,062
- How you doing?
- Hi.

296
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:22,293
Come on. Let's meet everybody.

297
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,593
Okay.

298
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,403
Nick, how about Matt in New York?

299
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:29,632
Definitely. Lina, Andrew. Bill, Sara.

300
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,541
To put everyone's mind at ease...

301
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,808
I've transferred all my accounts to Amalia.

302
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,008
But I've got some bad news.

303
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,087
There's no money in them.

304
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,313
Why give your mother such a hard time?

305
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,381
You must be tough on kids these days.

306
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,119
I'm just teasing, Ma.

307
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,894
This is my party.

308
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:53,523
So...

309
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,891
there'll be no wake and no funeral.

310
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:59,800
So grab the free booze while it lasts.
Come on.

311
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,135
- Uncle Nick?
- What's with the hair?

312
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,731
It's for a show.

313
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,301
- You're a dancer now.
- Yeah, and Dad's not doing leaps.

314
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,578
I thought he'd be in bed...

315
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,980
not joking and pouring champagne.

316
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,513
Amalia.

317
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,614
- Where's Brandon?
- Who cares?

318
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,815
- Nick hasn't told Brandon?
- Nick couldn't handle it.

319
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,884
You lost so much weight.

320
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:26,097
I thought your ass was Jodie Foster's chin.

321
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:29,965
Babe, you know me,
I never miss an opening...

322
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,164
or a closing.

323
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:33,534
You look fantastic.

324
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,972
This a tan, or Ava Gardner's
Show Boat make-up?

325
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,168
"I always look well when I'm near death."

326
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:41,212
Greta Garbo in Camille.
And we move on to Double Jeopardy.

327
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,115
What is this? The Big Chill, or what?

328
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,014
More like The Deep Freeze.

329
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:48,686
I want an unbiased opinion.

330
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:50,379
You.

331
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:53,457
Which of us is tanner?

332
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:58,760
Yes. Monty,
have you met my mother, Amalia?

333
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,398
Wanted to see if you're paying attention.

334
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,799
I'm going to fix the music.

335
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,606
Why don't we sing Christmas carols?

336
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:15,943
What do they sing in Australia?
"We Three Kangaroos"?

337
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:17,277
Oh, man.

338
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:21,814
Quincy.

339
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,391
Don't mind the car. Sit. Speak.

340
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,496
I'm sorry. We're very busy right now.

341
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,563
Don't you have a paper route or something?

342
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:39,064
Brandon.

343
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:41,002
Charlene.

344
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
It's been a while. What are you doing here?

345
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,572
I tried calling you. Nick's sick.
He's having a gathering.

346
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:51,444
We're heading out of town this afternoon.

347
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,144
And he doesn't want me there.

348
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,550
Brandon, it's a farewell party.

349
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:57,554
They did a brain scan.

350
00:22:57,623 --> 00:23:00,990
He has a few days before
his mind's completely gone.

351
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,288
No.

352
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,496
Why does this have to happen now?

353
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:09,163
Of course, he planned this whole thing
to annoy you.

354
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,230
Maybe I can fly back.

355
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,705
There won't be time. Do what you want.

356
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:21,911
What's going on?

357
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,715
- I'm going over to Nick's house.
- For what?

358
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:25,909
He's very sick.

359
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:28,953
Again? Who'll finish directing the scene?

360
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,785
Who cares?
It's not directing, it's animal training.

361
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,222
Stan, take over, will you?

362
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,426
When will you do it?

363
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,096
This Friday night.

364
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:50,903
Not gonna end up like Jim and Jack,
unable to take care of myself.

365
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:53,172
You'll still be alive.

366
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:54,769
You call this living?

367
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,704
I'm too weak to work.

368
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,712
The pain is unbearable.

369
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,183
Look at me. I'm ready.

370
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,089
Sounds like a good idea to me.

371
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:07,983
- Some champagne, dear?
- Sounds simply marvelous.

372
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,455
Here goes my diet.

373
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,054
Hi, Brandon.

374
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,366
- My best piece, so far.
- She's beautiful.

375
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:17,424
That's Liz.

376
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:18,527
Happy birthday.

377
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:21,471
Joe wants us here Saturday
to arrange his body.

378
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:23,232
Arrange?

379
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:26,311
Tony says the Seconals
can cause convulsions.

380
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:30,873
I wouldn't want my family to find me
wearing these crepes.

381
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,251
I'll miss you, Joey.

382
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,249
That's nice of you, darling.

383
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,394
This might not be a pretty picture.
You know that?

384
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:48,189
Come on, Nick, that's enough.

385
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,962
- You sure you can handle this?
- Yes.

386
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,944
Oh, no. What do we do?

387
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:45,549
The pillow.

388
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:46,852
Are you nuts?

389
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,828
Can you imagine waking up after this?
He could be a vegetable.

390
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:00,899
Oh, God.

391
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:05,507
I read in The Final Exit
you should use a plastic bag. I'll get one.

392
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,067
What's Final Exit?

393
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:08,372
It's a book.

394
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:11,907
You wouldn't know it,
because no one's filmed it.

395
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:13,915
I found one.

396
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:22,459
Much better.

397
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,164
Juan, hi. Look, we...

398
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:31,828
- He's still alive.
- No, he's not. No.

399
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:35,839
Give him time. The pills haven't taken effect.
Come on. Call Tony.

400
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:37,900
Calm down, Juan. Come on.

401
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,420
Is he gone?

402
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,122
Yeah.

403
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,330
Who's got a camera?

404
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,138
Joe.

405
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,009
Anybody home?

406
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,380
Elvis has left the building.

407
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,616
Come on.

408
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:29,751
I'm going to miss Joe.

409
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,998
Is this a girl?

410
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,802
- Yes.
- So I'm not the only bitch in the room.

411
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:57,984
Nikko.

412
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,018
Nikko, we're here.

413
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,493
Baby sister.

414
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,393
You only call if it's a matter of life or death.

415
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,164
- I always call you.
- Do not.

416
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,431
Do, too.

417
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:16,497
Thanks for coming, doll face.

418
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,133
Hi, Aunt Fanny.

419
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,541
You still tailgating semis?

420
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,138
They kept losing us, trying to change lanes.

421
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,877
Not easy.

422
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:29,278
- We have to go.
- I thought the plane waited for you.

423
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:31,686
Yeah, but we'll lose our take-off spot.

424
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:33,686
We'll be thinking of you.

425
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,824
Bill.

426
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:37,691
- Goodbye, Nick.
- Take care.

427
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:40,361
Goodbye, Nick.

428
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:41,790
You know...

429
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,927
I love Sara and Bill, but that dog...

430
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,732
Come on, let's go inside.

431
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:55,145
You made it.

432
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:57,708
Can't stay long.

433
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:07,820
Hello, Amalia.

434
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:25,269
- I think dementia is setting in.
- What is the Snow Queen doing here?

435
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:39,888
What a surprise.

436
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:42,425
Charlene told me.

437
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,197
You look great.

438
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:49,829
Live fast, die young,
leave a good-looking corpse.

439
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:53,469
How's Opala?

440
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:55,398
Fine.

441
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,442
I was just heading to the airport.

442
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:03,541
And where are we whisking off to
this holiday season?

443
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:07,483
Australia.
We're shooting the rest of the film there.

444
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,051
You and Junior?

445
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:16,591
You called this morning.
I thought you might want to see me.

446
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:19,930
He's seen you, and it's not a pretty picture.

447
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:24,660
When's your plane?

448
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:26,997
Soon.

449
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:31,039
We were going to say goodbye
to the boys at the firehouse.

450
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:38,639
- You got nerve showing up here.
- Get used to me.

451
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:41,117
Why don't you say goodbye and go?

452
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:46,957
I'll go when I'm good and ready.

453
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,591
You know how to do that so well.

454
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:54,732
- Don't make me run at this wake.
- Let's get a drink or two, or six.

455
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,990
Are you okay, hon?

456
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,771
"He has every characteristic of a dog,
except loyalty."

457
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:07,040
Henry Fonda in The Best Man.

458
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:09,313
Vodka rocks.

459
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:12,544
He looks better than ever.

460
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,777
He's got four, maybe five days.

461
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:18,222
I always figured there'd be time
to talk things through.

462
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,258
Uncle Brandon,
I thought you weren't coming.

463
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:22,190
God, you look so tall.

464
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,227
Tony, make him leave.

465
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,458
He's upsetting Nick,
and my mother's nervous enough.

466
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,627
- It's okay. I'll handle it.
- Okay?

467
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:35,298
- Is your father coming?
- He called. He'll be here any minute.

468
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,039
Will you excuse us?

469
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,038
Nick's family needs to say goodbye
in the time left.

470
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:45,707
What'll happen to him?

471
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:49,353
- You don't want to know.
- What will happen to him?

472
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:53,084
It's Progressive Multifocal
Leukoencephalopathy.

473
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:56,184
It moves fast.
He's already losing his peripheral vision.

474
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,319
And you're here to help?

475
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,596
Brandon...

476
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,536
your being here, it's just adding
a lot of stress and confusion.

477
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:08,095
Do us a favor.
Catch your plane before he gets back.

478
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:09,299
I've a right to be here.

479
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:10,500
You lost that right...

480
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,805
- when you kicked him out.
- Who are you to judge?

481
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,902
- This is between me and Nick.
- What's this?

482
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,310
Looks like one of Nick's art pieces.

483
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:27,814
My God.

484
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,890
It's our friends who have died of AIDS.

485
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:34,888
There's so many of them.

486
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,394
Jim Bixby was first.

487
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:42,599
He and Carl were together for...

488
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:45,074
- How did you stay together for so long?
- Wasn't easy.

489
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:47,270
Two male egos aren't easy to mesh.

490
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:49,241
He died in the hospital...

491
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,282
tubes coming out of everywhere.

492
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:53,078
You're a doctor, right?

493
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:57,019
Ran the AIDS Unit at County
until I couldn't take it anymore.

494
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:58,382
Now I teach.

495
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:00,320
There's different types of AIDS?

496
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,748
No.

497
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,559
Different infections
attack a weak immune system.

498
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,723
With Jack, it was toxoplasmosis.

499
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,459
He decided to die at home.

500
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:18,436
- Can we go outside?
- No, I'm staying here.

501
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,341
And Joey had skin lesions.

502
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:23,540
He took pills,
but he didn't get the dosage right.

503
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,613
Jeez, what happened?

504
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,814
He needed some help.

505
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:30,912
You?

506
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:33,321
I entered medicine to help people.

507
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:34,653
How soon?

508
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,555
Please, just don't make this any harder.

509
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,293
- I'm not leaving till I talk to him.
- He needs his tranquility.

510
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:46,701
Houdini's licking his balls, and Jim says:

511
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:49,968
"I wish I could do that."
I said, "Better pet him first."

512
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,032
So much for tranquility.

513
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,613
I thought you had Australia to go to.

514
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:01,516
- Can we go somewhere to talk?
- Go ahead, talk.

515
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:04,817
What's the plan?

516
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:08,586
Everything's taken care of.
Someone will show you the storyboards.

517
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,786
How soon?

518
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,694
- It was going to be tonight.
- Tonight?

519
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,324
But some friends are coming tomorrow.

520
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,767
I wanted to wait,
but I've got do it before I get too gaga.

521
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:22,705
I could drag a few days as a vegetable.
Guacamole for brains.

522
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,742
- Actually, I think avocado's a fruit.
- So am I.

523
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:32,941
- You still have your sense of tumor.
- Only working part of my immune system.

524
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:34,411
Excuse me.

525
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:37,521
You're going to kill yourself?

526
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:38,578
Andy...

527
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,724
I decided to end it before I become a mess.

528
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:45,291
- How?
- I been storing up Seconals in the safe.

529
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:47,995
Why'd you tell us?
Why didn't you just do it?

530
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:51,433
I wanted you to know
while I'm still working on all cylinders.

531
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,697
Almost all.

532
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:54,135
I think that sucks.

533
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,870
You're pissed off, so you drag us into it.

534
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:58,772
- It's not fair.
- Come back.

535
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,003
Andrew.

536
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,708
Was it something I said?

537
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:05,340
I'm sorry.

538
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:10,010
- He just loves you so much.
- And I love him, and I love you.

539
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:12,419
Didn't you bring me something?

540
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:14,452
- Yes.
- Go and get it for me.

541
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,120
I know how you love getting presents.

542
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,893
How's it going with Rodney?

543
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,265
Not good.

544
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:29,170
He doesn't know how to deal with Andrew.
Things are not great with us.

545
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,673
Then divorce him.

546
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:32,175
We have three kids.

547
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,504
Staying together won't help anybody.

548
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,706
What will I do without you to turn to?

549
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:37,975
You'll be fine.

550
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:42,042
What is this?

551
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:47,357
- My favorite color.
- It's for your ski suit.

552
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,553
So...

553
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,095
is it me?

554
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:52,629
It's perfect.

555
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,927
Nick Stark, coming down the slopes.

556
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:58,863
That's it, Brandon.

557
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:01,201
Good. Left. Right. You're getting it.

558
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,603
That's it.

559
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:05,108
I can't turn in this manner!

560
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:09,476
Shoulder down the fall line, Brandon.
Come on.

561
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,974
Uncle Brandon.

562
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,919
You're doing great. It's the intermediate run.

563
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,821
- But not on my skis.
- Are you all right, Brandon?

564
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,859
Race you guys to the bottom.

565
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:25,055
You're doing fine. Come on now, follow me.

566
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,791
No. You're such a sadist.

567
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,930
Look to your left. Good, now to your right.

568
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,368
Relax, you tense guy, you.

569
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:36,736
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

570
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,799
Come on, let's sit down.

571
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:46,577
What will it take for you two to talk?

572
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:51,018
Time heals all wounds.

573
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:56,824
Why is everyone treating him
like he's a goddamn saint?

574
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:59,557
He acts like it's a joke, like he doesn't care.

575
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,292
It seems that way, I know.

576
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:04,335
You don't care either. You used to call.
We used to hang out.

577
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:06,927
It felt weird calling after Nick and I broke up.

578
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,200
He's so close to your mom.

579
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:15,402
Uncle Brandon, why'd you break up?

580
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:20,978
It's complicated.

581
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,447
When he got sick, I guess...

582
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:25,045
I got scared.

583
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,651
Mom said you didn't get it.

584
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:31,327
But you did, didn't you?
You're gonna die, too.

585
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:32,693
I'm okay.

586
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:36,329
Sometimes one person gets it,
and not the other.

587
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,062
They don't know why.

588
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,774
So, what've you been up to lately?

589
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,038
I'm dancing...

590
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,481
in this performance piece
with my boyfriend's band.

591
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,050
What do you do in it exactly?

592
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:01,656
Most of the time, I'm suspended from wires.

593
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:04,558
- Has your father seen this?
- No.

594
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:06,924
I don't think he'd like it.

595
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,260
Why not?

596
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,526
I'm not wearing very much.

597
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:16,572
Levon.

598
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:31,980
Daph?

599
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,923
I want to make sure
that Mom is taken care of.

600
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:38,451
Tony knows,
but I'm telling you, just in case.

601
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,362
It's important...

602
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,730
I'm cremated quickly,
otherwise the insurance won't...

603
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,769
No, don't talk about it.

604
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:02,142
I can't get over how brave you are.

605
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:04,614
What's the choice, Brandon?

606
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,786
It ain't going away.

607
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,496
I can't read the fucking numbers.

608
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:19,203
I don't even remember
how to dial this thing.

609
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:23,130
Relax.

610
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:27,244
There are people here to help you.

611
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,614
I might as well have a cigarette.
It's not going to kill me, right?

612
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,456
Why did you come?

613
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,828
We were a big part of each other's lives.

614
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:49,423
But you ended that.

615
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,559
It's time for him to be with his family.

616
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:54,196
- You don't know what happened.
- It doesn't matter.

617
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:55,933
Can't you see, you upset him?

618
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:59,568
He wants me here.
He's acting like he doesn't, but he does.

619
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:02,169
I've known my brother longer than you have.

620
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:04,180
And he wants you to go.

621
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,681
I disagree.

622
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:09,787
What do dildos and soy beans
have in common?

623
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:10,843
What?

624
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:13,186
They're both meat substitutes.

625
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,452
What is a dildo?

626
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:19,823
Nikko, does all your humor
have to be gross?

627
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,421
Lighten up, Aunt Fanny.

628
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:23,933
I'm operating on a single T-cell.

629
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:28,633
Would you like my car?

630
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:31,937
I need another car
like I need a hole in the head.

631
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:35,103
Champagne.

632
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:43,309
Announcing the arrival of Air Brazil.

633
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,117
- Soli's here.
- And not in drag, for once.

634
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,956
- Are those your real eyebrows?
- They're fake, like your tan.

635
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:54,227
And this from someone
with Betty Boop spit curls.

636
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:55,856
So, is it true?

637
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,359
Yeah.

638
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:06,409
Sit.

639
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:13,410
Rodney.

640
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:18,245
How are you? So good to see you.
Let me get you a drink.

641
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,950
He looks fine.

642
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:25,953
He isn't.

643
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:29,395
Those are for you, drink...

644
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,662
Darling, look who I brought to your party.

645
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,762
Claudette Colbert and Leslie Gore.

646
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,773
- This is for you.
- Both for me?

647
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:37,967
No.

648
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,270
Cheers.

649
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:41,506
Give me one of those.

650
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,871
Making yourself at home?

651
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,741
It isn't easy.

652
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:52,084
Nick's a very loyal person.

653
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:54,351
Don't smoke the cigarette.

654
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:57,792
I know that my being here is hard for you.
I'm sorry.

655
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,254
I love him, too.

656
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,890
Prove that. Go in there and tell him.

657
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,798
Don't give her cigarettes.

658
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,861
I don't display my feelings in public.

659
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,737
I doubt if you display them in private.

660
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:19,376
So cute.

661
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:23,984
There's Yiayia.

662
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:27,149
Yeah, that was taken after Grandpa died.

663
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:28,986
No, it wasn't.

664
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,119
Doll face, the black dress.

665
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,662
You're right.

666
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:37,893
Imagine having to wear a black dress,
every day in the Greek sun.

667
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,597
Forget about it.

668
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,537
- Why is that one torn in half?
- Dad was in the shot.

669
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,603
The ancient past.

670
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:50,572
I think it's time to hand out presents.

671
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,308
Monty, for you.

672
00:42:58,623 --> 00:42:59,920
Nick.

673
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,757
It's Macaulay Culkin
throwing up a soft-shell crab.

674
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:09,527
- Were you on acid when you did this?
- No drug talk in front of Mama.

675
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,431
I took acid once...

676
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:16,767
when I was pregnant with you.

677
00:43:21,178 --> 00:43:22,440
Mama...

678
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,204
this one is for you.

679
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:31,153
- Open it, Amalia, let's see.
- No.

680
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,855
Charlene...

681
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,921
- for you.
- Finally. Thank you.

682
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:42,491
Aunt Fanny, it's small but expensive.

683
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:47,360
I made this for you, Mom.

684
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,575
I'll never take it off.

685
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,909
I should have the Chinese food.

686
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:59,142
Lina, it's breakable.

687
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,516
Thank you.

688
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:07,019
"Don we now our gay apparel."

689
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:09,355
That's sweet. I'm never gonna fit into this.

690
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,292
That's why God invented shoehorns.

691
00:44:11,362 --> 00:44:13,694
Why don't you just die already?

692
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,770
And this one is for you.

693
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:21,895
It's an original Mitoraj.

694
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:25,175
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. I love you.

695
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:28,777
- It's very beautiful.
- You know, I got that in Italy.

696
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:32,414
Which reminds me,
I have 50,000 frequent-flyer miles.

697
00:44:32,483 --> 00:44:34,781
Let's go to lbiza.

698
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:39,751
Your father's here.

699
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,752
Paul?

700
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,660
You are the last person
I expected to show up.

701
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:47,959
Hi, Dad.

702
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:52,231
Next to last.

703
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:55,602
How's your girlfriend?

704
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:57,072
She's fine.

705
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,435
We sent you a Christmas card
last year, remember?

706
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,500
I got it.

707
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:04,514
"Love, Paul and DeeDee,"
in her handwriting.

708
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:07,574
Amalia, aren't you going to say hi?

709
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:14,347
Hello, Amalia.

710
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:17,150
What are you doing here?

711
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,888
He's my son, too.

712
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:22,425
Mr. Stark, I'm Charlene Lee.

713
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:24,498
Let's get you a drink.

714
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:28,060
Did you see the latest house Nick designed?
It's gonna be in a magazine.

715
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:30,607
What're we waiting for?
Let's get out the good stuff.

716
00:45:30,674 --> 00:45:32,266
What a good idea.

717
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:36,279
He didn't come over to me.
I didn't even shake his hand.

718
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:39,315
Give it time. I know he's happy to see you.

719
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:41,644
Greg, you made it.

720
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:43,243
What can I get you?

721
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,788
Just water, please. I don't drink.

722
00:45:57,401 --> 00:45:59,926
- Alex. Hi.
- This is Nick, and this is Tony.

723
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:03,440
Come on, you guys,
we're bringing out the good stuff. Help us.

724
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:06,169
Let's get some caviar.
Does Le Dome deliver?

725
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,108
I think we could talk them into it.

726
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:10,079
Cool, let's work on that.

727
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:12,138
- Who needs a drink?
- I do.

728
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,748
Just beer for me.

729
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:21,149
- Not too much for Nick.
- Look out, it's Nurse Ratched.

730
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,523
- You need a nap.
- A nap? Tony...

731
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,619
I'll be sleeping soon enough.

732
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:27,186
Easy.

733
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:29,332
He's my brother.

734
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,992
I'm her brother.

735
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:33,227
This is my drink.

736
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:36,199
- Who elected him God?
- Where'd you guys meet?

737
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:39,265
- We met at 30,000 feet.
- 30,000 feet?

738
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:41,641
You're not members
of the Mile High Club, are you?

739
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,249
I can't believe you're still smoking.

740
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,275
It's the only thing that calms me down.

741
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:51,184
But you should really stop, Mom.

742
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,452
Greg, Santa Claus came early,
and dropped off something...

743
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:57,221
- to stuff your stocking?
- Little?

744
00:46:57,895 --> 00:46:59,726
Do you think it's my fault?

745
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:02,163
No, I don't want...

746
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,431
Is it some kind of punishment?

747
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,465
You've been a great mother.

748
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,340
Take the whole pack.

749
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,649
- It's Ken and Ken.
- Something tells me you want to be Barbie.

750
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:33,196
I have been calling the wrong 976 numbers.

751
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:36,292
Why don't you try 976-HAIR?

752
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,361
Paramedic vans to look at
emergency hairstylists.

753
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:43,565
Okay, let's play the quiet game.
Monty, you start.

754
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,462
Who is that man?

755
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:19,100
- Monty Tipton, he's an agent.
- Does he handle any stars?

756
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:22,805
Once Tony and I were houseguests
at Nick and Brandon's...

757
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,372
and you know how some hotels
put a chocolate on your pillow?

758
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,714
We looked at it and said, "How thoughtful."

759
00:48:28,786 --> 00:48:32,119
We had a closer look and
it turned out that a dog had taken a dump.

760
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:35,991
Dad, how come everybody's acting normal?

761
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,095
That's what Nick wants.

762
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:46,166
This is the first time
you've seen me drink beer.

763
00:48:47,371 --> 00:48:48,497
Yeah.

764
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,571
Is it okay?

765
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:54,170
You're asking me about beer?

766
00:48:56,847 --> 00:49:00,408
Damian Knowles. He's a theater producer.
This is Tony Zamara.

767
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:02,313
- Hello.
- Hello.

768
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:06,083
Is he really going to go through with this?

769
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:08,249
- It is not right.
- Don't start up here.

770
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:10,156
Someone must talk him out of it.

771
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:13,958
- Don't you dare fucking try.
- There you are. Nick wants you.

772
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:16,163
Excuse me.

773
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:20,770
How are you doing?

774
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:24,865
It's my worst nightmare.
Do me a favor. Don't make a scene, okay?

775
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,938
Once Damian gets going, he's relentless.

776
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:31,914
Can't let him loose in the house.

777
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,814
He gets a bowl of dry food in the morning,
and a bowl of dry food at night.

778
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,219
Tony, are you going to remember this?

779
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,416
Yeah.

780
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:43,090
Grab a pen, and write this down.

781
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:45,127
Tony isn't living here?

782
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:49,155
Earth to Brandon,
Nick's been living alone for the past year.

783
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:51,999
He and the dog next door love each other.

784
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:55,095
They always fight.
Can't let them be left alone with each other.

785
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:56,730
Give me a kiss.

786
00:49:57,908 --> 00:49:59,398
Good boy.

787
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,107
How do you know Nick?

788
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,545
I'm his father.

789
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,105
I'm so sorry.

790
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:09,784
What I meant was,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

791
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,350
- Hey, Marshall.
- How you doing?

792
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:16,884
- What's that?
- Remember that?

793
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,327
God, I'd forgotten I was your best man.

794
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:24,493
I'm fine. Nice to meet you, then.

795
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:27,662
You lost it from the hip,
and gained it in the soul.

796
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:34,567
You'll be battling the body fat,
which is one of your charms.

797
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:37,073
I like your shirt though.

798
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:39,411
Yeah, it's got that '70s look.

799
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:47,118
I'm worried that he's in danger.
And I don't want him to be in danger.

800
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:49,523
- You want him to practice safe sex.
- Yes, I do.

801
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,891
Do you know that he's not
practicing safe sex?

802
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:53,623
We don't talk about that.

803
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:56,461
If I mention something like that...

804
00:50:56,533 --> 00:51:00,936
I would say, commercials. You know...

805
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:05,268
He could be the personification
of Cottonelle toilet paper.

806
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:07,105
Fluffy, soft.

807
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:10,544
- You liked the idea of commercials?
- Or some kind of fabric softener.

808
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:15,046
Have you seen Leo, or whatever this kid is
he's been hanging around with?

809
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,782
- I don't know anything about it.
- He's got purple hair, and looks like he...

810
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:21,825
rolled home through the gutter.

811
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:25,988
Anyway, I don't know what he's doing.
I can't talk to him.

812
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,262
No, thanks.

813
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,592
Birds and bees are fine,
but bees and bees, I don't know.

814
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:35,504
Rodney.

815
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,808
You want me to talk to him, Rodney?

816
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,439
It would mean a lot, coming from you.

817
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,408
I rushed over,
because I heard it's going to be tonight.

818
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,813
Now he's extending another day.

819
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:48,841
Brandon.

820
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:51,813
- Everybody here knows.
- Yes.

821
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,650
I'll have to discuss this in confession.

822
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:58,786
So I can't take the sacrament
without confessing that I was here...

823
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:01,729
knew what was going on,
and didn't try to do something.

824
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:03,892
Do I have to escort you out of here?

825
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,696
You're not too bright.

826
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:07,600
I like that in a man.

827
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,565
My mother has drapes in that fabric.

828
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,639
How're you getting along
with your folks these days?

829
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:15,837
Okay.

830
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:19,543
They think I don't know
they're splitting up.

831
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,748
Dad sends me to church,
hoping I'll become straight.

832
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,947
Catholic church? Good luck.

833
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:27,547
I mean, your Dad'll come around.

834
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:28,886
He will.

835
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:31,519
Didn't Brandon give you this?

836
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,586
Yeah. Here, you want it?

837
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:37,167
Looks great. Red, blond hair, can't beat it.

838
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:40,363
What happened with you guys?

839
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:43,396
You've heard how opposites attract?

840
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:46,105
They also repel.

841
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:52,309
Ever since I was a little kid,
I remember how much you loved each other.

842
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:53,610
Really?

843
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:56,942
People grow at different paces.

844
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,387
It's hard to tell who's in the right,
or who's in the wrong.

845
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,391
Sometimes you just...

846
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:05,155
got to go with your instincts,
you know what I mean?

847
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:07,891
Look at this. I never even wore these.

848
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:13,200
So, I hear you have a boyfriend.

849
00:53:17,174 --> 00:53:19,404
- His name is Lion.
- He's cute.

850
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,334
He's in a band.

851
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:23,208
Excrement Sacrament.

852
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,979
Dad hates the name.

853
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,447
He's right.

854
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,947
You guys are using condoms, aren't you?

855
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,453
- Yeah.
- Sure?

856
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:34,187
Good. Very important.

857
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:37,183
I'm out of here, and so...

858
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:41,027
I'm going to give you these.
Now, these are $300 shirts.

859
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,625
This one is.

860
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,635
You're being a good girl
for Grandma, honey?

861
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,096
Yeah.

862
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:52,398
We will all be there for Christmas.

863
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:55,044
Nice gift for the Lion.

864
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,343
When you need somebody to talk to...

865
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:03,545
I want you to call Brandon.

866
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:06,583
He loves you very much, and he'll help you.

867
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:08,648
Don't do it, Uncle Nick.

868
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:10,457
I have to.

869
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:14,260
Stay a few more days.

870
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:16,896
In a few more days...

871
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:18,691
I won't be me.

872
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:28,302
I hear you're leaving for Australia.

873
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:30,807
I'm scheduled to fly tonight.

874
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:37,619
My sister wants me in the kitchen.

875
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:41,616
- Andrew, you're going to come with...
- Excuse me?

876
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:44,354
We went through this. He's drinking now.

877
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:46,089
Just leave him alone.

878
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:49,599
We're leaving at 10:30 p.m.,
to see your grandmother, in Philadelphia.

879
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,657
- I'm staying with Mom.
- No, you're not.

880
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:54,067
- More water.
- What can I do?

881
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:57,470
- Why don't you relax in the living room?
- Yes, Paul.

882
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:02,037
So it's okay if we take your credit cards
on a shopping spree?

883
00:55:02,114 --> 00:55:03,741
That's a good idea.

884
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:06,307
- We'll come and pick them up tomorrow.
- Okay, Greg.

885
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:09,252
- What time does the party resume?
- Same time, same station.

886
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:11,551
Right. Nice meeting you, Tony.

887
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:14,488
- See you, Alex.
- All right, see you.

888
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,393
Greg, drive carefully. You've been drinking.

889
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:22,329
- You're not going with them?
- No.

890
00:55:22,401 --> 00:55:24,096
- I'm staying.
- I wanna stay, too.

891
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,432
Andrew...

892
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:28,905
your grandmother's expecting you.
Don't let her down.

893
00:55:30,342 --> 00:55:32,902
I want you to take care of yourself.

894
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,208
Do it for me, okay?

895
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:42,816
And you.

896
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,619
You're really going to do this?

897
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:49,718
Rodney, I wouldn't do it if I didn't have to.

898
00:55:55,568 --> 00:55:58,002
I don't want to give you my cold.

899
00:56:01,473 --> 00:56:03,134
- Take care.
- Okay.

900
00:56:09,882 --> 00:56:11,406
Let's go party.

901
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:13,214
Let's go.

902
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,981
It's the '60s.
I, myself, am too young to remember.

903
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:23,358
I was such a big fat pig,
before he got on my case.

904
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:24,961
You weren't that bad.

905
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,828
Come on. I was a fat fag-hag...

906
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,433
afraid nobody would go out with me.

907
00:56:30,502 --> 00:56:32,663
Nick taught me self-respect.

908
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:35,968
I just flashed
on what life will be like without him.

909
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:37,905
Will he go through with it?

910
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,810
You ever known Nick
to back out of anything?

911
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,111
Does it take the whole Nile
to quench your thirst?

912
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:47,950
Drunkenness is...

913
00:56:48,187 --> 00:56:50,917
- temporary suicide.
- Hear, hear.

914
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:53,152
The Greeks said:

915
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,954
"It's not horrible to die.
It is horrible to die alone."

916
00:56:57,029 --> 00:56:58,929
In the gay community...

917
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,262
you get to choose your family.

918
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:03,326
And he chose us.

919
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:05,529
Nick always had good taste.

920
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:10,535
Just remember, kiddies, "no matter where
you go, or what you do, you're gonna die."

921
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:11,803
Moonstruck.

922
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:14,710
Maybe dying's like waking up from a dream.

923
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:16,872
So you believe in suicide?

924
00:57:17,549 --> 00:57:18,607
No.

925
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:21,382
I believe in choice.

926
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:25,288
I was raised a Catholic.
I wouldn't take my own life.

927
00:57:27,192 --> 00:57:30,923
Dying in agony, stuck everywhere with
tubes, is something you'd put up with?

928
00:57:30,996 --> 00:57:34,022
I know I'd rather not.
But I wouldn't take my life.

929
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:35,726
What's going on?

930
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:39,029
The man wrapped in newspaper
is reading a newspaper.

931
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:41,171
I don't get it. What is that again?

932
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,971
- It's conceptual art.
- Conceptual art. Please.

933
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,673
Try hiding your peepee inside of a dress
for Mardi Gras. That is art.

934
00:57:48,747 --> 00:57:51,648
How anyone can support suicide
is beyond me.

935
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:55,409
You'd be surprised how many people
are helping behind the scenes.

936
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,217
Even doctors.

937
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:00,281
- Wasn't this in Santorini?
- Yes.

938
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:03,986
This thing's expensive.
Don't ever call it a paper plate.

939
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:07,188
I'm sorry, I had a little too much.

940
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:16,403
What is that? Where'd you get that from?

941
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:18,405
The secret clubhouse.

942
00:58:18,477 --> 00:58:20,308
Where's Spanky and Buckwheat?

943
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:23,280
- What's this?
- Already they're planning your retrospective.

944
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:24,509
That old junk.

945
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:28,314
- It's brilliant.
- Knock off the modesty bullshit.

946
00:58:28,387 --> 00:58:32,153
I remember when you used to practice
your signature, in case you became famous.

947
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:33,748
That's one less worry.

948
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:37,956
Why don't you just sign everything quick?
Death is a great career move for an artist.

949
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,430
Nick, are you sure
you're doing the right thing?

950
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:41,989
- Hello, Damian.
- Hi.

951
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:43,466
About what?

952
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:46,363
It's God's decision when we die.

953
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:47,905
I told you to leave him...

954
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:50,498
No, it's okay, let him talk. Go ahead.

955
00:58:50,576 --> 00:58:52,203
Have you...

956
00:58:52,277 --> 00:58:55,906
Have you thought of the significance
of what you're doing?

957
00:58:57,549 --> 00:58:59,039
Why, I hadn't.

958
00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:01,415
I really appreciate your reminding me.

959
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:04,320
I really needed a moral crisis about now.

960
00:59:04,723 --> 00:59:07,590
If I buy your pamphlet, will you fuck off?

961
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:09,055
No, stop.

962
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:11,519
Who is this guy?

963
00:59:11,597 --> 00:59:13,963
- I'm only trying to help.
- It's best to shut up.

964
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:17,127
I appreciate your concern,
but don't worry about me. I am fine.

965
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:19,295
I just can't find my keys.

966
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:22,169
So, you and me, we go find the keys.

967
00:59:22,241 --> 00:59:23,503
Come on.

968
00:59:25,077 --> 00:59:27,602
I want you to leave him alone.

969
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,105
I wonder which is braver.

970
00:59:30,249 --> 00:59:33,013
Taking a life, or not taking it.

971
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:36,320
Get the hell out of here, Damian.

972
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:41,760
Thank you, Dr. Kevorkian.

973
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:46,225
- Damian, I'm sorry, but I warned you.
- I just hate what...

974
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:52,294
I just hate to see him go.

975
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,637
It's the most comfortable bed in the world.

976
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:02,874
You'll see it folds out really nicely.
This'll give you a little privacy.

977
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:04,074
Paul.

978
01:00:10,089 --> 01:00:11,181
So...

979
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:14,657
- when's the last time you were together?
- The day he walked out on me.

980
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:17,388
- I didn't walk out on you.
- Now you're back.

981
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:20,261
- You're pretending to be his father?
- I am his father.

982
01:00:20,332 --> 01:00:22,823
You haven't been his father for 20 years.

983
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:25,734
If you had been his father,
none of this would have happened.

984
01:00:25,804 --> 01:00:27,328
Would you ever think of that?

985
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:30,500
Maybe he wouldn't have turned gay.
Maybe he wouldn't be so sick.

986
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:32,168
Did you ever think of that?

987
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:35,042
- I think Nick's lucky.
- Lucky?

988
01:00:35,114 --> 01:00:38,641
He's wrapping up unfinished business
with everyone he loves.

989
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:42,244
Will you be here tomorrow?

990
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:46,419
Nick and I need to work things out.

991
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:47,885
Honey...

992
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,019
it would take years...

993
01:00:50,095 --> 01:00:52,689
years for you to work things out.

994
01:00:52,764 --> 01:00:54,129
He's got hours.

995
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:56,759
Why don't you leave him with people
who really care?

996
01:00:56,835 --> 01:00:58,462
Fuck you. I care about him.

997
01:00:58,537 --> 01:00:59,799
How about you?

998
01:00:59,872 --> 01:01:01,362
Doting on him...

999
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,773
- treating him like he's a mama's boy...
- Stop with all your arguing.

1000
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:06,071
Christ.

1001
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:07,840
Haven't you heard?

1002
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:10,548
It's in the genes.

1003
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:12,416
Designer genes.

1004
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:14,475
You want to take this...

1005
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,447
and you want to turn it into a star turn.

1006
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,224
The lover returns.

1007
01:01:21,293 --> 01:01:23,227
Let me tell you something, honey.

1008
01:01:23,295 --> 01:01:25,729
It's been done. And better.

1009
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:27,424
You're pathetic.

1010
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:32,435
Monty, that was a bit harsh.

1011
01:01:32,504 --> 01:01:35,064
"Way down deep, I'm very superficial."

1012
01:01:37,576 --> 01:01:38,804
Anyone?

1013
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:40,805
Julia.

1014
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:44,946
I won't do it.

1015
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:48,544
I won't spend a night
in the same house with him.

1016
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,050
Fanny's already called a cab.

1017
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,148
Here it is, Ma.

1018
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:55,453
Good night, Daphne.

1019
01:01:55,527 --> 01:01:57,290
Good night, Amalia.

1020
01:02:00,866 --> 01:02:02,561
Come on, let's go.

1021
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,972
You've been drinking.

1022
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:15,104
You've always hated
the smell of alcohol on my breath.

1023
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,909
- Fanny!
- Be careful, Paul.

1024
01:02:16,982 --> 01:02:19,917
- It's difficult.
- Yes, we all understand.

1025
01:02:19,985 --> 01:02:21,612
Now you see why.

1026
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,923
I didn't know how to...

1027
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:29,153
stop being mad at you, Nick.

1028
01:02:29,394 --> 01:02:30,520
At me?

1029
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:36,797
You kicked me out,
and you left me to die alone...

1030
01:02:37,169 --> 01:02:40,627
away from the home I built,
even away from my dog.

1031
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,599
Don't be a prick. I didn't dump you.

1032
01:02:43,976 --> 01:02:45,807
It was a shock for me, too.

1033
01:02:45,877 --> 01:02:47,572
I needed time to adjust.

1034
01:02:47,646 --> 01:02:49,477
And you really tried.

1035
01:02:49,915 --> 01:02:51,109
I did.

1036
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:55,075
We stopped making love,
but I stayed with you.

1037
01:02:56,855 --> 01:03:00,154
I think you were jealous of me,
for not being sick.

1038
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:02,620
You were jealous
of anyone who came near me.

1039
01:03:02,694 --> 01:03:04,127
I wasn't jealous.

1040
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,562
You're Greek, you can't help it.

1041
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:08,197
I'm dying.

1042
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:10,899
Why should I care what you say?

1043
01:03:12,537 --> 01:03:14,368
You pushed me away...

1044
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:19,605
because you were afraid
that I would abandon you.

1045
01:03:21,847 --> 01:03:23,872
I wouldn't have left you.

1046
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,013
We'll never really know now, will we?

1047
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:32,552
Do you want me...

1048
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:35,320
to cancel my flight
and come back tomorrow?

1049
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,520
What?

1050
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:38,890
Do what you want.

1051
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:41,828
You'll either be here, or not.

1052
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:44,067
Like always.

1053
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:54,673
No.

1054
01:03:54,946 --> 01:03:56,436
What's wrong?

1055
01:03:57,549 --> 01:03:58,777
Nothing.

1056
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,588
You're going to love going to court.

1057
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:09,116
I am not walking off into the sunset,
leaving my mother empty-handed.

1058
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,937
I guess this is it.

1059
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:27,801
I can't do it.

1060
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:30,771
I can't leave.

1061
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:38,182
It's for the best.

1062
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,287
We tried to make it work, but we just...

1063
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:45,853
We just can't.

1064
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:49,925
This is my home.

1065
01:04:57,442 --> 01:05:00,036
Your new place will become your home.

1066
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:04,774
Can I come back here to die?

1067
01:07:51,516 --> 01:07:53,313
Good morning, Amalia.

1068
01:07:57,522 --> 01:07:59,114
What's all this?

1069
01:08:03,128 --> 01:08:06,757
You used to say,
"I don't believe in that religious crap."

1070
01:08:10,802 --> 01:08:12,292
Couldn't hurt.

1071
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:28,181
You know what you ought to do?

1072
01:08:29,187 --> 01:08:32,679
You ought to go back to making
that kind of jewelry you used to make.

1073
01:08:32,757 --> 01:08:34,384
God, it was good.

1074
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:42,122
Remember not to look down all the time.

1075
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,191
Keep your eyes up. Okay?

1076
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:46,562
Okay?

1077
01:08:47,906 --> 01:08:49,965
Nikko, please don't leave me.

1078
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:52,168
I can't make it without you.

1079
01:08:56,514 --> 01:08:58,482
You're going to have to.

1080
01:09:08,893 --> 01:09:11,828
Do I smell hot onion bagels,
or did you sleep in that shirt?

1081
01:09:11,896 --> 01:09:14,262
Yes, it's me, Monty. I'm at Nick's house.

1082
01:09:14,332 --> 01:09:17,324
I want you to bring me a fresh shirt
and a new tongue.

1083
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,132
No, just come over as soon as you can.

1084
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:27,476
You look pretty hung-over
for someone who doesn't drink.

1085
01:09:27,545 --> 01:09:30,241
I'm having little problems with my vision.

1086
01:09:30,315 --> 01:09:33,011
Pieces are missing, like blank spots.

1087
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:35,075
You give me some of that?

1088
01:09:35,387 --> 01:09:36,786
Who are you?

1089
01:09:37,555 --> 01:09:39,045
You're my dad.

1090
01:09:42,427 --> 01:09:46,090
This is richness worth a second cup,
Charlene. How do you do it?

1091
01:09:46,164 --> 01:09:49,224
Nick never asked for a second cup
of my coffee.

1092
01:09:50,635 --> 01:09:52,296
How are you doing?

1093
01:10:01,446 --> 01:10:02,970
Come on, Opala.

1094
01:10:05,383 --> 01:10:07,374
Lina and I almost made it once.

1095
01:10:07,452 --> 01:10:08,544
What?

1096
01:10:09,154 --> 01:10:11,679
We had this electric moment
when you said to me:

1097
01:10:11,756 --> 01:10:13,849
"Why'd you have to be gay?"

1098
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:15,415
I said to you:

1099
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:17,757
"Me? Why do you have to be a woman?"

1100
01:10:20,131 --> 01:10:21,996
Here's some Thai food.

1101
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,130
You can always use more with this crowd.

1102
01:10:26,137 --> 01:10:27,661
You're staying?

1103
01:10:28,206 --> 01:10:29,298
Yeah.

1104
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:31,665
He always loved this dog.

1105
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,802
He's out in the back yard.

1106
01:10:34,879 --> 01:10:36,073
Thanks.

1107
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:41,783
I had an electric moment with her.
She's not a woman.

1108
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,555
Who's that?

1109
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:49,893
- Brandon.
- Oh, God, he's back.

1110
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:51,290
And Opala.

1111
01:10:51,362 --> 01:10:52,989
Come on, Houdini.

1112
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:55,690
Opala. You met Houdini, haven't you?

1113
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,234
Sure she has.

1114
01:10:57,302 --> 01:10:58,326
Hi.

1115
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,037
You showed up.

1116
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:03,199
- How do you like my brand new shoes?
- Nice.

1117
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:06,069
They were expensive, too. I thought...

1118
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:08,103
I should use them.

1119
01:11:08,179 --> 01:11:10,374
What kind of a name is Opala?

1120
01:11:10,448 --> 01:11:12,245
"Opala" means "trash" in Hawaiian.

1121
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:15,411
They found her in a garbage bag
by the roadside.

1122
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:17,384
- For you.
- Thanks.

1123
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:19,285
Don't you miss them?

1124
01:11:19,724 --> 01:11:21,248
I miss a lot of things.

1125
01:11:21,326 --> 01:11:24,921
When Opala was a puppy,
she used to sleep in between them.

1126
01:11:24,996 --> 01:11:26,395
Lucky bitch.

1127
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:29,664
I got this for you a while back.

1128
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:36,264
A sundial watch?

1129
01:11:38,977 --> 01:11:41,241
So is this out of one of your catalogs?

1130
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:42,973
What do you think?

1131
01:11:43,748 --> 01:11:46,273
This'll come in handy
for the next seven hours.

1132
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:48,182
- Nick, listen...
- Nick.

1133
01:11:49,053 --> 01:11:50,179
Matt.

1134
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:53,889
How are you, man? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

1135
01:11:54,325 --> 01:11:56,520
- For you.
- That's a pathetic poinsettia.

1136
01:11:56,594 --> 01:11:59,028
Babe, welcome to Christmas in LA...

1137
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:01,565
where Santa has sweat stains.

1138
01:12:01,633 --> 01:12:03,157
How's New York?

1139
01:12:03,735 --> 01:12:05,600
- Brandon's here?
- Sure.

1140
01:12:06,004 --> 01:12:09,235
You want to see the finishing touches
at the site?

1141
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:17,040
You mean, the latest house he designed.

1142
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:18,412
I'd love to see it.

1143
01:12:18,483 --> 01:12:19,882
Could we go?

1144
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:23,412
Wait now, we can't take a whole group.

1145
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:24,887
Can I come?

1146
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:27,155
If you want.

1147
01:12:27,225 --> 01:12:29,125
Why don't I take you some other time?

1148
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:30,661
- Oh, sure.
- Let's go.

1149
01:12:30,728 --> 01:12:33,060
This needs water. You take this.

1150
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:35,832
- I'll be back.
- Should I do the kitchen?

1151
01:12:36,434 --> 01:12:40,200
- I guess we didn't make the A-list.
- For this I flew five hours?

1152
01:12:40,271 --> 01:12:41,932
Let's get a drink.

1153
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:45,769
Does my hair look like one of the seagulls
from the Exxon Valdez oil spill?

1154
01:12:45,844 --> 01:12:47,436
I meant to tell you that.

1155
01:12:50,014 --> 01:12:52,505
Nick, we've done some great work together.

1156
01:12:52,584 --> 01:12:54,449
It ain't over for you.

1157
01:12:54,552 --> 01:12:57,749
I get to walk away,
but you gotta keep on slaving.

1158
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:02,183
I've always been amazed...

1159
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:05,386
at the way you see things.

1160
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:08,865
Does the client know
I'm checking out today?

1161
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,024
No.

1162
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:12,533
When he finds out I've kicked...

1163
01:13:12,604 --> 01:13:16,233
you should jack up the price
based on the sympathy factor.

1164
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:21,242
Here we are.

1165
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:25,143
They're finishing up the kitchen today.

1166
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:37,055
Come on.

1167
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,729
I'll be right back.

1168
01:13:47,138 --> 01:13:48,935
This is unbelievable.

1169
01:13:50,742 --> 01:13:52,937
This reminds me of Santorini.

1170
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,535
Do you like it?

1171
01:13:54,812 --> 01:13:55,904
Yeah.

1172
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,240
So...

1173
01:13:57,515 --> 01:14:00,746
- you and Tony aren't living together?
- No, we're just friends.

1174
01:14:00,818 --> 01:14:02,251
For a while now.

1175
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,878
What about you?

1176
01:14:04,055 --> 01:14:05,386
You were...

1177
01:14:05,456 --> 01:14:07,754
very perceptive about Zack.

1178
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:15,458
I was just thinking about
that trip to Lake Tahoe.

1179
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:17,329
Remember?

1180
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:20,633
You were teaching me how to ski.

1181
01:14:20,705 --> 01:14:23,435
I was giving you such a hard time.

1182
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:29,006
You were so patient with me.

1183
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:35,352
You remember when I finally got it...

1184
01:14:36,621 --> 01:14:39,590
and we skied down the hill together...

1185
01:14:40,925 --> 01:14:42,119
just...

1186
01:14:42,727 --> 01:14:45,093
swirling through the powder...

1187
01:14:46,464 --> 01:14:48,329
laughing and shouting?

1188
01:14:51,803 --> 01:14:53,930
Nobody connects like we did.

1189
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:00,476
Switch gyms, you'll find somebody.

1190
01:15:00,578 --> 01:15:02,478
Stop it, Nick. Stop it.

1191
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:04,839
We're running out of time.

1192
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,379
It's not my fault.

1193
01:15:09,153 --> 01:15:10,916
We better get going.

1194
01:15:11,422 --> 01:15:14,357
They'll be pissed at me for taking him away.

1195
01:15:27,705 --> 01:15:28,967
Hi, honey.

1196
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,440
Brandon, you've met my wife, Pat.

1197
01:15:33,378 --> 01:15:35,209
My favorite cousin.

1198
01:15:36,347 --> 01:15:37,678
Excuse me.

1199
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:40,475
What's the idea of leaving the party
without telling me?

1200
01:15:40,551 --> 01:15:43,281
So sorry, Mommy. I'll never do it again.

1201
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:45,155
Don't wander.

1202
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,119
Awake at the wake.

1203
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:51,821
You're wearing the same thing
you had on yesterday?

1204
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:53,124
I stayed.

1205
01:15:53,197 --> 01:15:55,392
Holding a torch on the porch.

1206
01:15:56,534 --> 01:15:58,900
Didn't you spend the night with Alex?

1207
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,063
Feeling vibrant near his hydrant.

1208
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:03,334
Didn't you think he was cute?

1209
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:06,574
- You two aren't really serious?
- Hardly.

1210
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:08,339
- How's Nick?
- Doing okay.

1211
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:10,904
- Are you holding up?
- I'm glad to see you.

1212
01:16:10,982 --> 01:16:13,473
- Who are all these people?
- Nick's friends.

1213
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:15,678
I've never seen them before.

1214
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,751
I want you to get them to go.

1215
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:19,881
- He invited...
- Every single one of them.

1216
01:16:19,957 --> 01:16:21,925
- I'll see what I can do.
- Don't see.

1217
01:16:21,993 --> 01:16:25,793
Get them the hell out of this house.
My son is going to die.

1218
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,259
I want to have time with him.

1219
01:16:32,203 --> 01:16:33,261
Yes.

1220
01:16:34,272 --> 01:16:35,637
Roast beef.

1221
01:16:38,109 --> 01:16:40,304
Got to have an empty stomach.

1222
01:16:42,313 --> 01:16:43,940
An empty stomach?

1223
01:16:44,849 --> 01:16:46,339
For the pills.

1224
01:17:10,775 --> 01:17:12,970
Was the spanakopita that bad?

1225
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:16,977
The sun...

1226
01:17:17,548 --> 01:17:19,175
keeps going down.

1227
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:23,185
I can't believe this is his last afternoon.

1228
01:17:24,288 --> 01:17:25,687
How'd it go?

1229
01:17:28,126 --> 01:17:31,357
I can't get through to him.
I don't know if it's...

1230
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,624
the sickness or the drugs...

1231
01:17:33,998 --> 01:17:36,091
No, it's just him.

1232
01:17:37,468 --> 01:17:38,867
Keep trying.

1233
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:42,072
We have to spread the word.

1234
01:17:42,507 --> 01:17:45,601
Nick's family wants everyone
to leave by sunset.

1235
01:17:51,215 --> 01:17:53,206
We're all supposed to go?

1236
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,957
It's my party, and I'll die if I want to

1237
01:18:03,027 --> 01:18:04,858
Die if I want to

1238
01:18:04,929 --> 01:18:06,920
Die if I want to

1239
01:18:07,098 --> 01:18:11,125
You would die, too, if it happened to you

1240
01:18:14,038 --> 01:18:16,131
Lighten up, please.

1241
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:17,936
It's not a funeral...

1242
01:18:18,442 --> 01:18:19,500
yet.

1243
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:22,844
- I want a picture.
- Good, Aunt Fanny, here we go.

1244
01:18:23,548 --> 01:18:26,642
All right. Here, Nick. Come on.
Look at me. Smile.

1245
01:18:29,387 --> 01:18:31,287
I want an 8 x 10.

1246
01:18:31,422 --> 01:18:33,083
Everyone, out of the kitchen.

1247
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:35,648
Let me see your face, Nick.
Here we go. Great.

1248
01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:40,120
- One with Matt.
- Matt, sit down.

1249
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:45,067
Squeeze together, guys.

1250
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:48,400
Would you like to have a picture taken
with Nikko?

1251
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,641
No, thank you.
I have one at home that I really love.

1252
01:18:53,077 --> 01:18:54,339
Let's go.

1253
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:03,384
Everybody, get together. Get tight.

1254
01:19:03,454 --> 01:19:05,081
Wait, wait, wait.

1255
01:19:11,462 --> 01:19:13,054
That'll be nice.

1256
01:19:13,164 --> 01:19:15,462
Where's Dad? Dad, get in there.

1257
01:19:17,168 --> 01:19:19,193
All right, squeeze together.

1258
01:19:20,438 --> 01:19:21,962
I hope these come out.

1259
01:19:22,039 --> 01:19:23,506
Pretty, okay.

1260
01:19:23,808 --> 01:19:25,503
One more, one more.

1261
01:19:25,576 --> 01:19:27,737
No, I'll go over here.

1262
01:19:30,982 --> 01:19:32,973
Yeah, good. Look this way.

1263
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,813
And smile.

1264
01:19:35,653 --> 01:19:37,848
Now, just me and the children.

1265
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:49,466
Pretty. That's a good one.
Mom, all right, one with you.

1266
01:19:52,403 --> 01:19:54,394
I do hope these come out.

1267
01:19:56,874 --> 01:19:59,206
Nick's taken his father's place.

1268
01:19:59,677 --> 01:20:02,669
Greek sons
always watch out for their mothers.

1269
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,173
How about one with Brandon?

1270
01:20:05,316 --> 01:20:07,807
Sure. Brandon, come, get in there.

1271
01:20:13,624 --> 01:20:16,422
All right. Good, guys. Great.

1272
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:23,859
- That'll be nice to have.
- Who's next?

1273
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:26,599
Do one with us and the baby.

1274
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:28,696
I was thinking about that.

1275
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:33,468
Don't forget. You have to help me
get everybody out before sunset.

1276
01:20:41,285 --> 01:20:43,082
That's great, thanks.

1277
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:02,466
Can we go someplace and talk?

1278
01:21:06,844 --> 01:21:09,369
Why didn't you tell me you had AIDS?

1279
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:13,807
'Cause I knew you'd be ashamed.

1280
01:21:13,884 --> 01:21:17,718
How do you think I feel, being left out?
Facing it all now?

1281
01:21:17,788 --> 01:21:21,315
You've been ashamed of me
ever since you found out I was gay.

1282
01:21:23,627 --> 01:21:25,720
I've always had a lot of prejudices.

1283
01:21:25,796 --> 01:21:26,854
No shit.

1284
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,831
I thought a lot about this.

1285
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:30,526
When I dated your mother...

1286
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:33,035
her family rejected me,
because I was Jewish.

1287
01:21:33,104 --> 01:21:35,231
I know exactly how you feel.

1288
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:37,265
I'm sure you do.

1289
01:21:40,578 --> 01:21:44,878
Watching you with your friends
has made me see things differently.

1290
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:49,245
They care about you so much.

1291
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:03,066
I'm sorry I wasn't a good father to you.

1292
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:12,237
You were a good father when I was a kid.

1293
01:22:12,676 --> 01:22:16,578
You gave me my first watercolor set
that got me interested in art.

1294
01:22:16,647 --> 01:22:17,807
I did?

1295
01:22:17,882 --> 01:22:21,079
It was a deluxe set. It had 42 colors.

1296
01:22:21,852 --> 01:22:24,480
I did my first paintings with it, Dad.

1297
01:22:26,924 --> 01:22:29,688
I'm so proud
of how you're handling yourself.

1298
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:38,694
Excuse me.

1299
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:43,869
Your family is at our house,
driving me crazy. I can't do it anymore.

1300
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:46,341
He's my business partner for years.
What do you want?

1301
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,399
I want you to come home.

1302
01:22:47,478 --> 01:22:49,878
- It's what I want.
- You gotta give me more time.

1303
01:22:49,947 --> 01:22:53,542
- It's just so sad, Charlie.
- I know.

1304
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:55,949
Get help. Help me.

1305
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:00,755
- It's a paper plate with paint on it.
- It's a Lichtenstein.

1306
01:23:00,858 --> 01:23:02,291
It makes me dizzy.

1307
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:04,190
Tony, Stuart's a mess.

1308
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:07,162
He's been drinking non-stop
since he got here.

1309
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:09,222
I'll see if Tim can drive him home.

1310
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,259
- You've got to get everybody out of here.
- All right. Excuse me.

1311
01:23:13,604 --> 01:23:16,198
Know the phone number for Yellow Cab?

1312
01:23:16,273 --> 01:23:18,366
I'll take you to the airport.

1313
01:23:18,442 --> 01:23:20,876
- No, that's okay.
- No, I'd like to.

1314
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:24,072
I can't stand the idea
of you being in a cab all by yourself.

1315
01:23:24,148 --> 01:23:26,241
Thanks. You're such a doll.

1316
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:29,478
Every cloud has a silver lining,
even a storm cloud.

1317
01:23:36,527 --> 01:23:37,994
Is he coming?

1318
01:23:38,195 --> 01:23:39,219
No.

1319
01:23:39,296 --> 01:23:41,389
You'll tell me if he comes?

1320
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:44,991
Metaxa, right?

1321
01:23:46,704 --> 01:23:47,898
Thanks.

1322
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,869
What's the picture?

1323
01:23:53,377 --> 01:23:56,540
It's a picture of Nikko and Daphne
when they were kids.

1324
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:59,074
Is there anything that I can do?

1325
01:23:59,149 --> 01:24:00,776
No, Nikko left...

1326
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:04,911
written instructions for afterwards.

1327
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:08,117
He has a prepaid work order...

1328
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,760
for the Neptune Society.

1329
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:14,388
Is there going to be a funeral?

1330
01:24:14,465 --> 01:24:17,366
No funeral, no services.

1331
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,433
That's what he wants.

1332
01:24:21,338 --> 01:24:24,967
He wants me
to scatter his ashes in Santorini.

1333
01:24:27,678 --> 01:24:29,441
That's where we met.

1334
01:24:35,085 --> 01:24:36,279
I know.

1335
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:41,484
Tony said that...

1336
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:45,451
everyone has to leave, except for the family.

1337
01:24:46,997 --> 01:24:49,522
I wanted to ask you if I could stay.

1338
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:55,562
When you came back,
it meant a lot to Nikko.

1339
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,534
It did?

1340
01:24:58,475 --> 01:25:00,443
He didn't say so...

1341
01:25:00,811 --> 01:25:03,211
but I know he would want you to stay.

1342
01:25:03,714 --> 01:25:05,045
Thank you.

1343
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:10,047
Douglas?

1344
01:25:10,621 --> 01:25:12,282
- Uncle Paul?
- Yeah.

1345
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,487
It's good to see you.

1346
01:25:14,825 --> 01:25:16,292
It's been a...

1347
01:25:26,003 --> 01:25:27,868
You gave up your trip?

1348
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:29,030
Yes.

1349
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:31,803
Listen...

1350
01:25:32,576 --> 01:25:34,237
I may have gone...

1351
01:25:34,678 --> 01:25:36,475
overboard last night.

1352
01:25:37,014 --> 01:25:38,276
May have?

1353
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:46,281
"God always has another custard pie
up his sleeve."

1354
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:47,756
Georgy Girl.

1355
01:25:50,594 --> 01:25:52,960
My plane leaves in about an hour.

1356
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,089
The family's going to have dinner.

1357
01:25:55,165 --> 01:25:56,655
"Not moussaka again."

1358
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,725
Melina Mercouri in Never on Sunday.

1359
01:25:58,802 --> 01:26:00,861
Do I have something for you.

1360
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:04,635
- The ultimate LA bad-taste jacket.
- You made fun of me when I bought it.

1361
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,232
Now it's yours.

1362
01:26:06,443 --> 01:26:08,673
Wear it with enthusiasm, Matt.

1363
01:26:16,687 --> 01:26:19,315
- I love you.
- I love you, too, babe.

1364
01:26:21,358 --> 01:26:22,825
Promise me...

1365
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:25,953
you'll make the choices
that'll make you happy.

1366
01:26:27,898 --> 01:26:29,229
I promise.

1367
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:42,303
Remember...

1368
01:26:42,379 --> 01:26:44,609
if you need anything though...

1369
01:26:45,382 --> 01:26:46,474
call.

1370
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:50,083
I mean, not me. I won't be here.

1371
01:26:54,525 --> 01:26:56,618
Funny to the end, aren't I?

1372
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:03,325
You think we could change the music?

1373
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,265
Why? You don't like it?

1374
01:27:05,335 --> 01:27:07,963
It's been playing over and over.

1375
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:12,103
If you don't change it,
I am going to break that CD in half.

1376
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:13,574
You know...

1377
01:27:14,078 --> 01:27:16,706
I always hated mushy music, but now...

1378
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,541
I kind of like it.

1379
01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:25,715
"Tears?

1380
01:27:25,856 --> 01:27:29,189
"When you have been bathed
in scented wine...

1381
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:32,319
- "your limbs caressed by sweet oils..."
- Give it a rest.

1382
01:27:32,396 --> 01:27:34,591
"When your hair's...

1383
01:27:34,732 --> 01:27:37,565
- "been combed with sandalwood."
- "My hair."

1384
01:27:38,035 --> 01:27:39,024
You mean, my hair?

1385
01:27:39,103 --> 01:27:41,765
"There will be no time for tears."

1386
01:27:42,206 --> 01:27:45,801
The Ten Commandments,
or a Vidal Sassoon commercial.

1387
01:27:47,244 --> 01:27:50,805
Will you call me tomorrow
and tell me if he went through with it?

1388
01:27:50,881 --> 01:27:52,246
Yeah, sure.

1389
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:54,313
Did you say goodbye?

1390
01:27:56,253 --> 01:27:57,481
I can't.

1391
01:28:07,664 --> 01:28:09,859
- Here, Monty's leaving.
- Okay.

1392
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:11,295
Babe...

1393
01:28:11,535 --> 01:28:14,470
I'd love to stay,
but I gotta go home and sort my socks.

1394
01:28:14,538 --> 01:28:16,130
This is for you.

1395
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:20,899
- For good luck?
- You always wanted me to give you head.

1396
01:28:22,379 --> 01:28:24,472
Come on, I'll walk you out.

1397
01:28:28,085 --> 01:28:29,109
So...

1398
01:28:29,186 --> 01:28:32,622
just don't do us any favors and sing
"I Did It My Way."

1399
01:28:33,423 --> 01:28:34,651
I won't.

1400
01:28:37,094 --> 01:28:40,257
I got drunk last night,
and I was really mean to Brandon.

1401
01:28:41,365 --> 01:28:43,697
It's in your nature. He'll live.

1402
01:28:45,002 --> 01:28:46,367
He's with Monty.

1403
01:28:46,436 --> 01:28:48,836
- You doing anything tomorrow?
- No.

1404
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:50,404
Me, neither.

1405
01:28:55,612 --> 01:28:56,977
I really...

1406
01:28:57,347 --> 01:28:58,678
miss Jack.

1407
01:29:00,284 --> 01:29:03,048
I thought about going with you tonight.

1408
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,417
Monty...

1409
01:29:04,488 --> 01:29:08,356
you've been positive for eight years,
you haven't shown a sign of a problem.

1410
01:29:08,425 --> 01:29:12,156
Even if you do get sick,
you gotta stay strong.

1411
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:13,719
Keep fighting.

1412
01:29:14,164 --> 01:29:15,927
You could get lucky.

1413
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:31,778
The next time we see each other,
my tan's going to be darker.

1414
01:29:33,116 --> 01:29:35,141
I'll be closer to the sun.

1415
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,128
Pastitsio is ready.

1416
01:29:45,662 --> 01:29:47,789
Come on, let's go over here.

1417
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,591
Eat something, Mr. Stark.

1418
01:29:55,672 --> 01:29:58,835
Time for the help to leave,
Mr. Eddie's Father.

1419
01:29:59,243 --> 01:30:01,143
- Stay for dinner.
- No.

1420
01:30:01,645 --> 01:30:04,580
It's family time.
Come outside and say goodbye to me.

1421
01:30:04,648 --> 01:30:08,448
- Okay. Sorry about my dad.
- Nikko, should I make you a plate?

1422
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:12,912
I'll get one in a minute.

1423
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:18,888
I feel like a stewardess.

1424
01:30:18,962 --> 01:30:20,896
"Bye-bye, so nice having you, bye.

1425
01:30:20,964 --> 01:30:23,865
"Nice having you,
bye-bye, please come back."

1426
01:30:31,341 --> 01:30:33,434
Don't you get morbid on me.

1427
01:30:34,144 --> 01:30:36,374
This won't be morbid, asshole.

1428
01:30:37,147 --> 01:30:39,638
I'll always be looking out for you.

1429
01:30:40,384 --> 01:30:44,013
Every once in a while,
just flash me that big Nikko smile.

1430
01:30:44,554 --> 01:30:45,816
Every day.

1431
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:51,256
Do you own a pair of scissors?

1432
01:30:52,529 --> 01:30:54,360
I want you to go home right now...

1433
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:56,729
and cut these bangs.

1434
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:58,829
Promise?

1435
01:31:02,306 --> 01:31:04,467
You're a beautiful woman, Charlene.

1436
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,977
How is Mr. Right going to find you
hiding behind this?

1437
01:31:08,178 --> 01:31:09,839
Look at that face.

1438
01:31:11,515 --> 01:31:13,380
It's a beautiful face.

1439
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:17,510
I want you to stay off Ding Dongs.

1440
01:31:23,894 --> 01:31:25,794
I gotta go back inside.

1441
01:31:26,663 --> 01:31:27,857
I know.

1442
01:31:28,398 --> 01:31:29,660
Goodbye.

1443
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:46,341
Houdini. Come on.

1444
01:31:48,518 --> 01:31:49,780
Lie there. That's it.

1445
01:31:49,853 --> 01:31:52,014
When I was a little girl, I was so mad...

1446
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:54,489
when you threw out my favorite toy.

1447
01:31:54,558 --> 01:31:56,321
- How old was I?
- 10.

1448
01:31:57,527 --> 01:32:00,189
But you love me now, don't you?

1449
01:32:01,698 --> 01:32:03,962
Yes. I love you now.

1450
01:32:05,135 --> 01:32:07,000
This is special sauce.

1451
01:32:07,504 --> 01:32:08,664
The sauce is good?

1452
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:10,331
It's from a can.

1453
01:32:23,253 --> 01:32:24,652
Really good.

1454
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,090
Look, all right.

1455
01:32:38,602 --> 01:32:41,127
First off, we've got to keep him
from drinking more.

1456
01:32:41,638 --> 01:32:45,369
He's gotta keep his head clear
to say goodbye to his family.

1457
01:32:45,776 --> 01:32:49,576
What's all this yip-yapping?
And what's with these sad faces?

1458
01:32:49,913 --> 01:32:52,609
- You know, we gotta take a walk.
- Nick.

1459
01:32:52,682 --> 01:32:54,775
I'm not losing my mind yet.

1460
01:32:56,219 --> 01:32:59,552
- Nurse Ratched.
- I don't want you wandering off again.

1461
01:32:59,623 --> 01:33:00,817
I won't be long.

1462
01:33:00,891 --> 01:33:03,485
Just don't put me in this position.

1463
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:07,121
- How long have I got after I take them?
- You've got 20 minutes.

1464
01:33:07,197 --> 01:33:08,391
Thirty, max.

1465
01:33:08,465 --> 01:33:10,660
All right. I gotta do this, Tony.

1466
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:11,996
I got to.

1467
01:33:14,104 --> 01:33:15,594
Don't be long.

1468
01:33:19,843 --> 01:33:21,401
What's going on?

1469
01:33:21,478 --> 01:33:24,276
I don't know. Nick wants to talk to Brandon.

1470
01:33:26,049 --> 01:33:27,573
Come on, Opala.

1471
01:33:29,986 --> 01:33:31,248
Listen...

1472
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:35,721
I want you to go back to making
the kind of films you made in college.

1473
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,152
Okay.

1474
01:33:41,398 --> 01:33:44,299
You made such a difference in my life, Nick.

1475
01:33:45,068 --> 01:33:47,366
You brought me out of my shell.

1476
01:33:47,537 --> 01:33:50,438
- The years that we spent together...
- Yeah.

1477
01:33:50,874 --> 01:33:52,603
We had great times.

1478
01:33:54,578 --> 01:33:55,806
Come on.

1479
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:20,135
Hey, Violet. Hi, honey.

1480
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:28,737
- Mr. Stark.
- Howdy, neighbor.

1481
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,273
I see him every day,
and I can't remember his name.

1482
01:34:32,349 --> 01:34:34,840
I am going out of town. Can you feed them?

1483
01:34:34,918 --> 01:34:36,010
Sure.

1484
01:34:36,386 --> 01:34:39,480
Actually, my friend here can feed them.
Brandon.

1485
01:34:39,556 --> 01:34:41,148
Good. Thank you.

1486
01:34:42,025 --> 01:34:44,357
They've been here all this time.

1487
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:46,429
I need you to be strong for me.

1488
01:34:46,496 --> 01:34:48,464
I don't want you crying.

1489
01:34:51,301 --> 01:34:52,666
You know...

1490
01:34:53,336 --> 01:34:54,667
I can barely see.

1491
01:34:54,738 --> 01:34:57,798
It's like looking down a long tube,
what I see.

1492
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:04,606
Come on, I'll take you back.

1493
01:35:04,948 --> 01:35:06,415
Bye-bye, Violet.

1494
01:35:08,552 --> 01:35:10,349
Would you take Opala?

1495
01:35:10,854 --> 01:35:14,381
You can't let her loose in the house,
or she'll rip everything to shit.

1496
01:35:14,457 --> 01:35:18,154
She gets one cup of dry food in the morning
and one cup at night.

1497
01:35:18,228 --> 01:35:21,686
Her name's Hawaiian for "trash."
Brandon found her in...

1498
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:37,168
I told him to make sure
that he got a hold of everything...

1499
01:35:37,247 --> 01:35:39,340
that I told him he needed...

1500
01:35:39,416 --> 01:35:42,010
because I have to keep some distance.

1501
01:35:44,955 --> 01:35:45,979
Hi.

1502
01:36:16,586 --> 01:36:19,111
Can't a guy take a leak around here?

1503
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:21,550
Sorry.

1504
01:36:25,962 --> 01:36:27,862
God, that was the best.

1505
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:30,758
That was the Christmas
we spent in Switzerland.

1506
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:33,598
And then New Year's Eve in St. Moritz.

1507
01:36:33,937 --> 01:36:37,771
We took the chair lift up the mountain,
and skied down to the Niarchos party.

1508
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:39,468
We were like James Bond.

1509
01:36:39,542 --> 01:36:42,511
We step out of our ski suits,
and had black tie on underneath.

1510
01:36:42,579 --> 01:36:44,171
Inside this mansion...

1511
01:36:44,247 --> 01:36:48,308
were all these rich 20-year-olds,
lying around, passed out.

1512
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:52,287
And this huge vat of caviar,
with cigarette butts put out in it.

1513
01:36:57,227 --> 01:36:59,718
Dad sure is taking this well.

1514
01:37:05,435 --> 01:37:07,596
Which reminds me,
when I was 16 years old...

1515
01:37:07,671 --> 01:37:10,765
Dad takes Daphne and me
on a camping trip in January.

1516
01:37:11,107 --> 01:37:12,699
The ground is frozen solid.

1517
01:37:12,776 --> 01:37:16,177
Tony always gave me a hard time
about the Winnebago.

1518
01:37:16,246 --> 01:37:18,214
He called it "Cleopatra's Barge."

1519
01:37:18,548 --> 01:37:19,879
Excuse me.

1520
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:24,719
I'm going to do a line.

1521
01:38:20,877 --> 01:38:22,276
That's that.

1522
01:38:56,646 --> 01:38:58,511
We were good together.

1523
01:39:04,187 --> 01:39:06,417
I'm going to miss you so much.

1524
01:39:08,091 --> 01:39:09,888
You'll find somebody.

1525
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,721
I want you.

1526
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,627
I'll still be around.

1527
01:39:17,634 --> 01:39:19,829
You always said you were an atheist.

1528
01:39:19,903 --> 01:39:23,361
Agnostic.
That just means I haven't had proof yet.

1529
01:39:24,908 --> 01:39:27,809
But I have a strong feeling I'm not leaving.

1530
01:39:29,979 --> 01:39:32,470
Will you send me some kind of sign?

1531
01:39:34,884 --> 01:39:35,942
Yes.

1532
01:40:19,062 --> 01:40:20,996
- We're close.
- How close?

1533
01:40:21,064 --> 01:40:23,362
Pretty close. He already took the pills.

1534
01:40:23,433 --> 01:40:25,162
Thanks for staying.

1535
01:40:30,073 --> 01:40:31,472
Your mother needs you.

1536
01:40:58,735 --> 01:41:00,600
Need anything, Amalia?

1537
01:41:01,271 --> 01:41:04,069
No, thank you very much. I'm fine.

1538
01:41:21,691 --> 01:41:22,919
Come on.

1539
01:41:26,796 --> 01:41:28,286
Sit on my lap.

1540
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:37,062
I want you to promise me one thing.

1541
01:41:39,275 --> 01:41:40,606
Promise...

1542
01:41:41,177 --> 01:41:43,042
you will stop smoking.

1543
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,578
I can't.

1544
01:41:51,621 --> 01:41:52,713
Okay.

1545
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:57,259
Then promise me you won't wear black.

1546
01:41:59,729 --> 01:42:00,821
Okay.

1547
01:42:03,733 --> 01:42:05,394
Always remember...

1548
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:07,898
I took care of you.

1549
01:42:09,639 --> 01:42:10,867
You did.

1550
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:15,602
Nick.

1551
01:42:16,512 --> 01:42:19,242
Come here, I want to show you something.

1552
01:42:26,756 --> 01:42:28,849
Come on. Come sit over here.

1553
01:42:31,794 --> 01:42:33,284
This is our...

1554
01:42:34,297 --> 01:42:36,288
trip to Europe last year.

1555
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:41,169
This is you arriving in Amsterdam.

1556
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:42,768
Check out your eyes.

1557
01:42:42,839 --> 01:42:45,672
- Not a pretty sight.
- Not a pretty sight.

1558
01:42:51,514 --> 01:42:53,539
See, this is the next day.

1559
01:42:56,552 --> 01:42:58,645
Can I talk to you a minute?

1560
01:42:59,022 --> 01:43:00,353
Excuse me.

1561
01:43:03,526 --> 01:43:06,927
Shouldn't he be spending these moments
with his family?

1562
01:43:08,331 --> 01:43:11,266
I don't want him to nod off in front of them.

1563
01:43:13,102 --> 01:43:15,696
We have to get him into his bed soon.

1564
01:43:21,044 --> 01:43:22,136
Okay.

1565
01:43:23,946 --> 01:43:25,436
Remember this?

1566
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:29,415
It's a train station
where we dropped off your French friends.

1567
01:43:31,187 --> 01:43:32,848
Where are my keys?

1568
01:43:36,225 --> 01:43:38,216
You don't need your keys.

1569
01:43:48,571 --> 01:43:50,300
Remember the view from our room?

1570
01:43:51,607 --> 01:43:54,132
It's time for us to leave, you guys.

1571
01:43:55,745 --> 01:43:57,269
He's starting to go.

1572
01:43:58,247 --> 01:43:59,236
Mother...

1573
01:44:02,385 --> 01:44:03,909
I love art.

1574
01:44:09,425 --> 01:44:11,620
This is us back at the hotel.

1575
01:44:33,282 --> 01:44:35,477
It's okay, Nick.

1576
01:44:43,192 --> 01:44:44,682
I'm so sleepy.

1577
01:45:04,347 --> 01:45:05,678
This is it.

1578
01:45:05,748 --> 01:45:07,682
Don't be scared, Nikko.

1579
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:09,377
It's me, Brandon.

1580
01:45:11,454 --> 01:45:14,423
- This is it.
- Just lie back and relax.

1581
01:45:15,424 --> 01:45:18,416
That's it. Just think about...

1582
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:21,989
us going up the chair lift together.

1583
01:45:24,267 --> 01:45:26,201
That sun feels warm.

1584
01:45:27,036 --> 01:45:30,335
And with that icy wind
blowing on your face...

1585
01:45:30,773 --> 01:45:33,071
it's a weird feeling, isn't it?

1586
01:45:34,076 --> 01:45:36,806
We're almost at the top of the mountain.

1587
01:45:37,346 --> 01:45:39,439
We're gliding off the lift.

1588
01:45:39,982 --> 01:45:42,177
We're stopping up at the top.

1589
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:45,412
Now we're pushing off.

1590
01:45:47,223 --> 01:45:48,884
We're flying down.

1591
01:45:50,626 --> 01:45:52,719
Ski with me, through powder.
