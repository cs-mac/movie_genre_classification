00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:46,527
April the 10th, 1671.

1
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,364
Monsieurle Prince de Condé...

2
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,631
His Majesty gives me reason to believe
that he would graciously accept an...

3
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:57,936
invitation to vislt you at Chantilly.
The visit will last three days.

4
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:01,513
The king instructs me to say that
he wants no fuss.

5
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:04,410
Merely the simple pleasures
of life in the country.

6
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:08,747
I not her words, if you value His
Majesty´s favor,you will set no limlt...

7
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:12,990
to the extravagance and
ingenulty of festivities.

8
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:17,487
I´ll present my self before hand
to approve the arrangements.

9
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,460
Marquis de Lauzun...

10
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:24,025
in the service of His Majesty
Louis the 14th,of France.

11
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:31,139
My dear Master Steward,
Monsieur Vatel.

12
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,242
Good new sand bad news.

13
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:37,108
His Majesty arrives
on Thursday.

14
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:40,444
I can´t emphasize enough
the importance ofhis visit.

15
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,019
A dropped wine glassor
an uncomfortable cushion...

16
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:46,020
would spell disaster
to ourentire province.

17
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:49,717
The good news is that we may
go to war with Holland.

18
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:04,030
On that table.

19
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,406
-Good morning, Monsieur.
-Good morning.

20
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:14,873
The Princess has placed her
apartments at the Queen's disposal...

21
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:19,079
Naturally I should place mine
at the disposal of His Majesty.

22
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,283
From the King antechamber
we pass through the music room...

23
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:32,328
and next to the apartments
of the Queen.

24
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,659
Her Majesty's bedroom...

25
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,239
Drawing-room, and a further bedroom
for Her Majesty's lady-in-waiting.

26
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,842
Lady-in-waiting,
Madame de Montausier.

27
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,811
Anne de Montausier.

28
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,784
Her Majesty will be
comfortable and convenient.

29
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,015
The King won't be going to her bed,
he did his duty two days ago.

30
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:02,653
Remarkably well informed.

31
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:04,921
The Queen always goes to confession
the following morning.

32
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,530
-When was it?
-Monday.

33
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,292
-Monday?
-Remarkably well informed.

34
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:13,298
This room is to serve as
the Council Chamber...

35
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:16,475
and the King's bedroom...

36
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:21,978
A second bedroom so here.
And this of course...

37
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:26,010
we´ve allocated to the
Duchess de La Vallière.

38
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,347
Who I believe is close
to His Majesty.

39
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,517
No.

40
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,220
This room is for
Marquis de Montespan.

41
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:41,589
It 's hard to keep up when
you live in the country.

42
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,468
And La Valliere?

43
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:51,643
Anywhere. In the attic.

44
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:55,041
I prefer Monsieur Le Prince
if my rooms were north-facing.

45
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,944
-I don't like the sun coming in.
-Your rooms, Lauzun?

46
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,177
I myself will have only one room for
those 3 days. As will the Princess.

47
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,055
Every corner and cupboard
is spoken for.

48
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:07,920
And to accommodate the court
we had to use every farm house...

49
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,027
from miles around.

50
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,789
My room...

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,231
No. I won't have you
disturbed, Vatel.

52
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,700
You haven't slept
for aweek as it is.

53
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:24,600
Have that cleaned.

54
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:38,723
The first day,
the glory of the sun...

55
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,790
the bounty of Nature.

56
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:44,861
Trees, birds, butterflies...

57
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,999
fruits and flowers.

58
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:57,070
The second day, on the lake.
Fireworks.

59
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,972
The sun banishes the night.

60
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,045
The lamps are on their way
from Paris now.

61
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,209
For Friday, the fish banquet will be
presented in asea of ice.

62
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,686
Neptune's tribute to Helios,
the Sun God.

63
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:15,016
-The King will catch a cold.
-No, my Prince...

64
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:18,219
the braziers will be lit
one hour before the banquet.

65
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:20,592
And the ice will melt.

66
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,634
I have forbid it to melt,
my Prince.

67
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:27,135
Well, our fate is in your hands.

68
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:35,906
There is always a reason
behind a royal visit.

69
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:39,243
And the reason for this one
is William of 0range...

70
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:42,012
king of Holland, who wants war.

71
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:46,988
And if he gets it,Louie is going
to meet the best general in France...

72
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:49,457
that many people think
is none other...

73
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:53,063
than the Prince de Condé,
even withgout.

74
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:11,979
Compared to this visit
from the king...

75
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:15,381
war with the Dutch
will seem like a picnic.

76
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,722
-Thank you!
-How can I help you?

77
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:22,382
Excuse me, sir, but we will only talk
to the top. Nobody else.

78
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:25,995
I regret it. His Majesty
is busy at this moment.

79
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:28,428
His host, the Prince of Condé,
like wise.

80
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:31,432
Not them...
The man in charge.

81
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,832
The master of pleasure
and festivities. Vatel.

82
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,539
Vatel!
That 's slightly more difficult!

83
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,408
I'll see what I can do.
Please, follow.

84
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:55,053
Good morning!

85
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:01,857
-How many geese?
-6O, Monsieur.

86
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:07,128
Monsieur Vatel...

87
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,239
-You're trespassing here, Alcalet.
-All of us are owned money.

88
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:16,609
We've come to tell you.
From this moment nothing on credit.

89
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:22,311
Not asingle cabbage leaf or cracked
coffee cup, or table napkin. Nothing.

90
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,887
-Until our bills are paid.
-Exactly!

91
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,149
We mean to get paid.

92
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,718
Come.

93
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:37,525
We have business to run and
families to provide for.

94
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:39,202
When we will get
what we are owned?

95
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:44,104
What you are owned now is the truth.
We cannot honor our debts.

96
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,278
Not for the months
or the years gone by.

97
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,344
Much less this festivities.

98
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:51,846
We cannot pay you asingle ''sou''
nor will we ever.

99
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,576
You have only one chance
of getting your money.

100
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:57,688
By giving me everything
I asked for. Instantly.

101
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,324
And of the very best quality.
And then more of the same.

102
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,389
This visit is a reconciliation.

103
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,722
If the King is pleased
by the festivities...

104
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,296
then the royal coffers will open.

105
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,635
The Prince is bankrupt.
It 's up to you.

106
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:15,865
If we do give you more credit, how do
we know we'll get our money back?

107
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:17,975
The Prince said so.

108
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,670
My master is a man of honor.

109
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,872
On that I stake my life.
You will be paid.

110
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:27,847
Good.

111
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,656
Excellent.

112
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:36,956
Good morning...

113
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,097
Monsieur Vatel.

114
00:09:57,082 --> 00:10:00,176
Are you going down, Madame?
I'm going up.

115
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,266
Where is Montausier?

116
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:19,801
Explain to her the Queen does not
wait on the lady-in-waiting.

117
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,877
Forgive me, Madame.

118
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:35,576
Please. Let me.

119
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,991
Allow me.

120
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,401
I hope your birds
will be happy with us.

121
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:08,815
Madame!

122
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,994
Here we are.

123
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,168
Put him with the fruits.

124
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,479
Monsieur, the King's brother
wants him for his page.

125
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:47,354
He chose me!

126
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:51,763
Get him dressed
and put him to work.

127
00:11:57,636 --> 00:12:03,074
And what would you have me tell
His Highness, the King's brother?

128
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:06,369
Tell him I don't get my boys
from his boudoir...

129
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:09,274
and he won't get his
from my kitchen.

130
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:14,919
Yes... indeed I will.

131
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,588
I need another two of this.
The same size, if possible.

132
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:29,029
It 's not very wise upsetting
the King's brother, you know.

133
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,668
It could make things go bad for us,
if he chooses.

134
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,031
I'm asteward, not a pimple.

135
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,068
Monsieur Vatel!

136
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:40,268
The Princess has been bitten
by a monkey!

137
00:12:57,363 --> 00:13:00,628
Master Steward, you filled my garden
with savage beasts!

138
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,266
I've been badly bitten.
Where were you?

139
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:06,003
Busy, Your Highness.
We had some unwelcome visitor.

140
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,571
-Beggars?
-No, no. Creditors!

141
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:10,805
Creditors?

142
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:16,409
Dr. Bourdelot!

143
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:20,183
I've been badly bitten
on the arm.

144
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,115
Oh, no!

145
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,554
-What 's your name?
-François Vatel, Madame.

146
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,535
Monsieur Vatel.

147
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:47,375
You were at Vaux-le-Vicomte
ten years ago.

148
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,106
Yes, Madame.
I was steward to Nicolas Fouquet.

149
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,216
His Majesty's Minister of Finance.

150
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:58,482
You mean, His Majesty's prisoner
for life in the fortress of Pignerol.

151
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,885
-That is so?
-Six thousand guests...

152
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,825
to meet the King.

153
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:10,127
Diamonds and saddle horses given
away as prizes in childish games.

154
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:13,863
That was overdoing it,
don't you think?

155
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:17,442
It showed how much
Fouquet had been stealing.

156
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:29,883
Gourville, why has the King
really come here?

157
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,386
It's revenge. The King will
never forget that Condé...

158
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,491
fought against him
in the civil war.

159
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:37,025
That was a long time ago.
The King was a child.

160
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:39,754
If there's awar with the Dutch...
the King will need Condé.

161
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:41,796
-Yes, but he is...
-Sick of war?

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,468
So he is. But he is equally sick
of being in debt.

163
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,810
I'm passing red hot stones.

164
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:08,291
Condé!

165
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:09,821
Majesty?

166
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:12,826
What exactly do you need
to borrow so much money for?

167
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:17,368
The better to serve France,
Your Majesty.

168
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:28,303
Well, Colbert, where are
our envoys from Holland?

169
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:31,244
-Aren't they here yet?
-Not yet, Your Majesty.

170
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,848
Peace with the Dutch
is good for nothing.

171
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,917
Except tulips.

172
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,951
How many tulips
do we have at Versailles?

173
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,754
-Two million, Sir.
-My gardener hates flowers!

174
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:47,363
He would love awar
with the Dutch.

175
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,700
Indeed, sir.

176
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,431
But would Your Majesty
please recall...

177
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,075
that you have offered your daughter
in marriage to William of Orange.

178
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:01,208
An invasion would not look well
in the eve of a betrothal.

179
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:04,576
My daughter can't even
talk yet, Colbert.

180
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:08,514
4 days ride from Paris, we have a
country of republicans, protestants...

181
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,484
and printers of
seditious pamphlets.

182
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,588
No King is safe
from free-thinkers...

183
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:17,762
especially if they are
as rich as the Dutch.

184
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:26,829
We have no better soldier
than Condé.

185
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,667
And if there is war,
we'll need him.

186
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,369
He's expensive.

187
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:34,808
But if there is peace...

188
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,976
What do I say in the meantime?

189
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,244
Why say anything?

190
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:47,785
Your Majesty was invited here
to enjoy yourself.

191
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,862
Not for business...

192
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,664
Your Highness?
Are the musicians ready?

193
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:01,463
Yes, my Prince. The King didn't utter
asingle word to me during Council.

194
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:04,164
-Kept muttering to Lauzun.
-Which one is the King?

195
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,674
You killed my only son.
You bastard!

196
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:09,073
He died working in
the machines at Versailles.

197
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,806
So the King
could have fountains!

198
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,919
-Take you hands of me!
-Have you no control of your people?

199
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,353
His Majesty wants her flogged,
and at once.

200
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,151
See to it, Master Steward.

201
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,761
I'm not your master
of flogging mad women.

202
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:27,426
A hundred lashes.

203
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,461
You know what 's at stake.
Don't weaken!

204
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:37,199
Murderer! Assassin!

205
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:41,401
My son! My son!

206
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:48,084
Monsieur Vatel!

207
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:54,182
I'm short of a page
at my household in Saint Cloud.

208
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:57,385
And you have a boy
who might do, apparently.

209
00:17:57,596 --> 00:18:00,531
Send him to my apartment
and I'll have a look at him.

210
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:04,728
Come, Lauzun,
we have been promised music.

211
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:07,234
Music is my weakness.

212
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:42,071
The mad woman has been
flogged, Your Majesty.

213
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:43,798
I ask your pardon.

214
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,671
Mad woman?
Don't concern yourself, Prince.

215
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,244
I recall no mad woman.

216
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,928
There's no sign of them.

217
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,132
-How long are they going to be?
-You can't hurry a King.

218
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,743
Well, one can't
slow down the sunset.

219
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,357
-Madame...
-Monsieur Le Marquis?

220
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:50,105
The King sends you
his compliments...

221
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:56,206
and he begs the favor of taking
a cup of chocolate with you...

222
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:58,882
in your room, at midnight.

223
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:00,846
With me?

224
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:06,214
May I offer you
my congratulations?

225
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:12,559
Although, as you can imagine...

226
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:15,665
this came as a great blow to me.

227
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,996
After tonight I cannot
hope for deliverance...

228
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:22,935
from the pain
of my own desires.

229
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:26,137
May I suggest...

230
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:29,007
my rooms at ten?

231
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:31,182
Alas, Monsieur...

232
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:34,716
ten o'clock I have
an even more attractive offer.

233
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:39,289
Her Majesty has asked me
to delouse her Spaniel.

234
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,294
Madame.

235
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:58,900
Monsieur Vatel.

236
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:21,122
He is coming!
Thank God!

237
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,496
Go, go!

238
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,933
Table one!

239
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:07,136
With your King, eat, drink...

240
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:09,933
and enjoy yourselves!

241
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:20,742
Your hat!
Go, go, go!

242
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:46,976
The King's gout is bad.
Tell Dr. Bourdelot.

243
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,942
Madame de Courbé needs
a new napkin. Come on.

244
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:53,549
Marquis de Effiat wants his dishes
without coriander.

245
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:58,687
Isn't it to your taste,
Your Majesty?

246
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:07,721
Change Montespan
for Montausier.

247
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:19,970
You look pale, Prince.
Are you ill?

248
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:22,508
Your Majesty
is gracious to inquire.

249
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:24,545
Yes, indeed.

250
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:14,930
I see we share the same taste.

251
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,794
Taste?

252
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:19,693
In women.

253
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,770
There is a lady who has been
rejecting my advances...

254
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:27,501
in away which
I find quite stimulating.

255
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:35,709
Her world is about to change.
The King has asked for her tonight.

256
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,321
I suggest we mark the event.

257
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:43,559
I want you to make
a masterpiece.

258
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:47,128
Spun sugar, almond paste,
fruit and flowers.

259
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:49,596
-I'll leave it to you.
-I'm not a pâtissier, Marquis.

260
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,608
I will be too busy.

261
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,209
Ask someone else, Marquis.

262
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:06,809
Fruit and flowers
in the color of flesh and blood.

263
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:10,950
Flesh and blood.

264
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,020
I will send my valet
in the morning.

265
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:43,112
Young Sire,
I ask you to behave yourself.

266
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:45,585
-Don't you know who I am?
-I do not have the honor.

267
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,587
I am the Vicomte d'Amboise...

268
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,522
and when I grow up I will be
the Duc de LaTremoille.

269
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:55,629
In that case it 's not too soon to learn
to behave like the Duc de LaTremoille.

270
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:03,963
In truth, the Duc de La Tremoille
behaves like a pig.

271
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:05,800
I thank you, Madame.

272
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,501
The poorest of poor of Chantilly
picked those flowers...

273
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:10,578
just for a few ''sous''...

274
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:14,411
to make the trees pretty for
His Majesty. And did so on credit.

275
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,880
But the poor are happy
to be the King's creditors.

276
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,058
-It 's an honor they never dreamed of.
-Of course.

277
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:25,292
Both my parents were so honored,
they died of it.

278
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:56,853
The Prince's birds.
Oh, God! I can't believe this!

279
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,325
-Where are my birds?
-By order of the Vicomte I let them go!

280
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:03,966
What Vicomte?

281
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:07,797
The Vicomte d'Amboise, Doctor,
and his sister. They ordered me.

282
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,474
But they are children!
They are little children!

283
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:14,304
-But he is still a Vicomte, doctor!
-These were the birds of the Prince.

284
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:22,119
What am I going to do?

285
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,345
I mean, it is a disaster.

286
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:29,219
I specifically ordered those thrushes
and larks for the Prince's gout!

287
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:32,621
His gout is giving him agony today.
What am I going to do?

288
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,627
Use something else.

289
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,835
Use something else?

290
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:41,969
Use something else...

291
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:45,470
The heart torn
from the living bird...

292
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:48,669
is the only treatment for gout.
Everyone knows that.

293
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,280
-Why not chickens?
-Chickens!

294
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:55,350
He's a Prince! Chicken's hearts
wouldn't even cure a peasant.

295
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:58,386
Monsieur Vatel!

296
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:13,796
Are you trying to ruin me?

297
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:16,472
-Your Highness?
-First that mad woman.

298
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:19,871
Now the Marquis de Lauzun
tells me you've been insolent.

299
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:23,980
-Insolent?
-You refused to be of service to him.

300
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,984
I refused to be his pâtissier.

301
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:32,751
What is the matter with you?

302
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:37,155
Lauzun has the King's ear. For
the next few days do what he asks.

303
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,262
Bravo!

304
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:41,894
Bravo!

305
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:33,016
Gourville, have they put you
to spy on me?

306
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:36,015
If they had, you would be
in the Bastille by now.

307
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,983
You despise them, don't you?

308
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:40,521
They don't leave me
much alternative.

309
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,994
Tell me, Gourville,
who is Anne de Montausier?

310
00:30:44,195 --> 00:30:46,561
-Why?
-How many times have l...

311
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:50,928
bitten my tongue? And now I snap at
the only one who is human to me.

312
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:54,832
Well, she is new at Court.
She still got a heart...

313
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,472
or so they say.

314
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:16,357
Good.

315
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:21,362
Yes, but it better be perfect.
Colbert is not in our camp.

316
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:25,195
He is hostile to our Prince
getting influence at court.

317
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:43,418
Good night, my Queen.

318
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,644
Your Majesty...

319
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:15,411
Madame de Montausier.

320
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,091
I'm concerned about the fish.

321
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,661
I have sent to Dieppe
for an extra cartload...

322
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,923
in case there are storms
off Les Havres.

323
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:33,763
You are my general.
The battle plan is yours to decide.

324
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:40,271
-What else?
-Nothing. Unless it rains.

325
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:43,836
The carving stewards
will have to sleep in the stable.

326
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:45,572
But they are German.

327
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:52,112
-The lanterns arrive in the morning.
-Very good. Well, I leave it to you.

328
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:54,484
Go to bed, my friend.

329
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,018
Vatel...

330
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:04,162
You did well.

331
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:33,427
Goodnight,Madame.

332
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:00,517
Can you tell me
where Vatel is?

333
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,324
You sent for me,
Monsieur Vatel?

334
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:17,238
Food for cattle.

335
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,802
Now we can feed cattle
through the Winter...

336
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:24,311
instead of having
to slaughter them every year.

337
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:27,240
How many varieties
of pears are there?

338
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:31,444
There are 5OO different
kinds of pear.

339
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:35,019
This is the best one.
Its name is?

340
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:38,423
-Bon Chrétien d'hiver.
-And...

341
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:42,790
-It was known to the Romans.
-Good.

342
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:47,593
When I'm rich,
I'd like a garden like yours.

343
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:51,000
I hope so, Colin.
I hope so.

344
00:34:52,743 --> 00:34:54,734
Bravo, Colin.
You made a good choice.

345
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:57,140
The King will be pleased.

346
00:34:58,149 --> 00:34:59,446
Colin...

347
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,847
don't leave the kitchen
without my order. Colin?

348
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:26,842
They were badly packed...

349
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:29,103
and the roads were bad.

350
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:38,014
Monsieur Vatel.

351
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:42,824
I am the valet
of the Marquis de Lauzun.

352
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,658
-My commiseration.
-Thank you.

353
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,939
Good.

354
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:44,415
Now a real flower.
Give me the blue one.

355
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:49,056
Harmony and contrast.

356
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,252
All beauty comes
from those two things.

357
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:02,264
You see, Colin? A few objects
are beautiful or ugly in themselves.

358
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:05,909
To know that is the beginning
of being an artist.

359
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:11,243
Here. Huh?

360
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:24,421
Now I will show you
a real masterpiece.

361
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,967
-For your mistress.
-Just a moment.

362
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,408
It 's from the Marquis de Lauzun.

363
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:41,734
Send it back.

364
00:37:42,913 --> 00:37:45,177
She doesn't want it.

365
00:38:02,499 --> 00:38:05,332
Will you keep me with you
when you are a Duchess?

366
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:09,505
Let 's wait and see
if I am to be a Duchess...

367
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:14,576
or just a night 's divertissement to keep
Madame de Montespan on her toes.

368
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:17,811
Or on her knees.

369
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:26,381
Louder!

370
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,423
-I'm in love!
-With a fish?

371
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,994
Monsieur Le Marquis?

372
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:42,305
Monsieur Le Marquis?

373
00:38:43,107 --> 00:38:46,304
-What?
-She refused it, Monsieur Le Marquis.

374
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,313
That 's rather beautiful.

375
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:53,675
Send it to...

376
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,917
the Duchess of Longueville.

377
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,188
With the note?

378
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,287
Of course.

379
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:04,222
There's far too much waste
in this country.

380
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:10,159
Madame.

381
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,903
There still won't be enough meat.
Not with the extra guests.

382
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:23,338
Monsieur,
I'm worried about the meat.

383
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:25,708
We have scarcely enough.

384
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,816
Monsieur Vatel!

385
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,621
The King's brother,
he is playing with the whale.

386
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:42,764
The monster must not get away!

387
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,764
Kill with my heart!

388
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:48,735
It is they your hand
should strike.

389
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:59,148
Strike now!

390
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:05,354
Your men are so careless.
They've quite spoiled our pleasure.

391
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:08,719
My men had orders
to wait for me.

392
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:11,485
The whale was intended
for the King's pleasure.

393
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:13,754
The King!
That 's ashame.

394
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:17,900
We, Bourbons, are unpredictable
when deprived of our...

395
00:40:18,102 --> 00:40:19,831
pleasure.

396
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:26,509
You are astubborn man,
Master Steward. Admirable.

397
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:36,152
Horse racing!

398
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:41,550
Get that carcass
out of the water.

399
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:47,162
For your mistress.

400
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,802
Must be from the King.
There is a note.

401
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:14,181
It 's all right, Louise.

402
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,283
It 's all right.

403
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:22,331
It 's sugar.

404
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:29,737
Madame,you were kind to
one who turned a side kindness.

405
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:34,976
Such gift as I have,
Iemploy for your forgiveness.

406
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:37,739
François Vatel.

407
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:57,467
Master Steward,
do you promise us sport?

408
00:41:57,668 --> 00:41:59,898
Yes, Princess, there will be sport.

409
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:04,337
-I smell blood.
-I promise you blood!

410
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,020
Montausier's stock is rising.

411
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:27,353
She spent the night
in His Majesty's bed.

412
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,460
Does everybody know
who sleeps with the King?

413
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:34,535
Every footman knows. Sometimes you
can be quite ridiculous, my dear Vatel.

414
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:18,378
You find the day more exciting
than the night, Madame?

415
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:23,152
You sent back
my gift and my note.

416
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,579
You think the King
intends to keep you?

417
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:27,347
Perhaps not, Lauzun.

418
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:30,618
But from the King's bed
to yours is a long fall.

419
00:43:30,827 --> 00:43:33,728
And I'm not contemplating it
in this life.

420
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,772
François!

421
00:43:46,743 --> 00:43:49,234
They are waiting for the sauces!

422
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,309
Pick this up.
Someone help him.

423
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:56,619
Go on.

424
00:43:57,788 --> 00:44:00,484
Monsieur Vatel, the pie!
There's really not enough meat.

425
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:03,854
We are two tables short.
They gave us the wrong numbers.

426
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,021
Give me that!

427
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,669
-Bring me some mushrooms.
-Edouard! Mushrooms!

428
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:18,174
Condé has won 4O,OOO pistols
from the King.

429
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:20,309
Colbert must be furious.

430
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,411
By losing a little
you might have won more.

431
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:27,311
By winning a little
you might lose everything.

432
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:31,145
Is the Prince
losing its Chateau?

433
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:33,687
Not if he plays his cards wrong.

434
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:37,656
Your Majesty.

435
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:52,464
Madame de Montausier.

436
00:45:02,052 --> 00:45:04,418
Condé's demands are excessive.

437
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:07,647
-Outrageous!
-You mean, he knows his price.

438
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:10,721
Of course, if there were
to be awar...

439
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:13,586
As yet there is no war.
My envoys from Holland...

440
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:17,358
may well bring terms we can accept.
I would prefer that.

441
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:22,670
It is not rational for
two rich countries to make war.

442
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:27,276
My dear Colbert, our destinies
are not ruled by reason.

443
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:30,844
Lust for power, like any lust,
is seated at least according to...

444
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:34,017
the latest medical knowledge,
in the liver.

445
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:39,451
Although, personally...

446
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:41,388
it hasn't been my experience.

447
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:09,570
Madame?

448
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:13,579
Madame!

449
00:47:14,718 --> 00:47:17,050
Madame, please.

450
00:47:21,057 --> 00:47:22,524
Are you ill, Madame?

451
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:25,286
I just needed to escape
from them for a moment.

452
00:47:25,495 --> 00:47:29,090
If you make an infusion of this,
it will restore you.

453
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,228
I wanted the wind
to stop blowing.

454
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:37,397
I made it stop.

455
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:41,142
Oh, I thought it was God.

456
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:48,216
Then perhaps God provided me.

457
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:57,423
Is it so important?

458
00:47:59,396 --> 00:48:02,627
It is no small thing
to please a King, Madame.

459
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:06,132
To please a King
is easily done...

460
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,499
and of no importance.

461
00:48:09,706 --> 00:48:12,004
But as asteward
I have it in my power to...

462
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:15,042
to save the house
of the Prince of Condé.

463
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:19,705
What power do you have?

464
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,713
To create.

465
00:48:22,052 --> 00:48:24,179
To astonish.

466
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:28,685
The visit of His Majesty
is the supreme test.

467
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:32,851
If I please him, his benevolence will
restore my master to his position...

468
00:48:33,063 --> 00:48:35,759
in the destiny of France.

469
00:48:37,701 --> 00:48:41,364
So the destiny of France
is in your hands, Monsieur.

470
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:46,570
That will be a great surprise
to the King's minister Colbert.

471
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:56,712
I must go back.

472
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:36,482
Laurent!

473
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:39,353
What kind of meat is this?

474
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:41,292
Unicorn. Laurent!

475
00:49:41,598 --> 00:49:43,532
Hurry up!

476
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:45,830
For God's sake!

477
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,404
There's no news
about the lanterns.

478
00:49:53,977 --> 00:49:57,708
More than half the eggs are addle.
We can't make the custard.

479
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:05,548
Watch.

480
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:12,258
Come.

481
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,572
The sugar will come out
like bitten egg whites.

482
00:50:30,547 --> 00:50:33,141
-Don't forget the apricots.
-No, Monsieur.

483
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,711
Lanterns, lanterns...

484
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,785
Lanterns...

485
00:50:55,672 --> 00:51:00,371
If they ask you what it is, tell them
it 's an old recipe from Chantilly.

486
00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:03,906
Don't cut any more melons.

487
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:35,769
Who is it?

488
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,341
Don't be afraid.
Come on.

489
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,382
My mistress...

490
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:46,981
she asked me to stay
until I've seen you read it.

491
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,960
This is so pretty!
What astrange idea.

492
00:51:54,297 --> 00:51:56,128
A custom from lndia.

493
00:51:56,332 --> 00:52:00,428
Your kindness to me shows
a nobler heart thananyat court.

494
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:03,265
Where they know only
hunter and prey.

495
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:05,805
Use your powers
to protect yourself.

496
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:08,876
Beware Lauzun. A.

497
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:11,807
Please, thank your mistress.

498
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:34,860
I stink from head to toe.

499
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:38,006
This is good.
I don't know it.

500
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,774
It 's made from walnuts.

501
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:42,944
What did you want?

502
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:46,240
Monsieur sent me,
the King's brother.

503
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:48,542
It 's not an easy embassy.

504
00:52:51,788 --> 00:52:55,724
Your name is in everybody's lips, you
know. This banquet will be decisive.

505
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,756
Your geniuses...

506
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:00,652
Get to the point.

507
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:05,195
Monsieur wants you
for his friend.

508
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:11,267
He admires, well... to speak quite
frankly, everything about you.

509
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:14,602
So, what he wants
from you is...

510
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:18,205
everything.

511
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:27,720
-Do I hear you right?
-What do you hear?

512
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:30,757
That monsieur has sent you
to ask me to join a long line...

513
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,420
of stable boys and Princes
whom he has honored so... intimately.

514
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,896
Yes, your hearing is very good.

515
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:39,591
Tell Monsieur...

516
00:53:40,403 --> 00:53:43,429
and I quote Descartes
whom I once knew...

517
00:53:43,706 --> 00:53:46,470
''There is no soul so weak
that it cannot...

518
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:50,077
acquire an absolute power
over the passions.''

519
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,738
Monsieur is not a Cartesian,
as far as is known.

520
00:53:54,918 --> 00:53:57,546
He only wants a few moments
of your time.

521
00:53:57,754 --> 00:54:02,214
Then I send him a message
which reveals more of me...

522
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:06,122
than he would ever see
if I were to submit. Tell him...

523
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:10,628
that both of us live
with a terrible thing.

524
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,564
The desire for the absolute.

525
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:17,103
The sublime. The perfect.

526
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:24,442
That 's why he flits
from person to person...

527
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:28,514
and that 's why
I give myself to no one.

528
00:54:28,718 --> 00:54:30,652
And the Prince?

529
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,514
How long do you think it will take
before this reaches the Prince?

530
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,748
Not long, if you hurry.

531
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:39,358
My dear Vatel.

532
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:42,955
We all go round together
like a celestial machine.

533
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:44,633
The Sun King is at the center.

534
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:47,234
Condé is one of his planets
and I am Condé's moon.

535
00:54:47,437 --> 00:54:50,099
Do you think there's a place
to stand when we are free?

536
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:52,968
Naturally I will speak to Condé.

537
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:55,675
Not to do so would be...

538
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:58,277
self-important.

539
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:07,852
Bourdelot!

540
00:55:08,057 --> 00:55:10,389
Why have you got
Madame de Montausier's birds?

541
00:55:10,593 --> 00:55:12,857
I got them from
Madame de Montausier.

542
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:16,031
-I'm saving them for the banquet.
-For the banquet?

543
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:19,065
No. In case the Prince
requires them for his gout.

544
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:21,066
But why?

545
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:24,704
The Princess has asked La Montausier
to sacrifice her canaries.

546
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,102
She refused.

547
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:29,472
So, the Princess
told Her Majesty...

548
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,082
and she commanded La Montausier
to give them to me. Her Majesty.

549
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:37,183
But canaries...

550
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:39,321
are so small.

551
00:55:39,522 --> 00:55:43,185
I don't think that their hearts will be
enough to ease the Prince's pain.

552
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:46,854
See, all this rich food
is very bad for his gout.

553
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:50,361
I can't serve him omelet to celebrate
the visit of the King of France!

554
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:54,229
It 's not your fault. I just wish
I had some better birds, that 's all.

555
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:57,867
I have my parrots.

556
00:55:58,074 --> 00:56:00,668
But surely, Vatel,
you will not sacrifice...

557
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:03,141
If the Prince's pain
gets too great to bear...

558
00:56:03,346 --> 00:56:05,007
send to me for my parrots.

559
00:56:05,214 --> 00:56:07,580
Tell the Princess
the canaries are too small.

560
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:10,452
Demaury!

561
00:56:12,822 --> 00:56:16,019
Return those birds to
Madame de Montausier's room.

562
00:56:28,171 --> 00:56:32,039
Condé is lucky. This banquet
would shame a Roman emperor.

563
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,305
Who is this Vatel?
Where does he come from?

564
00:56:36,512 --> 00:56:39,743
Nowhere.
The slums of Paris.

565
00:56:39,949 --> 00:56:41,678
He was apprentice to Eberhardt 's,
I believe.

566
00:56:41,884 --> 00:56:45,513
Eberhardt 's? Fromlle Saint-Louis?
My mother swore by Eberhardt 's.

567
00:56:45,722 --> 00:56:49,818
So did your father. Although I don't
think he went there for the pastries.

568
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,285
Vatel, I was just telling
the Duchess here...

569
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:58,798
It 's quite true.

570
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,300
No one knows more about the brothels
of thelle-Saint Louis...

571
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:03,597
than the Marquis de Lauzun.

572
00:57:08,978 --> 00:57:11,742
I think he's just insulted you,
but it 's hard to tell.

573
00:57:11,948 --> 00:57:14,041
That 's a rare gift.
If you punish him for it...

574
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,343
I'll tell everyone
your favorite perversion.

575
00:57:21,224 --> 00:57:23,089
Fetch Bourdelot.

576
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:29,999
From lndia?

577
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:33,031
How beautiful! lngenious!

578
00:57:33,236 --> 00:57:36,694
I have learned something today.
Which is rare.

579
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:16,569
-You sent for me, Vatel?
-I need something.

580
00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:18,371
-Are you in pain?
-No.

581
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:20,981
I'm in the grip of some anxiety.

582
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:24,880
Anxiety? I've got nothing
for anxiety. I'm a doctor!

583
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:26,851
Vatel!

584
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:30,514
Go!

585
00:58:30,726 --> 00:58:32,125
Vatel!

586
00:58:32,862 --> 00:58:38,767
And now for you! One, two, three.
And more, and more!

587
00:58:39,435 --> 00:58:42,233
I am the steward of the fish.

588
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:45,965
They tell me these carps
are called Love-Carps.

589
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:54,944
Gourville gave me your message.

590
00:58:57,954 --> 00:59:01,890
You understand me like none
of my friends understand me.

591
00:59:02,158 --> 00:59:04,752
I hope you find your perfection.

592
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:08,021
I know I'm looking
in the wrong place.

593
00:59:08,297 --> 00:59:10,265
But when I despair...

594
00:59:10,466 --> 00:59:14,425
I shall remember there was a man
who looked into my soul.

595
00:59:16,172 --> 00:59:19,938
Sport! I demand!
There shall be a race!

596
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:23,276
-Between Efriat...
-Yes!

597
00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:24,605
...and Carl.
-In!

598
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:26,475
Efriat, now!

599
01:00:32,748 --> 01:00:35,740
Master Vatel,
the horses are ready.

600
01:00:36,686 --> 01:00:38,381
Come on.

601
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:36,563
What awonderful spectacle!

602
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:40,609
Condé, who is responsible
for these marvels?

603
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,607
My steward, Your Majesty.

604
01:02:42,812 --> 01:02:44,746
And what is his name?

605
01:02:44,947 --> 01:02:47,108
François Vatel.

606
01:02:56,959 --> 01:02:59,587
Bring me this Vatel.

607
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:02,795
I would like
to congratulate him.

608
01:03:08,637 --> 01:03:11,162
16,OOO pounds of
flares and rockets...

609
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:13,569
gone up in smoke
to kill a groom.

610
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:19,775
Sir, the King wishes
to speak with you.

611
01:03:19,982 --> 01:03:21,574
Not now, please.

612
01:03:21,784 --> 01:03:24,275
Does he think all this
happens by itself?

613
01:03:24,954 --> 01:03:27,718
I want everything cleaned up
by dawn. Understand?

614
01:03:42,438 --> 01:03:44,872
-Is it Friday already?
-Yes, nearly.

615
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:48,703
I must send Demaury to look out
for the fish. The roads are bad.

616
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,823
-Demaury, Jean-Marie is dead.
-I know.

617
01:04:07,029 --> 01:04:09,827
-You must tell his family.
-I sent a messenger to tell them.

618
01:04:10,032 --> 01:04:12,057
Monsieur, the Queen is asking
for crystallized fruits.

619
01:04:12,268 --> 01:04:13,462
Well, get on!

620
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:22,334
Lauzun!
Withered away, Lauzun?

621
01:04:25,714 --> 01:04:28,046
The King has called for Vatel.

622
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,482
He's refused to come.
Claims he is too busy. Monsieur.

623
01:04:32,688 --> 01:04:34,280
Lauzun?

624
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:39,086
I'll pass his message
onto the King.

625
01:04:47,503 --> 01:04:48,492
Monsieur.

626
01:04:56,111 --> 01:04:57,703
Halt!

627
01:04:59,114 --> 01:05:01,207
-What is your business?
-King's business.

628
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:04,716
Envoys from Holland.
Let me go! Let me pass!

629
01:05:05,788 --> 01:05:08,916
The black Queen loses, Colbert.

630
01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:10,682
Let me try to help.

631
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:14,226
Your Majesty, my hand
needs all the help it can get.

632
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,423
If Colbert loses, he won't be able
to pay our workmen at Versailles.

633
01:05:18,834 --> 01:05:21,598
-Monsieur, are you all right?
-How many workers do we have?

634
01:05:21,804 --> 01:05:23,271
3O thousand, Your Majesty.

635
01:05:23,472 --> 01:05:26,964
Well, Monsieur, don't deal him
the black Queen.

636
01:05:27,176 --> 01:05:29,303
How many orange trees
do we have, Colbert?

637
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:33,414
-One thousand, Your Majesty.
-And one hundred in silver cups.

638
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:36,141
Versailles is
my favorite mistress.

639
01:05:36,352 --> 01:05:39,048
That 's why she costs you
so much.

640
01:05:41,056 --> 01:05:43,422
What are you staking, Prince?

641
01:05:43,626 --> 01:05:45,321
Ten ''louie''.

642
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:48,653
Ten ''louie''?

643
01:05:49,198 --> 01:05:51,428
How many fountains
do we have, Colbert?

644
01:05:51,634 --> 01:05:55,070
One and a half thousand,
Your Majesty. Forfeit.

645
01:05:57,506 --> 01:06:00,532
For Versailles, if I lose.

646
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:03,473
For something of yours,
if I win.

647
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:05,977
A glove perhaps, mon frére.

648
01:06:10,753 --> 01:06:15,087
But one glove is no good
to anybody. Now...

649
01:06:15,591 --> 01:06:17,149
What?

650
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:24,924
Well, Prince?

651
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:28,227
I have nothing do add to the glory
of Versailles, Your Majesty.

652
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:30,405
But that 's not true.

653
01:06:30,973 --> 01:06:34,136
You have something
rarer than diamonds.

654
01:06:34,543 --> 01:06:37,068
You have
the Master of Pleasures.

655
01:06:39,014 --> 01:06:40,276
Majesty?

656
01:06:40,482 --> 01:06:45,112
Vatel is worthy of a larger stage. And
Versailles could use a man of his gifts.

657
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:53,624
You are asking me to stake
my Master Steward on a card game?

658
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:56,463
Do you have any objections?
Look what you might win!

659
01:07:06,141 --> 01:07:08,234
We take the bet.

660
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:16,147
Are we playing or not?

661
01:07:20,589 --> 01:07:22,523
Very well.

662
01:07:23,525 --> 01:07:25,823
Then we'll play.

663
01:07:27,096 --> 01:07:30,532
Your Majesty, the envoys
from Holland are arrived.

664
01:07:30,733 --> 01:07:32,428
Then they come in
an interesting moment.

665
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:34,660
This is true.

666
01:07:37,673 --> 01:07:39,231
Well...

667
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:43,405
it 's between you two.

668
01:07:43,979 --> 01:07:45,913
Prince.

669
01:07:59,128 --> 01:08:01,358
Black Queen.

670
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:04,791
Bad luck.

671
01:08:06,435 --> 01:08:08,335
The envoys.

672
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:42,197
If His Majesty comes out smiling,
it will be peace with Holland.

673
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:46,471
No, if he returns smiling,
it will be war.

674
01:08:46,675 --> 01:08:48,267
War?

675
01:08:48,477 --> 01:08:50,377
What do you think, Monsieur?

676
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:53,044
Certainly one or the other.

677
01:08:53,248 --> 01:08:56,115
Also if he returns frowning.

678
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:10,691
Your Majesty...

679
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,525
Condé...

680
01:09:14,303 --> 01:09:16,965
what are your opinions of war?

681
01:09:19,975 --> 01:09:23,502
I have seen too much
of destruction, Your Majesty.

682
01:09:23,712 --> 01:09:25,407
William of Orange
has declined the offer...

683
01:09:25,614 --> 01:09:28,412
of the daughter of
the Duchess of La Valliière.

684
01:09:28,617 --> 01:09:31,245
Gallantly telling us that
his family only marries...

685
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:33,944
the legitimate daughters
of kings.

686
01:09:34,156 --> 01:09:36,920
-Not their bastards.
-I see.

687
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:40,391
Furthermore, the ruler of
the flat earth has minted coins...

688
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:43,793
with the image of the sun.

689
01:09:44,967 --> 01:09:47,663
That is impertinent.

690
01:09:48,437 --> 01:09:53,568
He has commissioned an oil painting
of one of my flagships sinking.

691
01:09:57,546 --> 01:09:59,514
With your permission...

692
01:09:59,715 --> 01:10:03,446
I will drown him in
one of his dikes, Majesty.

693
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:28,432
You do not have
the command yet, Prince.

694
01:10:29,011 --> 01:10:31,673
It is between you and Turenne.

695
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,611
-Turenne.
-Oh, I'm sure all will be all right.

696
01:10:35,818 --> 01:10:39,015
After all, you have the King
under your roof.

697
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:42,418
And Vatel to perform
his miracles.

698
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:44,649
The King is pleased with you.

699
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:48,159
Generals have been chosen
for worse reasons.

700
01:10:48,363 --> 01:10:51,161
Tomorrow will be decisive.

701
01:10:54,069 --> 01:10:56,162
No, no.
Just leave me this one.

702
01:11:07,749 --> 01:11:11,014
The Prince is grateful
and would like to see you.

703
01:11:26,702 --> 01:11:29,637
-Her Majesty?
-Asleep, Madame.

704
01:11:31,406 --> 01:11:34,569
They were brought back.
Orders of Monsieur Vatel.

705
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:38,471
Would you like me
to undress you, Madame?

706
01:11:39,882 --> 01:11:41,406
No.

707
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:53,486
Fortune seems to be with us.
A war with Holland.

708
01:11:53,695 --> 01:11:58,462
Turenne is scheming to get Colbert 's
backing. The King favors me I think.

709
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:00,897
He will make an announcement
at the banquet tomorrow.

710
01:12:01,103 --> 01:12:05,005
-Everything must be perfect.
-Everything will be perfect, my Prince.

711
01:12:05,707 --> 01:12:08,073
We've always understood
each other.

712
01:12:08,277 --> 01:12:12,509
You are a great man, Vatel.
You will end up as aVicomte.

713
01:12:19,988 --> 01:12:22,115
-You have heard.
-Heard?

714
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:24,758
The King wants you
at Versailles.

715
01:12:24,993 --> 01:12:28,394
Versailles?
I'm a cook, not a courtier.

716
01:12:28,597 --> 01:12:32,055
The King wishes to honor you.

717
01:12:37,806 --> 01:12:39,296
Go.

718
01:12:39,942 --> 01:12:42,240
I am sorry. I can't.

719
01:12:42,444 --> 01:12:44,639
I cannot leave my people.

720
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:06,884
We have a present for you.
From the Marquis de Lauzun.

721
01:14:17,706 --> 01:14:20,300
This will teach you
not to step above your station.

722
01:14:22,778 --> 01:14:25,303
In the name of the King,
let him go.

723
01:14:26,248 --> 01:14:28,375
What do you want, Messieurs?

724
01:14:34,022 --> 01:14:36,081
Preparation!

725
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:38,088
And plunge!

726
01:14:38,293 --> 01:14:41,558
Excellent. Edouard... calf.
Louis. Back.

727
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:43,856
John! Wrist.

728
01:14:44,433 --> 01:14:48,130
Bravo. Excellent.
And now... Open...

729
01:14:59,915 --> 01:15:02,213
Tell Lauzun enough!

730
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:08,818
His Highness, the King's brother,
presents his compliments, Mons. Vatel.

731
01:15:09,257 --> 01:15:13,125
He requests us to escort you
to your apartments.

732
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:16,458
It won't be necessary.

733
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:00,890
I wanted to thank you.

734
01:16:02,363 --> 01:16:04,024
If the King knew
you were here...

735
01:16:04,232 --> 01:16:06,757
The King is busy with
Madame de Montespan.

736
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,493
No one has seen me.

737
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:19,138
So you are coming
to Versailles, Monsieur.

738
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,439
Or haven't you heard?

739
01:16:21,783 --> 01:16:24,377
My Prince will never allow it.

740
01:16:27,889 --> 01:16:30,824
One of my people
was killed today.

741
01:16:33,995 --> 01:16:35,485
Who was it?

742
01:16:35,697 --> 01:16:39,064
His name was
Jean-Marie Benoud.

743
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:43,597
28 years old,
from the village of St. Crose.

744
01:16:43,805 --> 01:16:46,205
His father is a miller there.

745
01:16:46,741 --> 01:16:50,507
His mother died of
asweating sickness two years ago.

746
01:16:50,712 --> 01:16:53,579
He had two brothers.
One a priest.

747
01:16:55,016 --> 01:16:57,678
He came here as astable boy...

748
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:00,911
he was senior groom
for three years.

749
01:17:01,656 --> 01:17:03,647
Three years.

750
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:10,955
-You knew him well.
-No. Not particularly.

751
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:16,863
He was one of my people.

752
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:19,972
He was fortunate in that.

753
01:17:25,513 --> 01:17:29,347
Why did you save
my birds, Monsieur?

754
01:17:35,323 --> 01:17:39,555
Because they were too small
to do any good, Madame.

755
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:53,272
And because...

756
01:17:58,613 --> 01:18:00,638
because...

757
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,874
because they were yours.

758
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,762
Madame!

759
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:53,728
Madame!

760
01:19:01,743 --> 01:19:04,371
-Anne!
-His Majesty!

761
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:05,978
Go.

762
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:12,051
He asked for me.
He wants me.

763
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:17,884
It 's the King!
I'm a fool.

764
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:21,491
Yesterday you were a fool.
Stay here.

765
01:19:21,696 --> 01:19:26,190
You think I can do that? You have
lived among the farmers too long.

766
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:31,197
Condé gave you away
at the card table.

767
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:35,136
To please the King he gave you away
like a hound from his kennels.

768
01:20:27,728 --> 01:20:31,562
The King has retired.
Alone.

769
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:36,328
-We searched high and low.
-I was...

770
01:20:36,537 --> 01:20:38,630
I know where you were.

771
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,775
But I would never betray you.

772
01:20:52,987 --> 01:20:56,286
Now I told the King that you were
probably consoling a dear friend...

773
01:20:56,991 --> 01:20:59,084
the Duc de Longueville.

774
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:06,896
The way his wife puts herself about
is disgraceful.

775
01:21:07,235 --> 01:21:09,465
Don't you think?

776
01:21:13,174 --> 01:21:15,734
You are a true friend.

777
01:21:18,913 --> 01:21:21,780
Well, you will need a friend now,
won't you?

778
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,151
Would you do me the honor
of sharing a cup of chocolate...

779
01:21:29,624 --> 01:21:31,387
with me...

780
01:21:31,592 --> 01:21:34,459
even at this late hour?

781
01:21:36,597 --> 01:21:40,055
I think you'll find the King a less
democratic man than myself.

782
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:43,669
And it would be tragic,
would it not...

783
01:21:43,871 --> 01:21:47,204
if Vatel were to be sent back
to his former master...

784
01:21:47,408 --> 01:21:49,842
a prisoner of Pignerole?

785
01:22:57,712 --> 01:23:00,840
-My lord! ls there any news?
-News?

786
01:23:01,082 --> 01:23:03,380
From the money.
The money from the King.

787
01:23:03,584 --> 01:23:05,552
Money?
Yes, for sure.

788
01:23:05,753 --> 01:23:08,313
The news is very good.
The King is well pleased with us.

789
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:11,650
-My God. Where is Vatel?
-I'm looking for him myself.

790
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:15,626
-Is everything all right?
-Oh, yes. Indeed.

791
01:23:42,423 --> 01:23:44,687
-Is that all?
-Yes, sir.

792
01:23:46,394 --> 01:23:48,191
Have you seen other fish carts
on the road?

793
01:23:48,396 --> 01:23:50,694
No, sir. There are storms
all along the coast.

794
01:23:50,898 --> 01:23:53,765
Few boats put to sea at all
and they came back empty.

795
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:56,735
Empty!

796
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:08,607
-Come back tomorrow to be paid.
-Thank you, Monsieur Vatel.

797
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:03,697
MydearPrince.
Todaythisbanquet willbe mylast.

798
01:25:03,904 --> 01:25:06,372
But It willbe magnificent.

799
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,768
The broth will be made
from garlic and leeks.

800
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:13,572
Demaury, remember to blanch the green
vegetables before you sauté them...

801
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:16,181
or they will collapse
while waiting for the King.

802
01:25:16,383 --> 01:25:18,214
The lobsters will be grilled.

803
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:21,115
They must be cut in half,
when they are still alive.

804
01:25:21,322 --> 01:25:23,950
Be sure the knife
is big and sharp.

805
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:25,887
Don't worry.

806
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:28,323
Everything will be perfect.

807
01:25:34,535 --> 01:25:37,003
Monsieur Vatel,
a lady dropped her fan.

808
01:25:37,204 --> 01:25:39,502
Not now, Thibault.
Not now.

809
01:26:26,787 --> 01:26:30,553
Monsieur Vatel.

810
01:26:32,393 --> 01:26:34,384
From His Majesty.

811
01:26:34,595 --> 01:26:37,063
It 's your commission
for Versailles.

812
01:26:38,499 --> 01:26:41,696
The King commands that you
leave for the court tomorrow.

813
01:26:42,303 --> 01:26:45,067
There will be awagon
for your personal baggage.

814
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,765
Do you have a horse?

815
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:51,475
He'll await your answer.

816
01:26:52,012 --> 01:26:55,311
Monsieur!
Are you there?

817
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:35,946
Bravo!

818
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,192
It 's your turn.

819
01:28:08,289 --> 01:28:12,726
Monsieur! Wonderful news!
The fish carts! They are arriving.

820
01:30:02,636 --> 01:30:04,797
Poor little things.

821
01:30:08,642 --> 01:30:10,872
Like prisoners.

822
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:17,446
Madame...

823
01:30:18,452 --> 01:30:20,147
What is it?

824
01:30:20,354 --> 01:30:22,049
Vatel...

825
01:30:23,624 --> 01:30:25,683
This is for you.

826
01:30:27,227 --> 01:30:29,695
I am sorry.

827
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:53,584
Madame,you were right.

828
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:57,120
I was not the master
of these festivities...

829
01:30:57,324 --> 01:30:59,588
but their slave.

830
01:31:01,995 --> 01:31:04,225
When you read this...

831
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:07,764
Is hall have left this world
with only one regret.

832
01:31:08,168 --> 01:31:10,602
That I cannot be with you.

833
01:31:21,281 --> 01:31:24,739
In the last three days
I have come to understand...

834
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:28,080
that I treasure freedom
above all.

835
01:31:29,022 --> 01:31:32,958
Between Condé and Versailles
the pass is narrow...

836
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,424
and I have takenlt.

837
01:31:37,297 --> 01:31:40,198
May you find a better road.

838
01:31:42,402 --> 01:31:46,270
Your home is, I think,
in the south.

839
01:31:46,473 --> 01:31:49,806
If so, remember that
there is a place...

840
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,376
not faraway, in Vaucluse...

841
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:55,377
where they plant cherry trees
among the vines.

842
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,883
The taste of the cherries...

843
01:31:59,086 --> 01:32:02,522
comes through in the wine.

844
01:32:09,596 --> 01:32:12,622
The fish banquet was
a tremendous success...

845
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:17,202
even though the sauce lacked
perhaps that touch of perfection.

846
01:32:17,971 --> 01:32:19,700
But that was over looked...

847
01:32:19,907 --> 01:32:23,001
in the excitement of
declaring waron the Dutch...

848
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:26,668
and of Condé receiving
his command.

849
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:31,981
0f course no one dared
to tell the kingthe truth.

850
01:32:32,185 --> 01:32:34,244
And soon the word went round...

851
01:32:34,454 --> 01:32:37,582
Vatel killed him self
because of the fish.

852
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:40,316
Which flattered His Majesty...

853
01:32:40,527 --> 01:32:43,087
and pleased his courtiers.

854
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:51,467
Anne de Montausierleft Chantilly
quietly by a side gate...

855
01:32:51,672 --> 01:32:54,232
and never returned to court.
