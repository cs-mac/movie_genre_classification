1
00:02:56,787 --> 00:03:00,612
Of all the words my father wrote,
and there were many,

2
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,872
I remember these most:

3
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:08,564
"Nothing in human progress
is achieved with unanimous consent.

4
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,675
Those enlightened before others"

5
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:15,511
must pursue that light
in spite of others.

6
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:20,074
There was a time
the New World didn't exist.

7
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:25,305
The sun set in the west,
where no man ventured.

8
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,754
And beyond that...

9
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,366
infinity!

10
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,462
Look.

11
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,502
Now...

12
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,953
half of the hull has gone.

13
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,790
Good.

14
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,083
And now?

15
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:47,540
Now, I only see the mast.

16
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,959
Close your eyes.
And don't cheat.

17
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:58,752
I'm watching.

18
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,322
Open them when I tell you.

19
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:12,209
Once I asked my father
where he wanted to go.

20
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,964
He replied:

21
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,585
"I want to travel over the seas.

22
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:20,494
I want to get behind the weather."

23
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,378
Now.

24
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:26,794
It's gone.

25
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,090
What does it tell you?

26
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,496
It's round,

27
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,551
like this.

28
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:51,051
Round.

29
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:56,472
Come on, lad.

30
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,223
Good morning, Father.

31
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:29,183
Diego!

32
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,249
Kiss your brother, Diego.

33
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:00,648
I have something for you.

34
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,805
You'll be heard
at Salamanca University.

35
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:10,751
In a week!

36
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,483
That's what it says.

37
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:21,504
How did you manage it?

38
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,901
With some difficulty.

39
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,258
I promised them
you weren't a total fool.

40
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:47,781
Marco Polo said he found Earthly
Paradise off the coast of China.

41
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:49,947
Do you believe this?

42
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:56,616
I believe in Paradise and Hell.
And I do believe both can be earthly.

43
00:06:56,865 --> 00:07:00,325
Now...
let's go through this again.

44
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,971
Why do you wish to sail west?

45
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,155
To open a new route to Asia.

46
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:14,690
Asia is the richest Kingdom.
The land of spices and gold.

47
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:18,715
There are two ways of reaching it...

48
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:22,422
By sea...
Sailing around the African continent,

49
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,631
which takes a year,

50
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:29,643
or by land. But the Turks
have closed the route to Christians.

51
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:32,004
There is a third way...

52
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,708
by sailing west across the sea.

53
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,777
The distance is unknown...

54
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:43,997
It's said to be infinite.

55
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,553
Superstition!

56
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:53,780
I believe the Indies

57
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:58,792
are no more than 750 leagues
west of the Canary Islands.

58
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,326
How can you be so certain?

59
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:06,289
The calculations of Toscanelli...
Marin de Tyr...

60
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,043
Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.

61
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:10,376
So was Christ!
- 2 minutes...

62
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:12,961
and already you're a bad man.

63
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:15,002
For telling the truth?
- Yes.

64
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:17,916
They're burning people for less.

65
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,001
The man you're to confront

66
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,201
has no emotions.

67
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,247
Learn to control your passion.

68
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,132
Passion is something
one can't control.

69
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,272
You need their blessing.

70
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:33,215
If they say no...

71
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:36,384
you would have to give up.

72
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,517
I will not give up.

73
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,801
Is it ambition?

74
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:44,469
We've been told lies for so long...

75
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,246
The world is flat like this table...

76
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:51,176
Monsters guard
the edge of the world...

77
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:54,741
I will not be told what
and what not to be afraid of!

78
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,814
I want to find out for myself.

79
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:03,742
I just hope your passion
will be contagious, my son.

80
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,385
Look, father!

81
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,513
Fernando!

82
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:29,190
Do you repent your sins

83
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,147
in the name of the Father,

84
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,950
the Son and the Holy Spirit?

85
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,109
Burnings in the square...

86
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,124
They agreed to see me in Salamanca.

87
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:48,040
If they accept
I could be gone for years.

88
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,042
I know.

89
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:54,751
I haven't given you a real life.

90
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:59,368
Uh...that's true, I have a child
by a man who won't marry me...

91
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,924
Are you going to argue?

92
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:05,717
I'd love to argue with you more
often, but you're never here.

93
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:42,010
Unfortunately, that is precisely
where our opinions differ.

94
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:46,136
You're familiar with Aristotle?
Eratosthenes? Ptolemeus?

95
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:48,010
I am, Your Eminence.

96
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:52,375
So you can't ignore their
calculations that the circumference

97
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:57,056
of the Earth is approximately
22,000 leagues or more...

98
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:59,682
making the ocean uncrossable.

99
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:00,889
But you...

100
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,671
may have found new evidence

101
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:08,078
proving these great men mistaken!

102
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:15,349
You are aware of Marin de Tyr?

103
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,806
We are.

104
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:22,559
Then you are also aware that
his theories contradict Ptolemeus...

105
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:26,966
De Tyr believes the ocean to be
only 750 leagues.

106
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,518
Toscanelli...

107
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:32,895
and the French Cardinal D'Ailly,
both think De Tyr

108
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:35,560
is accurate in his calculations.

109
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,696
Therefore the ocean can be crossed.

110
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:42,602
Silence!

111
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:48,470
Gentlemen, are we here to examine
this man's proposal, or not?

112
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,981
Let's suppose the moment...

113
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:54,980
Marin de Tyr is right.
In your opinion,

114
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:57,562
how long would it take?

115
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,594
Seven weeks.

116
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,562
Six, during the summer.

117
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:02,192
De Tyr is wrong.

118
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,547
He's contradicted by the finest...

119
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:07,607
geographers.

120
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,505
Your voyage, Señor Colombus,
would take a year.

121
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:16,151
Suppose you cross the ocean
and reach Asia...

122
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:18,455
What would Spain do there?

123
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,235
Trade, Your Excellency.

124
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:25,523
According to Marco Polo,
the Kingdom of China

125
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:29,611
...is one of the richest
lands in the worlds

126
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,657
The meanest buildings
are roofed in gold.

127
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,614
It's your only interest?

128
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:35,736
Gold?

129
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:37,695
No.

130
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,820
I'll bring these people to God

131
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:45,270
and make them subjects
of Castille and Aragon.

132
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,607
From a Realm,

133
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,198
Spain will become an Empire!

134
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,072
If God intended our proximity to Asia

135
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:57,239
do you believe he'd have waited
for you to show it?

136
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:01,781
He chose a carpenter's son
to reveal Himself to the world.

137
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:04,647
So you consider yourself
the Chosen One?

138
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:15,952
Asia can be found to the west...

139
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:17,527
and I will prove it!

140
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:35,237
The Treasurer of Spain honours us.

141
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:39,414
The State has an interest
in his proposition, Your Eminence.

142
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:42,959
With all due respect,
the judgement is ours.

143
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,083
Why not?

144
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:45,884
And if he were right?

145
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:52,503
I've always found
such independent minds dangerous.

146
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:57,032
If he had wings
he'd return from the skies

147
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:00,401
and say heaven was empty.

148
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:07,087
I'd deplore the loss
of such an opportunity for Spain.

149
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:09,670
Especially over a point of geography.

150
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:12,837
It's not geography.
It's about reality.

151
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,276
This man is a mercenary.

152
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:17,795
States often use mercenaries.

153
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:22,548
If it is to the benefit,
the stability of Spain...No?

154
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:28,012
It should be as much your concern
as it is mine.

155
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:34,716
You would use your
influence to assist this heretic?

156
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:35,673
Well...

157
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:42,050
You know, your Eminence, the
fascinating thing about power...

158
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:45,030
is that what can be given...

159
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:51,605
so easily can be taken away.

160
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:13,314
And therefore nothing could justify
Your Majesties' participation

161
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:17,319
in a venture that relies on
feeble assumptions,

162
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,998
and which any man of knowledge

163
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:24,369
would take to be impractical...
if not impossible.

164
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:28,330
They didn't listen.
They don't want to listen.

165
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,616
Don't give in. You must wait.
- Wait?

166
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,829
After seven years,
how much longer can I wait?

167
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,413
If God intends you to...

168
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,036
Damn God!
- Christopher!

169
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:43,245
Damn all of you! You sit concocting
theories based on what?

170
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,080
You never leave your gardens.
Go out!

171
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:49,958
Well then, tell me something
I can accept.

172
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:54,537
These are full of assumptions!

173
00:18:57,622 --> 00:18:58,874
Just lies!

174
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,498
All of it lies!

175
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,127
All of it lies!

176
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,964
Father?

177
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,090
Don't disturb a man

178
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,846
doing penance.

179
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,591
What can you do?

180
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:47,217
Nothing.
That's the point, Fernando.

181
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,091
Fernando!

182
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,409
Señor Colombus?

183
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,908
I've looked all over Sevilla for you.

184
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:46,385
Never expected to find you
in a monastery.

185
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:49,370
I'm Pinzon.

186
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:53,659
Martin Alonzo Pinzon.
I'm a ship owner from Palos.

187
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,471
Is he a spy?

188
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:09,743
What is it?
Are you a Trappist?

189
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:11,836
Vow of silence?

190
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,247
Penance?

191
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:15,062
Just my luck.

192
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,497
I'll do the talking for us.

193
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,248
Just nod, agreed?

194
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,125
As with my wife.

195
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:24,368
I know the commission
turned you down, right?

196
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:26,745
What do you expect?
You're a foreigner.

197
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,935
And I want to help you.

198
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,745
Why do I believe in you?
I'm a seaman, too.

199
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:36,799
We don't like to be told
where to go or not to go.

200
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:41,501
I don't look much, but I have friends,

201
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:42,971
important friends.

202
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,362
A banker, for example.

203
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,169
He finances me.
He's name is Santangel.

204
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:49,796
Heard of him?

205
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:52,962
He'll get you in to see the Queen.

206
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,423
You know why?

207
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:56,874
She owes him money.
That's for it.

208
00:21:56,878 --> 00:22:01,390
You, me, the Queen, the world...
Everybody owes something.

209
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:03,007
What do you say?

210
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,583
Where can I meet him?
- Here.

211
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,716
Right there.

212
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,004
May I ask a question?

213
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:17,634
Yes.

214
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,511
Why do you want to help me?

215
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:24,217
Faith.

216
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,089
Hope.

217
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:28,052
Charity.

218
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,757
But greater than all these...

219
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,399
is banking.

220
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,203
Wait, Señores!

221
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,202
The Moors built Granada centuries ago.

222
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:48,776
We've taken it back.

223
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:53,114
A tragic victory.
We're losing a great culture.

224
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:01,206
But I suppose there's a price
for every victory.

225
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,396
Isn't there Señor Colombus?

226
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,627
Don Luis de Santangel

227
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:27,334
to see Don Gabriel Sanchez.

228
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:28,377
Luis!

229
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,565
Señor Columbus, Señor Pinzon.

230
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,054
Rise...
Come forward.

231
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,553
I should not be listening to you
since my Council said not to.

232
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,174
But Santangel says you're
a man of honour...

233
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:44,634
And Sanchez says
you're not completely mad.

234
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:47,702
No more than she who said...

235
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:50,929
she would take Granada from the Moors.

236
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:53,984
They believe the ocean is...
uncrossable,

237
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:56,142
Señor Colombus.

238
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:59,427
What did they say about Granada?

239
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,973
That it was impregnable.

240
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:23,518
I can't ignore my Council's verdict.

241
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,437
Surely you can do what you want.

242
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:30,311
How little you know.

243
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:36,604
Why should I believe in you,
Señor Colombus?

244
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:42,587
May I speak freely?

245
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:45,523
You are not inclined
to speak otherwise.

246
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,131
I know what I see.

247
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:50,967
I see someone who doesn't
accept the world as it is.

248
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:52,176
Who's not afraid.

249
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:56,879
I see a woman who thinks...
- A woman?

250
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:01,540
Forgive me...

251
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,134
but you're the only Queen I know.

252
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:11,074
That makes us equal,
you're the only navigator I know.

253
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,552
How old are you, Señor Colombus?

254
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:20,850
Thirty-nine, Your Majesty.

255
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,343
And you?

256
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:27,140
I'm forty...

257
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,097
You will be informed of our decision.

258
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:53,003
I thought you were younger than I.

259
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:10,668
The cost would be ruinous.

260
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,807
No more than the cost
of two state banquets.

261
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:24,844
Two banquets,
for new lands and spices...

262
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:28,089
and gold.

263
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,463
What are you saying, Sanchez?

264
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:36,029
That if he's right
we have everything to gain.

265
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,045
And if he's wrong...

266
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,064
we've so little to lose.

267
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:05,977
Tell me what he says.

268
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:09,144
He demands to be made a Knight,

269
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,056
with the right to wear
the Golden Spurs.

270
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:16,089
And that he will receive the title
Don Christopher Colombus,

271
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:20,270
which will be extended
to his descendants.

272
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:26,314
What else?

273
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:29,559
He'll be named
Admiral of the Ocean Seas.

274
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,893
Viceroy of the West Indies...

275
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:36,097
Governor of all islands
or lands discovered,

276
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:39,473
or as will be discovered by him.

277
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:44,094
The highest titles of nobility,
Your Excellency.

278
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:47,637
To an immigrant sheltered by monks!

279
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,005
Furthermore...

280
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,506
he'll receive one tenth

281
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,340
of wealth or monies,

282
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,845
precious gems,

283
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:07,134
pearls, metals, spices
and other lucrative sources

284
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:10,802
acquired under his jurisdiction.

285
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:17,223
You worry too much, Francisco.

286
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:22,027
He'll have to lower his demands.

287
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:23,303
Believe me...

288
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,890
He will.

289
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,596
I won't!

290
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:35,805
We have considered your proposal
carefully. It is excessive.

291
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:38,681
The responsibility is excessive.

292
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:41,174
Consider the contract...
- No.

293
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:45,491
No?
- No.

294
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,187
And I thought he was an idealist.

295
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:51,311
Idealism and ambition
are not incompatible.

296
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:55,811
I've fought too hard.
Now you expect me to take all the risks

297
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:58,475
while you take the profit.
- No...

298
00:30:58,476 --> 00:31:01,020
I'm not a servant...
- Señor Colombus,

299
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:02,982
you are in no position...

300
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:05,565
to bargain with me.

301
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,025
I'm not bargaining.

302
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:09,158
Then you are too ambitious.

303
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,137
And where you never ambitious?

304
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:23,108
Is ambition a virtue among nobles
but a fault for the rest of us?

305
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:24,673
If you won't accept we can

306
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,316
simply find someone who will.

307
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:31,946
If you can do that, Excellency...

308
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:38,274
I'll become a monk!

309
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,075
Your Majesty.

310
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:10,091
He'll become a monk...

311
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:14,029
It would be a pity, wouldn't it?

312
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:16,994
Call him back.

313
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,278
She said yes.

314
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,954
If I ever come back, I swear...

315
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:42,457
I don't want you to swear anything.

316
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:45,207
I don't want you to wait for me.

317
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:48,999
That's something
you can't decide for me.

318
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:33,204
Forgive me Father, I have sinned.

319
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:37,006
I am listening, my son.

320
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:41,841
Father...
I have betrayed my family.

321
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,799
I betrayed my men,

322
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,802
and I betrayed you.

323
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:50,353
I lied.

324
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:53,730
The journey is longer than I said.

325
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:55,483
How long?

326
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:57,543
I'm not sure...

327
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:02,374
How could anyone know.
It could be twice the distance.

328
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,224
You must tell them.

329
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:07,587
You must tell your men.
- They wouldn't follow me.

330
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,899
You know I'm right.
You must trust me.

331
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,569
You must speak to them.
If you don't, I will.

332
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,813
You made an oath.

333
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:22,009
May God forgive you.

334
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,065
I believed in you.

335
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:30,867
Give me absolution.

336
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,073
Absolution, Father.

337
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,154
Ego te absolvo a pecatis tuis.

338
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:10,311
Enter.

339
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:15,396
Mendez...

340
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:18,479
Sit down.

341
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:24,334
Wine?

342
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:36,536
What is it, Mendez?
Speak!

343
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:47,331
They wonder how you know our
position with no sight of land?

344
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:49,747
What do you think, Mendez?

345
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:56,070
I know you navigate by the stars
like the Moors...

346
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:57,582
but I don't know how?

347
00:39:04,238 --> 00:39:06,030
Take this quadrant.

348
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:24,036
Find the North Star.

349
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,620
Steady yourself!

350
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,703
Keep the plumbline vertical.

351
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:47,664
And don't move.

352
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:52,353
A mistake of one degree
and we'll be off 600 leagues.

353
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:54,249
What do you read?

354
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:57,747
28.
- That's it!

355
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,722
28th parallel.

356
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:02,947
And we'll follow it
until we reach land.

357
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:08,698
How do you know that
we'll find land of 28th parallel?

358
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,959
I don't.

359
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,390
Mark 26, Sir.

360
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:42,889
Mark 27, Sir.

361
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,392
Mark 28!

362
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,521
Mark 29!

363
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,393
629!

364
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,146
629, Sir.

365
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,062
I heard.

366
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:20,979
Captain, I don't understand.

367
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:23,104
I think I do.

368
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:50,131
We should've seen land.

369
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:56,300
We've been at sea nine weeks,
Alonzo. Can't be that far.

370
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,662
Can't be that near.

371
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:05,113
I don't like the smell
of this sea around here.

372
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:06,490
Smells like a whore!

373
00:43:06,905 --> 00:43:08,666
'Course it does.

374
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:12,053
That's why sailors go to sea.

375
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,542
And why is that one at sea?

376
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,552
Nobody knows.

377
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,542
He never says a word.

378
00:43:22,284 --> 00:43:25,878
Captain Pinzon requests
permission to board.

379
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:37,847
You mislead me.
You lied to me.

380
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:40,576
We are way past 750 leagues.

381
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:43,734
Six days ago, yes.
- You must be mad!

382
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:45,827
Keep your voice down!

383
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:49,036
There'll be a mutiny!
- You think I don't know?

384
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:51,204
We're lost!

385
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:57,205
Land is there. I know it.

386
00:43:57,206 --> 00:43:58,496
You don't know anything.

387
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:02,613
Listen, these are my ships
and we are turning back.

388
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:06,622
And then what? Half of the water
has gone, the rest is putrid!

389
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:08,956
I shouldn't have listened to you...
You...

390
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:11,000
Listen, Pinzon! Pinzon.

391
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:13,741
All we can do...

392
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,688
is go forward.

393
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:21,084
The land is there...
The land is close.

394
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:25,732
You tell them that.
You must tell them.

395
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:41,049
God doesn't want us
to cross this ocean.

396
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,297
This voyage is cursed.

397
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:47,371
We set sail for greed.
God has abandoned us.

398
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,435
The voyage is cursed.
There are signs.

399
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,885
Juanito has the voice of an angel.

400
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:08,811
His mouth is blessed, but what

401
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:11,116
comes out of yours is cursed.

402
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,303
Listen...

403
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:22,001
We're all afraid at first.

404
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:27,294
But those who overcome fear
will rightly earn their reward.

405
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:32,649
I don't know if it's God's will
that we should cross this ocean.

406
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,950
But I am certain it is you
who puts fear into our hearts.

407
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:46,181
We can't be lost if we keep faith
in God and in ourselves.

408
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,246
In time...

409
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,213
they will talk of the
courage of the first

410
00:45:55,215 --> 00:45:58,682
men to cross this ocean, and return.

411
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:01,392
And then you will be
able to say to them,

412
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:02,892
I was on the Pinta...

413
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:05,392
I was on the Nina...

414
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:08,518
and the Santa Maria...

415
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:18,394
This jacket to he who sights land.

416
00:46:18,395 --> 00:46:21,439
And 10,000 maravedis a year for life!

417
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:25,148
I wanna get a man aloft day and night!

418
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:41,233
Alonzo...

419
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:45,036
don't let the wind escape us.

420
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:52,799
You lucky bastard!

421
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:50,213
Mendez...

422
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,211
Mendez!

423
00:48:58,673 --> 00:48:59,756
Land...

424
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:26,430
25 fathoms!

425
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,137
24 fathoms!

426
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,399
There...

427
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:57,807
Land ho!

428
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,446
Drop anchor!

429
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:16,520
Don Christopher...

430
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:47,152
Excellencia...

431
00:55:05,114 --> 00:55:06,239
By the...

432
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:11,823
By the Grace of God...

433
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:20,366
In the name of their
Gracious Majesties

434
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:22,972
of Castilla and Aragon...

435
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:42,953
By all the powers vested in me...

436
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:47,870
I claim this island and name it...

437
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:51,121
San Salvador.

438
00:58:43,946 --> 00:58:45,693
Don Christopher...

439
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:06,989
Muskets!
- No!

440
01:02:40,776 --> 01:02:43,942
October 21st, 1492.

441
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:47,851
I think We have returned to Eden.

442
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,768
Surely this is how the world was
in the beginning of time.

443
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:57,517
If the natives are to be
converted to our ways

444
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:01,687
then it will be by persuasion
and not by force.

445
01:03:02,935 --> 01:03:06,394
I believe no man will ever see
this land again as we do...

446
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:08,020
for the first time.

447
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,842
We come in peace and with honour.

448
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:15,923
They are not savages,
neither will we be.

449
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:20,550
Treat them as you would
your own wives and children.

450
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,812
Respect their beliefs.

451
01:03:22,926 --> 01:03:27,490
Pillage will be punished by
the whip. Rape, by the sword.

452
01:04:16,934 --> 01:04:18,268
You?

453
01:04:21,145 --> 01:04:22,104
Utapan.

454
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:24,605
Utapan?

455
01:04:26,854 --> 01:04:27,813
Columbus.

456
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:33,521
Co...Colum...
Columbus.

457
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:36,437
Co...lombus.

458
01:05:00,236 --> 01:05:02,861
Where did you find this?

459
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,319
Cuba!

460
01:06:01,226 --> 01:06:04,974
Thanks...
I've got a river of gold to piss.

461
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:32,440
Here!

462
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:39,660
Is it gold?

463
01:06:40,024 --> 01:06:42,233
No, no.

464
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:43,649
No good, no.

465
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:28,469
Utapan!

466
01:07:30,906 --> 01:07:32,073
Utapan!

467
01:07:32,283 --> 01:07:34,282
Alonzo! Alonzo!

468
01:07:38,156 --> 01:07:39,324
Help him!

469
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:42,462
Help him!

470
01:07:52,284 --> 01:07:53,910
Do something!

471
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:57,161
Pray for him.

472
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:23,094
With Alonzo's death, I realise how
vulnerable we are in these islands.

473
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:25,647
How much we have to learn.

474
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,430
On every island...

475
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,015
the natives welcome us
with great generosity and trust.

476
01:08:34,974 --> 01:08:39,765
Because of our appearance
we have been mistaken for gods

477
01:08:39,963 --> 01:08:43,672
and are treated accordingly.

478
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:48,056
Despite the Indians' compliance
we have not found gold in quantity,

479
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:53,351
except for the few artefacts they
gave us as a sign of submission.

480
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:08,165
You will speak first.

481
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,047
Tell him we thank him
for his hospitality.

482
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,263
He knows.

483
01:11:17,015 --> 01:11:20,056
Tell him some of my men
are staying here

484
01:11:20,057 --> 01:11:22,058
to build a fort.

485
01:11:22,723 --> 01:11:25,223
I want them to be well treated.

486
01:11:26,309 --> 01:11:27,393
Tell him...

487
01:11:27,476 --> 01:11:30,155
we'll come back.
Many of us.

488
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:33,497
He said, how many?

489
01:11:37,268 --> 01:11:39,998
As many as the leaves on that tree.

490
01:11:41,309 --> 01:11:43,924
And many more will follow.

491
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:49,063
Why?

492
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:53,334
To bring the word of God.

493
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,020
He says he has a God.

494
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:01,261
And also to bring medicine.

495
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:10,325
He says...

496
01:12:10,356 --> 01:12:11,942
...he has medicine.

497
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:15,109
Tell him...

498
01:12:15,608 --> 01:12:17,486
we admire his people.

499
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:34,456
He knows you like his women and gold.

500
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,915
Pinzon is ill...

501
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:51,948
eaten up by a fever
that refuses to leave his body.

502
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:54,884
We must return to Spain.

503
01:12:56,321 --> 01:13:00,657
39 men have volunteered to stay
behind to build a fort.

504
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:03,659
I name it...
La Navidad.

505
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:27,704
After 7 months,
I haven't seen a civilisation

506
01:13:27,955 --> 01:13:31,539
that compares
with Marco Polo's descriptions.

507
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:36,870
No cities, no bridges.
No temples roofed with gold.

508
01:13:39,038 --> 01:13:41,330
The mainland still escapes me.

509
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:44,406
But I know it's there.

510
01:13:46,332 --> 01:13:50,833
My ships are not filled with the
spices and gold I was hoping for.

511
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:55,747
But this land intoxicates
my senses and my soul.

512
01:13:55,748 --> 01:14:00,668
And all I can think of
is to return to this untamed land.

513
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,857
This unexplored Eden.

514
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:05,742
This is a chance for a new beginning.

515
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:45,590
Majestates conjuncta Hispania.

516
01:14:46,302 --> 01:14:49,882
Reges Ferdinandus et Isabella

517
01:14:50,636 --> 01:14:53,968
executores voluntas Dei sunt

518
01:14:54,429 --> 01:14:57,218
et cum vobis Regnum Domini

519
01:14:57,427 --> 01:15:01,845
per terras novas ultra mares crescatur

520
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:05,263
et in eas Crux Cristi

521
01:15:05,678 --> 01:15:08,346
maneat semper.

522
01:16:06,506 --> 01:16:09,976
It won't be easy
to get rid of him now.

523
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:13,467
On the contrary...

524
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,207
It seems he is preparing
his own cross.

525
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:06,006
Let the palate enjoy
the flavour of the tobacco.

526
01:17:07,104 --> 01:17:08,073
Try it.

527
01:17:25,261 --> 01:17:27,877
You say this is an Indian vice?

528
01:17:29,305 --> 01:17:32,713
I don't see the pleasure
that would make it a sin.

529
01:17:35,143 --> 01:17:38,248
The Indians have no such word, Moxica.

530
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,476
Have they such thoughts?

531
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:46,603
They come and go naked
as God created them.

532
01:17:47,103 --> 01:17:49,436
God? Which God?

533
01:17:57,668 --> 01:17:59,595
Nature is their God.

534
01:18:01,418 --> 01:18:04,752
It's as if God and Nature were one.

535
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:08,462
They see him in a leaf...
in a stone...

536
01:18:10,003 --> 01:18:11,212
in a shell.

537
01:18:16,254 --> 01:18:17,630
The islands...

538
01:18:18,588 --> 01:18:20,546
are covered with trees.

539
01:18:22,693 --> 01:18:25,017
Forgive me, Don Cristobal...

540
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:27,267
What about gold?

541
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:34,582
It's not the purest metal I've seen.

542
01:19:34,624 --> 01:19:36,041
Is there more?

543
01:19:40,501 --> 01:19:43,210
We are more than gratified, Cristobal.

544
01:20:40,971 --> 01:20:42,180
Excellente.

545
01:20:52,703 --> 01:20:55,944
You fence well.
- For a commoner?

546
01:20:57,955 --> 01:20:58,995
So...

547
01:21:00,537 --> 01:21:02,788
Your second expedition, hm?

548
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:05,289
17 ships...

549
01:21:06,581 --> 01:21:08,747
and 1500 men?

550
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:10,623
Thanks to you.

551
01:21:11,644 --> 01:21:14,624
This is Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

552
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,896
He can be valuable to you.

553
01:21:17,396 --> 01:21:21,292
He's very well acquainted
with our laws.

554
01:21:30,606 --> 01:21:33,632
I heard you'd be appointing Governors.

555
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:36,603
Will you consider my application?

556
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:41,191
Forgive me, Don Francisco.

557
01:21:41,275 --> 01:21:43,713
The positions are taken.

558
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,026
May I ask by whom?

559
01:21:49,902 --> 01:21:51,965
By two very competent men.

560
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,101
I trust their men of quality.

561
01:21:57,904 --> 01:22:02,061
Francisco is qualified
for high administration.

562
01:22:02,488 --> 01:22:03,613
Well...

563
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:07,593
we do lack notaries.

564
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,031
You should contact my administration.

565
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:15,938
Francisco is a judge.

566
01:22:16,115 --> 01:22:17,491
Good...

567
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,867
we also need judges.

568
01:22:20,242 --> 01:22:22,731
Except, there are no crimes as such.

569
01:22:24,742 --> 01:22:26,743
I see I was mistaken.

570
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:31,807
He has no need for my services.

571
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,744
Sanchez.

572
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:41,328
You have a special talent
for making enemies.

573
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:43,787
Why do I have so many already?

574
01:22:50,831 --> 01:22:56,613
Don't you think to rise so high in so
short a time is dangerous occupation?

575
01:23:12,856 --> 01:23:14,398
Beatrix...

576
01:23:16,606 --> 01:23:21,535
I can arrange for the Queen
to take the boys into her service.

577
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:24,578
It's a great honour, Beatrix.

578
01:23:25,754 --> 01:23:29,081
- We couldn't hope for anything better.
- Anything better?

579
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:33,277
- Better than being with their mother?
- It's not what I meant.

580
01:23:33,499 --> 01:23:35,880
What do you mean?
- I'll be gone...

581
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,216
for several years.

582
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:42,278
I have powerful enemies at the court.

583
01:23:42,445 --> 01:23:46,195
The boys bear my name
and bear my titles.

584
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:48,987
This way they'll be untouchable.

585
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:52,145
And you'll be free to see them
whenever you please.

586
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:59,949
- You don't know what you're asking.
- I do.

587
01:24:03,116 --> 01:24:06,743
I wish I could give you another life.

588
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:13,973
I am sorry.

589
01:24:13,994 --> 01:24:16,701
Don't say that, because you're not.

590
01:24:16,702 --> 01:24:20,223
You lead the life you chose
for yourself...

591
01:24:20,286 --> 01:24:22,917
and I chose you.

592
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:51,062
You might have given us a choice.
I'm a map maker!

593
01:24:51,063 --> 01:24:55,981
And now you're Lieutenant-General
of the West Indies, Bartolome!

594
01:24:56,148 --> 01:24:59,398
He's just out of seminary
and can't use a sword.

595
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:01,190
Never touched a sword!

596
01:25:02,107 --> 01:25:03,941
You have time to learn.

597
01:25:04,941 --> 01:25:06,650
What are you complaining about?

598
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:12,817
You can live the way we dream of.

599
01:25:12,818 --> 01:25:14,579
I don't share your dreams.

600
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,059
Do you refuse to help me?

601
01:25:18,903 --> 01:25:20,964
To help your brother?

602
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:24,611
Are you going to desert me?

603
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:33,822
You bastard!
You always had your own way.

604
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:37,156
I have always supported you.
- I know.

605
01:25:37,323 --> 01:25:39,406
I went to Portugal...
- I know!

606
01:25:39,407 --> 01:25:42,490
I'm the eldest!
- How could we forget?

607
01:25:43,407 --> 01:25:44,783
You've said it enough.

608
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,451
Let me show you something.

609
01:25:54,117 --> 01:25:55,159
Excellency...

610
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,618
It's about my son...

611
01:26:22,749 --> 01:26:23,666
See...

612
01:26:24,332 --> 01:26:27,311
Now, you tell me, who can I trust?

613
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:31,886
We're brothers. A bloodline.

614
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,792
I need you. Both of you.

615
01:26:35,209 --> 01:26:36,167
Admiral!

616
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:39,981
The horses are here.
This pair's magnificent!

617
01:26:40,585 --> 01:26:42,878
Send them Back!
- What?

618
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,065
They're like mules!

619
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,378
I hope you did better with men!

620
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:52,130
Who did we take on today?

621
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:57,547
30 blacksmiths. 28 halberdiers.
20 carpenters.

622
01:26:57,756 --> 01:26:59,088
100 farmers.

623
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:00,922
20 miners.

624
01:27:01,381 --> 01:27:05,173
And Doctor Chanca, the royal surgeon.

625
01:27:05,174 --> 01:27:08,153
Then we can count on royal health.

626
01:28:09,478 --> 01:28:10,520
Fire!

627
01:28:11,978 --> 01:28:13,354
Fire again!

628
01:28:20,522 --> 01:28:21,897
Where are they?

629
01:28:31,566 --> 01:28:34,234
Drummers, sound the advance!

630
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:27,571
Almirante!

631
01:29:47,533 --> 01:29:48,950
Juanito.

632
01:30:01,036 --> 01:30:04,079
Is this your New World, Almirante?

633
01:30:04,413 --> 01:30:07,161
We will teach these animals savagery.

634
01:30:07,162 --> 01:30:10,621
Three heads for every life taken.
No mercy before God!

635
01:30:10,622 --> 01:30:11,581
Vamonos!

636
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:13,164
No Moxica!

637
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:15,530
We'll be no revenge.

638
01:30:23,374 --> 01:30:28,083
These were our cousins, our
friends, our countrymen.

639
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:31,188
But you say no revenge?

640
01:30:32,084 --> 01:30:34,814
We will wash this in blood and now!

641
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:41,180
If you want to keep your head
do as I say.

642
01:30:42,128 --> 01:30:43,670
I lost friends, too.

643
01:30:44,171 --> 01:30:46,671
39 brave men who trusted me.

644
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:49,920
You want war?
Fine.

645
01:30:51,296 --> 01:30:54,088
We are 1000.
They outnumber us by 10.

646
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:57,859
Who will you kill?
Which tribe?

647
01:30:58,714 --> 01:31:01,402
We don't need to know.
- Moxica...

648
01:31:01,673 --> 01:31:04,495
Try to remember
who you are talking to.

649
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:12,279
We came here to stay.

650
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,531
Not to start a crusade.

651
01:31:14,947 --> 01:31:17,375
So, we will swallow our anger.

652
01:31:17,907 --> 01:31:20,459
And in the name of those who died,

653
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:24,428
we will accomplish what we came for.

654
01:31:57,851 --> 01:31:58,810
They're here.

655
01:32:50,613 --> 01:32:51,530
There.

656
01:33:56,501 --> 01:33:59,293
Guarionex!
Ricardo!

657
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:01,710
Arquebuses!

658
01:34:03,544 --> 01:34:04,503
Preparen!

659
01:34:23,923 --> 01:34:25,048
Ask him.

660
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,049
What happened to my men?

661
01:34:33,175 --> 01:34:35,466
Warriors come from the sea.

662
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:40,988
Caribes. Guarionex says...
All fled to the hills.

663
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,551
When they came back

664
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:45,020
all the Spaniards...had gone.

665
01:34:45,343 --> 01:34:47,282
God's mercy on them.

666
01:34:53,262 --> 01:34:55,703
The monkey's lying.

667
01:34:57,638 --> 01:34:59,597
You talk too much.

668
01:35:00,513 --> 01:35:03,847
Here they are.
We should kill them.

669
01:35:04,452 --> 01:35:07,780
No...You'll do it my way.

670
01:35:11,452 --> 01:35:14,578
Tell him we will not harm his people.

671
01:35:15,412 --> 01:35:18,319
Even though we have
the power to do it.

672
01:35:20,684 --> 01:35:22,810
I'm prepared to believe him.

673
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:27,166
We will work with them
and we want peace.

674
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:30,836
Ask if he understands.

675
01:35:34,733 --> 01:35:36,381
He understands.

676
01:35:36,942 --> 01:35:38,401
Will he help?

677
01:35:43,569 --> 01:35:46,238
He says you know the answer.

678
01:38:31,139 --> 01:38:34,142
Moxica...
I need your horses.

679
01:38:34,684 --> 01:38:37,867
My horse does no work.

680
01:38:37,893 --> 01:38:42,944
- We all have to work, Moxica.
- Not my horse.

681
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:50,533
Forgive me, Moxica.

682
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:55,910
But it was your horse
that I was talking about.

683
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:12,584
Thank you, Moxica.

684
01:39:30,216 --> 01:39:31,509
Now...

685
01:39:32,801 --> 01:39:33,842
Heave!

686
01:41:29,418 --> 01:41:31,065
My dear sons...

687
01:41:33,044 --> 01:41:38,006
In unbearable heat, we are building
the first city of the New World.

688
01:41:39,465 --> 01:41:43,123
I brought the plans
of a Florentine architect,

689
01:41:43,258 --> 01:41:45,675
Leonardo...da Vinci.

690
01:41:46,925 --> 01:41:50,593
God willing,
we will build his ideal city.

691
01:41:52,802 --> 01:41:55,795
We are adapting to the Indian diet.

692
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:59,348
Meat is only a memory for us.

693
01:42:00,473 --> 01:42:04,891
But in a week, the mill
will be ready to produce of flour.

694
01:42:06,767 --> 01:42:09,560
Soon, we'll be eating bread.

695
01:42:10,895 --> 01:42:13,928
Never again I'll never
underestimate it again.

696
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:16,595
Nor the simple comforts of home.

697
01:42:19,314 --> 01:42:21,398
You are always in my thoughts.

698
01:42:22,523 --> 01:42:24,982
As ever, your Father.

699
01:43:20,404 --> 01:43:22,338
You want her?

700
01:43:25,738 --> 01:43:28,522
Then you can have her.

701
01:43:29,698 --> 01:43:32,490
To the New World, my friend.

702
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:43,277
To the Governor...

703
01:43:44,997 --> 01:43:46,164
of the mosquitoes.

704
01:44:02,608 --> 01:44:04,191
She's a good cook.

705
01:44:11,904 --> 01:44:13,415
What meat is it?

706
01:44:16,323 --> 01:44:17,323
Iguana.

707
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,951
What's wrong?
It's Indian dish.

708
01:44:24,952 --> 01:44:26,349
I'm not an Indian.

709
01:44:26,661 --> 01:44:29,713
You know Christopher,
I think Giacomo is right.

710
01:44:29,911 --> 01:44:32,245
We can't live on corn and pepper.

711
01:44:32,246 --> 01:44:36,122
For the plantation,
we need black slaves.

712
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:39,373
Everything rots
before it can be harvested.

713
01:44:39,956 --> 01:44:43,679
Have you noticed?
The horses and pigs multiply.

714
01:44:44,335 --> 01:44:48,378
They keep mounting each other...
Must be the heat.

715
01:44:49,378 --> 01:44:53,150
I must confess that the heat
has a similar effect on me.

716
01:44:58,529 --> 01:45:00,217
You're both right.

717
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:03,696
But the fort must be finished
before the rains.

718
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:06,625
We must rely on our strengths.

719
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:08,490
What do you mean?

720
01:45:09,282 --> 01:45:12,147
Every able man must work.

721
01:45:13,783 --> 01:45:16,828
All of us.
Including nobility.

722
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:24,466
They're exempt, Christopher.

723
01:45:25,581 --> 01:45:28,707
Well...Now they won't be.

724
01:46:15,164 --> 01:46:16,123
Next.

725
01:46:16,665 --> 01:46:17,748
Name?

726
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,513
Name?
Colpa.

727
01:46:55,349 --> 01:46:57,392
What's he saying?

728
01:46:57,767 --> 01:46:59,434
He's found none.

729
01:47:00,455 --> 01:47:03,034
Why? Ask him why!

730
01:47:04,436 --> 01:47:06,749
Stop him! Bring him back!

731
01:47:13,557 --> 01:47:15,645
Hasn't found any.

732
01:47:29,981 --> 01:47:32,378
He's lying. Tell him...

733
01:47:33,462 --> 01:47:37,417
to put his hand on the table.
Like this.

734
01:47:41,881 --> 01:47:43,027
Tell them...

735
01:47:44,799 --> 01:47:47,759
I know they are hiding
the gold from us.

736
01:47:54,136 --> 01:47:55,387
And tell them...

737
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:59,595
this is how we treat
thieves and liars.

738
01:47:59,596 --> 01:48:02,235
Don Adrian, you cannot do this thing.

739
01:48:02,266 --> 01:48:03,850
I can't?

740
01:48:08,893 --> 01:48:09,852
I can.

741
01:48:21,945 --> 01:48:24,738
Your act of brutality
has created chaos.

742
01:48:27,322 --> 01:48:31,584
All the tribes are now
joining forces against us.

743
01:48:31,782 --> 01:48:36,035
All of that because of your
criminal savagery.

744
01:48:36,452 --> 01:48:40,214
Savagery...
is what monkeys understand.

745
01:48:41,579 --> 01:48:46,204
You should have done the same
a long time ago, Don Cristobal.

746
01:48:46,205 --> 01:48:50,061
Your ways...don't work.

747
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:56,324
You'll be put in detention,
deprived of privileges,

748
01:48:56,377 --> 01:49:00,305
until you are sent to Spain
for judgement.

749
01:49:00,336 --> 01:49:02,118
Have anything to say?

750
01:49:15,302 --> 01:49:17,761
For four years now...

751
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:19,970
we've been here.

752
01:49:20,762 --> 01:49:25,095
We stayed here four years

753
01:49:26,265 --> 01:49:28,953
because we believed your promises.

754
01:49:29,974 --> 01:49:31,975
But we find neither gold

755
01:49:32,767 --> 01:49:36,101
nor your earthly paradise.

756
01:49:52,484 --> 01:49:54,297
You and your brothers...

757
01:49:56,152 --> 01:49:57,859
have failed.

758
01:49:59,946 --> 01:50:04,239
Señor...Colombo!

759
01:50:25,873 --> 01:50:28,989
Don Giacomo, come at once!
- What's happening?

760
01:50:29,082 --> 01:50:32,009
In the mine!
Get Don Christopher!

761
01:51:39,926 --> 01:51:41,093
Cut him down!

762
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:48,033
Cut the ropes!

763
01:51:54,472 --> 01:51:55,985
Moxica's right.

764
01:51:56,225 --> 01:51:59,215
Your ways don't work.

765
01:51:59,372 --> 01:52:01,008
We have to find them.

766
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:03,081
Did you hear me?

767
01:52:03,957 --> 01:52:05,593
You have to find them!

768
01:52:05,999 --> 01:52:07,333
You see what they did?

769
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:10,791
You did the same to your God.

770
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:17,962
You know them?

771
01:52:24,965 --> 01:52:26,965
Goohooni. Goohooni.

772
01:55:14,516 --> 01:55:16,059
Charge!

773
01:55:48,093 --> 01:55:50,304
Stop!

774
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:40,942
Fire!

775
02:02:07,784 --> 02:02:08,868
Moxica.

776
02:02:39,428 --> 02:02:40,637
You know...

777
02:02:41,262 --> 02:02:43,971
what will be said about this
in Spain...

778
02:02:45,346 --> 02:02:46,805
don't you?

779
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:01,270
You are nothing.

780
02:03:03,063 --> 02:03:07,482
Your bastards
will never inherit your titles.

781
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:09,316
No...

782
02:03:10,941 --> 02:03:12,275
We...

783
02:03:13,776 --> 02:03:16,735
We are everything.

784
02:03:20,278 --> 02:03:22,781
We are immortal.

785
02:03:51,375 --> 02:03:54,794
Bastard!

786
02:05:39,397 --> 02:05:41,439
Don Christopher...

787
02:05:45,857 --> 02:05:47,921
I wish to return to Spain.

788
02:05:48,857 --> 02:05:50,941
I have no desire to remain...

789
02:05:51,567 --> 02:05:53,382
in this Godless place.

790
02:05:54,445 --> 02:05:55,778
They are criminals.

791
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:58,963
They have a debt towards Spain.

792
02:05:58,964 --> 02:06:01,863
Moxica paid. They will pay, too.

793
02:06:01,864 --> 02:06:04,448
I don't understand you,
Don Christopher.

794
02:06:05,407 --> 02:06:08,617
You treat Christians equally
with heathen savages.

795
02:06:08,618 --> 02:06:10,994
And what do you offer in return?

796
02:06:14,287 --> 02:06:16,579
A New World, Buyl.

797
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:20,289
No one wants one.

798
02:06:21,371 --> 02:06:22,747
Only you.

799
02:06:23,122 --> 02:06:24,789
Not only me.

800
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:26,708
Look at them.

801
02:06:27,375 --> 02:06:30,428
They could go back to their families.

802
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:32,419
But they stay.

803
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:36,337
They want something new.
A new world.

804
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:40,505
I'll be leave...

805
02:06:41,672 --> 02:06:43,508
on the next ship.

806
02:06:44,216 --> 02:06:46,342
Leave if you please but...

807
02:06:48,134 --> 02:06:53,469
your departure won't help me
make this place more Godly.

808
02:07:10,893 --> 02:07:14,644
Perhaps hope only exists
in the journey, Giacomo.

809
02:07:16,689 --> 02:07:18,898
At beginning everything's possible.

810
02:07:19,148 --> 02:07:21,774
Every expectation, every dream.

811
02:07:22,607 --> 02:07:26,482
No one expected this to be easy.

812
02:07:26,484 --> 02:07:29,025
This isn't how I imagined
it to be, Christopher.

813
02:07:30,484 --> 02:07:33,445
Marchena was right, Bartolome.

814
02:07:39,656 --> 02:07:43,698
Paradise and Hell both can be earthly.

815
02:07:43,699 --> 02:07:46,731
We carry them wherever we go.

816
02:09:37,748 --> 02:09:38,789
Utopan!

817
02:09:41,457 --> 02:09:42,457
Speak to me!

818
02:09:43,332 --> 02:09:46,367
You never learned
to speak my language.

819
02:12:19,475 --> 02:12:23,871
Your Majesty, here are the true facts
concerning the island of Hispaniola.

820
02:12:24,726 --> 02:12:27,489
The activity of your servant Columbus,

821
02:12:27,490 --> 02:12:29,915
Admiral of the Oceans
and Governor of the

822
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:34,940
the truth he now presides
over a state of chaos,

823
02:12:35,106 --> 02:12:38,608
of degradation and of madness.

824
02:12:39,754 --> 02:12:44,818
From beginning He had shown he was
incapable of managing the islands

825
02:12:45,172 --> 02:12:49,551
he appointed his brothers
very important positions,

826
02:12:49,592 --> 02:12:53,780
injuring the pride and dignity
of nobles.

827
02:12:53,781 --> 02:12:55,969
He promised to build a city.

828
02:12:55,989 --> 02:12:59,073
Isabel, after Your Majesty.

829
02:12:59,074 --> 02:13:01,782
A group of mud huts
in the wrong place,

830
02:13:01,783 --> 02:13:05,128
swept away by the rains and mud.

831
02:13:05,805 --> 02:13:07,454
He promised gold,

832
02:13:07,537 --> 02:13:10,203
not finding the amounts he promised.

833
02:13:10,204 --> 02:13:15,331
He has since commanded
the Indians to pay a tax...

834
02:13:16,331 --> 02:13:19,082
a monthly tribute of gold.

835
02:13:19,145 --> 02:13:24,044
Most being unable to, we find,
have been punished

836
02:13:25,045 --> 02:13:26,504
or massacred.

837
02:13:29,587 --> 02:13:33,307
Columbus forced nobility
to hard labour,

838
02:13:33,588 --> 02:13:36,755
treating them equally with Indians.

839
02:13:36,756 --> 02:13:39,591
He reduced them into his slaves.

840
02:13:39,592 --> 02:13:43,052
When Adrian de Moxica
protested against this,

841
02:13:44,136 --> 02:13:45,344
he was executed.

842
02:13:45,969 --> 02:13:47,844
Is this true, Brother Buyl?

843
02:13:47,845 --> 02:13:49,429
Yes, Your Excellency.

844
02:13:49,554 --> 02:13:54,629
These all true. All of it.
I saw it. With my own eyes.

845
02:13:55,809 --> 02:13:57,312
Well...

846
02:13:57,604 --> 02:13:59,375
He promised a Paradise.

847
02:14:05,022 --> 02:14:06,481
He failed.

848
02:14:08,106 --> 02:14:09,940
He must be replaced.

849
02:14:11,482 --> 02:14:12,941
Immediately.

850
02:14:15,527 --> 02:14:19,612
And who would you think of
for such a task?

851
02:14:21,946 --> 02:14:23,968
I am thinking of a man.

852
02:14:25,322 --> 02:14:28,563
A man devoted to Your Majesties.

853
02:14:28,969 --> 02:14:33,120
A man extremely motivated.

854
02:15:13,426 --> 02:15:14,926
Excellency, I'm sorry.

855
02:15:17,886 --> 02:15:20,889
Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

856
02:15:22,723 --> 02:15:26,182
Yes...I remember.

857
02:15:27,224 --> 02:15:29,475
My letters of appointment.

858
02:15:38,146 --> 02:15:41,105
I am the new Viceroy of the Indies.

859
02:15:41,563 --> 02:15:43,064
Congratulations.

860
02:15:44,689 --> 02:15:47,492
Then I can search for the mainland?

861
02:15:48,315 --> 02:15:51,149
The mainland was discovered weeks ago.

862
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:52,723
By another Italian.

863
02:15:57,154 --> 02:15:59,602
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

864
02:16:11,911 --> 02:16:13,244
How far?

865
02:16:13,619 --> 02:16:19,100
I'm no seaman, but I heard
it's no more than a week at sea.

866
02:16:20,954 --> 02:16:23,622
I hope not too disappointed.

867
02:16:26,875 --> 02:16:28,396
How could I be?

868
02:16:30,543 --> 02:16:35,753
The mainland has been found
exactly as I said it would.

869
02:16:41,046 --> 02:16:44,696
I'm afraid this isn't the worst news.

870
02:17:28,304 --> 02:17:29,304
Diego?

871
02:17:30,263 --> 02:17:31,680
Father.

872
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:36,851
Fernando.

873
02:17:37,538 --> 02:17:38,497
Oh, my God!

874
02:17:41,310 --> 02:17:42,561
A man?

875
02:17:43,478 --> 02:17:44,624
How did this happen?

876
02:17:47,979 --> 02:17:48,980
Diego.

877
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:00,133
Don't worry.

878
02:18:00,134 --> 02:18:02,302
We're going to get you out.

879
02:18:02,303 --> 02:18:04,652
Santangel's going to the Queen.
- Good.

880
02:18:04,653 --> 02:18:06,695
Good.

881
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:10,388
I'll go back when they free me.

882
02:18:10,389 --> 02:18:12,274
This time with me.

883
02:18:13,527 --> 02:18:16,241
In your present state
it is madness, Father.

884
02:18:16,242 --> 02:18:19,462
You needn't come with us.

885
02:18:23,903 --> 02:18:25,097
Diego.

886
02:18:26,841 --> 02:18:28,700
Diego.

887
02:19:30,389 --> 02:19:32,295
Rise, please.

888
02:19:41,528 --> 02:19:42,745
Now...

889
02:19:43,841 --> 02:19:46,133
I do look older than you.

890
02:19:53,429 --> 02:19:59,401
I have looked for a reason why
I should allow you to go back.

891
02:19:59,473 --> 02:20:03,057
And though I tried
I could not find one.

892
02:20:04,839 --> 02:20:06,960
Help me find one.

893
02:20:11,843 --> 02:20:17,770
All my life I have dreamed
of reaching the continent.

894
02:20:17,822 --> 02:20:22,405
I thought my dreams...
grandiose.

895
02:20:24,679 --> 02:20:29,465
But reality was beyond
my expectations.

896
02:20:29,523 --> 02:20:31,190
Far beyond.

897
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:36,087
And now...

898
02:20:39,508 --> 02:20:42,657
I want to explore that land.

899
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,852
Before I die.

900
02:21:08,094 --> 02:21:09,247
I allow you...

901
02:21:11,885 --> 02:21:14,194
to undertake another voyage.

902
02:21:15,114 --> 02:21:16,200
Thank you.

903
02:21:17,946 --> 02:21:20,006
But without your brothers.

904
02:21:21,287 --> 02:21:23,254
You can't go to Santo Domingo

905
02:21:23,306 --> 02:21:24,979
or the other colonies.

906
02:21:27,163 --> 02:21:28,818
The New World...

907
02:21:29,814 --> 02:21:32,106
is a disaster.

908
02:21:37,443 --> 02:21:40,504
And the old one...
an achievement?

909
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,179
I know...

910
02:22:20,561 --> 02:22:23,416
I shouldn't tolerate his impertinence.

911
02:22:26,027 --> 02:22:27,486
Then why?

912
02:22:30,881 --> 02:22:32,965
Because he's not afraid of me.

913
02:22:37,354 --> 02:22:38,687
Sanchez!

914
02:22:49,107 --> 02:22:51,609
You're a dreamer.

915
02:22:58,139 --> 02:23:00,223
Look out there.

916
02:23:04,225 --> 02:23:05,790
What do you see?

917
02:23:12,596 --> 02:23:17,750
I see towers.
I see palaces, I see steeples.

918
02:23:18,993 --> 02:23:21,077
I see civilisation.

919
02:23:22,716 --> 02:23:25,646
And I see spires that reach...

920
02:23:26,091 --> 02:23:27,656
to the sky!

921
02:23:33,208 --> 02:23:36,427
All created by people like me.

922
02:23:37,343 --> 02:23:39,844
No matter how long you live,

923
02:23:41,228 --> 02:23:44,085
one thing will never change
between us.

924
02:23:46,538 --> 02:23:47,782
I did it.

925
02:23:49,721 --> 02:23:51,287
You didn't.

926
02:25:06,875 --> 02:25:08,787
You're so beautiful.

927
02:25:17,652 --> 02:25:22,510
I can't believe another man
has never taken you from me.

928
02:25:22,851 --> 02:25:26,394
They tried...
but I didn't let them.

929
02:25:32,827 --> 02:25:34,596
They took everything.

930
02:25:35,834 --> 02:25:37,715
Not everything.

931
02:25:39,649 --> 02:25:41,639
You think I care?

932
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:45,280
I'm a free man again.

933
02:25:46,933 --> 02:25:51,206
Riches don't make a man rich,
they only make him busier.

934
02:25:55,811 --> 02:25:58,538
God!
How much I've missed you.

935
02:26:01,815 --> 02:26:06,479
By the Grace of God
and Your Beneficient Majesty,

936
02:26:06,521 --> 02:26:10,628
a new continent has now
been found and claimed

937
02:26:10,654 --> 02:26:16,607
in the name of the Spanish
Crown, in the year 1492.

938
02:26:17,865 --> 02:26:20,304
As Your Majesty is aware,

939
02:26:21,417 --> 02:26:23,567
the University of Salamanca

940
02:26:23,593 --> 02:26:27,298
has always defended the theory

941
02:26:27,405 --> 02:26:32,114
of the existence
of unknown territories to the west.

942
02:26:34,492 --> 02:26:38,878
The surest route to the continent
is now firmly established.

943
02:26:39,462 --> 02:26:44,871
West by south-west for 750 leagues
to Santo Domingo.

944
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:46,465
From there...

945
02:26:46,855 --> 02:26:51,509
west-north-west from San Juan
to the north,

946
02:26:51,535 --> 02:26:57,130
reaching the island of Hispaniola
on the Cape of San Raphael.

947
02:26:57,531 --> 02:27:03,434
Then onto the mainland
at Cape Gracias A Dios.

948
02:27:03,946 --> 02:27:07,698
Spain, by Your Majesty's grace,

949
02:27:08,053 --> 02:27:11,645
has confirmed for all humanity,

950
02:27:11,713 --> 02:27:15,038
the existence of a New World.

951
02:27:15,603 --> 02:27:19,885
Terra Incognita.

952
02:27:20,850 --> 02:27:24,334
It was discovered by a mariner

953
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:26,938
commissioned by Your Majesty.

954
02:27:26,939 --> 02:27:28,593
His name...

955
02:27:30,662 --> 02:27:34,560
Amerigo Vespucci.

956
02:28:13,116 --> 02:28:14,332
Sanchez...

957
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,308
What a tragedy.
What a waste of a life.

958
02:28:29,149 --> 02:28:31,296
A waste?

959
02:28:31,349 --> 02:28:34,901
If your name or mine
is ever remembered...

960
02:28:36,044 --> 02:28:39,441
it will only be because of his.

961
02:28:58,196 --> 02:29:00,611
Diego is at court
with Santangel hoping

962
02:29:00,612 --> 02:29:04,463
to get your privileges restored.

963
02:29:04,464 --> 02:29:06,037
But how is he?

964
02:29:07,426 --> 02:29:11,959
He wants to start a pearl trade
in Santo Domingo.

965
02:29:12,012 --> 02:29:15,856
He has received many letters
from your men.

966
02:29:15,857 --> 02:29:17,702
He sent some of them.

967
02:29:20,167 --> 02:29:24,001
This one's from Mendez.
- Mendez?

968
02:29:24,018 --> 02:29:25,235
What does he say?

969
02:29:27,782 --> 02:29:31,741
He asks to visit you.
He left his address.

970
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:37,849
He never had one.
Except aboard my ships.

971
02:29:42,057 --> 02:29:44,999
I want you to tell me
everything you remember, Father.

972
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,238
I wouldn't know where to start.

973
02:29:49,473 --> 02:29:53,172
Tell me the first thing
that comes to mind.

974
02:30:18,636 --> 02:30:20,820
I remember...

975
02:30:42,327 --> 02:30:45,263
In 1502, Columbus made a final trip
to the New World with Fernando.

976
02:30:45,264 --> 02:30:48,234
They reached Panama where the Indians
told them of the Pacific Ocean.

977
02:30:48,235 --> 02:30:51,143
His son's biography gave Columbus
his rightful place in history.

978
02:30:51,144 --> 02:30:54,104
In 1992, one of his descendants is
Honorary Admiral of the Spanish Navy.

979
02:30:54,105 --> 02:30:57,054
There is more imagination in life
than in dreams...
