1
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:50,655
We have power. We have presence.
We have knowledge.

2
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,989
Pro-life is on the move.
This is a war to the end.

3
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,864
They're sick.
They're perverted.

4
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,536
You must repent.

5
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,512
Not the church! Not the state!
Women must decide our fate!

6
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,855
We want equality now.

7
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:27,828
Last night the abortion controversy
was back in the House.

8
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:31,355
I do not sit down and negotiate
with baby killers.

9
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:35,632
We will no longer tolerate
laws that degrade...

10
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:38,196
mutilate and murder women!

11
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:40,242
What about the child's right?

12
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:44,439
When you talk about the woman's right,
that's one third of the rights involved.

13
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:47,540
Listen, honey,
it men could get pregnant...

14
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,710
abortion would be a sacrament.

15
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:53,483
The Court's 7 to 2 decision that in
the first three months of pregnancy...

16
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:57,287
only the woman and her physician may
decide whether she may have an abortion.

17
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:09,828
- Morning, Miss Donnelly.
- Hi, Jim.

18
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,595
- It's looking very nice.
- Oh, yeah.

19
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,102
You're gonna have the prettiest
home on the block.

20
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:05,113
Dr. Hanks is sorry
it's taking so long.

21
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,910
How much longer will it be?

22
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,974
I think it should only be
another ten minutes...

23
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,350
and then he'II come out
and talk to you about your mother.

24
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:14,116
Dr. Kramer?

25
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,886
Dr. Kramer, excuse me.
I need to talk to you about...

26
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,359
I have to meet my wife
and I'm running late.

27
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,794
It'll just take
a minute ot your time, sir.

28
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,197
I've been in a bit ot shock
since we spoke yesterday.

29
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,104
But I've thought about it
and I know what I need to do.

30
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:34,040
I just need your help
and some information.

31
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,876
You're putting me in
an awkward position, Claire.

32
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,006
I've known the Donnellys
tor a long time.

33
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:42,676
I'm thinking of them too,
Dr. Kramer.

34
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:45,949
They're practically
all the tamily I have.

35
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:49,355
That's why I was thinking that maybe
you could prescribe something tor me.

36
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,953
I know there are things
that I could take.

37
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,963
I'm just atraid
I don't know the dosages.

38
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,965
I can't prescribe
anything for you.

39
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:00,031
It's illegal
to terminate a pregnancy.

40
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:08,035
I can get you a number for
the Florence-Critten Home in Moreville.

41
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,511
They'll take care ot the adoption
for you, give you a place to stay.

42
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,573
That's impossible.
I can't go away tor seven months.

43
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,586
- What would I tell everyone?
- I don't know, Claire.

44
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,452
That's the sort of thing
one should think about...

45
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:23,822
before one puts herself
in this situation.

46
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:16,128
- Becky, you don't have to do my dishes.
- Oh, I woke you up.

47
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:20,037
No, I'm just kind of sick.

48
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:24,045
I know. I was on the hot line with Mom.
She told me everything.

49
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,980
- Hi, my sweet girl.
- You know what?

50
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,677
No otfense,
but I'm sure it's contagious...

51
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:33,313
and the last thing
that I need is a sick baby.

52
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,016
Come here, sweetie.

53
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:40,325
- It's some kind of stomach thing.
- Here's your toys.

54
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:48,597
I didn't want to bother you, but Mom
wanted me to bring some chicken soup...

55
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,299
and I brought you some magazines.

56
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:55,309
She also sent over
a hot-water bottle.

57
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,013
Here, honey.

58
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,313
- Thanks.
- Geez, Claire.

59
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:05,979
You really do look like hell.

60
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,224
Your mom is too much.

61
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,091
I mean, she just does
too much for me.

62
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:16,825
Painting the house and...

63
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,390
I know it's
a huge expense for them.

64
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:23,370
Well, you know how she is.

65
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:30,341
Let her help you though, honey.
It's good tor her.

66
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,579
You know what it is?

67
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:35,617
I think that by doing tor you,
she teels that she hasn't...

68
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:38,175
completely lost Steven.

69
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:42,957
Boy, she was so happy
when you two got married.

70
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:46,392
You were so good to my brother.
He loved you so much.

71
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:50,330
I'm sorry, Claire.
I'm so stupid sometimes.

72
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,957
It's okay.

73
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:58,533
I wish I could help you, honey.

74
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:06,146
There's just so much happening.

75
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,751
- I'II see you.
- Tell Mom thanks for the soup.

76
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,753
I will. Bye.

77
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:17,121
Look who's here. Hey, Louise.
Avon lady, where's my lipstick?

78
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:20,958
- Next Tuesday.
- I need it for Thanksgiving.

79
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:24,097
She is so impatient.

80
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,761
Here is my last sample, and this is
gonna have to hold you till Tuesday.

81
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

82
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,329
My goodness. 12:35.
I gotta pick up Michael.

83
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:35,536
- I'll see you, okay?
- Bye, sweetie.

84
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,909
- The house looks great, Claire.
- Thanks, Louise.

85
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,450
Hey, Louise?

86
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,918
I've gotta ask you a question.

87
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,752
Can you come up here though?
'Cause I'm not dressed.

88
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,416
Oh, sure.

89
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:55,161
What?

90
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,664
- See you in an hour.
- Okay, Jim.

91
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,868
I would never ask you this...

92
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,342
but I know that you have an opportunity
to get around and see a lot ot people.

93
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,645
There's this woman,
and her son is in the hospital.

94
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,308
She has three
little ones at home...

95
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,375
and she just told me that
she found out that she's pregnant.

96
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:20,286
- Oh, dear.
- She's just overwhelmed.

97
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,381
Overwhelmed is right.

98
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,121
She asked me it I knew someone
who could do something.

99
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:28,026
Hi, Louise.

100
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,895
- Are you stopping by later?
- Yes.

101
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,457
I'll be over this afternoon.
I'II see you then.

102
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:40,132
Well, I honestly
don't know anyone myselt...

103
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,667
that's ever done that, or at least
that's told me that they have, but...

104
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,812
I guess I could ask.

105
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,749
Great.

106
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:55,423
I have heard rumors about
that green house on Worth Street.

107
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:58,654
You know, the old, big one
near Worth and Pine?

108
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,695
I thought it was just
abandoned houses down there.

109
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:04,062
Well, yeah.
She'd have to be pretty desperate.

110
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,465
But you should ask
at the hospital.

111
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:09,971
Someone there's bound to know
of a better place, right?

112
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,973
I hope so.

113
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:22,274
- Excuse me, Mrs. Ford?
- Mrs. Donnelly.

114
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,514
I haven't started my shift,
and already the work pours in.

115
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:28,181
I'm sorry. I can wait.

116
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,282
Let's see what you have there.

117
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:33,920
I have a question about
Maureen Cain's admitting intormation.

118
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:36,931
I need to get a prescription
and I need this to be clear.

119
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,523
I see.

120
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,866
I can send up the into, but you can
still put the prescription through.

121
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,236
Very good. Thank you.

122
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,935
I also have
another question for you.

123
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,410
I have a friend
and she's pregnant...

124
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,040
and she asked me,
since I work here...

125
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,452
Well, you see, she can't do it.

126
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:02,115
She can't have the baby.

127
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:04,125
What is it that you want trom me?

128
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:09,196
Well, I was hoping that
we could help her here.

129
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:11,596
I heard there's someone in E. R...

130
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,667
Mrs. Ford, I'm sorry.
I didn't know who else to ask.

131
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:22,472
- I know you've worked there the longest.
- Yes.

132
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,705
And I would like
to keep working here.

133
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,510
Or hadn't you heard they dismissed
two nurses a tew weeks ago?

134
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,845
Excuse me.

135
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:32,011
That's all right. Go ahead.

136
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,021
We're finished here.

137
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,984
Time to hit the trenches.

138
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:44,658
What can I tell her?
I mean, what should I tell her to do?

139
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:47,826
I don't know...

140
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,428
but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't ask me anymore.

141
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:07,054
I think it might be the next one.

142
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:10,823
I haven't been around
this neighborhood in years.

143
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,831
Here's Worth Street.
We take a right here.

144
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:26,304
Okay, it's right down here.
It's the big house.

145
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,541
This house?

146
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,214
Lady, I don't know
what you're doin' here...

147
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,917
but it you want, I could wait.

148
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:44,424
That's okay.

149
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:47,985
I think I made a mistake.
It's not the house.

150
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:45,983
Leave it, Mom.
It's not gonna wake her.

151
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:48,249
Oh, it's loud.

152
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,690
The neighbors will think that
we're having some kind ot a party.

153
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,228
Let me take this.
It's a holiday, Mom.

154
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:57,424
It's Thanksgiving.
I think we can listen to some music.

155
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,626
Sit down.

156
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,534
For a renovation tor an apartment.

157
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:04,799
Would you like a piece?
It's your favorite.

158
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:07,273
It they are renting,
they can't do anything.

159
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,436
In this neighborhood
it's illegal.

160
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,639
I heard that Uncle Al...

161
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:15,911
has found a tenant
tor the apartment.

162
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:18,350
That Marty ain't
too happy about it.

163
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,615
Well, I don't blame her.

164
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,522
I mean, she's a divorcee.

165
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,685
Oh, my goodness.

166
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,525
You don't know what kind of people
she'd be bringing home.

167
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:31,498
If she pays the rent,
it doesn't matter what she brings.

168
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,830
She pays the rent.

169
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,427
- This pie is so good.
- It is.

170
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,804
- Scrumptious.
- Forty-five, tifty dollars?

171
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,140
This reminds me of Aunt Maureen's pie.
Aunt Maureen?

172
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,146
- Aunt Maureen's were delicious.
- Daddy?

173
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:50,050
Just delicious.

174
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,552
- Yeah, but not like this.
- Thank you.

175
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,384
I'm gonna have to excuse myself.

176
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,825
I have to work tonight,
so I have to go.

177
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:00,987
Don't go.

178
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,798
It's late.
Bill, let's go.

179
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,494
No. The kids are exhausted.

180
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,730
- We'll take you home.
- I'll just walk.

181
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:13,070
No, you won't.
Kevin will take you home.

182
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,871
- You'II drive her home.
- Give your sister-in-law a ride.

183
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:19,675
Really, it's okay.
I could use the walk.

184
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,080
Kevin will be absolutely delighted
to take you home.

185
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,555
It's nice to have you here.

186
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:33,353
- It was nice being here.
- Let me get your coat.

187
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,692
- I'll see everyone later.
- You take care.

188
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,758
You have to work on Thanksgiving?

189
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:42,895
Yes. They had no one else
to work the shift, so I said I would.

190
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:51,011
Claire, I don't want
to seem like a...

191
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:56,178
busybody mother-in-law,
but I'm worried about you.

192
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:58,151
I'm really fine.

193
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,917
I think that you work too hard, and
I don't want you to worry about money.

194
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,687
We want to be able
to take care ot...

195
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:10,722
- To take care of you.
- You're doing so much tor me already.

196
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,996
I'm not gonna hear
anything about that.

197
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:18,871
We're still tamily, Claire...

198
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,171
and we're gonna
get through this together.

199
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,439
Thank you.

200
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,236
- Thank you.
- Wait.

201
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,953
I wanted to call you,
but I just couldn't.

202
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,827
I'm sorry, Claire.

203
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,087
I'm so sorry.

204
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,025
What are you doing?
What are you doing to yourself?

205
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,972
I just wanted to help you.

206
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,841
I never meant tor anything like that
to happen. You have to believe me.

207
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,546
- He wouldn't want you doin' this.
- Damn it!

208
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:36,846
Don't you tell me what he wants.

209
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:39,250
He doesn't want anything.
He's dead!

210
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:41,983
Goddamn you, he's dead!

211
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,025
You seem to have forgotten that.

212
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,018
I wanted so badly
to call you and...

213
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:51,831
tell you how sorry I felt
tor what happened that night...

214
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,834
but I just couldn't.

215
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:59,139
I felt so... ashamed.

216
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,375
It's not your fault.

217
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:13,815
I know you'd never
do anything to hurt me.

218
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:18,721
I know you wouldn't.

219
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,728
Stop crying.

220
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,241
You just have to torget
it ever happened.

221
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:39,041
Do you hear me?

222
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,749
It never happened.

223
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:07,403
Yes, I found the mix-up.
It's Carmen M-O-R-O.

224
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,310
No "T."
Birth date: 10-8-35.

225
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,882
Give her my name
or she won't tell you anything.

226
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:21,217
I trust her.

227
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,950
She'II find you someone safe.

228
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,391
Thank you.

229
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,563
Good luck.

230
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,785
Hello?

231
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,515
I'm looking for Audrey.

232
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:56,853
This is she.
Who is this?

233
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:00,486
Well, you don't know me.
I got your number from a friend.

234
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,658
Who gave you the number?

235
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:09,169
Actually, Jenny Ford.

236
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:12,263
I work with her and...

237
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,841
well, she said that you might have
the name of someone who could...

238
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:21,881
Someone who could
give me an abortion.

239
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,985
The name I have...

240
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,022
is ot a woman in Puerto Rico.

241
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:30,887
She isn't cheap,
but the place is clean.

242
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,893
How much would that cost?

243
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:36,158
With airtare and hotel,
it'll cost you around a thousand.

244
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:40,459
Oh, God.
I don't have that kind of money.

245
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:45,029
- This is the only woman I would trust.
- But I really need to get this done.

246
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:48,337
- I understand.
- But I can't borrow from anyone.

247
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,843
Okay.

248
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,540
Let me make some
phone calls, okay?

249
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:58,780
Maybe I can find someone closer.

250
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:01,822
It's just that I can't
make you any promises, okay?

251
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,592
Just in case,
let me take your number.

252
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:12,094
KL-53690.

253
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,331
Thank you.

254
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:03,272
Hello. I was going to the store.

255
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,403
Do you need anything?

256
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,426
What's wrong? What happened?

257
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:31,267
- It's bad enough.
- What happened?

258
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:32,863
What happened?

259
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:37,477
Oh, God.

260
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:39,638
What happened? What's wrong?

261
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:43,548
Tell me. What's wrong?

262
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,245
- I couldn't do it.
- What?

263
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,811
Oh, Becky, I'm pregnant.

264
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:53,324
Oh, my God.
Who did this to you?

265
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:58,826
I can't tell you. I can't.
It doesn't matter.

266
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,391
- What do you mean?
- It was just a mistake.

267
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,801
I was just lonely and I was...

268
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:09,867
I was hurting,
and I didn't mean tor it to happen.

269
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,546
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God, am I sorry.

270
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,686
You were lonely?

271
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,690
My brother's been dead
for six months.

272
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,903
Oh, my God.
Everybody in this town knows us.

273
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,569
- I tried to take care of it.
- You can't stay here.

274
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,978
You have to have this baby
somewhere else.

275
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:52,308
Becky, I can't have this baby.

276
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:53,877
I just can't do it.

277
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:56,389
I'm gonna have
to have an abortion.

278
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:59,085
How could you do this?

279
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,253
How could you?
Baby, let's go.

280
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,560
Come on. We're going.

281
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:06,429
We have to go.

282
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,493
Becky, please don't.

283
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:11,766
It my mother ever
finds out about this...

284
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,273
it'll kill her,
so I don't give a damn what you do.

285
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:18,344
How dare you shame us like this.

286
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:20,347
How dare you.

287
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:41,124
Hello. It's Audrey Miller.
I found someone for you.

288
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,635
Yes.

289
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:49,369
I've got someone named Tom,
and he comes to your house.

290
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:52,811
I got his name from someone
whose sister-in-law used him.

291
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,144
I didn't speak
to the woman directly...

292
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,185
but I do think it's good
that he comes to you.

293
00:27:58,252 --> 00:28:01,415
I mean, it seems
a little safer that way.

294
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:04,219
What's his number?

295
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:07,284
You can't call him.
He'll call you.

296
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:10,923
I'll need your name
and your work number.

297
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,933
Why my work number?

298
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:16,593
Look, he'll be discreet.

299
00:28:16,671 --> 00:28:19,970
I've gotta have your work number because
he needs to be able to reach you.

300
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,874
It seems he's pretty busy.

301
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,208
How much does he want?

302
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,839
He said 400.

303
00:28:32,854 --> 00:28:35,345
This is all tinished.
Here's the chart.

304
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,391
Oh. All right.

305
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,024
Three West.
This is Annie Ross.

306
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,798
No, I don't see it anywhere.

307
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:52,465
I'll call you
if it shows up. Okay.

308
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:58,769
Hold on, please.

309
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:02,873
Claire, telephone for you.

310
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,475
It's Tom.

311
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:09,045
Rose, can you take
Mrs. Sherman back to her room?

312
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,785
And I'll come right down
to check on you.

313
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:20,099
- Hello?
- Claire Donnelly?

314
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:22,102
Speaking. Tom?

315
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,230
Yes. Hold on. Okay.

316
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,240
I guess you know.

317
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,937
Four hundred cash.
You need to pay it in full.

318
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:34,709
- Can you get it by tomorrow?
- Yes, that's fine.

319
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,716
What's your address?

320
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:40,313
2266 Evergreen.

321
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:43,482
I'm in the middle ot the hub.

322
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:46,925
All right. I'll be there
at 8:00 tomorrow night.

323
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:50,395
I'll do it in your kitchen, so I'll need
something to cover your table with...

324
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:53,025
a bucket,
maybe a few towels, okay?

325
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:56,264
- Anything else?
- Nope. That's it.

326
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:59,431
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Thank you.

327
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,558
I'm running late.

328
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:56,222
- Do you have the cash?
- Yes.

329
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:58,322
- In tull?
- Of course.

330
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,492
Okay, let's have it.

331
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:04,471
You'II get the money
when it's done.

332
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:10,399
- Where are you going?
- I don't have time for games, lady.

333
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:13,379
Please come back.
I'II give you the money.

334
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,381
I'll give it to you.

335
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,371
- Anybody else here?
- No.

336
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,101
- Where's your kitchen?
- Back there.

337
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,346
- Do you have everything you need?
- That's fine.

338
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,410
Take off your underwear.

339
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,394
Would you like to use the sink?

340
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:15,074
Come on up here
and lie down on the table.

341
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,427
Move down to
the edge of the table.

342
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,770
Are you gonna disintect those?

343
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,746
They're fine.

344
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,785
Well, I would really
rather not get an infection.

345
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:04,189
Look. Do you want to
do this or not?

346
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:09,628
- Yes.
- Okay.

347
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,599
So let's do it.

348
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,828
Lie down. Lie down.

349
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,050
Leg up.

350
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,303
Don't move.

351
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:27,668
Don't move.

352
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:31,371
The more you move,
the more it's going to hurt.

353
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,310
So don't move.

354
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,822
All right, that's it.

355
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:09,908
- Is it over?
- Yes.

356
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:12,544
You'll have some cramping...

357
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:16,222
and you'll have some bleeding.

358
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:20,187
It you start to hemorrhage...

359
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:22,286
call the hospital.

360
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,602
Am I okay?

361
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,497
Am I okay?

362
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:59,758
- Hospital.
- I need your help.

363
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,426
Hello?

364
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:05,703
- Right away.
- Yes, I understand.

365
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:08,264
- I need your help.
- Ma 'am.

366
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:10,606
Ma 'am, I need to get your address.

367
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:15,445
Ma'am, we can't send an ambulance
without your address.

368
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:18,409
Hello?

369
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,373
Hi.

370
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:58,247
I may be callin' too early.
My name is Barbara Barrows.

371
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,083
I'm callin' about the results
of my pregnancy test.

372
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:05,120
No way! It's my turn!

373
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:08,056
Hey, come on!

374
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,995
I was just in there!
I gotta pee!

375
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:12,999
You'll have to wait.

376
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,943
Mrs. Barrows,
the test came back positive.

377
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:32,181
And that's it? I mean,
there's no chance of a talse positive?

378
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:34,847
No. The tests
are pretty accurate.

379
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:39,960
Well, thank you.

380
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,393
Would you like
to make an appointment?

381
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:45,591
No. I'II call back later.

382
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,692
- Thank you.
- Mom, could you help me?

383
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:51,169
I tinished it.

384
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:53,570
It's heavy.
I almost broke my arm.

385
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,508
- How are you gonna get that to school?
- Jason's gonna help me.

386
00:39:00,748 --> 00:39:01,942
What is that?

387
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:04,541
Seaweed. It's good for
calcium and iodine.

388
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:09,452
It's better than
Red Dye No. 4.

389
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:13,584
- Are you wearing a bra?
- Nope.

390
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:16,061
Put one on.
I don't want you goin' out...

391
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,392
- Sally!
- Sorry.

392
00:39:17,464 --> 00:39:20,160
Go, please.
Wake up your brother.

393
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,828
Excuse me, but why
can't Ryan wake up Scott?

394
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:26,532
Sexual discrimination starts young.
Better get used to it.

395
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:28,598
Oh, spare me.

396
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:31,042
Chester, here.
Breakfast.

397
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:34,877
- She woke me up late.
- Better hurry if you want breakfast.

398
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:37,815
Look at him. Ape Man!

399
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,313
Linda, do the world a favor.
Wear a bra.

400
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:44,414
- Like you'd even know the difterence.
- Good one.

401
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,085
- Shut up, stupid.
- Stop!

402
00:39:49,396 --> 00:39:52,331
It you're gonna clobber each other,
get out ot my kitchen!

403
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,390
- He messed up my hair.
- Mom?

404
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:57,494
- Band's gonna rehearse here today.
- Not before 4:00.

405
00:39:57,571 --> 00:40:00,096
- Why?
- Your father will be sleeping.

406
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:04,338
I'm serious, Scott. I won't be here.
Takin' your brother to Little League.

407
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:06,038
Man.

408
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,843
You guys better straighten up.
Your dad's home.

409
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:12,447
- Hi.
- Hello.

410
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,952
Good-bye.

411
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,785
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, everybody.

412
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:24,623
- What's the matter? You okay?
- No, actually, I'm not.

413
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:27,394
We gotta talk. Later.

414
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,862
Dad, you gotta tighten
the chain on my bike. It's loose.

415
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:34,737
What do we got goin'
over here? Meat loaf?

416
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,174
Meat loaf, baked potato,
salad on the counter.

417
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:40,702
Honey, don't forget to send
your tinancial aid forms today.

418
00:40:40,781 --> 00:40:42,476
Right. Hey, listen.

419
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:46,542
Alison and I are plannin' a road trip
to Boston to visit the campus, okay?

420
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,611
I don't know about that.

421
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:51,988
It's dangerous for girls to be alone.
All kinds of kooks out there.

422
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:54,755
It's okay. We're staying
at Alison's aunt's house.

423
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:58,058
John, come on!

424
00:40:58,132 --> 00:41:00,430
John? John?

425
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,969
It's Officer John Barrows
to you, miss.

426
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:06,005
Or is it Ms.?
That enough buzz for you?

427
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:11,339
Mom, will you tell him
that this is not a big deal?

428
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:14,142
- I don't want her going.
- I got the maps laid out...

429
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:16,182
Can't we talk about this tonight?

430
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,014
Because I don't have a car today
and Julia's pickin' me up.

431
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:21,850
- I just gotta get outta here.
- Bye, Mom.

432
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:24,823
And don't torget to put
your dishes in the sink.

433
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:34,393
Don't break a leg.
We're not late or anything.

434
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:36,493
I didn't have any cotfee
this morning.

435
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,767
Do you mind it we pass by the deli
so I can get myself a cup?

436
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,774
Hey, what's wrong?

437
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,366
I'm pregnant.

438
00:41:48,816 --> 00:41:51,410
- Drive.
- Sure, honey.

439
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:05,498
Don't stop, Julia.
I don't wanna be late for class.

440
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:09,502
We're gonna talk.

441
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,538
- Here.
- Thank you.

442
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:19,901
Does John know?

443
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,682
I just tound out.

444
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:28,821
I just now found out.

445
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:30,914
It's a shock, isn't it?

446
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:35,661
I know what you're going through.

447
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:43,568
Do you regret it?

448
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,167
No, I really don't.

449
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:50,540
You know, my friends
told me I'd be depressed...

450
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,375
and teel guilty.

451
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:56,845
Honestly, I was so relieved.

452
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,884
But not everybody's the same.

453
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,635
Excuse me.
Do you know where physics is?

454
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:26,406
Physics. Last row on the right,
by the back door.

455
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,072
Thanks.

456
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:32,709
I'd like to research the life
of a woman poet for my paper...

457
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,276
but I'm not sure which one yet.

458
00:43:34,354 --> 00:43:37,380
That's very good.
What will your focus be?

459
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:39,391
Say she's got a tamily.

460
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:42,257
Where's a woman poet
gonna tind time to write?

461
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:47,494
I have a hard time seein' her alone.
I keep seein' her kids interrupting her.

462
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:49,695
I don't know if
it's a good topic.

463
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,796
I just would love...

464
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:57,003
to know how these women balanced it,
their work, their families.

465
00:43:57,077 --> 00:44:00,171
The important thing is that
you're enthusiastic about it.

466
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:03,182
See what you come up with.
Give it a try.

467
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,686
So, did you tind out
about the T.A. Position?

468
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:08,687
- I got accepted tor one.
- Good.

469
00:44:08,755 --> 00:44:12,350
It starts this fall
at Franklin High.

470
00:44:12,426 --> 00:44:14,360
- Eleventh graders.
- Eleventh graders.

471
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:18,762
The thing to know is, you can't teach
them anything because they know it all.

472
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:21,699
- Oh, I know.
- I've got one at home.

473
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,702
So do I.
Two, in fact.

474
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,034
- See you Thursday.
- Thank you.

475
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:38,109
Our Bodies, Ourselves.
Good book.

476
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:41,120
Oh, you've...
you've read it?

477
00:44:41,188 --> 00:44:43,053
I own it.

478
00:44:57,371 --> 00:44:59,305
Leave it. I'll get it.

479
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:06,737
You know, Mom, you can get one
at any health clinic.

480
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:07,905
What?

481
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:12,546
It's your legal right.

482
00:45:14,287 --> 00:45:17,154
What are you talking about?

483
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:19,852
I saw you, Mom.

484
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:25,861
Reading about abortions.

485
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:32,071
You gonna get one?

486
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:37,266
I'm so not prepared
to talk about this right now.

487
00:45:41,515 --> 00:45:44,109
But thanks for the information.

488
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:58,559
- More tood?
- The guys are hungry.

489
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,566
Why don't they go home and eat?

490
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:03,762
- The gig is tomorrow.
- Oh, the gig is tomorrow.

491
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:12,237
So, I don't guess you slept
so great, huh? All the noise?

492
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:17,306
Well, it's just that they keep playing
that one tune over and over again.

493
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:19,318
Learn a new song!

494
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:22,548
Mom, I didn't get any dessert.

495
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:25,557
You didn't?
Then who ate all the cake?

496
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:28,253
Scott took it out to the garage.
The band ate it.

497
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,990
- What can I have?
- How about a cookie?

498
00:46:31,064 --> 00:46:33,396
- Yes.
- Okay, that's it.

499
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:37,426
- Now oft to bed with you.
- You said I could see Partridge Family.

500
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,994
Go.

501
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:42,337
One more cookie, please.

502
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:47,980
Two. Now go.
Leave us alone.

503
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:53,451
Guess what.

504
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:56,017
What?

505
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:59,149
I'm pregnant.

506
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:02,327
Kidding me.

507
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:08,132
Get away trom it.
You've been watching TV all atternoon.

508
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:11,329
- It's my turn.
- Mom!

509
00:47:11,404 --> 00:47:14,168
Sally, stop it.
I told him he could.

510
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:23,209
If I gotta come in there, it's gonna be
TV otf with the lights out! Got that?

511
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,085
Is that clear?

512
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,889
This is somethin' else, isn't it?

513
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,365
That is some news.

514
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:54,413
Hi, Barbara. Officer.

515
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:56,676
Alison's gonna
stay over tonight, okay?

516
00:48:02,622 --> 00:48:04,886
Is that... That's my shirt.

517
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:07,927
Why the hell is Alison wearing it?
I've been lookin' all over tor it.

518
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:11,521
I don't know. I guess Linda
borrowed it and lent it to her.

519
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,589
Get it back.
I want it back.

520
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:16,192
- I'll get it back tonight.
- It's like an invasion here!

521
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:19,602
Nothing belongs to me anymore.
Nothing.

522
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,868
- One more cookie, please?
- One more.

523
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:35,214
Mom, want a cookie?

524
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:38,018
No, honey.
I'm tryin' to talk to Daddy.

525
00:48:38,091 --> 00:48:40,355
I guess we'll talk later, huh?

526
00:48:40,427 --> 00:48:44,056
Right. When they're
all grown up and married.

527
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,164
Oh, man, that's heavy.

528
00:48:54,107 --> 00:48:56,769
Queen of Cups.
That's always my mother.

529
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:59,073
I love your mom.
She's so cool.

530
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,874
You live with her.

531
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:05,651
Okay, it's done.

532
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:09,314
What are you gonna do?
That's it.

533
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:13,086
We just have to figure it out.
We're experienced enough.

534
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,754
What does that mean to you, John?
What are we gonna tigure out?

535
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:19,798
How to accommodate a new baby?

536
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:24,929
I keep talkin' about
early retirement.

537
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,633
That ain't gonna happen
with a tifth child.

538
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:31,734
Come on, honey.
What do you want me to say?

539
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:34,473
Havin' kids,
it's a part ot married lite.

540
00:49:35,282 --> 00:49:38,581
I just thought I was done
doin' it, that's all.

541
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:40,779
I thought I was tinished.

542
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:45,754
We just got a curveball
thrown at us, that's all.

543
00:49:45,825 --> 00:49:47,292
We'll tough it out.

544
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,885
- What does that mean?
- What I just said.

545
00:49:49,963 --> 00:49:53,399
I don't get to retire, Linda
doesn't go to her expensive school.

546
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:56,060
- We can't do that to her.
- Do what?

547
00:49:56,136 --> 00:50:00,129
She can go to state college. If it's
good enough tor you, it's good tor her.

548
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,367
We're talkin' about sacrifice.

549
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:05,934
We all have to make
a sacrifice here, all of us.

550
00:50:06,012 --> 00:50:08,981
Including you.
Your degree is gonna have to wait.

551
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:12,280
I don't wanna wait, John!
I just got started again.

552
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:14,377
This is deja vu!

553
00:50:14,454 --> 00:50:17,184
I teel like I'm pregnant
with Linda again.

554
00:50:17,257 --> 00:50:20,055
- What the hell else do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

555
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:23,391
I just want you to understand
how important school is to me.

556
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:26,364
- Honey, I know that.
- No, you don't.

557
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:30,199
If you did, you'd know that my quitting
school isn't the answer to everything.

558
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,898
It's important to me.

559
00:50:32,973 --> 00:50:35,601
For the first time
since Linda was born...

560
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:39,236
I'm having actual
adult conversation.

561
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:42,406
I'm talkin' about what's
goin' on in the world, about art...

562
00:50:42,482 --> 00:50:46,509
That's what we're havin' right now.
This is an adult conversation.

563
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:50,886
It may not be about art and philosophy,
but this is an adult conversation now!

564
00:50:50,957 --> 00:50:55,894
Stop! I know. I'm just tryin' to say
that there are no easy answers here.

565
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,096
I wanna work this out somehow...

566
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:01,497
without us havin' to give up
everything important.

567
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:04,162
- I don't know what you have in mind.
- I don't know.

568
00:51:05,305 --> 00:51:08,103
- I don't know.
- What's the alternative?

569
00:51:08,174 --> 00:51:11,541
- What are you saying is the alternative?
- I don't know!

570
00:51:22,822 --> 00:51:24,756
Here are your shoes.

571
00:51:35,935 --> 00:51:37,869
Way to go!

572
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:47,711
Why'd you tell?

573
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:50,648
- I almost got away with it.
- One hundred dollars.

574
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,751
John, you're gonna be late.

575
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:04,555
Got your keys? Your wallet?

576
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:16,703
We'II work it out, okay?

577
00:52:16,776 --> 00:52:18,403
Kiss?

578
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,445
I just have one thing
to say to you.

579
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:33,754
It you think I'm gonna give up on going
away to college because you screwed up...

580
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:37,092
Linda, I don't want you to
give up goin' away to college.

581
00:52:37,163 --> 00:52:39,757
I'm not deaf.
I heard you guys up there.

582
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:42,495
- We all have to sacrifice?
- Just a minute.

583
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:45,094
Just listen to me
tor one minute, Linda.

584
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:48,303
Nothin' is decided here.

585
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:52,435
I don't want everybody to know about it
until we have decided what to do.

586
00:52:53,513 --> 00:52:55,447
What is there to decide?

587
00:52:57,217 --> 00:53:00,209
Look. You wanna be a martyr,
that's your business.

588
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:02,948
But I'm not gonna pay
tor your mistakes.

589
00:53:03,022 --> 00:53:04,614
I'm not gonna do it.

590
00:53:11,364 --> 00:53:14,891
I mean,
she came completely unglued.

591
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:17,493
- Then she called me a martyr.
- Oh, boy.

592
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,834
Katie calls me that
almost every other day.

593
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:22,238
Atter all I do for her.
Who irons her clothes?

594
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:24,708
Who cleans her room?

595
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:29,339
Who argues with Daddy when he says no?
Little ingrate.

596
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,542
That's the job description
ot a martyr.

597
00:53:31,618 --> 00:53:35,714
- I am not a martyr, Julia.
- Barbara, listen to yourself.

598
00:53:35,788 --> 00:53:37,653
You're one and I'm one.

599
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:41,717
All this selt-sacrifice,
this unconditional love, it's bullshit.

600
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:45,423
- We expect gratitude tor what we do.
- You're right.

601
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:48,797
So why am I tryin' to please her?
Let her iron her own damn clothes.

602
00:53:48,868 --> 00:53:52,827
- Let's go have a cup of cotfee.
- Mom on strike.

603
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:11,579
Good morning.
Westside Women's Health Services.

604
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:13,421
Yes. Hi.

605
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:16,428
This is Helen.
How may I help you?

606
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,860
I need to talk to someone.

607
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:23,460
I just need some information
about getting an abortion.

608
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:35,913
Here's a really great one.
It's called "She."

609
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:39,042
"She wears her pain
like an aging dress.

610
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:43,411
"Moves her hips within
and smothers in its warmth.

611
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,889
"She cries for freedom.

612
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:50,020
Discard ladylike lace
to lose companionship."

613
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:52,823
Killer, huh?

614
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:54,833
Hang up the phone.

615
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:57,028
I wanna talk to you.

616
00:54:57,103 --> 00:54:59,264
Alison, I gotta go, okay?

617
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,807
I'll call you back later.

618
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:05,601
You're goin' away to college.
I want you to know that.

619
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:11,812
- What about you?
- What about me?

620
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:14,284
I don't think
you wanna have this baby.

621
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:23,361
Do you think this baby would have
a good life if its mother resented it?

622
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:26,626
You're exaggerating
how I feel, Linda.

623
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,099
I don't think you
even know how you teel.

624
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:33,332
We all know how Dad feels.
You certainly know how I feel.

625
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:36,534
But you're not even giving yourselt
the right to your own opinions.

626
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:41,205
I have my own opinions, I just don't
need to shout it out to the whole world.

627
00:55:45,985 --> 00:55:48,453
This is a tire hazard.

628
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,955
I've been researching
the topic of my paper...

629
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:55,961
the women poets and how
they balanced work and tamily.

630
00:55:56,029 --> 00:55:59,692
Well, they didn't balance anything.
I've been doin'...

631
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:03,167
Reading the biographies
of Plath and Sexton and...

632
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:05,962
Their lives were a mess.

633
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:07,802
So much for my brilliant topic.

634
00:56:07,874 --> 00:56:12,311
That's too bad, but maybe you can
make something out ot what you tound.

635
00:56:12,378 --> 00:56:16,610
This wasn't what you expected,
but there might be some good in it.

636
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:20,517
- Don't give up.
- Well, I'II think about it.

637
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,053
Thank you.

638
00:56:28,895 --> 00:56:30,954
- Hi.
- Hi, Titfany.

639
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,294
- See you Tuesday.
- Yeah.

640
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,774
- I heard you guys rehearsing.
- Oh, yeah?

641
00:56:48,848 --> 00:56:50,782
It sounded really good.

642
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,882
That's good.
Now bring that down.

643
00:56:56,956 --> 00:57:01,188
Bring down the eight...
and the two.

644
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,356
That's right.
Okay, now, check your proot, sweetie.

645
00:57:28,554 --> 00:57:32,081
You look like Leif Garrett
or Shaun Cassidy.

646
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,558
You've heard that, right?

647
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:45,894
How's my girl?

648
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:00,719
Got your wallet?

649
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:03,822
Got your lunch?

650
00:58:07,627 --> 00:58:09,891
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

651
00:58:09,962 --> 00:58:12,556
- Night, all.
- Bye, Dad.

652
00:58:19,906 --> 00:58:23,774
Let's see what you got.
Two and eight goes how many times?

653
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,041
Yeah?

654
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:33,544
Can I come in?

655
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:35,211
Yes.

656
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,890
I just wanted to let you know
what I decided.

657
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,159
I'm gonna have the baby.

658
00:58:52,805 --> 00:58:56,070
I don't know it it's
the right decision, Linda.

659
00:58:56,142 --> 00:58:58,337
It's just the only one
that I can live with.

660
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:02,641
That's great, really.

661
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:07,144
I know...

662
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,848
everything seems so simple
when you're young.

663
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:18,597
Don't worry, honey.

664
00:59:24,871 --> 00:59:26,805
It's what I want.

665
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,079
It'll be okay.

666
01:00:38,477 --> 01:00:41,469
All right. Catch you later.

667
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:42,980
Come on.

668
01:00:44,216 --> 01:00:47,276
Hey! Will someone please tell Kirk
to turn down...

669
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,753
The Artist Formerly Known As Prince?

670
01:00:49,822 --> 01:00:54,088
- Fuck you, asshole!
- Jack's doing his bad Arnold imitation.

671
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,391
- You're lame, Jack.
- Hasta la vista, baby.

672
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:15,707
Hey! Hey, you guys.

673
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:19,877
Don't play in the clothes.
Go play on the sidewalk. Come on.

674
01:01:27,259 --> 01:01:29,250
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

675
01:01:29,328 --> 01:01:33,287
Chris, you lett so quickly,
I didn't get a chance...

676
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:35,357
You lett your blueprints...

677
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:40,599
and I wanted to tell you
your work is wonderful.

678
01:01:40,673 --> 01:01:42,641
You're really talented.

679
01:01:52,018 --> 01:01:56,546
I want you to have this.
Please, take it.

680
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:58,783
Look, I know you can't
atford it, so...

681
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:01,053
- So this is money.
- Yeah.

682
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:06,130
Giving me money.

683
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:17,942
I don't know what to say.
What did you expect?

684
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,036
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- That you cared.

685
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,674
- I do care.
- I expected that you cared about me.

686
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,843
- I do care.
- Yeah?

687
01:02:32,658 --> 01:02:34,592
Look, I'm late.
I have to go.

688
01:02:35,394 --> 01:02:39,728
- What?
- I'm late. I have to go.

689
01:02:41,434 --> 01:02:43,368
Oh, I'm keeping you?

690
01:02:45,938 --> 01:02:50,204
I wouldn't wanna do that.
Wouldn't wanna make you late...

691
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,409
Professor.

692
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:00,476
- Tonight's Jack's birthday.
- Oh, party?

693
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:03,488
- Yeah.
- You ever known me to miss a party?

694
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,951
She sits there and calls me
a whore and a slut and a...

695
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,997
- Why can't I call her a...
- Okay.

696
01:03:12,064 --> 01:03:14,931
How can you talk to
your mother like that?

697
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:23,107
Hey, what's up?

698
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:27,634
If that was my mother, I would not
be talking to my mama like that.

699
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:35,181
Thank you! Tell her a little somethin'.
Little trollop.

700
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:39,787
Kick her out.
What is she still doing there?

701
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:45,163
Oh, Chris, I forgot.
Your mom called you last night.

702
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:48,257
I'm sorry. How long
did she keep you on the phone?

703
01:03:49,435 --> 01:03:53,496
We just hung up.
Your mother is so special.

704
01:03:53,572 --> 01:03:57,440
She was telling me some story
about how in the '60s...

705
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:01,002
women drew their mouths
up at the corner...

706
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,708
so that they always looked
like they were smilin'.

707
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:05,717
I mean, gone.

708
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:11,182
She wanted to know if you were coming
home tor your brother's rehab party.

709
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:17,523
I went to Barnes and Noble today.
I found the best books...

710
01:04:17,596 --> 01:04:21,828
on prenatal care, diet, everything.

711
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:24,301
Yea!

712
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:29,073
What is wrong with you?

713
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:34,841
- I just saw Jim.
- And?

714
01:04:36,182 --> 01:04:38,776
Basically, he said, "See ya."

715
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:43,955
Wouldn't really be a...

716
01:04:47,827 --> 01:04:50,591
Then he gave me money.

717
01:04:51,397 --> 01:04:54,423
Well, I'd really like to know what
he thinks you're gonna do with that.

718
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,231
What do you think
he expects me to do with it?

719
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,875
I don't know.
Maybe he's right.

720
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,606
What do you mean,
you think he's right?

721
01:05:12,685 --> 01:05:14,915
You don't even
believe in abortion.

722
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:19,914
I'm a hypocrite and a fucking coward,
but I can't go through with this.

723
01:05:19,992 --> 01:05:21,960
So let me just get this right.

724
01:05:22,027 --> 01:05:25,224
Are you trying to tell me that
you've decided to kill your baby?

725
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:27,959
Why is this so important to you?

726
01:05:28,033 --> 01:05:31,366
This isn't. You are.

727
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:36,067
My God, we've been triends
since '88.

728
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,268
It's '96 now.
What is that?

729
01:05:38,344 --> 01:05:41,279
That would be
eight and a half years.

730
01:05:41,347 --> 01:05:43,577
- Eight and a half years.
- And you still suck at math.

731
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:46,379
I still suck at math,
but I am damn good at you, Chris.

732
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:49,080
Listen to me.

733
01:05:50,623 --> 01:05:52,557
Chris, I know you.

734
01:05:53,692 --> 01:05:55,785
All right?
I know that if you...

735
01:05:59,198 --> 01:06:01,826
I know that if you
get this abortion...

736
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:05,268
you are not gonna be able
to live with yourselt.

737
01:06:06,438 --> 01:06:11,205
All I'm asking you is please
think about what you're doing.

738
01:06:11,277 --> 01:06:13,871
Think about it?
I'm ten weeks.

739
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:17,748
Ten weeks already.

740
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:21,149
How long you want me to think?

741
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:33,927
You get this abortion
and I swear to you, you are on your own.

742
01:06:51,684 --> 01:06:53,811
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

743
01:06:53,886 --> 01:06:55,979
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

744
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:09,267
Hail Mary, tull ot grace.
The Lord is with thee.

745
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:12,930
Blessed art thou amongst women and
blessed is the fruit ot thy womb, Jesus.

746
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:15,132
Holy Mary, Mother ot God,
pray tor us sinners...

747
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,437
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

748
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,680
Excuse me, honey.

749
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,109
- What's your name?
- Christine.

750
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:34,555
You're not going in there
to have an abortion, are you?

751
01:07:36,528 --> 01:07:38,894
Doreen, honey, come here.

752
01:07:38,964 --> 01:07:42,491
- This is my daughter, Doreen.
- Hi.

753
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:47,164
I think Christine might want
to hear what you have to say.

754
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:50,640
- She's young like you are.
- Hi, Christine.

755
01:07:50,709 --> 01:07:53,371
Listen, I just need you
to hear me out a minute.

756
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:58,041
I have tour kids.
Now, I am not rich.

757
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:03,282
I am no super mom, but I am gratetul
tor the gitts that God has given me.

758
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:05,550
My children are those gifts.

759
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:10,186
Maybe you're not married.
Maybe your boytriend won't know you...

760
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:13,356
but, honey, your baby
shouldn't have to pay for that.

761
01:08:13,432 --> 01:08:15,957
Just wait.

762
01:08:16,035 --> 01:08:21,166
When you have your baby and you
hold your son or your daughter...

763
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,801
that love, that maternal instinct,
it just takes over.

764
01:08:24,877 --> 01:08:27,744
- It is so fierce, Christine.
- So, Doreen, tell us.

765
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:31,613
What happens to all those mothers
who beat their kids or abandon them...

766
01:08:31,683 --> 01:08:34,652
or maybe even murder them because they
didn't want them in the first place?

767
01:08:36,455 --> 01:08:39,982
I guess their maternal instinct
just didn't click in like yours, huh?

768
01:08:43,062 --> 01:08:44,654
Hi, I'm Frances.

769
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,960
I'm here to escort you
into the clinic.

770
01:08:47,032 --> 01:08:49,626
Christine, she's just trying
to distract you.

771
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:52,636
We can help you keep your baby.
We'II help you financially.

772
01:08:52,704 --> 01:08:55,935
- You'll dream about that baby...
- Ladies, excuse me!

773
01:08:57,743 --> 01:08:59,005
Get back!

774
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:03,781
You're already a mother,
just like me.

775
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:07,785
I carry my baby in my arms.
You carry yours inside you.

776
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:09,787
- You all right?
- Yeah.

777
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:14,892
Okay. Come on.

778
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:22,323
She's coming in for a follow up.

779
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:24,631
- You coming in tull day Fridays?
- I hope not.

780
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:27,228
Shameeka, do me a favor.
Call my car alarm guy.

781
01:09:27,306 --> 01:09:29,638
Tell him my alarm is still
not working right.

782
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:33,166
Dr. Thompson, we've got to talk about
tomorrow's schedule before you leave.

783
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:36,806
- Shameeka, this is Christine.
- Hi, Christine.

784
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:42,349
Fill this one out, and the other one
tells you about our procedures.

785
01:09:44,022 --> 01:09:46,820
You guys make it impossible
tor me to clear the schedule.

786
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:49,326
Well, I don't want to come in
tull day Fridays.

787
01:09:53,699 --> 01:09:57,362
All right, Christine. I'm gonna take
your temperature now. Open up.

788
01:09:57,436 --> 01:09:59,370
There you go.

789
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:07,242
You'II be fine.
We're just gonna have you...

790
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,494
Well, I guess what
I'm not clear about is...

791
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:31,366
it you're here because you want to be
or someone's pressuring you.

792
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:36,333
Oh, I'm not being pressured.

793
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:40,910
I want to be here. I mean,
I don't actually want to be here.

794
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:43,243
- I'm just a little confused.
- That's okay.

795
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:46,443
- Let's just go over the options again.
- All right.

796
01:10:46,518 --> 01:10:50,614
The women outside yelled
something about...

797
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:53,624
taking care ot expenses.

798
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:55,626
Okay, in all tairness...

799
01:10:55,694 --> 01:10:57,753
they have been able
to provide some women...

800
01:10:57,829 --> 01:11:01,196
with baby supplies
and a place to live temporarily.

801
01:11:01,266 --> 01:11:05,293
Temporarily.
That's what I figured.

802
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,565
Are your parents around?
Have you tried to talk to them?

803
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:10,107
Uh, you know, they're...

804
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:14,337
they're really strict
Irish Catholic.

805
01:11:14,413 --> 01:11:17,348
I'm one of five kids.

806
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:20,442
I'm the good kid, so they tell me.

807
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:23,283
Yeah, that is a lot ot pressure,
isn't it?

808
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,923
Yeah, it's a lot of pressure.

809
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:33,955
Well, what about the relationship
that caused the pregnancy?

810
01:11:35,267 --> 01:11:37,132
He's married.

811
01:11:37,202 --> 01:11:40,797
He's concerned about his wife
tinding out, and that's about it.

812
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,944
It just doesn't seem fair at all.

813
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:52,109
He goes on with his lite
and I'm here making this decision.

814
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:54,675
And I just...

815
01:11:57,356 --> 01:12:01,486
I'm having a hard time thinking about
the baby being ripped out ot me.

816
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:07,329
They said that it can
feel the hurt.

817
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:08,832
Is that...

818
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,969
Can it?

819
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:17,407
Look, I know that's what
the people outside are saying.

820
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:20,343
I've asked the same question
to the medical people I trust.

821
01:12:20,412 --> 01:12:23,813
They say that it's not true.
There's no pain involved...

822
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:27,045
in a first trimester abortion.

823
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:31,951
- This is hard.
- I know it is.

824
01:12:32,024 --> 01:12:34,549
It's very hard,
and it's my job...

825
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:37,493
to help you be clear
on your decision.

826
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:44,225
Oh, shit! I can't believe you tell
tor that huge demonstration story today.

827
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:47,795
We're ready for 'em too. I had
150 people ready to come down here.

828
01:12:47,873 --> 01:12:50,501
- That's why they call it rumors.
- I know.

829
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,941
He probably planned it that way
just to watch us jump.

830
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:54,911
I know.

831
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,881
That one's a baby herself.
Her husband brought her.

832
01:12:57,949 --> 01:13:00,144
There were three other kids
in the car.

833
01:13:00,218 --> 01:13:02,686
The clinic director Angela
told me they took...

834
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:05,314
Dr. Thompson to lunch one day.

835
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:08,154
Really? That must've been
something special. What happened?

836
01:13:08,226 --> 01:13:12,526
Nothing. They couldn't convince her.
She couldn't convince them.

837
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,622
It is so weird.

838
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,693
They say hello every morning.
They wave good-bye.

839
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:23,469
- Huh? How people manage to coexist?
- It is weird.

840
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:25,533
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

841
01:13:27,546 --> 01:13:31,414
- I couldn't go through with it.
- That's okay.

842
01:13:31,483 --> 01:13:34,213
Take your time.
Think about it.

843
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:39,656
- Holy, holy, holy
- Thanks.

844
01:13:44,329 --> 01:13:47,787
- We'II pray tor you.
- Pray for me?

845
01:13:47,866 --> 01:13:51,563
- I didn't do it.
- She didn't do it!

846
01:13:55,507 --> 01:13:57,668
- Oh, God!
- Listen, call us.

847
01:13:57,743 --> 01:13:59,677
We can help you.

848
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:02,145
We can give you baby clothes,
a crib and a stroller.

849
01:14:02,214 --> 01:14:04,648
Here. Oh, thank God.

850
01:14:14,259 --> 01:14:16,887
- It's not Friday yet.
- See you tomorrow.

851
01:14:16,962 --> 01:14:19,522
- How's the baby doing?
- She's tine, Dr. Thompson.

852
01:14:19,598 --> 01:14:21,225
Good atternoon.

853
01:14:22,401 --> 01:14:24,301
Next weekend?

854
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:28,396
I didn't think the house was
going to be done until July, Mom.

855
01:14:32,644 --> 01:14:34,111
Okay.

856
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:38,946
Is that right, you have tive?
Five outdoor ceiling tans.

857
01:14:41,286 --> 01:14:43,720
That's really great.

858
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:47,555
I'm glad I know they were
a tun thing for you to buy.

859
01:14:51,096 --> 01:14:52,529
Mom...

860
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:58,461
No, go get your door.
It's okay.

861
01:14:58,537 --> 01:14:59,970
I'II, um...

862
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:03,199
I'll talk to you some other time.

863
01:15:03,275 --> 01:15:07,268
I just wanted to see it you were
doin' all right, and you are.

864
01:15:09,247 --> 01:15:11,647
I'm glad. Okay.

865
01:15:13,919 --> 01:15:17,912
Yeah, me too. Okay.

866
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,330
Look out!

867
01:15:40,111 --> 01:15:42,773
Hey, I saw your blueprints.
They look amazing.

868
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:45,715
Thanks.

869
01:15:50,188 --> 01:15:53,589
- You made it. Good. How are ya?
- Yeah. Good.

870
01:15:53,658 --> 01:15:56,183
Wanna play some quarters?

871
01:16:04,569 --> 01:16:06,503
There you go.

872
01:16:07,973 --> 01:16:09,634
- Whoa!
- Whoa, Chris!

873
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:11,141
All right.

874
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:16,008
- You want to try this bed?
- What are you doing?

875
01:16:16,081 --> 01:16:19,517
- Just lie back. It's the lumpiest...
- You think you're gonna get lucky?

876
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:22,178
Wait a second.
You want to play some pool?

877
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:26,486
- Come on. Let's go play some pool.
- I'd kick your ass on pool.

878
01:16:26,558 --> 01:16:30,153
Chris, you are wanted on the pool table
immediately for an ass-kicking.

879
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:32,196
- Good night.
- Where're you going?

880
01:16:32,264 --> 01:16:35,427
No, it's too early for bed.
Come here.

881
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,468
You are pushin' your luck.

882
01:16:37,536 --> 01:16:40,562
Are you sure?
Can I come with you?

883
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:43,233
You wish!
Some other time.

884
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:46,209
- You sure?
- No.

885
01:16:46,278 --> 01:16:48,473
All right.

886
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:55,485
Yeah!

887
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:58,079
I'm wasted.

888
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:04,361
Hi, triend.

889
01:17:05,564 --> 01:17:09,432
Hi, sweet triend ot mine.
Oh, boy.

890
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,603
You know...

891
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:17,839
tonight when I was
in the bathtub...

892
01:17:19,811 --> 01:17:22,279
I looked down at my stomach.
I looked pregnant.

893
01:17:23,748 --> 01:17:27,844
- What are you talking about?
- I look pregnant when I'm naked.

894
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,821
I look pregnant 'cause I...

895
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,323
chickened out.

896
01:17:34,659 --> 01:17:37,560
Yeah, I chickened out, but...

897
01:17:37,629 --> 01:17:42,157
Tomorrow.
I'm detinitely gonna go back tomorrow.

898
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:45,430
Why are you even telling me this?
Why?

899
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:51,073
Excuse the shit out of me
tor being a little confused.

900
01:17:53,278 --> 01:17:56,338
Just a little confused over here.
I'm not always right.

901
01:17:56,414 --> 01:18:01,215
- I don't always have the right answer.
- That's bullshit.

902
01:18:01,286 --> 01:18:05,347
You know exactly what to do.
You just won't accept it.

903
01:18:05,423 --> 01:18:09,553
And that's why you're
so damn confused all of the time!

904
01:18:09,628 --> 01:18:11,562
That's right, girltriend!

905
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:17,501
I'm so screwed!

906
01:18:20,038 --> 01:18:21,471
I'm screwed.

907
01:18:24,042 --> 01:18:27,705
I'm screwed for screwin'
the Nutty Protessor.

908
01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:29,212
That right?

909
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:39,515
Patty, I made a mistake.

910
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:47,628
I made one hell of a big mistake.

911
01:18:52,704 --> 01:18:56,333
Could you torgive me
tor making a mistake, triend?

912
01:18:58,877 --> 01:19:01,402
My tucking best triend...

913
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:05,040

for making a mistake?

914
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:37,138
- Here.
- I don't want your snotty rag!

915
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,942
It's not snotty.
I just got it out ot my pocket.

916
01:19:47,759 --> 01:19:49,192
Come on.

917
01:20:09,814 --> 01:20:11,748
Could you help me?

918
01:20:14,552 --> 01:20:16,782
Could you throw away
your morals for once?

919
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:19,449
Could you just throw 'em away
and help me?

920
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:27,130
It's cool.

921
01:20:27,966 --> 01:20:29,399
It's cool?

922
01:20:30,468 --> 01:20:32,561
I'll be there tor you.

923
01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:47,777
- What is going on?
- Oh, God.

924
01:20:47,852 --> 01:20:51,754
This looks way too intense.
Maybe we should come back tomorrow.

925
01:20:52,857 --> 01:20:54,791
No, I can't.

926
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:58,061
Let's just get it over with.

927
01:21:13,678 --> 01:21:15,805
What are you doing here, honey?

928
01:21:18,983 --> 01:21:21,383
We kept you trom this yesterday.

929
01:21:21,452 --> 01:21:25,582
We told you... Please,
let's talk about it. You should go.

930
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,587
Give her a hand. Help her through.
Come on. Let's go.

931
01:21:33,531 --> 01:21:36,591
- Come on. She's going through enough.
- This is murder!

932
01:21:36,668 --> 01:21:40,195
- Frances, I need some help out here.
- If you get an abortion...

933
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:43,707
you are the mother ot a dead baby.

934
01:21:43,775 --> 01:21:46,243
Come on. Go, go.

935
01:21:46,311 --> 01:21:48,370
- Why don't you go help her?
- No, I got it.

936
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:51,779
Do you ever ask yourselt it this is
a good, Christian way to make a living?

937
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:56,787
- Do you ever think about that?
- No, I don't. I'm Jewish.

938
01:21:56,855 --> 01:22:00,291
God, they're bold.

939
01:22:00,358 --> 01:22:02,519
- You all right?
- Yeah.

940
01:22:03,828 --> 01:22:05,762
Let's go on back.

941
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:10,130
Jesus loves the little children

942
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:13,534
All the children of the world

943
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:16,438
Red and yellow, black and white

944
01:22:16,507 --> 01:22:19,533
- Let her through!
- We got you. You're all right.

945
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:22,409
We will pray for all ot you,
but you're headed straight to hell!

946
01:22:24,449 --> 01:22:27,213
This is a house of murder!

947
01:22:27,285 --> 01:22:29,810
They are doing murder
in this house!

948
01:22:29,888 --> 01:22:32,083
In the name of the Lord,
I will not stop!

949
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:35,284
Don't worry, sweetie,
we are not gonna let them in here.

950
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,659
We have got the law on our side.
Don't worry.

951
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:42,325
Come with me. There's a room in
the back where you can lay down.

952
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,996
- You can relax a little bit.
- Can he come with me, please?

953
01:22:50,074 --> 01:22:52,235
- Of course he can go with you.
- Please.

954
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:54,778
- Go with her till she feels better.
- Thank you.

955
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:58,009
I'll show you where.
You're okay, sweetheart.

956
01:22:58,082 --> 01:23:00,573
Dorothy just called.
She couldn't get through the barricades.

957
01:23:00,652 --> 01:23:02,586
All right.
At least she calls.

958
01:23:02,654 --> 01:23:05,384
I would never let anything happen.
She's just scared.

959
01:23:05,456 --> 01:23:07,390
- It's ridiculous out there.
- Are you okay?

960
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,119
I'm okay.

961
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:12,356
This place kills babies!
This place kills babies!

962
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:16,691
Burn in hell, you baby killer!

963
01:23:17,835 --> 01:23:19,268
Stop her!

964
01:23:25,076 --> 01:23:28,170
Jesus! People!

965
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:30,874
Hey! Hey, get oft my car!

966
01:23:30,949 --> 01:23:35,386
- Get back!
- This situation is out of control!

967
01:23:35,453 --> 01:23:38,684
- These people are within their rights.
- Their rights? What about my rights?

968
01:23:38,756 --> 01:23:42,385
They come to my house, bother my
children in school... Goddamn it!

969
01:23:46,698 --> 01:23:48,632
That's Dr. Thompson.

970
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,634
She's a tough lady.

971
01:23:50,702 --> 01:23:56,140
She tlies twice a week to this clinic
up north that's always got picketers.

972
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:36,107
Channel 8 News has arrived.

973
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,808
Great. The 6:00 News is here.

974
01:24:38,883 --> 01:24:42,216
Shameeka, have everybody call home.
Let people know they're okay.

975
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:45,619
My mother's gonna have a heart attack
if she sees this on TV.

976
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:48,420
It's gonna get worse
now that the cameras are here.

977
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:57,694
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, Marcia, I'll be right there.

978
01:25:06,344 --> 01:25:09,279
Are you going to be with me
in this struggle?

979
01:25:11,349 --> 01:25:14,477
Our cause is just.
Our consciences are clear.

980
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:17,419
These people are crazy.

981
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:21,758
They're not crazy.

982
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:24,454
I mean, that guy might be
a little radical...

983
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:26,759
but their overall concept is right.

984
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:31,325
Excuse me? Then what the hell
are you doin' in here?

985
01:25:31,402 --> 01:25:35,270
Listen to what this young woman
has to say to you...

986
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:37,307
her urgent message.

987
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:41,175
I'm here to represent
the young women of this country.

988
01:25:41,245 --> 01:25:45,079
God forgive us tor taking roles
that aren't ours to take.

989
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:47,481
- Amen.
- May He break the curse...

990
01:25:47,552 --> 01:25:49,952
ot independence in women's hearts.

991
01:25:50,021 --> 01:25:52,421
Those deep-breathing exercises
are gonna help.

992
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,424
Hi, Christine. I'm Dr. Thompson.

993
01:25:54,492 --> 01:25:58,019
I'm going to be doing the procedure
this morning. Here, Marsh.

994
01:25:58,096 --> 01:26:00,656
First I have to listen
to your little heart.

995
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:04,797
Let me warm this up.

996
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:06,302
Okay.

997
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:09,406
Mm, it's beating.

998
01:26:11,075 --> 01:26:13,168
Okay, take a deep breath.

999
01:26:15,012 --> 01:26:16,946
All right, again.

1000
01:26:19,183 --> 01:26:21,743
Okay, great. Lay back.

1001
01:26:21,819 --> 01:26:26,119
- Now's when I get nervous.
- That's okay. It's normal.

1002
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:28,750
It's pertectly normal, really.

1003
01:26:28,826 --> 01:26:31,351
And it one of us has to be nervous,
better you than me, right?

1004
01:26:33,264 --> 01:26:35,198
She's too funny.

1005
01:26:36,834 --> 01:26:39,462
Can I ask you a question?

1006
01:26:40,838 --> 01:26:44,672
With all that you have to deal with,
why do you still do this?

1007
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:49,478
Because I remember when it was illegal
for women to make this decision.

1008
01:26:49,547 --> 01:26:51,640
I don't want to see
those days come again.

1009
01:26:51,716 --> 01:26:54,014
And also when a woman
comes to me and says...

1010
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:57,145
that she doesn't know what
she would've done without my help...

1011
01:26:57,221 --> 01:27:00,213
I know I'm doin' the right job.

1012
01:27:01,959 --> 01:27:03,893
Okay, scootch down, hon.

1013
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:06,863
Come on.
What is that they say?

1014
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:09,866
You can never be too rich, too thin
or too close to the end ot the table.

1015
01:27:15,006 --> 01:27:18,703
I'm going to explain everything as we
go along so there'll be no surprises.

1016
01:27:18,776 --> 01:27:21,176
I'm gonna put in the speculum.

1017
01:27:21,245 --> 01:27:24,180
It's a little cold.
Try to warm it up.

1018
01:27:24,248 --> 01:27:27,684
You think the 12-year-old
I had in here last week...

1019
01:27:27,752 --> 01:27:30,346
should've had her baby?

1020
01:27:31,222 --> 01:27:33,281
She could've given her
baby up tor adoption.

1021
01:27:33,357 --> 01:27:35,382
Oh, yeah.

1022
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,723
Right, girlfriend.

1023
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,923
You are livin'
in a tantasy world.

1024
01:27:41,766 --> 01:27:44,064
Just the other day
I was thinkin'...

1025
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:46,535
what a big demand there is
tor little black babies.

1026
01:27:51,108 --> 01:27:55,101
All right, I'm going to take this swab
and dip it in disintectant...

1027
01:27:55,179 --> 01:27:57,807
- You're okay.
- And swab the area.

1028
01:27:57,882 --> 01:28:02,046
Who will control
the minds ot our children...

1029
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:04,610
tor the next 100 years?

1030
01:28:04,689 --> 01:28:07,453
That is the struggle
that is betore us today.

1031
01:28:07,525 --> 01:28:11,154
We cannot let
the armies of death triumph.

1032
01:28:11,229 --> 01:28:13,322
We must win this war!

1033
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:21,271
All right.
You're going to feel a little stick.

1034
01:28:34,485 --> 01:28:36,476
I see this all the time.

1035
01:28:36,554 --> 01:28:38,715
You people, you come in here,
you get your abortion.

1036
01:28:38,789 --> 01:28:41,019
The next day, you back there
out on the line.

1037
01:28:42,493 --> 01:28:45,860
That's a completely inappropriate
conversation to be having in here.

1038
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,665
Whoa! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

1039
01:28:51,736 --> 01:28:54,967
- I was looking for the restroom.
- It's right down the hall.

1040
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,008
- Yes, ot course. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1041
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:18,421
It you'd arrest all the tags
and lesbians, this would all be over!

1042
01:29:18,496 --> 01:29:20,521
Fuck you, you redneck asshole!

1043
01:29:21,599 --> 01:29:23,692
What are you studying in school?

1044
01:29:24,869 --> 01:29:27,804
- Architecture.
- Really? My uncle's an architect.

1045
01:29:27,872 --> 01:29:30,568
He just helped me redo my bungalow.
It was so sweet.

1046
01:29:30,641 --> 01:29:33,166
He put one of those skylights
in my bedroom.

1047
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:35,178
- All right.
- Let's go.

1048
01:29:38,482 --> 01:29:40,746
Take some deep breaths now, okay?

1049
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,920
That's it.
You're doing really well.

1050
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:54,364
You're going to hear a suction machine.
You might hear a little noise.

1051
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,366
Don't be scared.

1052
01:30:41,512 --> 01:30:44,242
- It's not murder!
- Break it up!

1053
01:30:48,853 --> 01:30:50,787
You're doing really well.

1054
01:30:52,723 --> 01:30:54,657
We're almost over.

1055
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:04,167
Okay, it's all done.
You came through it like a trooper.

1056
01:31:04,235 --> 01:31:07,602
- It's over!
- Uh-huh!

1057
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:12,673
Murderer!

1058
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:25,955
Oh, God!

1059
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,761
Did I shoot you?

1060
01:31:41,906 --> 01:31:44,204
I didn't mean to shoot you.

1061
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:48,273
I'm sorry.

1062
01:31:54,385 --> 01:31:56,876
Shit. I didn't mean to hurt you.
Are you all right?

1063
01:31:56,954 --> 01:31:59,650
I'm sorry.
You got blood...

1064
01:32:13,804 --> 01:32:15,237
She's been shot.

1065
01:32:17,408 --> 01:32:20,036
The doctor's been shot!

1066
01:32:57,348 --> 01:32:59,282
Oh, my God.

1067
01:33:04,889 --> 01:33:07,881
Somebody... Oh, my God.

1068
01:33:11,562 --> 01:33:13,257
Help!
