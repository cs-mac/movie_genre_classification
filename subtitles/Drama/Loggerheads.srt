00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:26,928
You know sometimes, I get to
thinking about a turtle out there.

2
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:28,317
You know, he's just swimming
around, he's doing his thing.

3
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,379
And then one day he looks up, and
he sees another turtle-a female-

4
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,847
and they've never met

5
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:39,658
they've never even seen each
other before, but there's that...

6
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,548
...moment...

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,392
of recognition.
Where they just know that...

8
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:49,202
...that they're connected.
Something's going on.

9
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:55,044
It could happen.

10
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:59,856
It's a big ocean though.

11
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:13,531
To the end of the Earth,
I'll search for your face

12
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:19,389
For the one who laid all
of our beauty to waste

13
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:25,804
Threw our hope into Hell and
our children into the fire

14
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:36,119
I am the one who crawled
through the wire

15
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,966
There's a million sad stories
on the side of the road

16
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:50,268
Strange how we all
just got used to the blood

17
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:56,535
Millions of stories
that'll never be told

18
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:04,421
Silent and froze in the mud

19
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:09,977
I know a cold as cold as it gets

20
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:16,289
I know a darkness that's darker than cold

21
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:22,567
A wind that blows
as cold as it gets

22
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:29,337
Blew out the light of my soul

23
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:35,979
I know a cold as cold as it gets

24
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:42,331
If I had a war,
I may never see one

25
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:48,648
I live only to see
you live to regret

26
00:02:48,683 --> 00:03:01,804
Everything that you done

27
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,737
Hey!

28
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,446
Hi Patti!
Hi Wanda!

29
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:05,033
- I like that top.
- Hey. - Thanks.

30
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,973
Oh, we missed you at church.

31
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,135
I know, I know.
We were at Dwight's mama's.

32
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,904
Looks like you got new neighbors.

33
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:16,406
- I hope they speak english.
- I hope he's single.

34
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:20,147
- Shame on you ladies!
- Can't blame a girl for tryin'!

35
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,575
Adios!

36
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,533
You should invite them to church.

37
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:55,108
Hmmm?

38
00:06:55,143 --> 00:06:57,063
The new neighbors.
You should invite them to church.

39
00:06:57,098 --> 00:07:01,508
Oh I thought I'd take a pie over later.

40
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,003
Wanda's afraid they'll be Mexican.

41
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,334
Wanda's still worried about
property values.

42
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:10,661
I don't care as long as
they take care of their yard.

43
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:13,217
Will you slow down?

44
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:14,670
I have to get over to the hospital.

45
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:17,146
Harry's having his surgery this morning.

46
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:21,336
- You want me to make you a sandwich?
- No, I'll pick something up.

47
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:25,097
- No cheese!
- I know. I know.

48
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,450
See you later!

49
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,606
- When do you plan on returning the car?
- Sunday.

50
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,788
All right. Mid-size all right?

51
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:55,916
- As long as it has a cd player.
- It does. Driver's license, please.

52
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:05,253
- Ok. Will there be any additional driver's?
- Nope, just me.

53
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,579
Credit card?

54
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,473
You're Scorpio.

55
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:21,926
- Yeah, I don't really follow that stuff.
- Yeah, me neither.

56
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:26,327
- So what brings you to Asheville?
- Ah, Mother's Day.

57
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:29,925
Right.
Okay.

58
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:36,765
There you go. Just initial here, here,
and here. And then you sign at the bottom.

59
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,619
Can I ask you a personal question?

60
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,607
Well, I guess that depends on how personal.

61
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:59,259
It's personal.

62
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:03,495
Are you adopted?
I mean, were you?

63
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,063
- Are you adopted?
- Was I adopted?

64
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:10,261
- Yes.
- No.

65
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,401
I'm sorry. It's inappropriate.

66
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,958
I shouldn't...
You just remind me of someone...

67
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:25,147
Your date of birth, and the year...
Just thinking about... a friend...

68
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:00,344
Looks like we're in for a
gorgeous Mother's Day Weekend

69
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,549
with high's up and down the
coast reaching the upper 80's.

70
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:08,792
Currently 72 degrees in Wilmington,
74 at Rightsville, and 71 at Kure Beach.

71
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:33,264
Lola, as good as I say.

72
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,559
The people in number 6 called.
Their sink's stopped-up.

73
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:42,269
- I just fixed it!
- And they smell!

74
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:49,469
We should have a party.
I'm serious George, it's getting old.

75
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:55,636
Oh my God, dude.
Check it out.

76
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:00,671
What do you think?
Your team, or mine?

77
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:06,425
- I thought you played on everybody's team?
- I'm a team player.

78
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,665
Want to take those towels to 9 for me?

79
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,455
Hey! Hey mom!

80
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,513
- How was your day?
- Oh... fine.

81
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,565
Just fine.

82
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,567
- I feel like pork chops.
- Funny, you don't look like a pork chop.

83
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:31,611
- Is that ok? Does that sound good to you?
- I'm not hungry, so whatever you want.

84
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,434
Your aunt Millie called today.

85
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:47,044
She said she wants to come
up next month for a visit.

86
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,148
Won't uncle Don be coming up with her?

87
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,218
No. I doubt it. He still won't fly.

88
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,222
But they know I'm back and
that I'm living here with you?

89
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,609
She knows.

90
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:08,105
Did you tell her why?

91
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:15,529
I told her you'd been in the hospital.

92
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:21,673
She doesn't have to know everything.

93
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:45,189
Gracious Lord, accept our thanks
for these and all other blessings.

94
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:49,175
Lead us, and guide us, and teach
us to be true to each other,

95
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:54,955
ourselves and thee.
In Jesus name, Amen.

96
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:02,867
I talked to Susan today. She said
that Harry was recuperating very well.

97
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:07,840
You know, the first thing he asked
the doctor when he came out of surgery?

98
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,057
He wanted to know if he could
still use their microwave.

99
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:13,404
That sounds just like Harry!

100
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:22,673
- Did you meet the neighbors?
- Um, no... I saw them.

101
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:26,090
Are they Mexicans?

102
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:31,494
- Well... One might be.
- Oh, that's good.

103
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:35,567
Now Linda will only be half of upset.

104
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:43,083
Which one is Mexican?
Him or her?

105
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:47,630
Well...
I don't think there is a her.

106
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,606
What do you mean?

107
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:55,817
I mean I don't think that
there's a woman over there.

108
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,729
You saying what I think you're saying?

109
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:04,467
All I know is, one man came out of the house

110
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:09,170
another man got out of a car
and they embraced.

111
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:14,149
Well, maybe they're friends.

112
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,406
- How many friends do you kiss?
- They kissed?

113
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:20,662
Right in the driveway.
In front of the child.

114
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:25,088
- They have a child?
- Little boy.

115
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:34,547
- Were you wearing your glasses?
- Robert, I know what I saw.

116
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,576
Should I invite them to church?

117
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:46,276
Let's just wait and see
if they come on their own.

118
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:51,033
I made a pie and everything...

119
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:01,807
- Here ya go Bubba.
- Thank you, Julie.

120
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:05,789
So anyway,
everybody left around 11:30.

121
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:09,215
Around midnight I went out to get
into my truck and there it was,

122
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,782
- ... gone!
- Oh my god, what'd you do?

123
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,279
- I called Kanee.
- Did he find it?

124
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:18,120
Well, they told me I had to file
a police report, which I did.

125
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:21,892
They told me I had to call the
insurance company, which I did.

126
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,102
They told me they'd found the guy
who had stole it, which they didn't!

127
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:30,796
Same thing happened to my friend
Tammy when she was at Myrtle Beach.

128
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:35,745
Except, it was her bicycle and
they found it. Oh, that's my song!

129
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,660
- Want another 'cow-out-of-line', George?
- Yes m'am, thank you.

130
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,673
Well, what can I get for you, sugar?

131
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,885
- How much for a cup of coffee?
- A dollar.

132
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,968
I'll have one of those 'to go', please.

133
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:56,574
- It'll be a few minutes.
- That's all right.

134
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,827
- Hey. How's it going?
- Pretty good, yourself?

135
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:05,429
Not bad.
Thanks.

136
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,961
You on vacation?

137
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:12,173
I think you actually have to have a job,
to be on vacation. So, no...

138
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:14,597
- Hope you didn't come here looking for one.
- No.

139
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:17,616
No, acutally I came here to
see the loggerhead turtles.

140
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:18,845
Yeah, I figured that was what
you were doing.

141
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,752
I saw you out there this morning
putting that flag in the sand.

142
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,319
Yeah, I woke up right next to a nest.

143
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:26,214
I figured it'd be the best way to
keep someone from stepping on it.

144
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:28,776
I wouldn't worry too much
about the turtles around here.

145
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,765
This whole place is a loggerhead sanctuary.

146
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,719
I love it that they call it a sanctuary.

147
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,182
- Hey, I'm... I'm George.
- Hi George, I'm Mark.

148
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,960
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

149
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,836
Hey, you should um...
you should really be careful out there.

150
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:59,048
It's against the law to
sleep on the beach here.

151
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,225
- What you kidding me?
- No, it's a city ordinance.

152
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,670
No, it's a public beach right there.

153
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:05,818
Just trust me when I tell you you don't
wanna get busted by the cops around here.

154
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:10,722
- That's ridiculous!
- Well, welcome to Kure Beach.

155
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:14,445
Ku-re?
I thought it was 'cure'...

156
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,541
Everybody gets it wrong.

157
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:20,003
- Did you want sugar and cream in this?
- No, thank you that's fine.

158
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,920
- There you go.
- You know what? I got it.

159
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:25,891
- No, really you don't have to do that.
- Lemme get it. Phyllis, I got this one.

160
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:30,423
- Thanks alot.
- You're welcome.

161
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:37,474
- Hey seriously, be careful out there.
- I will.

162
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,702
Did you get his number?

163
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:53,581
No, well you know, I don't think he's
got one. He's sleeping on the beach.

164
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:57,008
Oh boy!

165
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,208
I thought you'd finished your sermon?

166
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:07,405
I'm just looking for a good
scripture for Mother's Day.

167
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,333
- Well, how about Mary?
- I was thinking about Ruth and Naomi.

168
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:18,667
- "Wither thou goest"?
- That's the one!

169
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:23,653
- We used that when we got married.
- We, and everybody else.

170
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:28,481
- Except Naomi is Ruth's mother-in-law.
- Mmmm.

171
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:34,846
Oh, speaking of mothers-in-laws, we need
to send mom something for Mother's Day.

172
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:39,174
I thought maybe I'd send her
a nice pot of Azalea this year.

173
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,855
Oh, she can't take care of a plant!

174
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:46,174
Well, the nurses could water it for her.

175
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:51,634
- Just send her some yellow
roses, she likes that. - Okay.

176
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:20,071
Are you adopted?
I mean, were you?

177
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:23,512
- Are you adopted?
- Was I adopted?

178
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:26,590
- Yes.
- No.

179
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,504
There was a time, you know,

180
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,702
when parents didn't tell their
kids that they were adopted.

181
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:38,131
Well, I'm a pretty sure my parents would
have mentioned something about that.

182
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:46,244
Anyway, there's no way I was adoped.
I look just like my mom. So...

183
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:21,220
You are in violation of
county ordinances...

184
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:24,171
Can you please explain that situation?

185
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,266
I don't understand whats...
I don't understand whats...

186
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:29,076
- ... to come here.
- Because you... - Hey, no, no!

187
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,126
No, no one can insult me like...

188
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,653
I don't believe that any of these...
First of all, you don't touch me!

189
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,325
You're gonna calm down,
is what you're gonna do.

190
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,759
What's going on?

191
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:40,388
- Hey, George.
- What's going on?

192
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:45,188
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.

193
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:49,872
Step to the rear of the car, son.

194
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,614
- How do you know this guy?
- He's a... he's staying over at the motel.

195
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:57,581
- He's a guest at your motel?
- Yeah.

196
00:25:57,616 --> 00:26:02,537
So why is he sleeping on the beach?
Something doesn't smell right, George.

197
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,271
Sounds like you're gonna
owe me one, right?

198
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:11,912
- Last one!
- I appreciate it.

199
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:17,799
And you!
I don't want to see you anymore.

200
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:34,893
- That guy's uptight.
- He's a nice one.

201
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:43,600
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him you were a guest of my motel.

202
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,000
- Did he believe that?
- Probably not.

203
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,023
He owes me one, anyway.

204
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,099
Here you go!
Kind of a wreck.

205
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:02,295
You can open these windows if you want to.
The AC died last week.

206
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,274
Oh that's all right.
I hate the air conditioning.

207
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:08,276
You won't be saying that in August.

208
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,875
I like this place.

209
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,986
It's very 'retro'.

210
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:18,616
By 'retro' you mean that
there's always something to fix?

211
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,426
- Yeah.
- Pretty 'retro'.

212
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,322
- Is it all right if I smoke in here?
- It's your lungs.

213
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:39,705
I...
I should probably tell you...

214
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:48,622
I'm HIV-positive.

215
00:27:49,228 --> 00:27:50,361
I'm sorry.

216
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:53,010
I just thought I'd tell you
before we get in to anything.

217
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,625
And if you don't want to
give me the room now, I...

218
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,907
- ... I understand.
- Wait!

219
00:27:56,942 --> 00:28:02,590
What? What do you think that I
gave you this room in exchange for...?

220
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:05,629
Yeah, I thought it was a barter...
situation...

221
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,175
No.
It isn't, okay?

222
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:21,782
I'm sorry.

223
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,761
You have to do this alot?

224
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,433
Some.

225
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:34,926
It seems kinda dangerous.

226
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,381
Well, I can usually tell who's
harmless and who's dangerous.

227
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,779
Oh.
So, I'm harmless?

228
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:47,021
You seem like a nice guy.

229
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:50,893
I am a nice guy, Mark.

230
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:57,585
No need to barter.

231
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:18,233
Ruth!
What on earth!

232
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:23,398
Isn't he divine?
Look at those proportions.

233
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:27,253
I'm going to put day lilies around him.

234
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:29,850
You're not gonna leave him here?!

235
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:33,660
- Why not?
- He's practically in front of the church!

236
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:37,090
Well...
David's in the bible.

237
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,871
He threw Goliath.
He was a king.

238
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,231
I know very well who David is.

239
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,556
Now, that looks like a king!

240
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:48,727
Ruth, he's naked.

241
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,220
You know what?

242
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:54,999
If this were the Venus De Milo we
wouldn't even be having this conversation.

243
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,685
Oh, c'mon Ruth!

244
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,242
Elisabeth, if you don't
like it, don't look at it!

245
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:07,354
Well, I have a good mind to go
over there and cover him up myself.

246
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,718
Don't get yourself worked up over it.
That's just what she wants you to do.

247
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:14,659
- She just does it to irritate me.
- She does it for the attention.

248
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:17,361
Landon-DeWight are
going to be very upset.

249
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:20,029
And Patti will be furious
when she sees it.

250
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,572
I'll um... I'll say something
to the mayor.

251
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,637
What can he do?
It's her property.

252
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:29,429
-But we have to look at it.
- Not according to Ruth.

253
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:30,885
Well, he better do something.

254
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,979
He made us take down our
living nativity at town hall.

255
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:36,971
Oh, I'm going to need the car
this afternoon.

256
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:41,596
Well, I'll uh...
I'll see you at home.

257
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:57,174
- Aren't you going to be late?
- Uh, it's my day off.

258
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,751
I thought Monday was your day off?

259
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:04,558
Yeah well, they changed the schedule around.

260
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:11,515
I made a list.
Do you need anything?

261
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,638
No, mom, I'm fine.

262
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:21,409
- Okay. I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

263
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:54,943
Did you live here?

264
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:57,823
I'm sorry.

265
00:32:57,858 --> 00:33:02,431
Did you live here?
When you were...

266
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:06,970
Yes I did. Upstairs.
Room in the front.

267
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:11,519
- It's all offices now.
- Oh, really? - Mmmmm.

268
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:15,365
- Where are you from?
- Asheville.

269
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,171
Oh, I love Asheville.

270
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:21,982
Went there last Christmas.
To the Biltmore House.

271
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:24,416
Amazing.

272
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:34,289
Do alot of us come back?

273
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,670
Some.

274
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:42,494
Ms. Bellamy?

275
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,082
It's quite common for a
birth mother to question,

276
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:50,431
from time to time, if she
made the right decision.

277
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:53,746
- But I can assure you...
- Uh, it wasn't my decision.

278
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,490
Excuse me?

279
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:59,326
I signed the papers,
but it wasn't my decision.

280
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:03,046
I can assure you he was
placed with a very good family.

281
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:06,595
But... I mean,
I know it happens everyday...

282
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,109
birth mother's reunited with their children.

283
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:12,031
Some States allow for that.

284
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:15,184
But in North Carolina
all adoptions are closed.

285
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,267
Which means birth records
are sealed permanently.

286
00:34:18,302 --> 00:34:23,014
We find that's best for all the
members of the adoption triade.

287
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:26,390
Best for the triade? I mean,
what about him?

288
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:30,140
I mean, he's at a certain age now...
If he were to try to contact me...

289
00:34:30,175 --> 00:34:33,856
Well, if an adoptee contacts us,
the only thing we are allowed to provide

290
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:37,134
is what's known as a 'letter
of non-identifying information'.

291
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:40,498
Nothing that could ever
sacrifice your anonimity.

292
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:47,446
My anonimity...
Yeah...

293
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:52,667
Ms. Bellamy...

294
00:34:52,702 --> 00:34:56,653
When birth mother's like yourself
try to find relinquished children

295
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:59,520
it can be very disruptive
to the adoptive family.

296
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:04,968
A closed adoption protects them.

297
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:09,307
Protects them from what?

298
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:15,082
From you.

299
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,179
Excuse me.

300
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:21,253
Could you sign out please?

301
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:33,661
She can help you find
what you are looking for.

302
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:58,750
Pearl, are you back there?

303
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,153
Mrs. Austin.

304
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:08,877
- Sam!
- My mom will be right back.

305
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:11,186
She... she just...
stepped out for an hour.

306
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:16,535
- I thought you were in the service?
- No.

307
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,598
Not anymore.

308
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,878
Well, your mother didn't
say anything about that.

309
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,203
Yeah.

310
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:31,169
Is there something I can help you with?

311
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:36,984
Oh! Uh... we need to send some
yellow roses to Robert's mother.

312
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,116
- She's at Oakwood.
- Okay.

313
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:47,299
- How's she doing?
- She doesn't recognize us anymore.

314
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:49,690
I'm sorry.

315
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:54,330
What would you like this card to say?

316
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:58,631
Um...
Happy Mother's Day...

317
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,898
Love,
Robert and Elisabeth

318
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:07,916
How's Mark?

319
00:37:09,537 --> 00:37:14,905
- Fine!
- Good.

320
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:24,206
When's the last time you spoke to Mark?

321
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,161
Not since graduation.

322
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:29,951
What's he up to these days?

323
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:35,105
Well.. you know Mark.

324
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,722
Yeah.

325
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:43,350
When you see him,
tell him I said 'Hi'.

326
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,930
All right.

327
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:04,624
I almost ran over that little boy today.

328
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,234
What little boy?

329
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:09,009
The little boy across the street.

330
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:10,975
What happened?

331
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:17,493
Well, he was on his bicycle and he
just darted right out in front of me.

332
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:21,660
Did anybody see you?

333
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:24,785
No, I don't think so.

334
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:32,110
You should say something. He
shouldn't be riding out on the street.

335
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,945
No.

336
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:38,750
I wasn't paying attention.

337
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:02,474
Grace Bellamy.

338
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,887
- Yeah.
- I thought that was you.

339
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:08,231
It's Mike. Mike Sullivan.

340
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:10,733
Oh my God! Mikey!
How are you?

341
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,818
What are you doing back in Asheville?

342
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,703
Just uh... you know, staying with
my mom for a little bit.

343
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:19,365
- She okay?
- Fine. Just fine.

344
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,172
- What can I get you?
- Uh, a beer's great.

345
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:25,642
You got it!

346
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:31,686
- Thanks.
- I heard uh, you were livin' in...

347
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:36,809
- Where was it? Was it Baltimore?
- Atlanta. - Oh, right.

348
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:39,245
God, you look great!

349
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,703
- No I don't.
- Yeah, yeah, you do.

350
00:39:43,738 --> 00:39:46,619
Thank you Mike.

351
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:51,211
Remember, you used to drive
that 'green bug'?

352
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:57,196
- Yeah, I remember that.
- God, times have changed, huh?

353
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,500
Yeah, yeah...

354
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:04,353
Well, that's on the house.
Welcome home.

355
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:07,263
Thank you Mike.

356
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:33,045
- Hey!
- Hey!

357
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,905
- Oh, wow! Bad time?
- No.

358
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,903
No, no, c'mon in.
Lemme just get dressed.

359
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:39,125
I just thought these might
help cool you off there.

360
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,152
Thanks!

361
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:52,039
Yeah, I forgot how good
it is to sleep in a bed.

362
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,734
How long have you been on the road?

363
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:59,215
This time it's been about...
about 3 weeks.

364
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,534
But I've been on my own since I was 17.

365
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:04,993
Where you from originally?

366
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:07,521
Have you ever heard of a place called Eden?

367
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:10,113
Yeah, book of Genesis?

368
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:14,464
This place wasn't paradise.
You know, actually it was kinda pretty.

369
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,981
If you drove out far enough, it started
to look like Scotland a little bit.

370
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:19,962
Oh, oh, I've never been.

371
00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:22,449
Yeah, well, me neither.

372
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:24,902
But I've seen pictures.

373
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:29,775
Thanks. It must be nice living at the beach.

374
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,851
Hmmm. If you can stand the hurricanes.

375
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,858
- Have you been in a bunch?
- Yeah.

376
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:40,752
Nah. No. Not really.
They always evacuate us.

377
00:41:40,787 --> 00:41:43,891
Some of the old timers like
to stick it out, though.

378
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,872
Yeah, I would.

379
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:51,566
Yeah. You obviously never been in one.

380
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:01,328
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

381
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:05,324
- And what are these?
- Infrared goggles.

382
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,576
- For what?
- So I can see the turtles at night.

383
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,883
A soldier down at Camp
LeJeune gave them to me.

384
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:14,097
Gave them to you?

385
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,102
Yeah, we bartered for them.

386
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:23,064
Wow. Bet you could do some
serious spying with these things.

387
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,563
You want to?

388
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:36,445
Why do they only come out at night?

389
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:41,443
I guess they just don't wanna be seen.

390
00:42:45,225 --> 00:42:47,854
Do you know what the most amazing thing is?

391
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:50,693
A female loggerhead who
was born on this beach

392
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:53,462
will return to this exact
spot to lay her eggs.

393
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:56,299
And then when the babies finally hatch,
they look up and find the moonlight.

394
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:59,053
And hat's what guides
them back into the ocean.

395
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:03,193
- How does she know?
- It's a mystery.

396
00:43:03,228 --> 00:43:06,861
But something pulls her back.

397
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:15,287
Hey Mark, you feel okay?

398
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:18,904
Yeah, yeah. I feel great,
why?

399
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:22,487
Coz you look a little green.

400
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:28,283
How long have you been positive?

401
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,741
It's been about 5 years now.

402
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,165
Mind if I ask how you got it?

403
00:43:36,229 --> 00:43:39,110
I trusted someone.

404
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:42,410
You know, it's not like somebody
tied me up, forced me to do

405
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:43,805
something I didn't want to do.

406
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,569
Well, that one time! But,
that's a totally different story.

407
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,666
I found out that I was
positive on my 21st birthday.

408
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:54,535
Oh, my God!

409
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,641
- A birthday's a birthday.
- Well...

410
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,677
We're all born.
We'll all die.

411
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:03,941
At least now they can treat it, right?

412
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:06,298
It's what they say.

413
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,586
You're not treating it?

414
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:11,102
I'm not going to spend the rest of my
life getting sick just trying to get well.

415
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:13,330
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Well, that's how it works, Mark.

416
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:16,787
- Drugs keep people alive.
- Some people.

417
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:21,040
If you don't treat it, how
do you expect to survive?

418
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,132
I don't.

419
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,030
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

420
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:35,635
I wasn't asleep.

421
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:41,701
I remember the exact moment
that picture was taken.

422
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:44,149
I thought I was so ugly.

423
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:49,829
You're beautiful.
You look just like my mother.

424
00:44:49,864 --> 00:44:54,542
I wish I could go back and
tell her how pretty she is.

425
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,918
Was.

426
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:03,407
I really wish I could do that.

427
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,873
I was 4 months pregnant
and I didn't even know it.

428
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:15,349
Can you believe that?

429
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:18,918
It's late.

430
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:21,694
You have to work tomorrow.

431
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:24,401
- No mom, I quit.
- What?

432
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:27,726
- I quit.
- I thought you liked this job?

433
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:32,241
No, I've never said that.

434
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:39,592
Well, drink some water
before you go to sleep.

435
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:52,207
- Well, do you wanna come inside?
- Nah, nah, I'm gonna head in.

436
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:56,761
- I understand.
- No, it's not that.

437
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:03,365
- I.. I have to get up early, that's all.
- That's cool.

438
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,232
Are you spying on the homosexuals?

439
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,377
I'm not spying.

440
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:19,631
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with that Dogwood.

441
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,391
I ordered your mother
some flowers today.

442
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:26,524
Good.

443
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:37,642
- Guess who I saw at the florist?
- Who?

444
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:42,631
Sam.

445
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:46,772
I thought he was in the service?

446
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:51,248
Not anymore.

447
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:56,084
He asked about Mark.

448
00:46:57,111 --> 00:47:00,320
And what did you tell him?

449
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:05,404
I said he was fine.

450
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:09,218
What do you say?

451
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:16,343
When people ask about him?

452
00:47:16,344 --> 00:47:20,455
They don't.

453
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:38,818
As I row, row, row

454
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:43,428
Going so slow, slow, slow

455
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:54,256
Just down below me
is the old sea

456
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:58,948
Nobody knows, knows, knows

457
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:03,606
So many things, things, so

458
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:05,616
So out of range

459
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:07,830
Sometimes so strange

460
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:11,087
Sometimes so sweet

461
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:14,310
Sometimes so lonely

462
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:17,590
And I'm alone

463
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:22,969
All of the way

464
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:28,313
Alone and unheard

465
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:42,240
You just have to go, go, go

466
00:48:42,275 --> 00:48:46,602
Where I don't know, know, know

467
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,729
This is the thing

468
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:50,838
Somebody said

469
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:53,347
Somebody told me

470
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:55,821
A long time ago

471
00:48:57,141 --> 00:48:59,157
The further I go

472
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:05,636
More letters from home
never arrive

473
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:09,179
And I'm alone

474
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:13,302
All of the way

475
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:17,390
Alone and unheard

476
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:33,586
As I row, row, row

477
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:37,947
Going so slow, slow, slow

478
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:47,434
Just down below me is the old sea

479
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:50,857
As I row, row, row

480
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:55,771
Going so slow, slow, slow

481
00:49:55,806 --> 00:50:00,346
Just down below me
is the old sea

482
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:12,424
-Oh! Hello!
- I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

483
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:17,041
Oh, well, let's introduce
ourselves then, okay?

484
00:50:17,076 --> 00:50:21,633
I'm Mrs. Austin, and I live
in that house right over there.

485
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:25,424
- And what's your name?
- Julian.

486
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:30,335
Julian? Well, nice to meet you
Julian.

487
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,107
You know, you really should
be more careful on your bicycle.

488
00:50:33,142 --> 00:50:38,598
Because yesterday you almost...

489
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:42,862
Well, I... I almost hit you and I...

490
00:50:42,897 --> 00:50:47,091
- How old are you Julian?
- Eight.

491
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:51,522
Eight years old? Oh my goodness,
you're almost grown up!

492
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:54,776
How old are you?

493
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:59,323
Well... I... I don't think you
should ask a lady how old she is.

494
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,904
Why not?

495
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:08,402
- Um... where's your daddy?
- He's in the house. - Oh.

496
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:12,188
And your mommy?

497
00:51:12,223 --> 00:51:16,345
Can you tell me where your mommy is?

498
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:11,438
I see you've met the neighbors.

499
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:13,881
Yeah.

500
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:19,412
Well?

501
00:52:19,447 --> 00:52:25,772
- Well, they're not homosexuals.
- Why I thought you said they were?

502
00:52:25,807 --> 00:52:29,183
I was wrong.
He's a widower.

503
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:35,308
- And the other man is his wife's brother.
- Oh.

504
00:52:35,343 --> 00:52:38,935
Did you invite them to church?

505
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,846
No.

506
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:46,442
You should do that.

507
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:53,171
You'd better hurry if you're
gonna get your hair cut.

508
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:12,526
So why do they put bibles
in motel rooms?

509
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:15,421
- Gideon's do it.
- Yeah, but why?

510
00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:19,397
To brainwash a few more people, I guess.

511
00:53:19,432 --> 00:53:21,939
So you're not a believer?

512
00:53:21,974 --> 00:53:26,932
I think that people who
believe in God are fools..

513
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:32,494
Well, I guess that makes me a fool, huh?

514
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:38,034
I like church.

515
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:42,066
I like the ritual of it.
I like the way it makes me feel.

516
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:44,931
I...
I dunno...

517
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:51,606
Not me. It's always one extra hour
away from my surfboard on Sundays.

518
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:55,641
Whenever they had the doors
unlocked, I was in church.

519
00:53:55,676 --> 00:53:59,842
I didn't have much of a choice.
My father was the minister.

520
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,356
Do they know you're positive?

521
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:09,809
Nah.

522
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:12,904
It doesn't matter. I mean,
they're not my real parents anyway.

523
00:54:12,939 --> 00:54:14,930
I was adopted.

524
00:54:17,528 --> 00:54:19,946
You know, when I was
little they would tell me:

525
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:23,339
Of all the kids out there,
we chose you.

526
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:26,575
I used to picture this fenced-in area
with babies just crawling all around

527
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,093
like a dog-pen.

528
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:31,007
And my parents peering over the
fence, pickin' out their baby.

529
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:34,624
No. No. Oh that one's pretty cute!
Maybe.

530
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:36,834
No.
Yes! Yes!

531
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:39,895
You!
You will be our baby.

532
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:42,143
For the longest time I thought
that if I did anything wrong,

533
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:47,559
anything at all,
they'd send me right back there.

534
00:55:07,395 --> 00:55:10,786
Three thousand dollars,
that's a lot of money.

535
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:19,128
You get his name. His address.
The name and address of his adopted family.

536
00:55:19,163 --> 00:55:22,950
Yeah, but how do you get that
with all the records sealed?

537
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:26,409
Uh, it isn't just me.
It's a whole network.

538
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:31,808
Think of it as a kind of
modern-day underground railroad...

539
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:33,558
...or something.

540
00:55:33,593 --> 00:55:36,304
And how long does it take?

541
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:39,505
Uh... it varies.

542
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:45,706
One search took me a year.
Uh, another one took me an hour.

543
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:50,235
Oh, one thing you should know...

544
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,637
I don't... set up reunions or do
introductions, or anything like that.

545
00:55:55,672 --> 00:55:59,701
Uh... after I get paid,
I'm out of the picture.

546
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:03,731
What you do with the
information, is up to you.

547
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,509
An interesting career choice.

548
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:12,111
Well... I... I believe people have
the right to know who they are.

549
00:56:12,146 --> 00:56:15,408
Or where they came from.

550
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:18,670
You're adopted, are'nt you?

551
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,150
- Yeah!
- Of course!

552
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:23,058
How'd you know that?

553
00:56:25,284 --> 00:56:27,930
Did you find your birth parents?

554
00:56:27,965 --> 00:56:30,656
I found my mother.

555
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,659
For me, I didn't have any choice.
I had to find her, you know?

556
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:45,267
I had to find her so that I
could stop looking for her.

557
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,147
Thank you for calling the North
Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher.

558
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:12,788
The aquarium is open from 9AM to 5PM,
seven days a week.

559
00:57:12,823 --> 00:57:16,394
Everyday except Thanksgiving
Day, Christmas Day and...

560
00:57:17,631 --> 00:57:20,185
- You looking for George?
- Yeah, have you seen him?

561
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,739
- Is he around?
- He's upstairs.

562
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:27,583
- Something I can help you with?
-No, thanks. That's all right.

563
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:29,622
I'm Lola.

564
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:35,327
- Hi, I'm Mark.
- I know who you are.

565
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:39,476
You're in number 2.
He gave me number 9.

566
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:43,590
Have you known George
for a long time?

567
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:48,027
Let's see... uh...
five years?

568
00:57:48,062 --> 00:57:50,550
Yeah.
Wow!

569
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:57,539
So... George says that you're here
trying to save the turtles.

570
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:03,509
Yeah, somebody has to.
They're endangered.

571
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:06,913
Lola.

572
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:09,480
It's a good name.

573
00:58:09,515 --> 00:58:11,834
Lola's not my real name.

574
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:17,079
My real name's Sharon, but, you know,
I... hate Sharon and...

575
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:22,205
Besides, George said I
seem more like a 'Lola'.

576
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,876
I do too.
I see it.

577
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:32,969
You know, I heard that uh,
loggerhead turtles

578
00:58:33,004 --> 00:58:36,270
could live to be like
over a hundred years old.

579
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,166
Yeah, some of them can.

580
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:44,376
They got us beat!

581
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:55,876
Hello.

582
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:57,903
- Hi Marvin!
- Richard. Chad.

583
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:01,631
- Fred. Hey Gordy.
- Hi reverend. Nice to see you.

584
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,650
How long's the wait this morning, Lou?

585
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:06,236
You're next.
Right after this young fella.

586
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:08,158
How's your momma Gordy?

587
00:59:08,193 --> 00:59:10,010
Oh not too good, reverend.

588
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:12,751
We took her out of Mercy
on Wednesday and

589
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,454
- had to put her right back in on Friday.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

590
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:18,122
- Don't seem like she can stay
at home more than 2 or 3 days

591
00:59:18,157 --> 00:59:19,722
before she has to go right back in.

592
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,226
I'll get over to see her tomorrow.

593
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:24,604
She'll appreciate that.
Thank you, reverend.

594
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:34,957
Okay.
How's that?

595
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:42,115
Thank you.
Oh, and good luck at the game!

596
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:46,188
Reverend, you're up!

597
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:48,859
Reverend?

598
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:52,474
- Hmmm?
- It's your turn.

599
01:01:29,536 --> 01:01:31,812
Can I help you?

600
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:37,130
Oh.
I didn't think anyone was home.

601
01:01:37,165 --> 01:01:40,903
What have I done this time?

602
01:01:40,938 --> 01:01:44,641
I wanted to talk to you...

603
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,800
...about the statue.

604
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:51,294
I thought maybe that you could
move it to the back yard?

605
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:53,883
You know.
A compromise.

606
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,137
A compromise?

607
01:01:56,172 --> 01:02:01,806
Well, that way not everybody
would have to look at it.

608
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:06,978
That's your solution
to everything, isn't it?

609
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:15,265
Move it to the back yard!
Don't have to look at it!

610
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:20,329
I don't know what Mark told you...
But we didn't throw him out of the house.

611
01:02:20,364 --> 01:02:24,987
- He ran away from home.
- Oh, Elisabeth...

612
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:30,079
You don't believe me?

613
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:42,957
I believe it's hard
being a minister's wife.

614
01:02:46,102 --> 01:02:52,855
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Chase after him?

615
01:02:55,735 --> 01:03:00,453
Nobobdy ever asked about him.

616
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:04,416
He lived here his whole life.
It's like he never existed.

617
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:08,596
Nobody ever asked about him.

618
01:03:08,631 --> 01:03:12,742
What would you say if they did?

619
01:03:12,777 --> 01:03:16,289
You don't ask about him.

620
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:20,633
I don't need to.

621
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:24,942
Where is he?

622
01:03:24,943 --> 01:03:29,204
He sent this to me.
Last summer.

623
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:34,876
We'd been in touch ever since.

624
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:41,510
This is where he is?
Uh, 'Cure' Beach.

625
01:03:41,545 --> 01:03:46,429
Ku-re.
He's been living there for a year.

626
01:03:47,613 --> 01:03:50,590
I thought you'd know.

627
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:56,032
He spent more time here growing
up than he ever did at home.

628
01:03:56,067 --> 01:04:00,444
You should go see him.

629
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:05,637
- Mark doesn't wanna see us.
- You NEED to.

630
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:09,781
SOON.

631
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:13,890
What?

632
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:19,520
What?!

633
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:24,288
He's ill.

634
01:04:39,515 --> 01:04:42,545
You knew this and you didn't tell me?

635
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,088
He asked me not to.

636
01:04:45,123 --> 01:04:52,387
- See? - He didn't want you
having to make a choice.

637
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,384
Go see him.

638
01:04:55,419 --> 01:04:59,552
- I can't.
- Of course, you can!

639
01:04:59,587 --> 01:05:03,686
- Robert won't.
- I'll go with you!

640
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:06,838
We can take my car. I've been
wanting to go a long time but

641
01:05:06,873 --> 01:05:11,328
I just can't drive
that far by myself!

642
01:05:14,321 --> 01:05:16,340
I have to go.

643
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:21,675
I have to go now.

644
01:05:36,626 --> 01:05:40,225
How can you live in a place like this?

645
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,480
What do you mean? Like opposed
to New York or San Francisco?

646
01:05:42,515 --> 01:05:44,498
Yeah.

647
01:05:44,533 --> 01:05:49,656
I just like it here.
I like knowing my neighbors.

648
01:05:50,626 --> 01:05:54,037
Yeah, but do they know you?

649
01:05:54,072 --> 01:05:58,328
They all know I'm gay.

650
01:06:06,418 --> 01:06:10,996
What about this guy?
Do they know about him?

651
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:13,323
That's Paul.

652
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,127
He's cute.

653
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:20,896
He was.

654
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:37,354
Was he... sick?

655
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:40,029
No.

656
01:06:40,504 --> 01:06:43,855
He drowned actually.

657
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,172
That's what they said.

658
01:06:47,207 --> 01:06:51,475
Kinda funny to me being he
was such a good swimmer, but...

659
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:56,857
They said he got caught
in a riptide or something.

660
01:06:56,858 --> 01:06:59,234
I'm sorry.

661
01:07:01,886 --> 01:07:06,999
- How long were you guys together?
- Almost seven years.

662
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:12,388
You know? How come no one
asks: why you were together?

663
01:07:12,423 --> 01:07:15,234
Everybody always says:
how long you were together?

664
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:18,559
As if it matters, you know?

665
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:24,820
My folks were together for 40
years now, and I still don't know why.

666
01:07:24,855 --> 01:07:29,524
Okay, why were you guys together?

667
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:33,942
Coz he made me laugh.

668
01:07:33,977 --> 01:07:38,614
Because he had this...
great voice...

669
01:07:38,649 --> 01:07:44,238
I loved his voice.

670
01:07:45,388 --> 01:07:50,896
And because I loved this place.
And he didn't.

671
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:55,206
We moved here, anyway.
And I thought it was this crazy idea.

672
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:59,665
He moved here for me.

673
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:05,241
Few years later
he loved it too.

674
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:10,337
Mom, you must think about him?

675
01:08:10,372 --> 01:08:12,868
Don't you know wonder
what happened to him?

676
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:15,020
We know what happened to him.

677
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:17,410
He was adopted by a family
that wanted him

678
01:08:17,445 --> 01:08:19,706
and could take care of him.

679
01:08:19,741 --> 01:08:23,355
- We could have kept him.
- You were seventeen!

680
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,969
- Oh yeah! With my whole life ahead of me.
- Yes.

681
01:08:27,004 --> 01:08:28,363
With the rest of your life ahead of you.

682
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:30,502
Do you know what happened
to girls in your situation?

683
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:33,115
Oh my God!
And my life is so perfect now?

684
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,484
Don't blame me for the
way your life turned out!

685
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:37,986
I'm not blaming you.

686
01:08:38,037 --> 01:08:43,216
I.. I just don't understand
why you want to do this.

687
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:47,470
It's not about a 'want'.
It's about a 'need'.

688
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:51,689
I need to know that he's okay.
That he was loved.

689
01:08:51,724 --> 01:08:56,806
What if he doesn't need to meet you?

690
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:00,376
Okay mom, I know you're ashamed
of me, but that doesn't mean...

691
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:05,507
- Don't be ridiculous!
- You are, you're ashamed of me.

692
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:12,178
You think this is going
to solve all your problems?

693
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:17,802
No, but it might keep me from
swallowing another bottle of pills.

694
01:09:17,837 --> 01:09:20,261
That was an accident.

695
01:09:20,296 --> 01:09:21,960
You know that's not true.

696
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,589
You said it was an accident.

697
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:26,843
You said you'd forgotten
how many you had taken.

698
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:33,158
- I never said that.
- That is what you said!

699
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:53,824
George?
It's me.

700
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:57,205
I'm fine.

701
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,697
How's he feelin' today?

702
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:05,771
Can I speak to him?

703
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:11,527
Hey honey!

704
01:10:11,562 --> 01:10:16,400
Listen, um, your mom
stopped by this afternoon.

705
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:21,873
I told her.

706
01:10:21,874 --> 01:10:27,312
You need to call her.

707
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:40,225
I like to thinking about...

708
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,804
...a turtle out there, just
foolin' around, you know?

709
01:10:45,839 --> 01:10:47,267
He's just doin' his thing.

710
01:10:48,426 --> 01:10:53,452
And one day he looks up and he sees another
turtle, a female, and they've never met...

711
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:56,856
They've never even seen each
other before, but there's that...

712
01:10:56,891 --> 01:10:59,348
...moment.
Of recognition,

713
01:10:59,383 --> 01:11:02,915
where they just know that...
that they're connected.

714
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:06,931
Something's going on.

715
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:11,608
It could happen.

716
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:16,230
It's a big ocean though.

717
01:11:19,936 --> 01:11:24,285
You ever thought about
tryin' to find them?

718
01:11:30,855 --> 01:11:35,630
Once when I was 18 years old
I wrote the adoption agency.

719
01:11:35,665 --> 01:11:37,789
They sent me some letter.

720
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:40,921
A bunch of bullshit
facts about my mom.

721
01:11:40,956 --> 01:11:43,283
Nothin' about my dad.

722
01:11:43,318 --> 01:11:46,156
What did it say?

723
01:11:46,191 --> 01:11:49,233
I don't even remember.

724
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:55,069
Hey!
Tell me.

725
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:10,528
It said my mom was 17
years old when she had me.

726
01:12:10,563 --> 01:12:16,426
It said that she was tall.
With blonde hair and blue eyes.

727
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:21,012
It said she was smart.

728
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:26,850
She made good grades, and she
was popular with her peers,

729
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:30,795
which I'm really tryin'
hard not to hold against her.

730
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:36,297
It said she was...
full of promise.

731
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:38,636
Whatever that means.

732
01:12:38,671 --> 01:12:43,479
I know what that means.
It means I take after my dad, I guess.

733
01:12:44,915 --> 01:12:48,923
I've heard of people finding
their birth parents.

734
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:53,368
It's not for me.

735
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:58,255
Why not?

736
01:13:11,044 --> 01:13:14,824
Because.

737
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:22,430
Because I wouldn't know what the
fuck to say when I walked up to her.

738
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:28,998
I mean if I ever...

739
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:36,659
If you were my mom,
would you want to meet me?

740
01:13:36,694 --> 01:13:40,576
Yeah...

741
01:14:14,481 --> 01:14:17,021
It's you.

742
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:20,928
I thought I forgot to turn off the lights.

743
01:14:20,963 --> 01:14:24,523
I'm sorry.
What time is it?

744
01:14:24,558 --> 01:14:27,110
It's late.

745
01:14:33,663 --> 01:14:36,482
Beth?

746
01:14:42,305 --> 01:14:46,383
He's sick.

747
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:52,450
How do you know?

748
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:55,780
Ruth.

749
01:15:07,112 --> 01:15:11,453
Is it AID's?

750
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:15,407
It doesn't matter.

751
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:33,416
God punishes.

752
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:43,749
Yes he does.

753
01:15:43,784 --> 01:15:47,479
And right now,
he's punishing me.

754
01:15:47,514 --> 01:15:49,328
Beth, you didn't do anything.

755
01:15:49,363 --> 01:15:53,082
Mark ran away from God.

756
01:15:53,117 --> 01:15:54,447
No.

757
01:15:54,482 --> 01:15:59,098
He ran away from us.

758
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:03,715
And we let him go.

759
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:13,156
Mark made his choice.

760
01:16:18,498 --> 01:16:23,365
I guess it's true what they
say about preacher's kids.

761
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,454
No. Not at all.
I was a good kid.

762
01:16:26,489 --> 01:16:29,250
I was a great kid.
In fact, I made good grades,

763
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:32,243
I had good manners,
I was never in any trouble!

764
01:16:32,278 --> 01:16:35,494
- Oh really?
- No.

765
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:36,893
God!

766
01:16:36,928 --> 01:16:39,574
I think the farthest was
when I came home when my mom

767
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:41,941
caught me and
my best friend Sam

768
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:44,721
back in the church
we were 16 years old.

769
01:16:44,756 --> 01:16:45,947
- C'mon!
- No.

770
01:16:45,982 --> 01:16:50,262
She walked right in on us.
Not... not good!

771
01:16:50,297 --> 01:16:54,543
Isn't that like a mortal sin
or something?

772
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:02,377
We were just kids.

773
01:17:02,412 --> 01:17:06,723
We were just kissing.

774
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:09,966
I begged her not to tell my dad and...

775
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,925
Of course, that was
the first thing she did.

776
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,880
And he just...

777
01:17:14,915 --> 01:17:17,410
...started yelling.

778
01:17:17,445 --> 01:17:20,428
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Telling me I was going to burn in Hell.

779
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:23,184
How I'd ruined the family.

780
01:17:24,521 --> 01:17:26,531
I don't think he even believed
half of what he was saying.

781
01:17:26,566 --> 01:17:28,379
He was just...

782
01:17:28,414 --> 01:17:30,192
...yelling.

783
01:17:31,132 --> 01:17:34,663
Didn't they kick you out?

784
01:17:34,698 --> 01:17:38,046
No.

785
01:17:38,081 --> 01:17:41,820
I beat 'em to it.

786
01:17:46,157 --> 01:17:48,091
Grace?

787
01:17:49,046 --> 01:17:51,769
I'm not ashamed of you.

788
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:55,356
I've never been ashamed of you.
Ever!

789
01:17:56,234 --> 01:18:00,046
You probably don't believe me,
but it's true.

790
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:07,068
You're my daughter
and I love you.

791
01:18:15,907 --> 01:18:22,440
Yes, of course I think about him.
He's my grandson.

792
01:18:28,512 --> 01:18:31,486
What are you going to tell him
when he asks?

793
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:35,837
Why you gave him away?

794
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:43,229
The truth.

795
01:18:45,301 --> 01:18:50,857
I was only doing what I
thought was best for everybody.

796
01:18:51,464 --> 01:18:55,960
Then, that's what we'll say.

797
01:19:21,652 --> 01:19:23,485
You coming?

798
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,952
Yes.

799
01:19:51,702 --> 01:19:56,123
Hi. Can I please speak with Grace?

800
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,344
Get up.

801
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:03,909
- What?
- It's Rachel.

802
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:05,533
Hello?

803
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:08,694
Hi Grace. I'm sorry to call
so early in the morning.

804
01:20:08,729 --> 01:20:10,811
Um, I just wanted to let you know
that I... I...

805
01:20:10,846 --> 01:20:13,015
...was able to do a search last night.
And I...

806
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,149
I have some information
for you about your son.

807
01:20:15,184 --> 01:20:19,950
- She found him!
- No, I didn't find him... uh... I.. I...

808
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:24,458
What I learned was um...

809
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:28,441
...not such good news... um...

810
01:20:28,476 --> 01:20:33,664
Unfortunately...

811
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:38,852
What... What I learned is...

812
01:20:41,302 --> 01:20:42,604
He's...

813
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:46,382
He died.

814
01:20:47,854 --> 01:20:49,479
What?

815
01:20:49,514 --> 01:20:52,465
What is it?

816
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,982
...your bright and shining face.
Good morning to you.

817
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,264
- Good morning. Good morning to you.
Good to see you.

818
01:20:57,299 --> 01:20:59,872
Hi! How are you Carol?
Nice to see you.

819
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:03,715
Good morning, how are you?
Those pearls look very nice.

820
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,101
Good morning.
Good morning.

821
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,469
Hi. How are you?
You're welcome. Welcome to...

822
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:10,910
Good morning. Good morning.
And a happy Mother's Day to you!

823
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,737
Hey Billy-Ray.

824
01:21:24,772 --> 01:21:26,428
- God bless you.
- Good to see you buddy.

825
01:21:26,463 --> 01:21:28,084
Hi, how are you?
So nice to see you today.

826
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:30,292
You're looking very nice.

827
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:38,097
He called.

828
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:42,669
Good Morning.

829
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:49,129
- Morning.
- Morning.

830
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:53,367
I'm sorry Beth.

831
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:59,550
I can't.

832
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:06,765
Good morning.

833
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:13,309
Good to see so many of you
here on this Mother's Day.

834
01:22:13,344 --> 01:22:19,818
Our scriptural reading today
is from the book of Ruth.

835
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:24,436
It's a verse about love.

836
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:30,714
that has come to be associated
with love between a man and a woman.

837
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:36,946
But it's actually a pledge
from one woman, Ruth.

838
01:22:36,981 --> 01:22:39,647
To another, Naomi.

839
01:22:39,682 --> 01:22:42,279
Her mother-in-law.

840
01:22:42,314 --> 01:22:48,341
As Elisabeth pointed out to me,
it's a verse that we used

841
01:22:48,376 --> 01:22:51,807
on our wedding day.
So many years ago.

842
01:22:53,964 --> 01:22:58,558
It's a verse that I used in
this church to marry many of you.

843
01:22:58,593 --> 01:23:03,904
Looking out, I see some
of you sitting here today.

844
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:09,215
Some of you...
for the first time, in a long time.

845
01:23:10,094 --> 01:23:13,412
It's good to have you home.

846
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:23,207
Let us...
Let us go to the word of God

847
01:23:23,242 --> 01:23:27,331
for guidance and inspiration.

848
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:31,275
Where you go,
I will go.

849
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:35,067
Where you lodge,
I will lodge.

850
01:23:35,102 --> 01:23:38,824
Your people,
shall be my people.

851
01:23:38,859 --> 01:23:42,742
And your God,
my God.

852
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:49,408
Where you die,
I will die.

853
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:54,899
And there,
will I be buried.

854
01:24:10,418 --> 01:24:13,946
You should call them.

855
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:19,893
What would I say?

856
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:29,675
They've lost their son.
You'll know what to say.

857
01:25:05,596 --> 01:25:09,050
We are swimming
with the snakes

858
01:25:09,085 --> 01:25:12,743
At the bottom
of the well

859
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:26,536
So silent and peaceful in
the darkness where we fell

860
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:35,498
But we are not snakes
and what's more

861
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:38,837
We never will be

862
01:25:45,288 --> 01:25:48,614
And if we stay swimming
here forever we will

863
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:53,022
Never be free

864
01:25:57,566 --> 01:26:00,892
I heard them ringing
the bells

865
01:26:00,927 --> 01:26:04,260
In heaven and hell

866
01:26:04,295 --> 01:26:07,480
They got a secret

867
01:26:07,515 --> 01:26:10,487
They're getting ready to tell

868
01:26:10,522 --> 01:26:14,490
It's falling from the sky

869
01:26:14,525 --> 01:26:18,458
It's calling from the graves

870
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:30,469
Open your eyes, boy,
I think we are saved

871
01:26:30,504 --> 01:26:33,575
Let's take a walk
on the bridge

872
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,662
Right over this mess

873
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:39,997
Tell me to tell me a thing, baby

874
01:26:40,032 --> 01:26:42,720
We've already confessed

875
01:26:42,755 --> 01:26:47,277
And I raised my voice
to the air

876
01:26:47,312 --> 01:26:50,967
And we were blessed

877
01:26:52,484 --> 01:26:55,572
It's hard to give

878
01:26:55,607 --> 01:26:58,626
It's hard to get

879
01:26:58,661 --> 01:27:03,956
It's hard to live baby still
I think it's the best bet

880
01:27:03,991 --> 01:27:11,196
Hey it's hard to give
and I'm never gonna forget

881
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:24,750
But everybody needs a
little forgiveness

882
01:27:37,235 --> 01:27:41,091
Everywhere I go I see
these guys and...

883
01:27:41,126 --> 01:27:44,777
every year they get
a little bit older.

884
01:27:44,812 --> 01:27:49,515
You know, I only held him
for a little while, but...

885
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:55,268
I just believed that if I could look
directly into his eyes I'd recognize him.

886
01:27:55,303 --> 01:28:00,038
Not long before Mark died,
we talked about you.

887
01:28:00,073 --> 01:28:03,842
I was never able to do that before.

888
01:28:03,877 --> 01:28:07,577
You were always
my worst nightmare.

889
01:28:07,612 --> 01:28:11,398
You're not the first person
to tell me that.

890
01:28:11,433 --> 01:28:14,896
I was so afraid that Mark
would want to find you and...

891
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:19,455
...if he found you he
would love you more than me.

892
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:22,414
Well no, you're his mother.

893
01:28:22,449 --> 01:28:25,260
We both are.

894
01:28:25,295 --> 01:28:28,072
Thank you.

895
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:33,239
Do you have any more children?

896
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:38,341
No. Just never thought
it would be right... after...

897
01:28:38,376 --> 01:28:42,217
I don't know why we
couldn't have children. I...

898
01:28:42,252 --> 01:28:46,024
I used to think it was my fault.
And then...

899
01:28:46,059 --> 01:28:50,734
For awhile, I even thought
maybe we were doing it wrong.

900
01:28:54,627 --> 01:28:59,351
I want to thank you for meeting me.

901
01:28:59,386 --> 01:29:04,076
I know not everybody would, so...

902
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,735
Well, I almost didn't.

903
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:11,867
What made you change your mind?

904
01:29:11,902 --> 01:29:15,732
Well, I thought about
how lucky I've been...

905
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:18,444
You gave me the chance
to be a mother.

906
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,938
So when you called, I realised
that this could be my chance

907
01:29:22,973 --> 01:29:29,973
to find a way
to give him back to you.

908
01:30:15,854 --> 01:30:20,821
He saved them?

909
01:30:22,434 --> 01:30:23,707
Yeah.

910
01:30:23,742 --> 01:30:30,781
Some of them.

911
01:30:31,781 --> 01:30:41,781
