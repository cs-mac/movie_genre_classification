tell everyone your name.

- Cherry Dee.

- Yes.

right?

swallow it, right?

tell me your name.

- Cherry Dee.

27
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:20,377
- No, not your porn name,
your everyday name.

28
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:21,852
- I don't want to say
my real name.

- Why not?

30
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:27,155
- Because it's none
of anybody's business.

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,990
- So you won't mind
if I call you whore?

- No.

33
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,024
- Are you scared
Mom and Dad are gonna find out

34
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:36,693
their baby girl, Cherry Dee,
is a whore?

- No.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,771
- You were expecting that,
right?

37
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,968
- No.

00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,739

"Hi, Mom. "

That's good.
It's good.

46
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:08,490
You're being honest now.

47
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:12,129
That's all right,
'cause I've broken you.

48
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:17,800
I see so many Cherry Dees,
and you know what I've learned?

00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:20,709
You all like it like this.

Right?

00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:25,317
Right, whore?

52
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:27,443
- Yeah.

53
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:28,714
- So get on the couch.

54
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:29,754
It's okay.

55
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:33,087
Get on the couch.

56
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:36,754
Get on the couch and spread.

- I smell cum.

64

- Dave, you do the math?

65
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,963
- No, I'm gonna do it tomorrow.

66
00:04:57,477 --> 00:05:00,674
- Thanks.

67
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,042
You know, Nick,
the senior,

68
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,775
his dimes are, like,
twice the size.

69
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,714
- Yeah, well, if you want to
smoke some swaggy shit,

70
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,720
then go to Nick,

71
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:10,915
but I can just sell that to
some other freshman, you know?

72
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,685
- No, it's cool.
- All right.

73
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,761
And if you need me
to pick anything else up,

74
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,523
just tell me,
and next time I go to the city,

75
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:19,861
I'll pick it up for you,
all right?

76
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:28,300
- Where were you guys?

77
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:30,399
- We were with the Talberts.

78
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,068
- Again?

79
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,668
- We cut practice
to chill with them.

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,111
Nothing happened, though.

81
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,842
- I really can't tell
the difference

82
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,383
between the two of them,
can you?

83
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,385
- Nope.

84
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:45,454
- Rob, you don't even play
any sports, do you?

85
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:46,786
- No.

86
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,885
- Jesus Christ,
you're a pussy.

87
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:50,963

- [snickering]

89
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,528
- No, get the fuck
out of our room.

90
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,002
- You guys seen this clip yet?

91
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,511
- Which one?

92
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,014

Where is that?

96
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,592
- I don't know.

97
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,861
Some school somewhere.

98
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,004
- Jesus.

99
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,510
Look at that.

- Wake up, Dave.

105
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:20,878
You're gonna be late
for morning meeting.

- [laughing]

108
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:51,469
Let's quiet down because
there's a lot of announcements

109
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,375
to make this morning,
and pay attention.

110
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,810
There might be
a little note in here

111
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,108
that could change your lives,

112
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:58,684
maybe an activity
you never knew of

113
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:00,878
that'll turn out to be
your calling later in life,

114
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,420
your career,

115
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:06,481
and from one little announcement
you heard in morning meeting.

116
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:08,561
Good morning.

117
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:12,358
Miss Jameson,
did you sleep all right?

118
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,092
You just missed
a little inspiring speech

119
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,132
on announcements,

120
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,169
about you possibly
being inspired

121
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,137
to try something that will
ultimately be your future,

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,901
but I wouldn't worry.

123
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,999
McDonald's will most likely
still be hiring

124
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,577
after you graduate.

125
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:26,736
Ha, ha, ha, okay.

126
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:27,778
Enough fun.

127
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,246
I have Mr. Anderson here

128
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,714
with a note on
clubs and activities.

129
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,877
Remember, everyone
needs to do one activity,

130
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:37,582
either a sport
or afterschool club.

131
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,918
Failure to do so

132
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,585
will result in a markdown
on your report cards.

133
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,924
Okay.
Mr. Anderson.

Robert, do you know
the answer to number four?

00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:02,204
- Hamlet's gonna have
the actors, um...

re-enact the murder
in front of his stepfather?

- Right, right.
That's right, Robert.

163
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:11,741
He's gonna play out the play

164
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,843
and have his stepfather
watch his own crime,

165
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,888
and, hopefully, his guilt

166
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,517
will drive a confession
out of him.

167

Right?
"The play's the thing,

168
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:24,995
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king. "

169
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,647
- Fuck.

170
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:48,812
- Dude, we're late.
Come on.

171
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,513
- One second.

172
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:01,929
- Hurry up; hurry up.
Let's go.

173
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:10,632
Are you done?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,904
All right, just wait a second
before you come in.

175
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,546
- Here come your coke whores.

176
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,747
- See you after lunch.

177
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,732
- How does Dave know them?

178
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,233
- The Talberts?

179
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,667
I don't know, actually.

180
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:51,847
- Oh, shit.

181
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,215
I still haven't signed up
for afterschool activities.

182
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
Is it two weeks or three weeks

183
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,385
until they start
taking points off?

184
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,288
- I don't know.

185
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:02,020
- Do you have to bring
your freshman friends

186
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,891
when you come here?

187
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,897
- Shut up.
He's not doing anything.

188
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,661
- Yeah, shut up.

189
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,296
- I think it's only two weeks,
so next week...

190
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:15,840
- I can kick your ass.

191
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:32,023
- Isn't your sister Maria
the senior?

192
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,524
- I don't know.

193
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,356
- You know
I fucked your sister.

194
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,397
- Does she know that?

195
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:43,162
- Her pussy's so wet.

196
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,102
Did you know your sister's pussy
gets so wet?

197
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:53,006
All you got to do
is brush up against it.

198
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,477
You know, your sister gives
mad good head, right?

199
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:07,356
Gets the whole thing
down her throat.

200
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,520
Last time,
when she was sucking on my dick,

201
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,031
it only took me, like, a minute
before I came all over her face.

202
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:21,835
I bet you jerked off
to pictures of your sister, huh?

203
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,472
Next time we do it,
I'll find you.

204
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,138
I'll let you smell my fingers.

205
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,741
[laughs]

206
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,181
- What have you been
thinking about doing?

207
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,782
- Oh, uh...

208
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:16,327
I think I'm gonna do video.

209
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,862
- Yeah, me too.

210
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,329
- I don't really want
to play sports,

211
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:22,595
and I kind of want to do
something creative, I guess.

212
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,468
- Yeah.

213
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,214
Hey, Mom.

214
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:41,047
- Hey, honey,
what are you doing?

215
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,350
- I'm just waiting
for lunch to be over.

216
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,322
- How's school?

217
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,689
- It's all right.

218
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:55,392
I don't think
anyone likes me here, Mom.

219
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:56,433
- Oh, stop.

220
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,366
Why do you say that?

221
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,529
Everyone loves you.

222
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,266
Don't say stupid things
like that.

223
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,538
- No, I just
get this sense that...

224
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,875
I don't know,
that I'm not, like, really too-

225
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,447
- It's been two years already.

226
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,016
Why are you still saying that?

227
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,016
What about Dave?

228
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,950
Dave's your roommate, right?

229
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:19,047
- Yeah, no, not Dave,
I mean, really.

230
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:23,618
I just get this sense
from people, even Dave-

231
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,357
- Robert, you're
being ridiculous, come on.

232
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,592
Let's talk about
something pleasant.

233
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,396
Are you liking
your new teachers?

234
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:31,561
Are classes good?

235
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,763
- Yeah.
Stop, though.

236
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:34,863
Listen.

237
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,474
I think I'm not a good person.

238
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:43,844
- Stop it.
You're a great person.

239
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,713
Is that guidance counselor
still the same from last year?

240
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,016
- Yeah, yeah, Mr. Virgil.

241
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,022
- Okay.

242
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,421
Why don't you talk to him?

243
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,585
He seemed really nice.

244
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,729
We could always do medication.

245
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,960
- No, Mom,
I don't want to do meds.

246
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,696
- I don't want you to either.

247
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:08,331
I think it's a horrible idea,
but what else is there to do?

248
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,137
I don't like
to hear you like this, Rob.

249
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,141
I love you, honey.

250
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:13,973
Please...

251
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,843
tell me you're okay, please.

252
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,007
I have enough
to worry about at work.

253
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:21,450
Please don't make me worry
about you all the way up there.

254
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,819
- No, I'm okay.

255
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:29,384
- Okay.

256
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:30,427
We love you.

257
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:31,518
- Mm-hmm.

258
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,963
Love you too.

259
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,797
All right, bye.

260
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:41,834
What's up, man?
Sorry about that.

261
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,670
- It's all right.

262
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:46,768
- Are you going?
- Yeah, let's go.

263
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,248
Just relax, it's gonna be
another five minutes, okay?

264
00:17:58,357 --> 00:17:59,289
- I'm gonna be late, man.

265
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:02,452
- All right.

266
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:04,222
Just tell her you're
in the nurse's office.

267
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,025
- They know
I'm not on meds, though.

268
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:07,497
- Then tell her
you're with a friend.

269
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,625
Just chill out, okay?

270
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,735
- How much coke
did you do with them?

271
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:20,209
- Just a couple bumps,
not too much.

272
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,609
- Are they paying for it?

273
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:25,775
- No, they just-
they just do it for fun.

274
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,251
Besides, they usually buy
their own shit, you know?

275
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,015
- Oh.

276
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:35,555
- Hey, David Wilson.
- Here you go. How are you?

277
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:36,753
- Thank you.
Good. How are you?

278
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:37,988
- Good, thanks.
Have a good day.

279
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,964
- You too.

280
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,465
- Anyone else?

281
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:43,500
You're all set?

282
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,433
Okay.

283
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:54,840
- Hey, Dave, hang on a second.
- Hey, Mr. Virgil.

284
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:58,007
Fuck.

285
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,584
- Hey, buddy.

286
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,084
You missed
our last two sessions.

287
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,677
Next time, I'm gonna
call your mom, man.

288
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:03,982
- Yeah, I know.

289
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,522
I had to go to practice early.

290
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:06,648
- Yeah, whatever.

291
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,090
Our talks
are more important, huh?

292
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,218
- Yeah.

293
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:10,727
- Oh, yeah, and have
your mom call me.

294
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,627
I haven't seen her
since last night.

295
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:20,331
- Then I'm gonna put together
five different crews,

296
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,100
and we'll figure out
how that goes.

297
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:27,771
The first crew will be dedicated
to interviewing teachers.

298
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,748
That'll be
John and Michelle.

299
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,617
Crew number two,
that'll be what we call B-roll.

300
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,154
That's establishing shots.

301
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:40,384
So we'll be doing visuals
of the classrooms

302
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,291
and the corridors,
the cafeteria,

303
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:47,297
et cetera,
et cetera.

304
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:51,460
Rob, what's going on
back there?

305
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,405
Come on, Rob,
what's going on?

306
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:01,105
- Rob wants to use the video
to make a porn.

307
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,544
[laughs]

308
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,047
- Well, that's, uh...

309
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,446
That's a very nice idea,

310
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,951
but there will be no fluids
permitted around the camera,

311
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,281
bodily or any other sort.

312
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,219
[laughter]

313
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:14,952
- Okay, crew number two.

314
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,692
How about Rob and Amy?

315
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,360
Crew number three.

316
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,527
- You got $30?

317
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,802
- Oh, no.
I thought it was only $20.

318
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,137
- All right,
I'll-I'll take it.

319
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:32,471
Just give me the rest later,
okay?

320
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:35,046
- Thanks, man.

321
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,547
- See you later.
- See you, man.

322
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,662
- Dude, how much
are you spending?

323
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:58,100
- Not much more than usual.

324
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,763
- Why can't you just wait
till next weekend to go back?

325
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,637
- 'Cause I'm really low, man.

326
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,937
Hey, can you send me
the Bio answers?

327
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,880
- Yeah, sure.

328
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,518
So, listen...

329
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,860
Maybe the next time
you chill with the Talberts,

330
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,695
I'll meet up with you guys.

331
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,235
- What do you mean?
You don't do coke.

332
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,828
- Yeah, but...

333
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,373
neither does Trevor.

334
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,069
- Did you get it?

335
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,114
- Yeah, hold on,
I'm sending it.

336
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,415
- I don't know.

337
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,580
They're weird.

338
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,327
- Whatever, Dave.

339
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:03,890
- Yes, I'm not introducing you
to them on purpose.

340
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,096
You're not cool enough, man.

341
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,366
- I don't know.

342
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,741
- What are you filming?

343
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,046
- You.

344
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,027
Think that's good?

345
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:48,834
- Yeah, I think that's
all we need, probably.

346
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:50,135
- Okay.

347
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:53,143
[playing gentle piano music]

348
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:04,715
- Do you play the piano?

349
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,814
- Not really.

350
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:11,890
- Sounds like you do.

351
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:15,023
- We used to always have one
in the house.

352
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:18,695
I used to fuck around on it.

353
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,965
I think my dad
really wanted me to.

354
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:27,337
- I don't play anything.

355
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:29,380
- Yeah?

356
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,006
- Well, in the third grade,
I played the recorder,

357
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:36,076
but, like, every class
had to do that.

358
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,553
- Yeah, I think
we had that too.

359
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:38,588
- I wasn't even good at it.

360
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,682
[laughs]

361
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:36,813
Have you ever had sex?

362
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,315
- What?

363
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:47,785
No.

364
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,691
- Dave told me you didn't,

365
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,427
but I didn't really
believe him.

366
00:25:56,535 --> 00:26:00,665
- What did Dave say?

367
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:01,704
- Nothing really.

368
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,172
I was just talking,
and I asked.

369
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,937
He said you hadn't done much.

370
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:10,978
- Dave's an asshole.

371
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,644
I've done more than him.

372
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:18,154
- Well, Dave's not a virgin.

373
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:20,555
- Don't make fun of me.

374
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,825
- I wasn't.

375
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,963
- How about you?

376
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:40,340
Are you a virgin?

377
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,936
- Yeah.

378
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:46,040
But I can have sex
whenever I want.

379
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,551
I just haven't wanted to yet.

380
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:55,821
- Guess that's pretty convenient
for you.

381
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:58,522
- Well, it's easy for girls.

382
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,291
You know, it's really not hard
to get-

383
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:03,027
to be able to have sex
with any guy,

384
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:06,536
whenever, whoever.

385
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:14,209
So what have you done?

386
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:18,079
- I guess, like,
everything but.

387
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:20,344
- So you've had a blowjob?

388
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:22,079
- Yeah.

389
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,850
- Like, a lot?

390
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,893
- What's a lot?

391
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:32,122
- Well, I wouldn't know, like...

392
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,529
10 times, 15 times.

393
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,728
- I guess, like,
something like 10.

394
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:41,397
- Oh.

395
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:44,100
Cool.

396
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:58,145
[laughs]

397
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:28,312
Are you trying
to strangle me to death?

398
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,584
What are you doing?

399
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:35,785
You're weird.

400
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:37,452
- Hmm.

401
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:38,893
- Hey, Mr. Burke.

402
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,522
[laughs]

403
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,133
There are the Talberts.

404
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:51,800
- What do you think?

405
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,537
- Get closer.

406
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:57,172
- Like this?
- Is that Dave? Yeah.

407
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,807
Hi, Dave.

408
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,794
- Everybody be
on your best behavior.

409
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:13,490
This is being videotaped.

410
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,532
all: Hi!

411
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:19,661
- Okay, enough fun.
Quiet!

412
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,137
Good.
All right.

413
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,299
Our very own Tigers
will be playing

414
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:25,535
Algonquin this Wednesday...

415
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:26,633
- [hiccups]
Excuse me.

416
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,270
- ... At their field it seems.

417
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,643
A little piece of history.

418
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:32,148
This will be the 72nd meeting

419
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,615
between the Warriors
and the Tigers

420
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:36,414
since the league was established
81 years ago,

421
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,182
and although our Tigers
have maintained-

422
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,190
- Camilla, Jess...

423
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,816
Ugh.

424
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:42,825
Audrey.

425
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:45,897
[applause]

426
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,294
There are the Talberts again.

427
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,026
- The majority of our losses
have occurred

428
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,328
on their home turf,

429
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,164
so if you finished
your studies this weekend,

430
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,261
please come out to support
your brother Tigers.

431
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:55,964
For all of you sloths,

432
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:59,373
the spirit bus leaves promptly
at 10:00 a. m. Saturday morning.

433
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,912
Also, stragglers...

434
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:03,981
- Do you want to do
those hallway shots or should I?

435
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:07,176
- Um, you do it.

436
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,651
- Can I get that note
to get out of class?

437
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:11,915
- Yep.

438
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:16,860
Hi, Dave.

439
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,909
[dull thuds]

440
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:55,952

00:32:54,953 --> 00:32:57,945
[strained breathing]

[breathing stops]

450
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:49,732
- Go to the office!

451
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:52,332
Have them call 911!

452
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,846
Oh, my God.

453
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:03,682
Oh, my God,
Robert, what happened?

454
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:05,050
Oh, my God, Mary.

455
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:06,316
Mary, open your eyes!

456
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,016
Are you-are they breathing?

457
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,651
Mary!
Oh, God!

458
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:14,863
Someone get help, okay?

459
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,593
Please go to the office.

460
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:17,668
Someone call 911.

461
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:19,964
We need to call a paramedic,
please!

462
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:21,368
Rob, what happened?

463
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:22,872
What happened to them?

464
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:24,407
Mary, can you hear me?

465
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:25,840
Can you hear me?

466
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,411
Open your eyes.
Can you see me?

467
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:29,070
- What's going on here?
- What's going on?

468
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,943
- I don't know.
- Okay, fine.

469
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:32,311
- Find out what happened.

470
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,975
- What's going on?
What happened?

471
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,245
- We're at Bryton Academy.

472
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,014
- What happened?
You're filled with blood.

473
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:38,953
What's going on, Robert?
- Second floor hallway.

474
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:40,752
- Robert, can you stand up?
Robert, look at me.

475
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,258
- Tell them that there's
a lot of blood

476
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,327
and they're not breathing!

477
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:44,690
They're not breathing.

478
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:48,892
- There's two here that
seem to be out completely.

479
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,228
Mary and Anne Talbert.

480
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,667
All right, everybody-everybody
needs to clear the area!

481
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:56,207
Back to the classrooms.
Come on, back in classrooms!

482
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:57,239
Come on.

483
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:58,934
- What was that?

484
00:34:59,043 --> 00:34:59,975
They're 18 years old.

485
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:02,638
- Come on, you guys,
get back!

486
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:03,714
All right, come on, Mary.

487
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:06,875
[voices overlapping]

488
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:10,780
- This way.
Follow me, please.

489
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,117
Amy, come on.
Come this way.

490
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:14,384
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

491
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:15,584
Excuse me.

492
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:19,322
- Go right upstairs, right now.
Go upstairs.

493
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:22,400
- Okay, come on.
Get back now.

494
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,398
Back. Go back.

495
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,732
Come on, back up.
Make room.

496
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:30,672
[voices overlapping]

497
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:33,676
Come on.
All the way back.

498
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:36,770
[voices overlapping]

499
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:45,084
[silence]

500
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:55,497
- Go back.

501
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,592
Go back.

502
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:17,310
- Were you with the girls
anytime before...

503
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:22,018
what we just saw?

504
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:25,823
- No.

505
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,560
- Why were you filming
in that hallway?

506
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:33,102
- My teacher told me to.

507
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,503
- We just started
an audio-video club here.

508
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:43,269
- Were you friends
with Anne or Mary?

509
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:51,081
- No.

510
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:54,124
- Did you know anyone
who knew them?

511
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,829
- No.

512
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,195
- Anne and Mary
were very popular seniors.

513
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,167
Rob is only in the tenth grade.

514
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,707
There's not much interaction
between sophomores and seniors.

515
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,934
- Yeah, I get it.

516
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,273
I used to be a kid too.

517
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:18,613
Why did you walk over
to the girls

518
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:22,413
instead of calling for help?

519
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:29,786
- I didn't know
what was happening.

520
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:35,196
- And once you realized
that something was wrong...

521
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,861
why didn't you go
and get a teacher?

522
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,468
Rob?

523
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:48,239
- I don't remember.

524
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:51,144
- Have you ever tried cocaine?

525
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,578
- No.

526
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:13,727
- It's hard, huh?

527
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,408
It's very...

528
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,755
Okay, Mr. Williams,
is there anything else

529
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:34,848
you'd like to say?

530
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,390
- Rob, I know how hard
this is for you.

531
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,872
This is going to be
very difficult times

532
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:54,468
for a while for everyone.

533
00:38:54,579 --> 00:39:00,017
But the most important thing,
I think...

534
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:03,349
is for us...

535
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:08,391
to be strong together.

536
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:10,723
- Mr. Williams is right.

537
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:18,561
- Rob, have you been
seeing Mr. Virgil?

538
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,836
- No.

539
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,931
- I really think you should.

540
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,840
I think we're going to encourage
everyone here

541
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,936
to start going to see him.

542
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,413
It's important
that no one be afraid

543
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:35,612
to talk at a time like this.

544
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,917
Rob, if you want to go home
for a little bit,

545
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:40,081
we would understand.

546
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:43,058
- Mm-mm.
No.

547
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:46,494
I'm okay.

548
00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:48,656
- Okay, I'm done.

549
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,256
You can go.

550
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,531
- Be strong, buddy.

551
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:04,273
Our kids are good kids.

552
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:09,376
Rob's a bit confused
but is harmless.

553
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,518
- I'm ready for the next one.

554
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:19,619
[voices overlapping]

555
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,464
- Hey, Mom.

556
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:03,739
Yeah, I'm okay.

557
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,480
They're questioning everybody.

558
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:20,021
Just to see who knew the girls.

559
00:41:26,697 --> 00:41:30,155
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

560
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:39,035
No, don't.

561
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:43,175
It's fine for me.

562
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,250
I want to stay up here.

563
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:44,300
- # All through the night #

564
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:49,141
# While the weary world
is sleeping #

565
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:52,808
# All through the night #

566
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,077
- This is so sad.

567
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:58,383
- # O'er thy spirit
gently stealing #

568
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:02,789
# Visions of delight
revealing #

569
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:07,297
# Breathes a pure
and holy feeling #

570
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:11,892
# All through the night #

571
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:16,497
# Though I roam
a minstrel lonely #

572
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,873
# All through the night #

573
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:24,539
# My true harp shall praise #

574
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:26,173
- It's hard to be up here
at a time like this

575
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:28,081
and to have to speak to you
like I usually do,

576
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:31,985
but I will because I have to.

577
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:34,557
The police have determined
that the illegal substances

578
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:36,650
that killed Anne and Mary
that day

579
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:39,559
were not purchased
in the school.

580
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:42,462
They were bought while the girls
were away for the weekend

581
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:45,399
and only used that morning.

582
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:49,999
How can we know this?

583
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:52,098
We are confident
this is the case,

584
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:53,870
because not two days ago,

585
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:56,446
a similar unfortunate
accident occurred

586
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:59,607
with a young boy in the city.

587
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,217
An examination revealed
that what killed the girls

588
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:09,953
was a lethal combination

589
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:12,757
of narcotics
and poisonous agents,

590
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:16,594
one of which was rat poison.

591
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:21,604
Now, what is important
to remember is first...

592
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:24,174
who these girls were.

593
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:28,541
They were beautiful
and full of life.

594
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,547
They were victims
of bad judgment,

595
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:34,140
of misguided energy,

596
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:36,185
of the threats that face youth.

597
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:42,692
They made a mistake
and paid dearly for it.

598
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:48,857
I have been in touch with
the parents of Anne and Mary.

599
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:51,059
They send their love and thanks
for everyone's cards

600
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:52,100
and warm wishes.

601
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:53,295
It has been a comfort to them

602
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:56,862
to know that their girls
were so loved here.

603
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:58,874
The only thing
that they can hope for now

604
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:00,534
is that what happened
to Anne and Mary

605
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:03,875
will never happen again
to any other student here.

606
00:45:06,684 --> 00:45:10,745
We wanted to give each and every
one of you a chance to...

607
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,255
say something about the girls
or to them

608
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:14,346
and to do so now.

609
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,586
So anyone-
there's no pressure-

610
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,095
please form a line
to the left of the podium

611
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:24,861
and one by one come up here.

612
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:28,632
Anne and Mary,
we will miss you.

613
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:42,210
- Anne and Mary,

614
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,882
things'll never be the same
without you.

615
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:51,519
Life will never be the same.

616
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:55,998
You'll be in my heart,
in all our hearts, forever.

617
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:12,713
- I'm so sorry
that this happened

618
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:17,379
and that we didn't
get to know each other better.

619
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:20,514
But you will be missed.

620
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:29,161
- I wrote a little something
about the girls.

621
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:32,565
"As a constant reminder
of our love

622
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,138
"and their indomitable spirit,

623
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,573
"the Talbert girls
will always thrive in our souls,

624
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:41,611
miraculously human. "

625
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:48,208
- Okay, I talked to Mr. Wiseman,
and, uh...

626
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,279
he's planning on
working on a memorial video

627
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,985
for the twins, you know,
for the school.

628
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:00,655
You like video, right?

629
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:01,924
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:03,966
Do you-do you think
it would be a good idea

631
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:07,868
for you to work on that?

632
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:10,702
- Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

633
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:15,177
- All right, great.
Good.

634
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:19,010
Well, we'll call this
a short meeting and...

635
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:22,051
my office is always open
anytime you want to come by.

636
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:23,677
Okay?

637
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:29,592
And I'd like you to come by
maybe a couple times a week,

638
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:31,160
all right?

639
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,457
- All right, sure.

640
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:35,896
- Okay.

641
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,574
- Does it matter what order,
Mr. Wiseman?

642
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,378
- Oh, no, no.

643
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:56,009
Just leave them there
for a few seconds,

644
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,749
and then we'll figure out
how to use them later.

645
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:02,758
- So these are
from when they were babies.

646
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:08,827
Now, when we finish up
with this,

647
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:14,030
we'll get back
to the video tour.

648
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:15,070
Yeah.

649
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:16,969
That's good.

650
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:20,100
Right, yeah, move in a little.

651
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,270
Great.

652
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,017
- Mr. Wiseman,
can I be excused for a second?

653
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:29,415
- Oh, sure.

654
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,580
Sure, Amy, I understand.

655
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,954
- Casey, why don't you fill in?

656
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,151
- Yeah.

657
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,423
- And anybody else
who feels like leaving.

658
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,191
How are you doing, Rob?

659
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,027
- I'm okay.

660
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:48,335
They're really cute.

661
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:52,299
- Okay, next one.

662
00:48:57,982 --> 00:49:00,246
Mr. Burke,
Mr. and Mrs. Talbert are here,

663
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:02,182
if you're ready.

664
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:09,049
- Guys.

665
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:11,889
Gloria, Tom.

666
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:14,931
Thank you so much for coming.

667
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,897
- We thought it would be good
to come back

668
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,940
and do something for the girls.

669
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,100
- Take however long you want.

670
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,306
This is Amy, a freshman here,
and Robert.

671
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:36,242
He actually
was the first person to...

672
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:40,653
find Anne and Mary that day.

673
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:45,525
- Robert...

674
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:50,000
I'm so sorry
you had to see that.

675
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:56,239
- Um...

676
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,140
I'm-I'm sorry, Mrs. Talbert.

677
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,598
- Whenever you're ready.

678
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,999
- Hello, everybody.

679
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:12,740
This has been the hardest time
for both of us.

680
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,286
We were used to
an empty apartment

681
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,720
for a good part of the year

682
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:25,693
since Anne and Mary
were at school.

683
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:30,631
Weekends have been
particularly hard.

684
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:35,467
Sometimes we feel...

685
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:39,338
when we've been
without them for a week...

686
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:45,738
that...

687
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:50,877
they're going to be showing up
Saturday night...

688
00:51:53,724 --> 00:51:54,656
But-

689
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:57,318
- Oh, please.
Please.

690
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:43,429
[crying softly]

691
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,691
- I don't know
why I keep crying.

692
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:22,716
- Did it hurt you?

693
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,316
- A little bit.

694
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:27,295
- I'm sorry.

695
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,735
- Thanks.

696
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:49,302
- When?

697
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:50,538
- Today.

698
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:53,343
- When?
- After AV.

699
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,815
Break.

700
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,886
- I don't believe you.

701
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,488
- Don't believe me, then.

702
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:05,891
- Okay, so how was it?

703
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:06,963
- I don't know.

704
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:08,189
- What do you mean
you don't-

705
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:10,289
Was it all right?

706
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,063
- Yeah.

707
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:20,676
- This is such bullshit.

708
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,210
- What's wrong?

709
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:23,438
- My mom.

710
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:25,879
She isn't able
to come pick me up this weekend.

711
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,847
- Oh.

712
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:31,216
Well, can't you just
take the train in?

713
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,288
- I mean, I guess so.

714
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:35,119
But I really hate
taking the train.

715
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:38,388
- Where do you live?

716
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:40,827
- In New York,
on the Upper East Side.

717
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:43,957
- Yeah, I live
on the Upper West.

718
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:51,473
Would you want
to come back with me?

719
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:54,703
- Okay.

720
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:57,177
I mean,
if that's cool with you.

721
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,249
- Yeah.

722
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,012
No, no.
You can't go.

723
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:07,920
- I really just want
to be home for a day.

724
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:12,791
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:14,420
- Are you sure it'd be cool
with your dad?

726
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:18,058
- Yeah.
Why wouldn't it be?

727
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:21,228
- I don't know.

728
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:23,704
Thanks a lot, though.

729
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:28,801
[strained breathing]

730
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,083
- Can you play it again?

731
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:46,321
- Yeah.

732
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:54,893
- Who made this?

733
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:57,064
- It's not my camera.

734
00:59:57,173 --> 00:59:59,664
- Yeah, looks like
a cell phone.

735
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:04,103
[strained breathing]

736
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:10,780
[screaming]

737
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:17,149
[crying]

738
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:18,644
[muffled screaming]

739
01:02:35,732 --> 01:02:37,461
- If there's something that
I need to know, he does tell me.

740
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
It's nothing to worry about.

741
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,464
It's nothing to worry about,
okay?

742
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,662
If it was, I'd let you know.

743
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:43,398
You know that, don't you?

744
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:44,495
You know that.

745
01:02:44,607 --> 01:02:46,768
I'd let you know immediately.

746
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:48,366
Don't worry.
I know how you're feeling.

747
01:02:48,478 --> 01:02:49,706
Don't worry about it.

748
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:53,249
Just enjoy your beautiful car.
Drive him around in it.

749
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:54,316
- Do you like it?

750
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:55,406
- I adore it.
I adore it.

751
01:02:55,518 --> 01:02:57,782
I'm green with envy.

752
01:02:57,887 --> 01:02:58,819
Young man.

753
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,856
- I hope he's okay.

754
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:02,219
- Don't worry, okay?
- Seriously.

755
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:04,122
- Don't worry.
Enjoy yourself.

756
01:03:04,227 --> 01:03:06,923
- His mother and I
would do anything...

757
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,997
- I understand.

758
01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:09,156
All's well.

759
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:11,256
- Speak with you later,
all right?

760
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:18,941
- Why don't you just say
what's on your mind?

761
01:03:22,345 --> 01:03:26,145
You're telling me that you don't
have any thought in your head.

762
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:27,216
- No.

763
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:31,617
- It's like a grapefruit?

764
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,884
- It's just-
I'm just-

765
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:40,691
Just wasn't even thinking
about anything...

766
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:43,425
important right then.

767
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:48,903
- I thought we-you know,

768
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:51,030
I thought we agreed
just to talk,

769
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:55,373
doesn't have to be important.

770
01:03:55,478 --> 01:03:57,503
Tell me something.

771
01:03:57,614 --> 01:03:59,013
Just want to know
what's on your mind,

772
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:01,777
what you're thinking about
right now.

773
01:04:07,624 --> 01:04:08,716
- I mean, it's hard.

774
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:11,794
Like, what are you
thinking about right now?

775
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:14,830
- I'm thinking about...

776
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:22,764
- See, it's sort of
just hard to tell sometimes.

777
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,373
I don't know.

778
01:04:34,517 --> 01:04:36,508
- Just tell me something,
anything.

779
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:39,247
Boom.

780
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:42,188
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind?

781
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:46,060
Rob.

782
01:04:46,162 --> 01:04:47,390
Just say anything.

783
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:49,556
Say anything.

784
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:52,066
- My skin's peeling.

785
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:09,578
It's all dry in certain parts
and coming off.

786
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,187
Happy?

787
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:15,086
- Yeah.

788
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:18,183
Yeah, I like it when you tell me
what you're thinking.

789
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:22,954
I feel like there's a lot
you want to say,

790
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:25,933
but you're not saying it.

791
01:05:30,506 --> 01:05:32,201
- Sorry.

792
01:05:32,308 --> 01:05:34,902
- Don't apologize to me
about it.

793
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,805
Did I make you upset?

794
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:40,905
- No.

795
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:43,247
- You know,
I'm not judging you.

796
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:46,015
None of this leaves the room.

797
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:54,026
What do you think
about your mom?

798
01:05:58,134 --> 01:05:59,761
Do you know
that she's got crabs so big,

799
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:04,465
I ride them to work?

800
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:05,836
- What?

801
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:08,809
- Rob, come on, man.

802
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:10,435
When somebody makes fun
of your mother,

803
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:13,037
you got to come back
quicker than that, right?

804
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:14,741
Right?

805
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:20,046
- Uh...

806
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:24,786
Your mom gets fucked for cash.

807
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:26,521
- Okay.

808
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:28,995
Okay, fair enough.

809
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:33,865
All right.

810
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,494
See, that was easy.

811
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:38,870
You just said
what's on your mind.

812
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:50,318
- I thought that
I wanted to be like them.

813
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,480
They're the ideal senior girls.

814
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:57,081
They were what everybody...

815
01:06:57,193 --> 01:06:59,593
looked up to.

816
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:32,153
- Hey, guys.
Hello.

817
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,822
We got new security checks.
I'm gonna check your bags.

818
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,559
- What's all that about?
- Not really sure.

819
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,100
But I'm gonna need you
to step up here,

820
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:41,534
and if you could stay
down there, please.

821
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:45,471
Just put your bag
on the table.

822
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:47,668
- There's nothing in there,
I can assure you of that.

823
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:49,142
- Nothing in here?

824
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,008
I'm gonna take some stuff out
and make sure

825
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:54,208
you're not bringing anything
into the school, all right?

826
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:02,153
- You're lucky
you didn't have anything.

827
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:04,249
- Yeah, Burke told my dad

828
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,954
that they might do
something like this.

829
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:27,707
I just brought some weed,
and a couple bottles of vodka.

830
01:08:32,755 --> 01:08:33,881
- What happened last night

831
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:36,015
is just the first
of many necessary steps

832
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:39,686
in trying to make this
a safer place for everyone.

833
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:41,195
The majority agree
that the steps

834
01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:43,231
we are starting to take
are the right ones.

835
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:50,067
First, you will not be allowed
unlimited Saturdays back home.

836
01:08:50,173 --> 01:08:54,507
Random room searches
and drug tests are allowed,

837
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:58,569
and the first series of these
will be starting this week.

838
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:01,206
Anyone in possession
of alcohol or drugs

839
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:03,217
besides those given to you
through the nurse

840
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,787
will be expelled.

841
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:09,255
Anyone caught smoking will have
a three-day suspension.

842
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:12,623
So-everyone settle.
Settle.

843
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:23,570
We have lost Anne and Mary,

844
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:26,437
but if there is nothing else,

845
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,942
we can only hope
that this experience

846
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:31,707
prevents this tragedy
from befalling others.

847
01:09:31,814 --> 01:09:35,250
And anyone
who disrespects these rules

848
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:36,613
is disrespecting them.

849
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,847
Is that clear with you guys?

850
01:09:39,956 --> 01:09:41,548
All that we're asking of you

851
01:09:41,657 --> 01:09:45,684
is that you uphold
the values of Bryton.

852
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:48,320
Now, I believe in the students
of this school,

853
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:51,662
and I really believe that
you're inherently good kids.

854
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:54,292
Now, we will do everything
in our power

855
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:57,463
to ensure
that is always the case.

856
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:03,611
Okay, as of last night,
several of our school's students

857
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:09,549
have been either expelled
or suspended indefinitely.

858
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:13,315
Now, Mr. Ullman will be reading
a list of their names.

859
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:17,222
It is important to remember
that these students,

860
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:19,886
some of whom are
your friends and roommates,

861
01:10:19,996 --> 01:10:25,400
did not respect this school,
themselves, or you.

862
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:30,236
Mr. Ullman.

863
01:10:42,552 --> 01:10:45,180
- Charles Wentworth,

864
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:48,018
Claire Goreman,

865
01:10:48,124 --> 01:10:49,148
Trevor Stuart.

866
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,207
- I think he's really upset.

867
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:15,842
I'm gonna go talk to him.

868
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:16,941
- We have to film Burke.

869
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:19,214
[metallic clang]

870
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:20,289
- Hey!
Cool it, guys.

871
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,220
Get over here.

872
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:23,883
Just stay right here.

873
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:26,587
Just go.

874
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:55,980
- What's going on?

875
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:59,289
- I thought you were asleep,
didn't want to wake you.

876
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:09,168
- Where are you going?

877
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:10,670
- Going to see Mr. Virgil.

878
01:12:10,773 --> 01:12:13,867
Thought it'd be a good idea.

879
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:38,716
- Is the light okay in here?

880
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:42,787
- Yeah, I think it's okay.
- Yeah.

881
01:13:42,898 --> 01:13:46,891
I'm very excited to see
what you guys have put together.

882
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:49,061
Mr. Wiseman says everyone's
been working really hard

883
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:53,130
on this project,
especially you and Amy.

884
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:55,676
I'm proud of you, Robert.

885
01:13:55,778 --> 01:13:57,245
Some people would have
lost their cool

886
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:59,314
after seeing what you saw.

887
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,213
Has this video
been helpful to do?

888
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:06,015
- Yeah, I think it's been nice.

889
01:14:06,122 --> 01:14:09,182
I'm-I'm set,
so we can start.

890
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:11,555
- Should we wait for Amy?

891
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:15,562
- No, I don't think
she's coming.

892
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,222
- All right, then.

893
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:22,865
Give me a second.

894
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:58,001
- Rob?

895
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,401
- Yeah, fuck me.

896
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:09,243
- Well...

897
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:11,609
I mean, I used to
really like videos,

898
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:15,673
but I think I might be
getting tired of them.

899
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:18,548
- You mean like movies?

900
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:22,852
- No, just like short clips.

901
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:27,924
- You mean like
kids' video blogs?

902
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,498
- No, I think
those are kind of phony.

903
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:32,999
No, just like little-

904
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:38,301
little clips of things
that seem real.

905
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:42,173
Usually just like a-

906
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:47,545
like a cat or a baby
doing something funny or-

907
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:50,278
or something violent.

908
01:16:53,722 --> 01:16:55,087
Like, there's this one
I really like

909
01:16:55,190 --> 01:17:00,184
where it's, like, a mother
and her six babies,

910
01:17:00,296 --> 01:17:04,562
and she's got like septuplets
or whatever you call it,

911
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:07,659
and they're all just,
like, laying around her,

912
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:09,704
and the dad,
who's filming,

913
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:14,265
just keeps making this noise
from behind the camera,

914
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:17,174
and whenever he makes the noise,
they all just giggle,

915
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:22,546
and they all stop giggling
at the same time.

916
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:24,744
- Do you like porn?

917
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,617
You can tell me.

918
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:29,850
- Yeah.

919
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:36,591
- No real moments in porn,
I can tell you that.

920
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:39,395
- Yeah, I know, but...

921
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:44,234
there are these ones
that I watch.

922
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,832
It's like this guy
who never shows his face

923
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:52,403
and he'll, like, grab the girls

924
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:54,744
and, like,
talk real hard with them.

925
01:17:57,653 --> 01:18:03,023
I don't know, he just gets them,
like, pretty scared

926
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:07,926
and not fake.

927
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:13,627
- Has doing the video
for the girls been good for you?

928
01:18:13,736 --> 01:18:15,101
I mean, I know
you don't want to talk

929
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:17,536
about the twins, Rob, but...

930
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:23,372
What's that?

931
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:25,606
Is there something
you want to say?

932
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:37,417
- It's all my fault.

933
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:46,293
- Rob, it's not your fault.

934
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:55,803
Can I tell you something?

935
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:59,438
And you promise
you won't tell anybody?

936
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:04,679
Swear?

937
01:19:04,787 --> 01:19:07,551
I knew the girls
were using drugs.

938
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:08,816
I knew they had issues.

939
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:12,360
I knew a year ago.

940
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:14,929
They stopped coming to see me.

941
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:18,193
This year, other kids
were talking about it.

942
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,892
I hear what's going on.

943
01:19:20,002 --> 01:19:21,469
Anyway...

944
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:25,165
I decided to tell, you know,
the school.

945
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:31,338
I felt like the girls
were in danger, and...

946
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:36,783
they told me
they didn't want to hear it,

947
01:19:36,885 --> 01:19:40,651
that the Talberts were
too important to this school

948
01:19:40,756 --> 01:19:46,353
and friends with certain people
and, uh...

949
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:49,226
they weren't worried about it,
so...

950
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:56,904
Nothing you can do,
nothing I can do.

951
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:00,532
In case you thought there was,
there wasn't.

952
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:23,261
[strained breathing]

953
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:26,357
[screaming]

954
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:40,475
- Okay, I'm excited
to see what you got.

955
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:45,582
Should I turn off the lights?

956
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:49,054
- Yeah.

957
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:58,627
- Oh, gosh.

958
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:00,065
Look at them.

959
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:02,569
- Okay, so it's not
completely done yet.

960
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:05,834
It's-it's close, I think.

961
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:48,939
- My mother once
knew a girl who-

962
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:52,782
she was at a party,
and she overdosed on drugs,

963
01:21:52,888 --> 01:21:56,346
and her friends thought
that she just passed out

964
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:57,618
because she had drank too much,

965
01:21:57,726 --> 01:21:59,387
and so they took her
to the school,

966
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:00,756
to the parking lot,

967
01:22:00,862 --> 01:22:02,625
and they just laid her
in the rain,

968
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:04,096
thinking it would be funny,

969
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:09,796
but, really, it wasn't,
because she died there, and...

970
01:22:14,243 --> 01:22:16,438
- I don't know,
they liked to have fun.

971
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:20,879
They were real cool girls.

972
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:23,451
I didn't know them as well
freshman year,

973
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:25,281
but obviously they-

974
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:27,947
they were a little intimidating
in the beginning,

975
01:22:28,056 --> 01:22:29,785
because they were
so pretty and-

976
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:32,655
they sort of took over
as soon as they got here,

977
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:34,251
and it took me a little while

978
01:22:34,363 --> 01:22:35,921
to get into
the swing of things,

979
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,522
so I didn't think I deserved to
hang out with them right away,

980
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:40,602
but, um...

981
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,067
they were-
they were more genuine

982
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:43,637
than I thought they were.

983
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:47,675
So they were
a lot more approachable.

984
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:49,266
So it was really cool
for me to-

985
01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:50,845
I don't know.

986
01:22:50,946 --> 01:22:53,471
I sort of felt honored to be
able to hang out with them.

987
01:23:12,734 --> 01:23:16,170
- No.

988
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:19,172
But they-

989
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:21,105
They always seemed like
they were having fun,

990
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:25,407
and everyone always
talked about them...

991
01:23:25,514 --> 01:23:31,919
and I guess they were
the kind of girls

992
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,750
I would like to be like,

993
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:37,586
and it's weird
that they're not there anymore.

994
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:44,830
- I'd really just ask them

995
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:47,424
about their, you know,
final experiences on this Earth

996
01:23:47,536 --> 01:23:51,131
and just what
they were thinking,

997
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:55,642
any remorse for any mistakes
they had made, any...

998
01:24:16,732 --> 01:24:20,065
- It was always a marvel to-

999
01:24:20,168 --> 01:24:21,066
I'm sorry, can we-

1000
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:23,296
can I-can we start again?

1001
01:24:29,678 --> 01:24:32,841
It was always a marvel to me

1002
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:36,679
to see how two young women

1003
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,616
who seemed so similar-

1004
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:52,418
Was that serious, Robert?

1005
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:55,121
- What do you mean?

1006
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,063
- Is there something
wrong with you, Robert?

1007
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,793
I'm no editor,
but I can safely say

1008
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:03,268
that was probably
the worst thing I've ever seen.

1009
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:05,168
You didn't even have music.

1010
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,304
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wiseman

1011
01:26:13,415 --> 01:26:16,248
to have someone else
re-edit everything.

1012
01:26:18,653 --> 01:26:20,177
I'm very disappointed.

1013
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:40,965
[voices overlapping]

1014
01:26:52,888 --> 01:26:54,253
- I like pudding.

1015
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:56,347
Don't you like pudding?

1016
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:02,052
[voices overlapping]

1017
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:08,795
- Yo, Rob,
let me get the homework, man.

1018
01:27:08,904 --> 01:27:11,134
- No.

1019
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:13,332
- Give it to me.

1020
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,109
- No.

1021
01:27:20,715 --> 01:27:22,342
- Yo, Max.
- Yeah?

1022
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:25,886
- Can I get the homework?

1023
01:27:25,987 --> 01:27:28,888
- Okay, fine.

1024
01:27:33,194 --> 01:27:35,685
Here.

1025
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:38,789
[voices overlapping]

1026
01:27:51,546 --> 01:27:53,980
- Fucking pussy.

1027
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:08,061
- Fuck you!

1028
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:09,721
You fucking killed them!

1029
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:13,130
You fucking
killed them!

1030
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,088
- Come on.
Come on, outside.

1031
01:28:49,337 --> 01:28:51,168
- You almost killed Dave.

1032
01:28:51,272 --> 01:28:54,639
Do you realize that, Rob?

1033
01:28:54,743 --> 01:28:59,874
There are a lot of people who
think you should be expelled.

1034
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:00,970
You boys are roommates.

1035
01:29:01,082 --> 01:29:02,743
Friends.

1036
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:05,752
What would make you
want to do that?

1037
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,650
I know this has been
a tough time for you,

1038
01:29:13,762 --> 01:29:15,024
Rob, in particular.

1039
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:17,724
It's been a difficult time
for everybody here.

1040
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:20,665
Dave, I can only hope
you've been there for him.

1041
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:30,937
- Yeah.

1042
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:33,810
I've been really worried
about Rob.

1043
01:29:33,915 --> 01:29:35,405
He's been acting
really weird lately.

1044
01:29:35,517 --> 01:29:36,541
- Rob, calm down!

1045
01:29:36,651 --> 01:29:37,618
All right.

1046
01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:39,414
Dave, um...

1047
01:29:39,521 --> 01:29:42,319
I need you to give Rob and I
a few minutes.

1048
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:44,654
Then I'll come
and talk to you.

1049
01:30:03,878 --> 01:30:06,870
I've heard things
from Mr. Virgil.

1050
01:30:06,981 --> 01:30:08,175
There are a lot of things
he says

1051
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:10,410
that really worry me, buddy.

1052
01:30:10,518 --> 01:30:12,748
The things you've been
looking at on the computer,

1053
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:15,084
that's not good.

1054
01:30:17,892 --> 01:30:20,053
A lot of things,
and the kind of things parents

1055
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:22,925
don't want to know
about their son.

1056
01:30:34,342 --> 01:30:36,537
And there was something else,
something you kept saying.

1057
01:30:36,644 --> 01:30:38,236
Do you remember
what you kept saying, Rob?

1058
01:30:38,346 --> 01:30:40,576
You were cursing like a madman,
and you were saying,

1059
01:30:40,682 --> 01:30:42,013
"You killed them.
You killed them.

1060
01:30:42,117 --> 01:30:43,311
You killed them. "

1061
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:46,046
What did you mean, Rob?

1062
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:53,187
- I'm sorry, Mr. Burke.
I don't know what I was saying.

1063
01:30:53,294 --> 01:30:55,728
- Were you talking
about the Talbert Twins?

1064
01:30:58,533 --> 01:30:59,830
- No, Mr. Burke.

1065
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:01,561
I don't think
I was talking about anything.

1066
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:06,265
- It's a serious allegation,
Robert.

1067
01:31:06,374 --> 01:31:08,604
That's why I'm asking you
like this.

1068
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:10,371
I know Dave,
and I know his parents.

1069
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:11,410
He's a good kid.

1070
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:12,445
He's like you,

1071
01:31:12,547 --> 01:31:17,814
just a little troubled
right now.

1072
01:31:17,919 --> 01:31:19,011
Were you trying to say

1073
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,315
Dave had something to do with
the death, Rob?

1074
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:24,220
And if you know something,
please say it now.

1075
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,028
- No.

1076
01:31:41,609 --> 01:31:44,976
- All right, Rob.

1077
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:47,673
I had to clear that up.

1078
01:31:51,986 --> 01:31:54,284
There's something I haven't
really said out there

1079
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:57,051
to the other kids,

1080
01:31:57,158 --> 01:31:59,456
but...

1081
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:00,619
no one knows where the girls

1082
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:04,494
purchased the drugs
that they got for sure.

1083
01:32:04,599 --> 01:32:08,160
It's scary to think it could
have been someone in the school.

1084
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:09,930
But the truth is, Rob,

1085
01:32:10,038 --> 01:32:15,169
we all kind of gave the girls
those drugs that day.

1086
01:32:15,276 --> 01:32:17,540
Do you see, it's not just
one person's fault, Rob.

1087
01:32:17,645 --> 01:32:18,612
It's everyone's.

1088
01:32:18,713 --> 01:32:21,511
In a way, it's mine.

1089
01:32:21,616 --> 01:32:23,550
And, in a way,
it's your fault, Rob.

1090
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:28,350
In a way, we all kind of gave
the girls those drugs that day.

1091
01:32:28,456 --> 01:32:30,515
Do you see?

1092
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:36,756
In a way, we all did.

1093
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:45,895
We're not gonna expel you,
buddy.

1094
01:32:46,007 --> 01:32:49,499
I think what you need
is some time away, back home.

1095
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:50,703
I've talked to your parents,

1096
01:32:50,812 --> 01:32:54,873
and they're obviously very
concerned.

1097
01:32:54,983 --> 01:32:56,951
It could be a couple of weeks
or a couple of months,

1098
01:32:57,051 --> 01:33:00,987
but when you're ready
to come back,

1099
01:33:01,089 --> 01:33:03,922
Bryton will be here for you.

1100
01:33:27,382 --> 01:33:30,249
Robert?

1101
01:33:35,323 --> 01:33:38,121
Can you get up?

1102
01:33:40,395 --> 01:33:43,091
It was always a marvel to me,

1103
01:33:43,197 --> 01:33:49,534
to see how two young women
who seemed so similar

1104
01:33:49,637 --> 01:33:50,831
could be so different.

1105
01:33:50,939 --> 01:33:54,966
Anne and Mary,

1106
01:33:55,076 --> 01:33:56,873
we'll miss you terribly.

1107
01:33:56,978 --> 01:34:00,436
- Whenever I would see
the girls pass by my office

1108
01:34:00,548 --> 01:34:01,606
before morning meeting,

1109
01:34:01,716 --> 01:34:03,149
they always had a smile
on their face,

1110
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:04,650
and they would always wave.

1111
01:34:04,752 --> 01:34:06,117
I'm gonna miss them.

1112
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,482
They were a bright spot
in the day

1113
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:09,055
and in the week for me.

1114
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:12,251
- Nothing like this should ever
happen to anybody.

1115
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,191
You'll be missed.

1116
01:34:14,295 --> 01:34:15,421
Take care.

1117
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,157
- I was happy
to have known them,

1118
01:34:17,265 --> 01:34:18,857
and I miss them.

1119
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:21,094
- Bryton won't be the same
without you.

1120
01:34:21,202 --> 01:34:23,864
- You're the most
beautiful girls I've ever seen,

1121
01:34:23,972 --> 01:34:26,805
and I'm really gonna miss
seeing you around campus.

1122
01:34:26,908 --> 01:34:27,932
Good-bye, Anne and Mary.

1123
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,407
- Good-bye, Anne and Mary.

1124
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:32,968
- I'm gonna miss you.

1125
01:34:33,081 --> 01:34:37,142
- I would say
that she was the best person

1126
01:34:37,251 --> 01:34:42,120
that I ever knew
in my entire life.

1127
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:43,986
- I will miss you.

1128
01:34:44,092 --> 01:34:46,287
- I never knew
the Talbert Twins,

1129
01:34:46,394 --> 01:34:48,419
but I'd always admired them.

1130
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:50,156
We'll all really miss them.

1131
01:34:50,264 --> 01:34:52,562
Our hearts go out
to their parents.

1132
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:55,534
- To the students of Bryton,

1133
01:34:55,636 --> 01:34:58,696
we want to thank you very much
from the bottom of our hearts

1134
01:34:58,806 --> 01:35:03,106
for all of your well-wishes
and your kind words,

1135
01:35:03,211 --> 01:35:04,235
flowers, cards,

1136
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:06,711
the many things
that you sent to us.

1137
01:35:06,814 --> 01:35:11,581
- Anne and Mary loved
many of you very much,

1138
01:35:11,686 --> 01:35:15,713
and we do hope that
in the future of this school,

1139
01:35:15,823 --> 01:35:17,950
that will never happen again.

1140
01:35:27,068 --> 01:35:30,060
[applause]

1141
01:35:34,308 --> 01:35:35,798
- That was beautiful.

1142
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:37,434
Please join me
in a moment of silence

1143
01:35:37,545 --> 01:35:40,207
in memory of Anne and Mary.

1144
01:35:58,066 --> 01:36:01,229
Thank you.

1145
01:36:01,335 --> 01:36:02,927
I'd like to give
another round of applause

1146
01:36:03,037 --> 01:36:04,561
to the audio-video class.

1147
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:07,732
[applause]

1148
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:11,737
What a beautiful card
to remember them by.

1149
01:36:11,846 --> 01:36:13,643
Their parents
are truly grateful.

1150
01:36:13,748 --> 01:36:15,340
Thank you, guys.

1151
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:19,216
Let us never forget
this tragedy

1152
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,812
and always remember
that we must remain vigilant

1153
01:36:22,924 --> 01:36:26,985
against the dangers out there.

1154
01:36:27,095 --> 01:36:31,293
Okay, everyone, please make
your way back to third period.

1155
01:36:36,537 --> 01:36:38,266

01:36:38,372 --> 01:36:41,364

1162
01:36:55,523 --> 01:36:58,651
- Good, how are you?

1163
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:08,860
Anyone else waiting?

1164
01:37:09,904 --> 01:37:12,372
Have a good day, Robert.

1165
01:37:12,473 --> 01:37:15,465
- [coughing]

1166
01:37:36,864 --> 01:37:39,059
- Hey, Rob!

1167
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:42,068
Rob!

1168
01:37:47,942 --> 01:37:52,970
How's things been working out?

1169
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,105
- They're better.

1170
01:37:58,219 --> 01:38:01,677
- If you want to talk anytime,
come see me, okay?

1171
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:03,347
- Yeah.

1172
01:38:07,828 --> 01:38:12,390
- And the surface area
of a sphere.

1173
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:15,435
The formulas are quite simple.

1174
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:18,630
Once you know the formula
for the area

1175
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:19,697
and the volume of a-

1176
01:38:28,182 --> 01:38:29,410
- Fuck you!

1177
01:38:29,517 --> 01:38:32,179
You fucking killed them!

1178
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:38,485
[knocks on door]

1179
01:38:38,593 --> 01:38:40,993
- Lights out, Rob.

1180
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:14,726
- Two, three.

1181
01:39:14,829 --> 01:39:17,229
[raucous cheering]

1182
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:19,265
- Good-bye, suckers!

1183
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:21,062
- So long, suckers!

1184
01:39:21,168 --> 01:39:24,160
[cheering fades]
