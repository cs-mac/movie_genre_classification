1
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,696
<i>The hills are alive</i>

2
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:51,132
<i>With the sound of music</i>

3
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,970
<i>With songs they have sung</i>

4
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,839
<i>For a thousand years</i>

5
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,405
<i>The hills fill my heart</i>

6
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:07,007
<i>With the sound of music</i>

7
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:14,344
<i>My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears</i>

8
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,085
<i>My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise</i>

9
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,290
<i>From the lake to the trees</i>

10
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies</i>

11
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,996
<i>From a church on a breeze</i>

12
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,935
<i>To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls</i>

13
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,549
<i>Over stones on its way</i>

14
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,511
<i>To sing through the night</i>

15
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,888
<i>Like a lark who is learning to pray</i>

16
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:53,452
<i>I go to the hills</i>

17
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:59,958
<i>When my heart is lonely</i>

18
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,395
<i>I know I will hear</i>

19
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,866
<i>What I've heard before</i>

20
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,408
<i>My heart will be blessed</i>

21
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:22,113
<i>With the sound of music</i>

22
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,257
<i>And I'll sing</i>

23
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:37,466
<i>Once more</i>

24
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:24,224
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

25
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,357
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

26
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,725
- Reverend Mother.
- Sister Bernice.

27
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,566
- I simply cannot find her.
- Maria?

28
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,007
She's missing again.

29
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,268
We should've put a cowbell
around her neck.

30
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,574
Have you tried the barn? You know
how much she adores the animals.

31
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,581
I have looked everywhere.
In all of the usual places.

32
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,052
Sister, considering it's Maria...

33
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,918
...I suggest you look in someplace
unusual.

34
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,459
Well, Reverend Mother...

35
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,361
...I hope this new infraction ends
whatever doubts...

36
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,868
...you may still have
about Maria's future here.

37
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:11,100
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

38
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,232
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

39
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,769
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

40
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,441
Of all the candidates for
the novitiate, Maria is the least--

41
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,247
Children, children.

42
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,684
We were speculating about
the qualifications of our postulants.

43
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,288
The Mistress of Novices
and the Mistress of Postulants...

44
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:38,822
...were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

45
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,131
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of Maria?

46
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,468
She's a wonderful girl,
some of the time.

47
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,476
- Sister Agatha?
- It's very easy to like Maria...

48
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,274
...except when it's difficult.

49
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:56,113
- And you, Sister Sophia?
- Oh, I love her very dearly.

50
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,246
But she always seems to be
in trouble, doesn't she?

51
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,255
Exactly what I say.

52
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,993
<i>She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee</i>

53
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,960
<i>Her dress has got a tear</i>

54
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,763
<i>She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair</i>

55
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,862
<i>And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair</i>

56
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,805
<i>I've even heard her singing
In the abbey</i>

57
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,004
<i>She's always late for chapel</i>

58
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,513
<i>But her penitence is real</i>

59
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,150
<i>She's always late for everything</i>

60
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,379
<i>Except for every meal</i>

61
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:35,486
<i>I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel</i>

62
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:40,152
<i>Maria's not an asset to the abbey</i>

63
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,191
<i>I'd like to say a word in her behalf</i>

64
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,767
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

65
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,028
<i>Maria makes me laugh</i>

66
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,776
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

67
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,208
<i>How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?</i>

68
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,076
<i>How do you find a word
That means Maria?</i>

69
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,716
<i>A flibbertigibbet</i>

70
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,324
- <i>A will-o'-the-wisp</i>
- <i>A clown</i>

71
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,350
<i>Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her</i>

72
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,354
<i>Many a thing she ought to understand</i>

73
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,533
<i>But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?</i>

74
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,563
<i>How do you keep a wave
Upon the sand?</i>

75
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,869
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

76
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:34,614
<i>How do you hold a moonbeam</i>

77
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:40,614
<i>In your hand?</i>

78
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,219
<i>When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused</i>

79
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,922
<i>And I never know exactly where I am</i>

80
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,468
- <i>Unpredictable as weather</i>
- <i>She's as flighty as a feather</i>

81
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,635
- <i>She's a darling</i>
- <i>She's a demon</i>

82
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,239
<i>She's a lamb</i>

83
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,238
<i>She'll out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest</i>

84
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,778
<i>She can throw a whirling dervish
Out of whirl</i>

85
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,908
- <i>She is gentle, she is wild</i>
- <i>She's a riddle, she's a child</i>

86
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,048
- <i>She's a headache</i>
- <i>She's an angel</i>

87
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,114
<i>She's a girl</i>

88
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,557
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

89
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,662
<i>How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?</i>

90
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,564
<i>How do you find a word
That means Maria?</i>

91
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,798
- <i>A flibbertigibbet</i>
- <i>A will-o'-the-wisp</i>

92
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,670
<i>A clown</i>

93
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,736
<i>Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her</i>

94
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,615
<i>Many a thing she ought to understand</i>

95
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:44,085
- <i>But how do you make her stay?</i>
- <i>And listen to all you say?</i>

96
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,244
<i>How do you keep a wave
Upon the sand?</i>

97
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:54,119
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

98
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:17,206
<i>How do you hold a moonbeam</i>

99
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:24,616
<i>In your hand?</i>

100
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,466
You may go in now, Maria.

101
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,683
Come here, my child.

102
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,563
Now sit down.

103
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,061
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

104
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,228
- The hills were beckoning and before--
- Dear.

105
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,629
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

106
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,105
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

107
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,041
If you'll feel better.

108
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,314
Yes, you see,
the sky was so blue today...

109
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,372
...and everything was so green and
fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

110
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:27,081
The Untersberg led me higher like
it wanted me to go through the clouds.

111
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,420
Suppose darkness had come
and you were lost?

112
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,892
Mother, I could never be lost
up there.

113
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,964
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

114
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,465
It was the mountain that led me
to you.

115
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,228
When I was a child,
I would come down and climb a tree...

116
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,270
...and look in your garden.

117
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,433
I'd see the sisters at work
and hear them sing.

118
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,409
Which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

119
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,778
I was singing out there today.

120
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,447
Only in the abbey do we have rules
about postulants singing.

121
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,648
I can't stop wherever I am.

122
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,258
Worse, I can't seem to stop
saying things.

123
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,759
Everything I think and feel.

124
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,488
Some call that "honesty."

125
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,055
Oh, but it's terrible,
Reverend Mother!

126
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,159
You know how Sister Berthe makes me
kiss the floor after a disagreement?

127
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,065
Lately, I kiss the floor when I see
her coming, just to save time.

128
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,873
Maria...

129
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,873
...when you saw us over the wall
and longed to be with us...

130
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,850
...that didn't mean you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

131
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,614
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

132
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,522
And I am learning. I really am.

133
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,457
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here?

134
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,898
To find out what is the will of God
and do it wholeheartedly.

135
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,865
Maria...

136
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,173
...it seems to be God's will
that you leave us.

137
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,901
- Leave?
- Only for a while.

138
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,745
No, Mother!
Please don't send me away!

139
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,248
This is where I belong. It's my home,
my family. It's my life.

140
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,912
- Are you truly ready for it?
- Yes, I am.

141
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:10,049
If you go out into the world for a time,
knowing what we expect of you...

142
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,059
...you will find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

143
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:17,554
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it! I promise I can!

144
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,368
Yes, Mother.

145
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,138
If it is God's will.

146
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,443
There is a family near Salzburg that
needs a governess until September.

147
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,914
- September?
- For seven children.

148
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,579
Seven children?!

149
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,084
Do you like children?

150
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,689
Well, yes, but seven!

151
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,024
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

152
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,896
Captain?

153
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:53,457
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.
A fine man and a brave one.

154
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,435
His wife died,
and he is alone with the children.

155
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:00,941
I understand he has had a difficult
time keeping a governess there.

156
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,045
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

157
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,306
The Lord will show you
in his own good time.

158
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,648
When the Lord closes a door...

159
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,351
...somewhere he opens a window.

160
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,530
<i>What will this day be like?</i>

161
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,801
<i>I wonder</i>

162
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,603
<i>What will my future be?</i>

163
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,777
<i>I wonder</i>

164
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,318
<i>It could be so exciting</i>

165
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,749
<i>To be out in the world
To be free</i>

166
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,154
<i>My heart should be wildly rejoicing</i>

167
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:31,462
<i>Oh, what's the matter with me?</i>

168
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,030
<i>I've always longed for adventure</i>

169
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,868
<i>To do the things I've never dared</i>

170
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,272
<i>Now here I'm facing adventure</i>

171
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:48,402
<i>Then why am I so scared?</i>

172
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,488
<i>A captain with seven children</i>

173
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,486
<i>What's so fearsome about that?</i>

174
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,224
<i>I must stop these doubts
All these worries</i>

175
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,197
<i>If I don't, I just know I'll turn back</i>

176
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,561
<i>I must dream of the things
I am seeking</i>

177
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,705
<i>I am seeking the courage I lack</i>

178
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,079
<i>The courage to serve them
With reliance</i>

179
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,581
<i>Face my mistakes without defiance</i>

180
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,818
<i>Show them I'm worthy</i>

181
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,447
<i>And while I show them</i>

182
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,749
<i>I'll show me</i>

183
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:38,221
<i>So let them bring on
All their problems</i>

184
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,596
<i>I'll do better than my best</i>

185
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,096
<i>I have confidence
They'll put me to the test</i>

186
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,638
<i>But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me</i>

187
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,140
<i>Somehow, I will impress them</i>

188
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,882
<i>I will be firm but kind</i>

189
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,452
<i>And all those children
Heaven bless them</i>

190
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,990
<i>They will look up to me
And mind me</i>

191
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>With each step, I am more certain</i>

192
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,726
<i>Everything will turn out fine</i>

193
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,128
<i>I have confidence
The world can all be mine</i>

194
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:18,637
<i>They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me</i>

195
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,243
<i>I have confidence in sunshine</i>

196
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,406
<i>I have confidence in rain</i>

197
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,674
<i>I have confidence
That spring will come again</i>

198
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,015
<i>Besides which you see
I have confidence in me</i>

199
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,313
<i>Strength doesn't lie in numbers</i>

200
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,586
<i>Strength doesn't lie in wealth</i>

201
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,264
<i>Strength lies in nights
Of peaceful slumbers</i>

202
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,426
<i>When you wake up, wake up
It's healthy</i>

203
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,436
<i>All I trust I leave my heart to</i>

204
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,671
<i>All I trust becomes my own</i>

205
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:57,311
<i>I have confidence in confidence alone</i>

206
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,124
Oh, help.

207
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:32,739
<i>I have confidence in confidence alone</i>

208
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:38,543
<i>Besides which you see
I have confidence</i>

209
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:45,047
<i>In me</i>

210
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,570
Hello. Here I am.

211
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,236
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, captain.

212
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,177
And I'm the old butler, fräulein.

213
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,915
Well, how do you do?

214
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,526
You'll wait here, please.

215
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,984
In the future, remember certain rooms
in this house are not to be disturbed.

216
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,615
Yes, captain, sir.

217
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:08,735
- Why do you stare at me that way?
- You don't look like a sea captain.

218
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,034
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

219
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,840
- Turn around.
- What?

220
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,377
Turn.

221
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,880
Hat off.

222
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,617
Put on another dress
before meeting the children.

223
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,485
But I don't have another.

224
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,616
When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes go to the poor.

225
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,057
What about this one?

226
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,662
The poor didn't want it.

227
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,993
There wasn't time to make a new dress.
I can make clothes.

228
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,503
I'll see that you get some material.

229
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,767
Today, if possible.

230
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,541
- Now, fräulein...
- Maria.

231
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,736
I don't know how much
the abbess told you.

232
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,340
- Not much.
- You are the twelfth governess...

233
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,044
...to look after my children
since their mother died.

234
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,417
I trust you will be an improvement
on the last one.

235
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,522
She stayed only two hours.

236
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,788
What's wrong with the children, sir?

237
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,656
Nothing is wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

238
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:16,863
They could not maintain discipline,
without which the house cannot be run.

239
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,607
Drill them in their studies.

240
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,370
I will not permit them to dream
away their summer holidays.

241
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,277
Each afternoon,
they march, breathing deeply.

242
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,143
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

243
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,378
When do they play?

244
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,615
You will see to it that they conduct
themselves with the utmost decorum.

245
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,816
- I am placing you in command.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,635
Now...

247
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,168
...this is your new governess,
Fräulein Maria.

248
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,839
Give your name at your signal.

249
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:10,215
Fräulein, listen carefully. Learn
their signals so you can call them.

250
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,922
Liesl.

251
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,920
Friedrich.

252
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,717
Louisa.

253
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,292
Kurt.

254
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,520
Brigitta.

255
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,060
Marta.

256
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,804
Gretl.

257
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,835
Now, let's see how well you listened.

258
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,448
I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

259
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,176
I mean, I'll use their names.
Such lovely names.

260
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,551
Fräulein, this is a large house.
The grounds are extensive.

261
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,555
And I will not have anyone shouting.

262
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,559
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

263
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,391
The children will help you.

264
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:59,426
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

265
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,102
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

266
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,464
I could never answer to a whistle.

267
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,371
Whistles are for animals,
not for children.

268
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,637
And definitely not for me.

269
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,576
It would be too humiliating.

270
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:18,583
Fräulein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

271
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,982
Oh, much more, sir.

272
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,660
I don't know your signal.

273
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,767
You may call me "captain."

274
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,177
At ease.

275
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,516
Now that there's just us...

276
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,924
...would you please tell me all your
names again and how old you are.

277
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,424
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old,
and I don't need a governess.

278
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,264
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

279
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,196
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14.
I'm impossible.

280
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,174
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

281
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,941
Fräulein Josephine.
Four governesses ago.

282
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,841
I'm Brigitta.

283
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,648
You didn't tell me how old you are,
Louisa.

284
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,623
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

285
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,626
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

286
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,631
I'm 10, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

287
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,530
- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
- Why not?

288
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,036
- Don't you think it's ugly?
- Of course.

289
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,004
But Fräulein Helga's was ugliest.

290
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,872
I'm Kurt. I'm 11.
I'm incorrigible.

291
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,241
- Congratulations.
- What's "incorrigible"?

292
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,374
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

293
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,855
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be
7 on Tuesday.

294
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,492
I'd like a pink parasol.

295
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,220
Pink's my favorite color too.

296
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,726
Yes, you're Gretl.

297
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,397
And you're 5 years old?

298
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,828
My, you're practically a lady.

299
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,368
I have to tell you a secret.
I've never been a governess.

300
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,711
You don't know anything
about being a governess?

301
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,348
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

302
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:31,780
The best way to start is to tell
Father to mind his own business.

303
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,853
Never come to dinner on time.

304
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,356
Never eat your soup quietly.

305
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,086
During dessert,
always blow your nose.

306
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,094
Don't you believe a word they say,
Fräulein Maria.

307
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,723
- Oh, why not?
- Because I like you.

308
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,493
Children, outside for your walk.

309
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,571
Father's orders. Hurry up.

310
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,105
Quick, quick, quick.

311
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,574
Fräulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,
the housekeeper.

312
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,905
How do you do.

313
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,914
I'll show you to your room.
Follow me.

314
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,791
Poor little dears.

315
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,832
You're very lucky.
With Fräulein Helga it was a snake.

316
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,092
Good evening.

317
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,092
- Good evening, children.
- Good evening, Fräulein Maria.

318
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,936
Enchanting little ritual.

319
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,839
Something you learned at the abbey?

320
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,345
No.

321
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,315
Rheumatism.

322
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,224
Excuse me, captain.
Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?

323
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,466
For what we receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

324
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,899
- Amen.
- Amen.

325
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,372
I'd like to thank you all...

326
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,611
...for the precious gift
you left in my pocket today.

327
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,890
What gift?

328
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,192
It's a secret between
the children and me.

329
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,063
Then I suggest you keep it,
and let us eat.

330
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,393
Knowing how nervous
I must have been...

331
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,061
...a stranger in a new household...

332
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,369
...knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted...

333
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,843
...it was so kind and thoughtful of
you to make my first moments here...

334
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,245
...so warm and happy...

335
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,248
...and pleasant.

336
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,555
- What is the matter, Marta?
- Nothing.

337
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:40,968
Fräulein...

338
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:45,067
...is it to be at every meal
or merely at dinnertime...

339
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:49,879
...that you intend leading us through
this rare and wonderful new world...

340
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,749
...of indigestion?

341
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,124
They're all right, captain.
They're just happy.

342
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,608
- Rolfe, good evening.
- Good evening, Franz.

343
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,613
- I trust everything is under control?
- Yes, yes.

344
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,643
- Are there any developments?
- Perhaps.

345
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,017
- Is the captain home?
- He's at dinner.

346
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,623
- With the family?
- Yes.

347
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,624
Give him this telegram at once.

348
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,454
Certainly.

349
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,872
A telegram for you, sir.

350
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,544
Franz? Who delivered it?

351
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,874
That young lad Rolfe, of course.

352
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,883
Father, may I be excused?

353
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:03,316
Children, in the morning
I shall be going to Vienna.

354
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,051
Not again, Father!

355
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,992
How long will you be gone this time?

356
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,169
I'm not sure, Gretl.

357
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,000
- To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
- Mind your own business!

358
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,864
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

359
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,502
- Why can't we ever see the baroness?
- Why would she want to see you?

360
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:31,676
You are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

361
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,920
And Uncle Max.

362
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,684
Uncle Max!

363
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,008
Rolfe!

364
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,106
Oh, Rolfe!

365
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,608
- No, Liesl. We mustn't!
- Why not, silly?

366
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,517
- I don't know--
- Isn't this why you're waiting?

367
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,589
Yes, of course.

368
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,624
- I've missed you, Liesl.
- You have? How much?

369
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,719
I even thought of sending a telegram,
so I'd be able to deliver it here.

370
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,859
Oh, that's a lovely thought!
Why don't you, right now?

371
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:25,269
- But I'm here!
- Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.

372
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,967
I'll start it for you.
"Dear Liesl..."

373
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,707
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able
to tell you...

374
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,716
...how I feel about you. Stop.

375
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:40,481
Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive.

376
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,124
Sincerely, Rolfe."

377
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,090
- "Sincerely"?
- Cordially.

378
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,958
- "Cordially"?
- Affectionately?

379
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,360
Will there be any reply?

380
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,799
"Dear Rolfe: Stop.

381
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,935
Don't stop! Your Liesl."

382
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,469
If only we didn't have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

383
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,139
How do I know when I'll see you again?

384
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,282
Well, let's see...

385
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,179
I could come here by mistake.

386
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:20,892
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!
He's here from Berlin staying with--

387
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,098
No one knows he's here.
Don't tell your father.

388
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,499
- Why not?
- Your father's so Austrian.

389
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,003
We're all Austrian.

390
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,632
Some think we ought to be German, and
they're very mad at those who don't.

391
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,642
They're getting ready to--

392
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,705
Let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

393
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:45,945
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.
He was even decorated by the emperor.

394
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,422
I don't worry about him.
I worry about his daughter.

395
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,326
- Me? Why?
- Well, you're so--

396
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,525
- You're such a baby!
- I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

397
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,138
<i>You wait, little girl
On an empty stage</i>

398
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,375
<i>For fate to turn the light on</i>

399
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,743
<i>Your life, little girl
Is an empty page</i>

400
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,382
<i>That men will want to write on</i>

401
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:22,087
<i>To write on</i>

402
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,185
<i>You are 16 going on 17</i>

403
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:30,890
<i>Baby, it's time to think</i>

404
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,065
<i>Better beware
Be canny and careful</i>

405
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,729
<i>Baby, you're on the brink</i>

406
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,031
<i>You are 16 going on 17</i>

407
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,771
<i>Fellows will fall in line</i>

408
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,607
<i>Eager young lads
And roués and cads</i>

409
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,677
<i>Will offer you food and wine</i>

410
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,559
<i>Totally unprepared are you</i>

411
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,554
<i>To face a world of men</i>

412
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,033
<i>Timid and shy and scared are you</i>

413
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,129
<i>Of things beyond your ken</i>

414
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,399
<i>You need someone older and wiser</i>

415
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,401
<i>Telling you what to do</i>

416
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,141
<i>I am 17 going on 18</i>

417
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:29,382
<i>I'll take care of you</i>

418
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,250
<i>I am 16 going on 17</i>

419
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,626
<i>I know that I'm naive</i>

420
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,326
<i>Fellows I meet
May tell me I'm sweet</i>

421
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,062
<i>And willingly I believe</i>

422
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:20,007
<i>I am 16 going on 17</i>

423
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,607
<i>Innocent as a rose</i>

424
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,573
<i>Bachelor dandies
Drinkers of brandies</i>

425
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,015
<i>What do I know of those?</i>

426
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,788
<i>Totally unprepared am I</i>

427
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,890
<i>To face a world of men</i>

428
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,226
<i>Timid and shy and scared am I</i>

429
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,022
<i>Of things beyond my ken</i>

430
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,398
<i>I need someone older and wiser</i>

431
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,837
<i>Telling me what to do</i>

432
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:58,006
<i>You are 17 going on 18</i>

433
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:03,539
<i>I'll depend on you</i>

434
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,332
Come in.

435
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,031
Frau Schmidt.

436
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,137
For your new dresses.

437
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:09,437
- The captain had these sent from town.
- Oh, how lovely!

438
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,138
These will make the prettiest
clothes I've ever had.

439
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,876
Do you think he would
get me more material if I asked?

440
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,783
- How many dresses do you need?
- Not for me, for the children.

441
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,118
I want to make them
some play clothes.

442
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,888
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

443
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,855
Surely you don't approve of that.

444
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,200
Ever since the captain
lost his poor wife...

445
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,166
...he runs this house as if on
one of his ships.

446
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,372
Whistles, orders.

447
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,507
No more music, no more laughing.

448
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:44,270
Nothing that reminds him of her.
Even the children.

449
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:45,873
But that's so wrong.

450
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,207
Oh, well.

451
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,148
How do you like your room?
There'll be new drapes at the windows.

452
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,651
But these are fine.

453
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,518
New ones have been ordered.

454
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:59,059
- But I really don't need them.
- Good night, now.

455
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,356
Frau Schmidt, if I asked the captain
tomorrow about the material...?

456
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,025
- He's leaving in the morning.
- Of course. How long will he be gone?

457
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:13,234
It depends. The last time he visited
the baroness, he stayed for a month.

458
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:19,007
I shouldn't be saying this to you.
I don't know you that well.

459
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,173
But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking seriously...

460
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,616
...of marrying her before
summer's over.

461
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:28,086
Wonderful! The children will
have a mother again.

462
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,857
Yes.

463
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,858
Well, good night.

464
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,462
Good night.

465
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,705
Dear Father, now I know
why you sent me here.

466
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,774
To help these children
prepare for a new mother.

467
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,355
And I pray this will become
a happy family in thy sight.

468
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,653
God bless the captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

469
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:10,060
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

470
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,165
And I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

471
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,736
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

472
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,001
God bless the Reverend Mother
and Sister Margaretta...

473
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,974
...and everybody at the abbey.

474
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,740
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

475
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,071
Help her know that I'm her friend...

476
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,913
...and help her tell me
what she's been up to.

477
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,782
Are you going to tell on me?

478
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,447
Help me to be understanding
so I may guide her footsteps.

479
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,389
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

480
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,588
I was out walking and somebody
locked the doors early.

481
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,496
I didn't want to wake everybody,
so when I saw your window open...

482
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,165
You're not going to tell Father,
are you?

483
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,543
How did you climb up?

484
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,177
It's how we always got in
to play tricks on the governess.

485
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,411
Louisa can make it with
a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

486
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,015
Spiders?

487
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:14,416
Liesl, were you out walking
all by yourself?

488
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:25,535
If we wash that dress tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.

489
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,040
You could put this on.

490
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,476
Take your dress and put it
to soak in the bathtub.

491
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,175
Come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

492
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,547
I told you today
I didn't need a governess.

493
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,850
Well, maybe I do.

494
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,848
Gretl, are you scared?

495
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,694
You're not frightened
of a storm, are you?

496
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,129
You just stay right here with me.

497
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,567
- Where are the others?
- They're asleep. They're not scared.

498
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,808
Oh, no? Look.

499
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,303
All right, up here on the bed.

500
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,313
- Really?
- Well, just this once. Come on.

501
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,743
- Now we'll wait for the boys.
- You won't see them. Boys are brave.

502
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,627
You weren't scared, were you?

503
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,398
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

504
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,462
- That's very thoughtful of you.
- It wasn't my idea.

505
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,605
It was Kurt's!

506
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:08,470
Kurt! That's the one I left out!
God bless Kurt.

507
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,044
Why does it do that?

508
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:17,139
The lightning talks to the thunder,
and the thunder answers.

509
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,912
- But lightning must be nasty.
- Not really.

510
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,421
Why does the thunder get so angry?

511
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,854
It makes me want to cry.

512
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,855
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,
I just try to think of nice things.

513
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,931
What kind of things?

514
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,660
Well, let me see. Nice things...

515
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:36,963
Daffodils.

516
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,674
Green meadows.

517
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,305
Skies full of stars.

518

<i>Raindrops on roses

<i>Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens</i>

520
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,482
<i>Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings</i>

521
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,656

522

And schnitzel with noodles</i>

<i>I simply remember my favorite things</i>

534
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:43,930
<i>And then I don't feel so bad</i>

535
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,703
- Does it work?
- Of course.

536
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,899
- What do you like?
- Pussy willow!

537
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,876
- Christmas!
- Bunny rabbits!

538

- Chocolate icing!
- No school!

540
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,648
Pillow fights!

541
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,879
- Telegrams!
- Birthday presents!

542
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,589
- Any presents!
- Ladybugs!

543
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,458
A good sneeze!

544
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,526
Gesundheit!

545
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,026

Hello.

562
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:10,253
Fräulein, did I not tell you that
bedtime is to be strictly observed?

563
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,258
The children were upset
by the storm, so I--

564
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,622
You did, sir.

565
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:20,064
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

566
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,965
Only during thunderstorms.

567
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,965
- Liesl?
- Yes, Father?

568
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,440
I don't recall seeing you
after dinner.

569
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,776
Really? As a matter of fact--

570
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,243
Yes?

571
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,210
Well, I was--

572
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,579
What she would like to say...

573
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,620
...is that she and I have
been getting acquainted tonight.

574
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:45,715
It's too late to go into that. You
heard your father. Go back to bed.

575
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,766
Fräulein...

576
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:56,131
...you have managed to remember
I'm leaving in the morning?

577
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:01,770
Is it also possible you remember the
first rule in this house is discipline?

578
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,937
Then I trust that before I return...

579
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,180
...you'll have acquired some?

580
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,952
Captain?

581
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,780
Could I talk to you about clothes
for the children for when they play?

582
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,790
- If I could have some material.
- You are many things.

583
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,156
Not the least of which is repetitious.

584
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,559
- But they're children!
- Yes.

585
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,528
And I'm their father.

586
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,363
Good night.

Children, over here. See!

Come on.

595
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,308
Fräulein Maria?

596
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,469
Can we do this every day?

597
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,947
- Don't you think you'd get tired of it?
- I suppose so.

Every other day?

599
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:36,351
I haven't had so much fun since we put
glue on Fräulein Josephine's toothbrush.

600

I can't understand how children
as nice as you can play such tricks.

601
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,595
- It's easy.
- But why do it?

602
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,221
How else can we get
Father's attention?

603
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,593
Oh, I see.

604
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,167
We'll have to think about that one.

00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,835
Think of a song for the baroness.

608
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,071
Father doesn't like us to sing.

609
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:04,912
Perhaps we can change his mind.
Now, what songs do you know?

610
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,316
We don't know any songs.

611
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:10,253
- Not any?
- We don't even know how to sing.

612
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,088
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,126
<i>Do-re-mi</i>

624
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,525
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti</i>

625
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,162
Let's see if I can make it easier.

626
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,166
<i>"Doe," a deer
A female deer</i>

627
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,841
<i>"Ray," a drop of golden sun</i>

628
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:09,109
<i>"Me," a name I call myself</i>

629
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,417
<i>"Far," a long, long way to run</i>

630
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,256
<i>"Sew," a needle pulling thread</i>

631
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:21,258
<i>"La," a note to follow sew</i>

632
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,690
<i>"Tea," a drink with jam and bread</i>

633
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:29,228
<i>That will bring us back to doe
Oh, oh, oh</i>

634
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,936
- <i>Doe!</i>
- <i>A deer, a female deer</i>

635
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:36,334
- <i>Ray!</i>
- <i>A drop of golden sun</i>

636
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,140
- <i>Me!</i>
- <i>A name I call myself</i>

637
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,709
- <i>Far!</i>
- <i>A long, long way to run</i>

638
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,644
<i>Sew, a needle pulling thread</i>

639
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,088
- <i>La!</i>
- <i>A note to follow sew</i>

640
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,516
- <i>Tea</i>
- <i>A drink with jam and bread</i>

641
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,891
<i>That will bring us back to</i>

642
00:58:57,267 --> 00:59:00,259
- <i>Doe</i>
- <i>A deer, a female deer</i>

643
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,033
<i>Ray, a drop of golden sun</i>

644
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,534
<i>Me, a name I call myself</i>

645
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:11,071
<i>Far, a long, long way to run</i>

646
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,579
<i>Sew, a needle pulling thread</i>

647
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:18,116
<i>La, a note to follow sew</i>

648
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,082
<i>Tea, a drink with jam and bread</i>

649
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:25,249
<i>That will bring us back to doe</i>

650
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,425
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do</i>

651
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:33,928
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only
the tools we use to build a song.

652
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:37,434
Once you have them in your head
you can sing different tunes...

653
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,767
...by mixing them up. Like this:

654
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:46,066
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

655
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,841
Can you do that?

656
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:53,283
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

657
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:59,114
<i>So-do-la-ti-do-re-do</i>

658
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:04,985
<i>So-do-la-ti-do-re-do</i>

659
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,997
Now, put it all together.

660
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:13,493
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

661
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:20,041
<i>So-do-la-ti-do-re-do</i>

662
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,245
- Good.
- But it doesn't mean anything.

663
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:26,444
So we put in words.
One word for every note.

664
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:27,951
Like this:

665
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:34,323
<i>When you know the notes to sing</i>

666
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:40,664
<i>You can sing most anything</i>

667
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,894
Together!

668
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:48,499
<i>When you know the notes to sing</i>

669
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:55,678
<i>You can sing most anything</i>

670
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,216
- <i>Doe</i>
- <i>A deer, a female deer</i>

671
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,786
- <i>Ray</i>
- <i>A drop of golden sun</i>

672
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:06,218
- <i>Me</i>
- <i>A name I call myself</i>

673
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:09,554
- <i>Far</i>
- <i>A long long way to run</i>

674
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:13,197
- <i>Sew</i>
- <i>A needle pulling thread</i>

675
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:16,735
- <i>La</i>
- <i>A note to follow sew</i>

676
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,895
- <i>Tea</i>
- <i>A drink with jam and bread</i>

677
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,203
<i>That will bring us back to doe</i>

678
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,074
- <i>Do</i>
- <i>Re</i>

679
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:25,942
- <i>Mi</i>
- <i>Fa</i>

680
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:26,843
- <i>So</i>

01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,052

01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,425

<i>Doe!

01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,605
<i>Ray!
A drop of golden sun</i>

697
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,048
<i>Me!
A name I call myself</i>

698
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,285
<i>Far!
A long long way to run</i>

699
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:13,158
<i>Sew!
A needle pulling thread</i>

700
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,593
<i>La!
A note to follow sew</i>

701
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,797
<i>Tea!
A drink with jam and bread</i>

702
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,800
<i>That will bring us back to</i>

703
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:30,639
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

704
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,510
<i>So-do-la-fa-ti</i>

01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,380
<i>La-so</i>

01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,079
<i>Fa</i>

01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,745
<i>Mi-re</i>

01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:46,919
<i>Ti-do</i>

709
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:47,494
<i>So-do!</i>

710
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,239
The mountains are magnificent,
really magnificent.

711
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:08,143
- I had them put up just for you.
- Oh?

712
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,612
Even if it's to a height
of 10,000 feet...

713
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:14,379
...Georg always believes in
"rising to the occasion."

714
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,956
Unless the jokes improve,
I'm taking back my invitation.

715
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,121
You didn't invite me.
I invited myself.

716
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,921
- Naturally.
- You needed a chaperone...

717
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,896
...and I needed a place
where the cuisine is superb...

718
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,797
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

719
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,666
...and the price perfect.

720
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,906
Max, you are outrageous.

721
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,136
Not at all.
I'm a very charming sponge.

722
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:41,910
Listen.

723
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,484
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

724
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,050
They're good.

725
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,788
Very good.

726
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,192
I must explore this area
in the next few days.

727
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,925
Somewhere, a hungry singing group
is waiting for Max Detweiler...

728
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,459
...to pluck it out and make it famous
at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

729
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,008
- They get fame, you get money.
- It's unfair, I admit it.

730
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:13,569
But someday that'll be changed.
I shall get the fame too.

731
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,817
Good heavens, what's this?

732
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,525
It's nothing.
Just some local urchins.

733
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:45,702
This really is exciting for me, Georg.
Being here with you.

734
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,075
Trees, lakes,
you've seen them before.

735
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,980
That is not what I mean,
and you know it.

736
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:56,180
- You mean me? I'm exciting?
- Is that so impossible?

737
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,485
No, just highly improbable.

738
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:03,859
- There you go, running yourself down.
- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

739
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,368
You're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.

740
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,407
- In my natural habitat?
- Yes, exactly.

741
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,805
Are you saying that I'm more
at home...

742
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:21,072
...among the birds and the flowers
and the wind that moves...

743
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,512
...through the trees
like a restless sea?

744
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,311
How poetic.

745
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,419
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

746
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:33,654
More at home here than in Vienna
in all your glittering salons...

747
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:38,253
...gossiping gaily with bores I detest,
soaking myself in champagne...

748
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:42,265
...stumbling about to waltzes
by Strausses I can't even remember?

749
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,631
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

750
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,239
Now whatever gave you that idea?

751
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,470
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It's so lovely and peaceful.

752
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,773
How can you leave it so often?

753
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,851
Oh, pretending to be madly active,
I suppose.

754
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,319
Activity suggests a life
filled with purpose.

755
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,356
Could it be running away
from memories?

756
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,489
Or perhaps just searching
for a reason to stay.

757
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,662
I hope that's why you've been
coming to Vienna so often.

758
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:22,664
- Were there other distractions?
- I'd hardly call you a distraction.

759
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:25,607
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

760
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,147
Lovely...

761
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,712
...charming, witty, graceful,
the perfect hostess...

762
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,822
...and, you're going to hate me
for this...

763
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,318
...in a way, my savior.

764
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,391
Oh, how unromantic.

765
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,961
I'd be an ungrateful wretch
if I didn't say...

766
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,464
...that you brought some meaning back
into my life.

767
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,034
I am amusing, I suppose.

768
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:56,030
I have the finest couturier in Vienna
and a glittering circle of friends.

769
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:59,373
- I do give some rather gay parties.
- Oh, yes.

770
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,479
But take all that away...

771
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:06,041
...and you have just wealthy,
unattached little me...

772
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,179
...searching, just like you.

773
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:15,992
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

774
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,756
- How many have I had?
- Two.

775
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,922
Make it an uneven three.

776
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,265
Still eating, Max?
Must be unhappy.

777
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:30,434
That mixed quartet I've been trying
to steal away from Sol Hurok.

778
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,375
- What happened?
- Sascha Petrie stole them first.

779
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:34,879
I hate thieves.

780
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:38,416
Max, you really must try
and learn to love yourself.

781
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,019
I had to call Paris, Rome
and Stockholm.

782
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:44,852
- On Georg's telephone, of course.
- How else could I afford it?

783
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:50,425
I like rich people, the way they live
and how I live when I'm with them.

784
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,724
I wonder where the children are.

785
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,694
They must have heard
I was coming and hid.

786
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:58,429
I was hoping they'd be here
to welcome you.

787
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:03,201
Max, do step out of character for
a moment and try and be charming.

788
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,619
Well?

789
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:15,751
Well what?

790
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,882
Have you made up his mind?
Do I hear wedding bells?

791
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,119
- Pealing madly.
- Marvelous.

792
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,093
- Not necessarily for me.
- What kind of talk's that?

793
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,927
None-of-your-business talk.

794
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,693
I'm terribly fond of him,
so don't toy with us.

795
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,499
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So tell me everything.

796
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:37,906
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,
intimate, disgusting detail.

797
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:43,478
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.

798
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,778
- I approve of that. How can you miss?
- Far too easily.

799
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:50,253
If I know you, darling,
and I do, you will find a way.

800
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,018
- He's no ordinary man.
- No, he's rich.

801
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,525
His wife's death gave him
a great heartache.

802
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,858
And your husband's death
gave you a great fortune.

803
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,023
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

804
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,297
You and Georg are like family.
That's why I want to see you married.

805
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,103
We must keep all that lovely money
in the family.

806
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,319
- What are you doing there?
- Oh, Captain von Trapp.

807
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,623
I was just looking for...

808
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,333
I didn't see, I mean,
I didn't know you were--

809
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,633
Heil Hitler!

810
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,829
Who are you?

811
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:41,338
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

812
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,342
- I am Herr Detweiler.
- Yes, sir.

813
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,047
You've delivered your telegram.
Now get out.

814
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:02,150
- Georg, he's just a boy.
- Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

815
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,197
Things will happen.
Make sure they don't happen to you.

816
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:08,164
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

817
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,599
I have no political convictions.

818
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,728
- Can I help it if other people do?
- You can help it.

819
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,072
You must help it.

820
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:28,947
Hello?

821
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,393
You're far away. Where are you?

822
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,554
In a world that's disappearing,
I'm afraid.

823
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,928
Is there any way I could bring you
back to the world I'm in?

824
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,422
- Father! Father!
- There's your father!

825
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,863
Oh, captain, you're home!

826
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,907
Come out of that water at once!

827
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,152
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

828
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,490
I'm soaked to the skin!

829
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,844
Straight line!

830
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,952
This is Baroness Schraeder.

831
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,331
And these...

832
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,197
...are my children.

833
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,729
How do you do?

834
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:30,540
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change
your clothes and report back here!

835
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,644
Fräulein, you will stay here, please!

836
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,949
I think I'd better go see
what Max is up to.

837
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,965
Now, fräulein...

838
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,897
...I want a truthful answer.

839
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,774
Yes, captain.

840
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:05,172
Is it possible,
or could I have just imagined it?

841
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:11,107
Have my children, by any chance,
been climbing trees today?

842
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,780
Yes, captain.

843
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,186
I see.

844
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:20,252
And where, may I ask,
did they get these...?

845
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,588
- Play clothes.
- Is that what they are?

846
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:26,222
I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.

847
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,128
- Drapes?
- They have plenty of wear left.

848
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,259
We've been everywhere in them.

849
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:36,034
Are you telling me that my children
have been roaming about Salzburg...

850
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,578
...dressed up in nothing
but some old drapes?

851
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,443
And having a marvelous time!

852
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,915
- They have uniforms.
- Forgive me, straitjackets.

853
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,918
They can't be children
if they worry about clothes--

854
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,283
They don't complain.

855
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,254
They don't dare.
They love you too much and fear--

856
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,053
Don't discuss my children.

857
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,151
You've got to hear,
you're never home--

858
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,888
I don't want to hear more!

859
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,625
I know you don't, but you've got to!

860
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,598
- Liesl's not a child.
- Not one word--

861
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,728
Soon she'll be a woman
and you won't even know her.

862
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,069
Friedrich wants to be a man
but you're not here to show--

863
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,677
Don't you dare tell me--

864
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,145
Brigitta could tell you about him.
She notices everything.

865
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,545
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain
when you ignore him...

866
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,278
...the way you do all of them.

867
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,945
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

868
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,423
The little ones just want love.
Please, love them all.

869
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,186
I don't care to hear more.

870
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:32,560
- I am not finished yet, captain!
- Oh, yes, you are, captain!

871
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,160
Fräulein.

872
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,670
You will pack
your things this minute...

873
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,367
...and return to the abbey.

874
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,346
What's that?

875
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,108
It's singing.

876
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,584
Yes, I realize it's singing.
But who is singing?

877
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,115
The children.

878
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,325
The children?

879
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,627
I taught them something to sing
for the baroness.

880
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:15,302
<i>My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears</i>

881
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,138
<i>Every song that it hears</i>

882
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:23,841
<i>My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise</i>

883
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,213
<i>From the lake to the trees</i>

884
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,888
<i>To the trees</i>

885
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:33,890
<i>My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies</i>

886
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:38,188
<i>From a church on a breeze</i>

887
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:43,061
<i>To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls</i>

888
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:46,262
<i>Over stones on its way</i>

889
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,873
<i>On its way</i>

890
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,169
<i>To sing through the night</i>

891
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:58,514
<i>Like a lark who is learning to pray</i>

892
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:02,918
<i>I go to the hills</i>

893
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:08,452
<i>When my heart is lonely</i>

894
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:13,459
<i>I know I will hear</i>

895
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:19,727
<i>What I've heard before</i>

896
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:24,774
<i>My heart will be blessed</i>

897
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:31,407
<i>With the sound of music</i>

898
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:37,712
<i>And I'll sing</i>

899
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:45,222
<i>Once more</i>

900
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,398
Edelweiss!

901
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,470
You never told me how enchanting
your children are.

902
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,711
Don't go away.

903
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,191
Fräulein.

904
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:49,757
I...

905
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,997
...behaved badly. I apologize.

906
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:59,331
I'm far too outspoken.
It's one of my worst faults.

907
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,265
You were right.

908
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,600
I don't know my children.

909
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:11,011
There's still time, captain.
They want so much to be close to you.

910
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:15,210
And you brought music back
into the house.

911
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,015
I'd forgotten.

912
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,094
Fräulein.

913
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,830
I want you to stay.

914
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,602
I ask you to stay.

915
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:37,935
- If I could be of any help.
- You have already.

916
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,537
More than you know.

917
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:00,732
Marta.

918
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,700
Curtain!

919
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,467
<i>High on a hill was a lonely goatherd</i>

920
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:10,031
<i>Lay odl lay odl lay hee hoo</i>

921
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,134
<i>Loud was the voice
Of the lonely goatherd</i>

922
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,406
<i>Lay odl lay odl loo</i>

923
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,975
<i>Folks in a town
That was quite remote heard</i>

924
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,541
<i>Lay odl lay odl lay hee hoo</i>

925
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,780
<i>Lusty and clear
From the goatherd's throat heard</i>

926
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:23,879
<i>Lay odl lay odl loo</i>

927
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:29,053
<i>Ho ho lady odlee ho
Ho ho lady odl lay</i>

928
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:33,395
<i>Ho ho lady odl lee ho
Lady odl lee ho lay</i>

929
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:37,424
Marta. Marta!

930
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:41,799
Gretl, the prince!

931
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,808
<i>A prince on the bridge
Of a castle moat heard</i>

<i>Lay odl lay odl lay hee hoo</i>

01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,414
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

974
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,114
Very good!

975
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,850
Wonderful!

976
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,593
- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?
- Yes, can we?

977
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,859
Of course you may, my darlings.

978
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:25,267
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?

979
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,705
Well done, fräulein.

980
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:35,102
I really am very much impressed.

981
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,374
They're your children, captain.

982
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:46,891
My dear, is there anything
you can't do?

983
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,460
Well, I'm not sure
I'll make a good nun.

984
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:52,792
If you have any problems,
I'd be happy to help you.

985
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:57,336
Attention, everyone!

986
01:22:57,572 --> 01:23:00,962
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise! Surprise!

987
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,574
Today, after a long
and desperate search...

988
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:08,806
...I have found a most exciting
entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

989
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,847
Congratulations, Max.

990
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:14,077
And who will you
be exploiting this time?

991
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:19,089
- The Saint Ignatius Choir?
- Guess again.

992
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,685
Well, let me see now.
The Klopmann Choir?

993
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:26,297
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no?

994
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:27,762
Tell us.

995
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:31,427
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

996
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,562
What a charming idea!

997
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,606
Whose family?

998
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:39,106
Yours.

999
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,612
They'll be the talk of the festival.

1000
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,478
- Well, now, what's so funny?
- You are, Max.

1001
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:50,850
You're expensive, but very funny.

1002
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,958
- They'll be a sensation!
- No, Max.

1003
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,356
It's a wonderful idea.
Fresh, original.

1004
01:23:56,598 --> 01:24:01,388
Max! My children
do not sing in public.

1005
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,025
You can't blame me for trying.

1006
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,231
Children, who shall we hear
from next?

1007
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,205
Who?

1008
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:18,614
Yes.

1009
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:23,377
The vote is unanimous.

1010
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,817
You, captain.

1011
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,255
Me?

1012
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,393
- I don't understand.
- Please.

1013
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:38,731
No, no, no, no.

1014
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:41,032
I'm told that you were quite good.

1015
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,575
- That was a very, very long time ago.
- I remember, Father.

1016
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:47,701
- Play us something we know.
- Oh, please, Father.

1017
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,677
Well...

1018
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:04,124
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

1019
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,731
To bring along my harmonica.

1020
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,829
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1021

1046
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:22,463
Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act:

1047
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:25,195
The von Trapp Family Singers.

1048
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:28,765
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1049
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,466
Let's really fill this house
with music.

1050
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,704
You must give a grand
and glorious party for me.

1051
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:37,645
- A party?
- Yes, Father, please!

1052
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:40,251
It's high time
I met all your friends...

1053
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:43,048
...and they met me.
Don't you agree?

1054
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,555
- I see what you mean.
- Oh, please!

1055
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,956
Children, it's bedtime.
Come now, say good night.

1056
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:51,159
Good night, Father.

1057
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,230
- Good night.
- Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

1058
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:56,061
Good night, Father.

1059
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,872
Good night, Uncle Max.

1060
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:05,940
It'll be my first party, Father!

1061
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,107
- Captain.
- Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

1062
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,444
- Good evening, Herr Zeller.
- Baroness.

1063
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,211
How do you do? Good evening.

1064
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,233
Did you notice the obvious
display of the Austrian flag?

1065
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,151
The women look so beautiful.

1066
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:22,686
I think they look ugly.

1067
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,821
You're just scared of them.

1068
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:27,324
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1069
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:31,490
- I think the men look beautiful.
- How would you know?

1070
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,741
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1071
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,612
Nobody.

1072
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,343
Oh, yes, you are.

1073
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,282
May I have this dance?

1074
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:02,018
I'd be delighted, young man.

1075
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,432
Why didn't you tell me
you could dance?

1076
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:16,598
We feared you'd make us all dance.
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1077
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,743
What are they playing?

1078
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,578
It's the Laendler.
An Austrian folk dance.

1079
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,950
- Show me.
- I haven't danced since I was little.

1080
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,113
You remember. Please?

1081
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,314
- Well...
- Please.

1082
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,789
All right. Come on over here.

1083
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:39,130
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1084
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:43,025
- Like this?
- Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1085
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,933
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1086
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:50,806
One, two, three, step together.
Now, step hop, step hop.

1087
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:53,740
Now turn under. Not quite.

1088
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:57,907
This way. Hop step, hop.
And under.

1089
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,281
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1090
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:01,978
Do allow me, will you?

1091
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,172
I don't remember anymore.

1092
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,547
- Your face is all red.
- Is it?

1093
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:39,945
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1094
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,681
Why, that was beautifully done.

1095
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:46,848
What a lovely couple you make.

1096
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,188
It's time the children
said good night.

1097
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:50,761
We'll be in the hall.

1098
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,887
- We have something special prepared.
- Right!

1099
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,362
Yes, come on!

1100
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,541
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1101
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,805
You thought you wouldn't find
a friend at the party.

1102
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:14,278
- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1103
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,546
It seemed rather warm to me.

1104
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:21,953
Ladies and gentlemen.

1105
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:26,791
The children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

1106
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:44,813
<i>There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall</i>

1107
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:48,648
<i>And the bells in the steeple too</i>

1108
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:53,011
<i>And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird</i>

1109
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,717
<i>Is popping out to say "coo-coo"</i>

1110
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:57,362
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1111
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:59,093
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1112
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:01,494
- <i>Regretfully, they tell us</i>
- <i>Coo-coo</i>

1113
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:03,101
- <i>But firmly they compel us</i>
- <i>Coo-coo</i>

1114
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:06,370
- <i>To say goodbye</i>
- <i>Coo-coo</i>

1115
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:11,938
<i>To you</i>

1116
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:18,978
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night</i>

1117
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:23,048
<i>I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight</i>

1118
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:33,664
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu</i>

1119
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,858
<i>Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you</i>

1120
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:49,008
<i>So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen</i>

1121
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:53,275
<i>I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne</i>

1122
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,910
- Yes?
- No.

1123
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:03,884
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1124
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:08,229
<i>I leave and heave a sigh
And say goodbye</i>

1125
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:12,429
<i>Goodbye</i>

1126
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:18,565
<i>I'm glad to go</i>

1127
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:21,679
<i>I cannot tell a lie</i>

1128
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,711
<i>I flit, I float</i>

1129
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:28,750
<i>I fleetly flee, I fly</i>

1130
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:44,521
<i>The sun has gone to bed</i>

1131
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:48,469
<i>And so must I</i>

1132
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:51,098
<i>So long</i>

1133
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:53,903
<i>Farewell</i>

1134
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:59,542
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1135
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:05,084
<i>Goodbye</i>

1136
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:11,116
<i>Goodbye</i>

1137
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:17,855
<i>Goodbye</i>

1138
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:26,103
<i>Goodbye</i>

1139
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:35,016
Extraordinary!
What they'd do at the festival.

1140
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,712
Young lady,
I must have a word with you.

1141
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:42,787
Georg, you won't let this girl get away.
She must join the party.

1142
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,453
- No, really I--
- Stop. Stop it now.

1143
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,657
- Georg, please.
- You can if you want to, fräulein.

1144
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:51,360
I insist.
You will be my dinner partner.

1145
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,494
This is business. Franz...

1146
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:56,938
...set another place next to mine
for Fräulein Maria.

1147
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:01,843
- Whatever you say.
- It appears to be all arranged.

1148
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:04,471
- It does.
- I'm not suitably dressed.

1149
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:07,077
You can change. We'll wait.

1150
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:13,546
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

1151
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:14,751
I am, thank you.

1152
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:19,490
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in our country...

1153
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:23,191
...than the innocent voices
of our children?

1154
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,970
Oh, come now, baron.

1155
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:28,972
Would you have us believe that Austria
holds a monopoly on virtue?

1156
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:33,974
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song...

1157
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:36,581
...to ugly German threats.

1158
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,246
The ostrich buries his head
in the sand...

1159
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,411
...and sometimes in the flag.

1160
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:49,190
Perhaps those who would warn you that
the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1161
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:53,127
...would get further with you by setting
their words to music.

1162
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:57,997
If the Nazis take over Austria, you
will be the entire trumpet section.

1163
01:37:58,305 --> 01:37:59,363
You flatter me.

1164
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:04,264
Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.

1165
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:14,543
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, baroness.

1166
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:16,382
I'm delighted, Maria.

1167
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:20,556
I really don't think I have anything
that would be appropriate.

1168
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:25,124
Now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening?

1169
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:28,664
When the captain couldn't keep
his eyes off you.

1170
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,903
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1171
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:37,040
Come, my dear, we are women.

1172
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:40,611
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1173
01:38:40,848 --> 01:38:44,306
- Here we are.
- The captain notices everybody.

1174
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:47,343
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1175
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,977
You are quite attractive, you know.

1176
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:53,920
The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

1177
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:57,851
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1178
01:38:58,332 --> 01:38:59,594
Not at all.

1179
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:01,425
I've never done a thing to--

1180
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:03,296
You don't have to, my dear.

1181
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:08,693
Nothing's more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

1182
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:12,468
- In love with him?
- Of course.

1183
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:16,804
What makes it so nice is
he thinks he's in love with you.

1184
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,147
But that's not true.

1185
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:25,015
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1186
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:30,184
And you know, you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1187
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,160
Don't take it to heart.

1188
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,698
He'll get over it soon enough,
I think.

1189
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,892
Men do, you know.

1190
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:39,997
Then I should go.

1191
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:42,832
I mustn't stay here.

1192
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,676
- Is there something I can do to help?
- No, nothing.

1193
01:39:58,525 --> 01:39:59,719
Yes.

1194
01:40:00,728 --> 01:40:02,753
Don't say a word to the captain.

1195
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:07,925
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1196
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,335
Goodbye, Maria.

1197
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:19,908
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1198
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:51,934
Champagne, darling.

1199
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:56,304
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1200
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:04,711
- You know something.
- Perhaps.

1201
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:09,486
If you're so clever, tell me how to
get fräulein to influence Georg.

1202
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:12,391
I want those children in the festival.

1203
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,098
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1204
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:17,064
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1205
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:18,828
I thought of that.

1206
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:21,597
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1207
01:41:21,775 --> 01:41:24,699
...maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1208
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,382
- Two.
- Three.

1209
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,110
- Four.
- Five.

1210
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:58,415
- Six.
- Seven.

1211
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:00,250
Eight.

1212
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,357
- Four.
- Two.

1213
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:05,294
- Seven.
- Five.

1214
01:45:05,532 --> 01:45:07,762
- Two.
- Six.

1215
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:14,431
Isn't this fun?

1216
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,199
- Four.
- I'm number five.

1217
01:45:18,445 --> 01:45:20,606
- Oh, yes.
- Eight.

1218
01:45:20,881 --> 01:45:23,247
- Two.
- Four.

1219
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:24,878
Six.

1220
01:45:27,387 --> 01:45:28,615
Two.

1221
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:32,714
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind
if we stop now? We're tired.

1222
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,915
Whatever you want, dear.

1223
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,153
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1224
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,536
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1225
01:45:50,577 --> 01:45:52,169
Have some lemonade.

1226
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:54,846
There must be an easier way.

1227
01:45:56,249 --> 01:45:59,548
I get a fiendish delight thinking
of you as the mother of seven.

1228
01:46:00,487 --> 01:46:02,318
How do you plan to do it?

1229
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:04,614
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1230
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:07,986
...of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

1231
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:11,360
Baroness Machiavelli.

1232
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:14,690
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1233
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:16,799
I think he's in the house.

1234
01:46:17,003 --> 01:46:19,563
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pussies?

1235
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:22,502
- Nothing.
- I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1236
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:23,700
What for?

1237
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:26,368
Let's make believe we're on-stage
at the festival.

1238
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:30,470
- I don't feel like singing.
- Not without Fräulein Maria.

1239
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:33,106
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1240
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:36,311
Everybody into the group.
Get in your places.

1241
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:39,320
Now be cheerful, right?
Give us the key, Liesl.

1242
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:43,890
Now, impress me.

1243
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:49,232
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1244
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:54,496
- I can't. I've got a sore finger.
- But you sang so beautifully at the party.

1245
01:46:56,676 --> 01:47:00,339
Come on, all of you. Try something
you know. Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1246
01:47:00,614 --> 01:47:02,206
All right, Liesl.

1247
01:47:04,184 --> 01:47:09,008
<i>The hills are alive</i>

1248
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:17,080
<i>With the sound of music</i>

1249
01:47:18,698 --> 01:47:22,964
<i>With songs they have sung</i>

1250
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:31,467
<i>For a thousand years</i>

1251
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:37,609
<i>The hills fill my heart</i>

1252
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:44,511
<i>With the sound of music</i>

1253
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,853
They wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

1254
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,017
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop.

1255
01:47:55,035 --> 01:47:58,926
- Something long and cool, Georg?
- No, thank you, darling.

1256
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:01,738
- Father?
- Yes, Brigitta?

1257
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:04,506
Is it true Fräulein Maria
isn't coming back?

1258
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:07,872
Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?

1259
01:48:08,215 --> 01:48:12,914
- Pink lemonade.
- Laced with lemonade.

1260
01:48:13,653 --> 01:48:15,143
I don't believe it, Father.

1261
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:18,581
- What?
- About Fräulein Maria.

1262
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:20,221
Oh, Fräulein Maria!

1263
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,952
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

1264
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:27,223
She said she missed her life
at the abbey.

1265
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:29,662
She had to leave us.

1266
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:31,462
And that's all there is to it.

1267
01:48:33,206 --> 01:48:35,868
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

1268
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:38,806
- She didn't even say goodbye.
- She did in her note.

1269
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,910
That isn't the same thing.

1270
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:42,808
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1271
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:45,574
Just too pink.

1272
01:48:46,987 --> 01:48:50,115
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

1273
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:57,787
Well...

1274
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:05,423
...you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1275
01:49:05,772 --> 01:49:08,400
- We're not?
- No.

1276
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:12,771
You're going to have a new mother.

1277
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:15,906
A new mother?

1278
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:19,844
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

1279
01:49:20,086 --> 01:49:22,782
And we're all going to be very happy.

1280
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:58,280
Well, all right, all right.
Run off and play.

1281
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:31,214
Yes, my children?

1282
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:33,780
- My name is Liesl.
- Yes, Liesl?

1283
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:38,219
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see Fräulein Maria.

1284
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:41,390
Fräulein Maria?

1285
01:50:42,102 --> 01:50:44,093
Oh, Maria.

1286
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:47,870
Come in, please.

1287
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:53,301
Wait here.

1288
01:51:04,224 --> 01:51:07,421
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

1289
01:51:07,694 --> 01:51:10,185
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here?

1290
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:13,024
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- But you've got to!

1291
01:51:13,266 --> 01:51:15,359
- She's our governess.
- We want her back.

1292
01:51:15,568 --> 01:51:17,456
She didn't even say goodbye.

1293
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:19,466
All we want to do is talk to her.

1294
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:23,128
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in seclusion.

1295
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:26,470
- She hasn't been seeing anyone.
- She'll see us.

1296
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:29,237
I want to show her my finger.

1297
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:31,280
Some other time, dear.

1298
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:32,915
I'll tell her you were here.

1299
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:36,247
- It was sweet of you to call.
- We have to speak to her!

1300
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:39,984
Run along, children.
Run along home.

1301
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:41,887
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1302
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:44,392
Sister Margaretta, please.

1303
01:51:44,597 --> 01:51:48,363
- Goodbye, children.
- Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1304
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:52,866
What was that about, Sister?

1305
01:51:53,106 --> 01:51:55,267
The von Trapp children,
Reverend Mother.

1306
01:51:55,508 --> 01:51:57,999
They want to see Maria.

1307
01:51:58,244 --> 01:52:00,576
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

1308
01:52:00,814 --> 01:52:04,807
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1309
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:06,109
Poor child.

1310
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:09,244
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here...

1311
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:12,754
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1312
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:17,121
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1313
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:20,025
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1314
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:21,927
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1315
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,967
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant
to the robing room.

1316
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:34,208
God bless you, my daughter.

1317
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:42,148
Yes, bring her in.

1318
01:52:51,197 --> 01:52:53,427
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1319
01:52:55,468 --> 01:52:56,662
Reverend Mother.

1320
01:52:57,036 --> 01:52:59,664
Why did they send you back to us?

1321
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:02,463
They didn't send me back. I left.

1322
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:06,536
Sit down, Maria.

1323
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:08,843
Tell me what happened.

1324
01:53:14,053 --> 01:53:15,350
I was frightened.

1325
01:53:15,588 --> 01:53:20,082
- Frightened? Were they unkind to you?
- Oh, no!

1326
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,057
No, I was confused. I felt...

1327
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:27,591
I've never felt that way before.

1328
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:31,598
I couldn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1329
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:36,570
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

1330
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:39,073
What is it you can't face?

1331
01:53:41,047 --> 01:53:42,480
I can't face him again.

1332
01:53:43,283 --> 01:53:44,773
Him?

1333
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:48,478
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1334
01:53:58,064 --> 01:53:59,725
Captain von Trapp?

1335
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:07,868
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!

1336
01:54:08,107 --> 01:54:09,540
I don't know. I--

1337
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:13,931
The baroness said I was.
She said that he was in love with me.

1338
01:54:14,214 --> 01:54:16,808
But I didn't want to believe it.

1339
01:54:17,951 --> 01:54:20,215
There were times we looked
at each other.

1340
01:54:20,453 --> 01:54:22,011
I could hardly breathe.

1341
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:25,086
- Did you let him see your feelings?
- I don't know.

1342
01:54:25,658 --> 01:54:28,320
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

1343
01:54:28,561 --> 01:54:33,521
To have asked for his love would have
been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1344
01:54:35,668 --> 01:54:38,523
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1345
01:54:39,405 --> 01:54:42,465
- Please help me.
- Maria.

1346
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:48,742
The love of a man and a woman is holy.
You have a great capacity to love.

1347
01:54:48,982 --> 01:54:51,906
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your love.

1348
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:56,042
But I pledged my life to God.
I pledged my life to his service.

1349
01:54:56,256 --> 01:55:00,613
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

1350
01:55:02,295 --> 01:55:04,160
No.

1351
01:55:04,364 --> 01:55:06,252
You must find out.

1352
01:55:08,001 --> 01:55:10,492
You must go back.

1353
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:13,625
You can't ask me to do that.
Please let me stay. I beg--

1354
01:55:15,942 --> 01:55:19,571
These walls were not built
to shut out problems.

1355
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:21,337
You have to face them.

1356
01:55:21,948 --> 01:55:25,179
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

1357
01:55:31,057 --> 01:55:34,788
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

<i>Your dream</i>

1382
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:45,248
Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

1383
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:47,551
We're not being secretive, Father.

1384
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:52,595
And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.

1385
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:56,290
- We lost track of the time.
- I see.

1386
01:57:57,103 --> 01:58:00,493
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1387
01:58:00,773 --> 01:58:02,798
Brigitta. Liesl.

1388
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:06,405
Where do you think we were, Father?

1389
01:58:13,019 --> 01:58:16,978
If you don't believe us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

1390
01:58:20,593 --> 01:58:22,356
- Marta.
- Yes, Father.

1391
01:58:22,595 --> 01:58:23,823
You tell me.

1392
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:28,794
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1393
01:58:29,635 --> 01:58:34,265
- I forgot! You were berry picking.
- Yes, we love berry picking.

1394
01:58:34,607 --> 01:58:35,733
All afternoon?

1395
01:58:35,975 --> 01:58:37,670
- We picked thousands.
- Thousands?

1396
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:40,801
- They were all over the place.
- What kind of berries?

1397
01:58:41,047 --> 01:58:44,346
- Blueberries, sir.
- Blueberries.

1398
01:58:46,285 --> 01:58:49,641
It's too early for blueberries.

1399
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:53,183
- They were strawberries.
- Strawberries?

1400
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:56,656
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

1401
01:59:02,468 --> 01:59:04,663
Very well. Show me the berries.

1402
01:59:05,872 --> 01:59:07,134
- We...
- Well...

1403
01:59:07,373 --> 01:59:10,137
- Show me the berries you picked.
- We don't have them.

1404
01:59:10,376 --> 01:59:12,640
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

1405
01:59:12,879 --> 01:59:15,677
- We...
- We ate them.

1406
01:59:15,882 --> 01:59:18,476
- You ate them?
- Yes!

1407
01:59:18,684 --> 01:59:20,276
- They were so good.
- Delicious.

1408
01:59:20,486 --> 01:59:21,714
Very well.

1409
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:27,085
Since you've obviously stuffed
yourselves on thousands of berries...

1410
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,285
...you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1411
01:59:31,531 --> 01:59:34,386
...to skip your dinner.

1412
01:59:43,576 --> 01:59:46,340
It's your fault.
We should have told him the truth.

1413
01:59:46,579 --> 01:59:48,570
And made him boiling mad at us?

1414
01:59:48,814 --> 01:59:50,702
It's better than starving to death.

1415
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:53,805
We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1416
01:59:55,121 --> 01:59:58,249
My stomach's making noises.

1417
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:01,524
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

1418
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:05,586
- I wonder what grass tastes like.
- I feel awful.

1419
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,299
When Fräulein Maria wanted to feel
better she used to sing that song.

1420
02:00:11,904 --> 02:00:13,394
Let's try it.

1421
02:00:13,606 --> 02:00:16,268
<i>Raindrops on roses</i>

1422
02:00:16,509 --> 02:00:19,740
<i>And whiskers on kittens</i>

1423
02:00:21,447 --> 02:00:23,972
<i>Bright copper kettles</i>

1424
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:27,276
<i>And warm woolen mittens</i>

1425
02:00:28,654 --> 02:00:34,149
<i>Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings</i>

1426
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:39,991
<i>These are a few of my favorite things</i>

1427
02:00:41,133 --> 02:00:43,158
Why don't I feel better?

1428
02:00:44,337 --> 02:00:46,635
<i>Girls in white dresses</i>

1429
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:49,898
<i>With blue satin sashes</i>

1430
02:00:50,209 --> 02:00:55,897
<i>Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes</i>

1431
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:59,410
- <i>Silver white winters</i>
- Fräulein Maria's back!

1432
02:00:59,619 --> 02:01:00,950
<i>That melt into springs</i>

1433
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:04,551
<i>These are a few of my favorite things</i>

1434
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:07,918
<i>When the dog bites
When the bee stings</i>

1435
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:10,287
<i>When I'm feeling sad</i>

1436
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:13,722
<i>I simply remember my favorite things</i>

1437
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,230
<i>And then I don't feel</i>

1438
02:01:16,502 --> 02:01:22,828
<i>So bad</i>

1439
02:01:24,944 --> 02:01:26,536
- I'm so glad to see you.
- We missed you.

1440
02:01:26,746 --> 02:01:27,838
I missed you.

1441
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,207
- Kurt, how are you?
- Hungry.

1442
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:34,379
- What happened to your finger?
- It got caught.

1443
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:36,781
- Caught in what?
- Friedrich's teeth.

1444
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:40,219
- Liesl, you all right?
- Just fair.

1445
02:01:40,426 --> 02:01:43,384
- Any telegrams been delivered lately?
- None at all.

1446
02:01:43,629 --> 02:01:47,087
But I'm learning to accept it.
I'll be glad when school begins.

1447
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:52,099
Liesl, you can't use school to escape
your problems. You have to face them.

1448
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:53,704
I have so much to tell you.

1449
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:55,932
- We have things to tell you too.
- I'm sure.

1450
02:01:56,275 --> 02:01:59,938
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

1451
02:02:00,212 --> 02:02:01,236
Married?

1452
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:03,605
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1453
02:02:11,524 --> 02:02:13,082
Oh, I see.

1454
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:18,283
Father, look!
Fräulein Maria's back!

1455
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:20,556
Fräulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1456
02:02:22,768 --> 02:02:23,826
Good evening, captain.

1457
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:26,635
Good evening.

1458
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:31,029
Everyone inside for dinner.

1459
02:02:31,277 --> 02:02:32,904
Dinner!

1460
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:46,918
You left without saying goodbye.
Even to the children.

1461
02:02:47,927 --> 02:02:49,485
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1462
02:02:51,564 --> 02:02:52,690
Why did you?

1463
02:02:52,932 --> 02:02:55,765
Please don't ask me.
The reason no longer exists.

1464
02:02:56,936 --> 02:02:59,996
Fräulein Maria, you've returned.

1465
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:03,072
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1466
02:03:06,345 --> 02:03:08,575
I wish you every happiness, baroness.

1467
02:03:08,781 --> 02:03:11,614
You too, captain.
The children say you're to marry.

1468
02:03:11,784 --> 02:03:12,842
Thank you, my dear.

1469
02:03:15,454 --> 02:03:18,981
You are back to stay?

1470
02:03:21,093 --> 02:03:24,392
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1471
02:04:20,186 --> 02:04:21,778
There you are.

1472
02:04:36,168 --> 02:04:38,693
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzel.

1473
02:04:38,938 --> 02:04:42,237
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

1474
02:04:42,675 --> 02:04:45,599
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner table.

1475
02:04:45,878 --> 02:04:47,869
Or was it the wine?

1476
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:49,944
Undoubtedly the wine.

1477
02:04:52,485 --> 02:04:54,783
You have no idea
the trouble I'm having...

1478
02:04:55,054 --> 02:04:57,784
...trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

1479
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:00,218
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1480
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:04,122
But I do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion.

1481
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:06,696
At first I thought
of a fountain pen...

1482
02:05:06,932 --> 02:05:09,196
...but you've already got one.

1483
02:05:09,435 --> 02:05:12,393
Then I thought perhaps a villa
in the south of France...

1484
02:05:12,638 --> 02:05:15,300
...but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

1485
02:05:15,574 --> 02:05:17,963
Oh, Georg, how do you
feel about yachts?

1486
02:05:18,244 --> 02:05:20,508
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean...

1487
02:05:20,779 --> 02:05:23,509
...or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

1488
02:05:25,718 --> 02:05:27,743
- Elsa.
- Where to go on our honeymoon?

1489
02:05:27,987 --> 02:05:29,579
Now, that's a real problem.

1490
02:05:29,788 --> 02:05:33,144
A trip around the world
would be lovely. And then I said:

1491
02:05:33,425 --> 02:05:36,280
"Oh, Elsa, there must be
someplace better to go."

1492
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:38,952
- But don't worry, darling, I'll--
- Elsa.

1493
02:05:39,665 --> 02:05:40,859
Yes, Georg.

1494
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:43,231
It's no use...

1495
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:45,835
...you and I.

1496
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:50,638
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1497
02:05:51,977 --> 02:05:53,604
...and utterly unfair to you.

1498
02:05:58,851 --> 02:06:01,649
- When two people talk of marriage--
- No, don't.

1499
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:04,614
Don't say another word, please.

1500
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:12,956
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1501
02:06:13,866 --> 02:06:18,565
Fond as I am of you, I really don't
think you're the right man for me.

1502
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,563
You're much too independent.

1503
02:06:23,876 --> 02:06:28,631
And I need someone
who needs me desperately...

1504
02:06:28,881 --> 02:06:31,907
...or at least needs
my money desperately.

1505
02:06:34,086 --> 02:06:39,012
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

1506
02:06:41,794 --> 02:06:43,659
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1507
02:06:43,896 --> 02:06:45,921
...I'll go inside,
pack my little bags...

1508
02:06:46,198 --> 02:06:48,689
...and return to Vienna
where I belong.

1509
02:06:54,073 --> 02:06:55,904
And somewhere out there...

1510
02:06:56,175 --> 02:06:59,008
...is a young lady who, I think...

1511
02:07:00,846 --> 02:07:02,074
...will never be a nun.

1512
02:07:14,226 --> 02:07:16,558
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1513
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:43,447
Hello.

1514
02:07:49,261 --> 02:07:52,856
I thought I just might find you here.

1515
02:07:57,002 --> 02:07:59,300
Was there something you wanted?

1516
02:07:59,672 --> 02:08:02,869
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1517
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:05,141
Please.

1518
02:08:10,249 --> 02:08:11,614
May I?

1519
02:08:23,996 --> 02:08:28,695
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things:

1520
02:08:29,835 --> 02:08:34,124
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1521
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:39,639
And what was it
that made you come back?

1522
02:08:41,313 --> 02:08:45,704
Well, I had an obligation
to fulfill...

1523
02:08:45,984 --> 02:08:48,111
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1524
02:08:48,721 --> 02:08:50,211
Is that all?

1525
02:08:51,523 --> 02:08:53,650
And I missed the children.

1526
02:08:53,992 --> 02:08:55,186
Yes.

1527
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:59,351
- Only the children?
- No. Yes.

1528
02:08:59,565 --> 02:09:03,353
- Isn't it right that I missed them?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1529
02:09:03,635 --> 02:09:06,229
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1530
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:09,135
Perhaps you might...

1531
02:09:10,876 --> 02:09:12,070
Yes?

1532
02:09:13,846 --> 02:09:19,170
Well, nothing was the same
when you were away...

1533
02:09:19,885 --> 02:09:23,150
...and it'll be all wrong again
after you leave...

1534
02:09:23,388 --> 02:09:28,052
...and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

1535
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:36,329
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be
able to make things fine for you.

1536
02:09:36,568 --> 02:09:37,967
Maria...

1537
02:09:40,072 --> 02:09:43,564
- There isn't going to be any baroness.
- There isn't?

1538
02:09:45,978 --> 02:09:47,343
No.

1539
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:49,410
I don't understand.

1540
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:55,914
Well, we've called off our engagement,
you see, and--

1541
02:09:56,188 --> 02:09:59,612
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes. You are?

1542
02:10:00,759 --> 02:10:02,989
- You did?
- Yes.

1543
02:10:04,062 --> 02:10:08,590
Well, you can't marry someone
when you're...

1544
02:10:11,103 --> 02:10:13,196
...in love with someone else...

1545
02:10:16,608 --> 02:10:18,041
...can you?

1546
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:55,175
The Reverend Mother always says:

1547
02:10:55,447 --> 02:10:58,837
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere he opens a window."

1548
02:11:07,259 --> 02:11:10,319
What else does
the Reverend Mother say?

1549
02:11:11,263 --> 02:11:13,652
That you have to look for your life.

1550
02:11:15,334 --> 02:11:17,825
Is that why you came back?

1551
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:23,364
And have you found it...

1552
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:25,570
...Maria?

1553
02:11:27,312 --> 02:11:29,303
I think I have.

1554
02:11:31,783 --> 02:11:32,647
I know I have.

1555
02:11:35,921 --> 02:11:37,582
I love you.

1556
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:44,051
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1557
02:11:46,798 --> 02:11:52,156
<i>Perhaps I had a wicked childhood</i>

1558
02:11:53,672 --> 02:11:58,928
<i>Perhaps I had a miserable youth</i>

1559
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:06,536
<i>But somewhere
In my wicked, miserable past</i>

1560
02:12:07,252 --> 02:12:12,849
<i>There must have been a moment of truth</i>

1561
02:12:13,959 --> 02:12:20,182
<i>For here you are
Standing there loving me</i>

1562
02:12:21,466 --> 02:12:27,496
<i>Whether or not you should</i>

1563
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:34,932
<i>So somewhere in my youth or childhood</i>

1564
02:12:35,781 --> 02:12:43,438
<i>I must have done something good</i>

1565
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:47,648
<i>Nothing comes from nothing</i>

1566
02:12:48,794 --> 02:12:52,616
<i>Nothing ever could</i>

1567
02:12:53,498 --> 02:13:02,361
<i>So somewhere in my youth or childhood</i>

1568
02:13:03,875 --> 02:13:13,364
<i>I must have done something good</i>

1569
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:19,143
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

1570
02:13:19,558 --> 02:13:23,415
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridiculous pine cone.

1571
02:13:23,695 --> 02:13:24,992
What?

1572
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:29,755
I knew the first time you blew
that silly whistle.

1573
02:13:30,702 --> 02:13:32,693
Oh, my love.

1574
02:13:36,441 --> 02:13:44,166
<i>For here you are
Standing there loving me</i>

1575
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:51,744
<i>Whether or not you should</i>

1576
02:13:53,558 --> 02:14:00,589
<i>So somewhere in my youth or childhood</i>

1577
02:14:01,366 --> 02:14:09,091
<i>I must have done something good</i>

1578
02:14:10,275 --> 02:14:13,403
<i>Nothing comes from nothing</i>

1579
02:14:14,413 --> 02:14:17,541
<i>Nothing ever could</i>

1580
02:14:17,783 --> 02:14:23,176
<i>So somewhere in my youth</i>

1581
02:14:23,822 --> 02:14:26,086
<i>Or childhood</i>

1582
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:35,326
<i>I must have done something</i>

1583
02:14:37,769 --> 02:14:50,432
<i>Something good</i>

1584
02:14:57,122 --> 02:14:58,612
Maria.

1585
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:05,088
Is there anyone I should go to,
to ask permission to marry you?

1586
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,797
- Why don't we ask--
- The children?

1587
02:17:01,179 --> 02:17:04,103
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

1588
02:17:04,916 --> 02:17:08,477
<i>How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?</i>

1589
02:17:09,521 --> 02:17:13,787
<i>How do you find a word
That means Maria?</i>

1590
02:17:14,159 --> 02:17:15,183
<i>A flibbertigibbet</i>

1591
02:17:15,427 --> 02:17:18,692
<i>A will-o'-the-wisp
A clown</i>

1592
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:22,889
<i>Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her</i>

1593
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:27,668
<i>Many a thing she ought to understand</i>

1594
02:17:28,673 --> 02:17:32,666
<i>But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?</i>

1595
02:17:33,345 --> 02:17:37,270
<i>How do you keep a wave upon the sand?</i>

1596
02:17:37,616 --> 02:17:41,609
<i>Oh, how do you solve
A problem like Maria?</i>

1597
02:17:42,988 --> 02:17:49,621
<i>How do you hold a moonbeam
In your hand?</i>

1598
02:19:55,687 --> 02:19:57,279
Herr Detweiler!

1599
02:19:59,858 --> 02:20:02,554
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1600
02:20:02,794 --> 02:20:06,093
Perhaps you've not heard.
I am now the Gauleiter.

1601
02:20:06,331 --> 02:20:07,923
Heil Hitler.

1602
02:20:08,833 --> 02:20:09,993
Heil Hitler.

1603
02:20:10,268 --> 02:20:12,566
I've come from
Captain von Trapp's house.

1604
02:20:13,004 --> 02:20:16,599
The only one in the area
not flying the Third Reich flag...

1605
02:20:16,841 --> 02:20:18,069
...since the Anschluss.

1606
02:20:18,309 --> 02:20:20,470
- But we have dealt with that.
- I don't--

1607
02:20:20,712 --> 02:20:23,670
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

1608
02:20:23,948 --> 02:20:25,643
The only thing she'd tell me.

1609
02:20:26,151 --> 02:20:28,676
What kind of information
are you looking for?

1610
02:20:28,953 --> 02:20:30,818
When will the captain return?

1611
02:20:31,356 --> 02:20:35,281
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
He's not been in touch with us.

1612
02:20:35,527 --> 02:20:40,351
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated
with his children in over a month?

1613
02:20:40,632 --> 02:20:42,520
How many men do you know...

1614
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:46,100
...who communicate with their children
while honeymooning?

1615
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:50,702
Upon his return, he'll fill
his proper position in the new order.

1616
02:20:50,975 --> 02:20:53,364
Naturally.
And may I congratulate you...

1617
02:20:53,645 --> 02:20:58,241
...and your people in allowing the
festival to go on tonight as planned.

1618
02:20:58,817 --> 02:21:02,241
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

1619
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:05,876
Singing and music will
show this to the world.

1620
02:21:06,124 --> 02:21:07,751
Austria is the same.

1621
02:21:08,693 --> 02:21:10,058
Heil Hitler.

1622
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:13,822
Heil Hitler.

1623
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:16,728
Come, let's go home.

1624
02:21:16,935 --> 02:21:20,427
- Why was he so cross?
- Everybody's cross these days.

1625
02:21:20,672 --> 02:21:24,028
Maybe the flag with the black spider
makes people nervous.

1626
02:21:24,242 --> 02:21:27,166
- Will Father be in trouble?
- He doesn't have to be.

1627
02:21:27,412 --> 02:21:30,142
The thing to do
is to get along with everybody.

1628
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:32,576
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1629
02:21:32,784 --> 02:21:35,708
Are we really going to sing
before a lot of people?

1630
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:38,013
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

1631
02:21:38,223 --> 02:21:42,785
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1632
02:21:43,027 --> 02:21:47,384
- Why am I always last?
- Because you are the most important.

1633
02:21:48,099 --> 02:21:49,691
There we go.

1634
02:21:55,607 --> 02:21:59,065
Are you sure Father will approve
of our singing in public?

1635
02:21:59,277 --> 02:22:01,575
He'll be pleased and proud.

1636
02:22:02,046 --> 02:22:04,469
- Liesl, do you think so?
- Don't you trust me?

1637
02:22:04,716 --> 02:22:05,740
No.

1638
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:08,043
You're a very intelligent girl.

1639
02:22:08,553 --> 02:22:10,748
Liesl. Liesl!

1640
02:22:11,689 --> 02:22:12,883
Rolfe!

1641
02:22:13,892 --> 02:22:15,883
I'm so glad to see you.
It's been su--

1642
02:22:16,127 --> 02:22:17,219
Good afternoon.

1643
02:22:17,629 --> 02:22:20,553
Give this to your father
as soon as he's home.

1644
02:22:21,232 --> 02:22:23,097
- He's on his honeymoon.
- I know.

1645
02:22:23,301 --> 02:22:26,634
- You do?
- We make it our business to know all.

1646
02:22:27,305 --> 02:22:29,933
- Who's "we"?
- See that he gets it.

1647
02:22:30,141 --> 02:22:32,439
- What is it?
- It's a telegram from Berlin.

1648
02:22:33,311 --> 02:22:35,802
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1649
02:22:36,281 --> 02:22:38,909
I'm occupied
with more important matters.

1650
02:22:39,117 --> 02:22:41,608
And your father had better be too.

1651
02:22:41,819 --> 02:22:43,343
But, Rolfe!

1652
02:23:06,477 --> 02:23:08,138
Father!

1653
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:11,041
- We didn't expect you so soon.
- Hello, hello!

1654
02:23:11,316 --> 02:23:14,114
We didn't expect you home
until next week!

1655
02:23:14,319 --> 02:23:19,746
- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?
- Hello! How are you?

1656
02:23:20,858 --> 02:23:22,155
Why didn't you call us?

1657
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,282
We couldn't get through.

1658
02:23:24,529 --> 02:23:26,485
I had nothing to do with that.

1659
02:23:26,764 --> 02:23:28,789
We came back as fast as we could.

1660
02:23:29,133 --> 02:23:31,294
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1661
02:23:31,536 --> 02:23:33,959
- We missed you!
- We missed kissing you.

1662
02:23:34,172 --> 02:23:37,005
We missed all the noise
in the morning.

1663
02:23:37,275 --> 02:23:41,473
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
- Oh, you came back just in time.

1664
02:23:41,679 --> 02:23:43,374
Look, Fräulein Maria--

1665
02:23:43,648 --> 02:23:45,206
I mean Mother.

1666
02:23:45,683 --> 02:23:48,174
We're going to sing
in the festival tonight.

1667
02:23:48,386 --> 02:23:50,479
We've been having a lovely time!

1668
02:23:50,722 --> 02:23:52,815
We've been rehearsing all--

1669
02:23:54,359 --> 02:23:56,691
Surprise! Surprise!

1670
02:23:57,362 --> 02:23:59,853
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1671
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:04,231
We'll talk about this.

1672
02:24:04,502 --> 02:24:08,791
I would've told you but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

1673
02:24:09,073 --> 02:24:11,564
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1674
02:24:11,809 --> 02:24:16,508
They'll be the talk of the festival.
Imagine, seven children in one family!

1675
02:24:16,714 --> 02:24:18,375
Max!

1676
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:21,805
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you...

1677
02:24:22,053 --> 02:24:24,749
...how I feel about my family
singing in public!

1678
02:24:25,023 --> 02:24:26,718
The committee was enchanted.

1679
02:24:26,924 --> 02:24:30,087
- What did they say?
- I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1680
02:24:30,361 --> 02:24:34,627
- Don't you think just this once--?
- Absolutely out of the question.

1681
02:24:34,899 --> 02:24:39,029
- Georg, this is for Austria.
- For Austria?

1682
02:24:39,404 --> 02:24:42,601
- There is no Austria!
- But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1683
02:24:42,874 --> 02:24:46,366
- Let's at least be grateful for that.
- Grateful?

1684
02:24:48,246 --> 02:24:49,873
You know, Max...

1685
02:24:50,782 --> 02:24:53,979
...sometimes I don't believe
I know you.

1686
02:24:56,721 --> 02:24:58,086
Father, I forgot.

1687
02:24:58,923 --> 02:25:00,481
This is for you.

1688
02:25:10,301 --> 02:25:14,294
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

1689
02:25:14,572 --> 02:25:16,062
You must convince him.

1690
02:25:16,307 --> 02:25:19,071
Max, I can't ask him
to be less than he is.

1691
02:25:19,277 --> 02:25:22,610
Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing, well...

1692
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:25,110
...it will be a reflection
on Austria.

1693
02:25:25,917 --> 02:25:29,273
Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

1694
02:25:34,459 --> 02:25:37,121
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1695
02:25:37,395 --> 02:25:40,125
- I like calling you "Mother."
- I like hearing it.

1696
02:25:40,331 --> 02:25:43,926
You love Father very much.
I can tell you do.

1697
02:25:44,102 --> 02:25:45,126
Very much.

1698
02:25:45,303 --> 02:25:48,636
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone?

1699
02:25:49,307 --> 02:25:54,597
I mean, when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you?

1700
02:25:57,215 --> 02:25:59,308
Well, you cry a little.

1701
02:25:59,717 --> 02:26:01,844
Then you wait for the sun
to come out.

1702
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:03,485
It always does.

1703
02:26:03,721 --> 02:26:07,282
There are so many things I think
I should know but I don't.

1704
02:26:07,525 --> 02:26:09,481
- I really don't.
- How can you?

1705
02:26:09,827 --> 02:26:13,957
- Sometimes I feel the world is ending.
- Then you feel it's just beginning?

1706
02:26:14,132 --> 02:26:16,794
- Yes!
- It was that way with me.

1707
02:26:17,235 --> 02:26:21,467
- And for you it will be just as wonderful.
- Do you really think so?

1708
02:26:23,608 --> 02:26:27,271
<i>When you're 16 going on 17</i>

1709
02:26:27,512 --> 02:26:31,107
<i>Waiting for life to start</i>

1710
02:26:31,783 --> 02:26:35,605
<i>Somebody kind
Who touches your mind</i>

1711
02:26:35,853 --> 02:26:40,142
<i>Will suddenly touch your heart</i>

1712
02:26:40,558 --> 02:26:42,287
<i>When that happens</i>

1713
02:26:42,693 --> 02:26:44,649
<i>After it happens</i>

1714
02:26:44,929 --> 02:26:48,285
<i>Nothing is quite the same</i>

1715
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,558
<i>Somehow I know</i>

1716
02:26:50,835 --> 02:26:52,826
<i>I'll jump up and go</i>

1717
02:26:53,237 --> 02:26:57,196
<i>If ever he calls my name</i>

1718
02:26:57,742 --> 02:27:01,667
<i>Gone are your old ideas of life</i>

1719
02:27:01,946 --> 02:27:05,575
<i>The old ideas grow dim</i>

1720
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:10,482
<i>Lo and behold
You're someone's wife</i>

1721
02:27:11,722 --> 02:27:17,547
<i>And you belong to him</i>

1722
02:27:17,995 --> 02:27:22,056
<i>You may think this kind of adventure</i>

1723
02:27:22,533 --> 02:27:26,390
<i>Never may come to you</i>

1724
02:27:27,471 --> 02:27:32,363
<i>Darling, 16 going on 17</i>

1725
02:27:33,711 --> 02:27:37,841
<i>Wait a year</i>

1726
02:27:38,616 --> 02:27:43,872
- <i>I'll wait a year</i>
- <i>Or two</i>

1727
02:27:44,255 --> 02:27:51,252
<i>Just wait a year</i>

1728
02:27:52,530 --> 02:28:00,722
<i>Or two</i>

1729
02:28:21,592 --> 02:28:22,957
What is it?

1730
02:28:23,895 --> 02:28:25,260
Berlin.

1731
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,595
They've offered me a commission.

1732
02:28:27,832 --> 02:28:30,392
I've been requested
to accept immediately...

1733
02:28:30,635 --> 02:28:34,628
...and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1734
02:28:35,239 --> 02:28:39,232
I knew this would happen.
I didn't think it would be so soon.

1735
02:28:39,443 --> 02:28:42,970
To refuse them would be fatal
for all of us.

1736
02:28:44,181 --> 02:28:47,969
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1737
02:28:54,125 --> 02:28:55,922
Get the children all together.

1738
02:28:56,193 --> 02:28:59,458
Don't say anything to worry them.
Just get them ready.

1739
02:29:00,364 --> 02:29:02,787
We've got to get out of Austria...

1740
02:29:04,435 --> 02:29:06,130
...and this house...

1741
02:29:08,472 --> 02:29:09,871
...tonight.

1742
02:29:53,818 --> 02:29:56,207
This strains my back
and breaks my heart...

1743
02:29:56,487 --> 02:29:59,320
...when I think of the children
missing the festival.

1744
02:29:59,557 --> 02:30:02,253
By your announcement
we'll be over the border.

1745
02:30:02,526 --> 02:30:04,915
Do you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making?

1746
02:30:05,162 --> 02:30:06,424
You have no choice.

1747
02:30:06,697 --> 02:30:09,530
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1748
02:30:10,201 --> 02:30:12,362
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1749
02:30:12,570 --> 02:30:15,994
Because he doesn't want anyone
to hear us.

1750
02:30:19,577 --> 02:30:22,068
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1751
02:30:22,346 --> 02:30:25,838
They'll be able to answer honestly
they didn't know anything.

1752
02:30:26,083 --> 02:30:30,281
- Will we be coming back here?
- Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1753
02:30:30,554 --> 02:30:35,446
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push
the car all the way to Switzerland?

1754
02:31:02,253 --> 02:31:04,676
Something wrong
with your car, captain?

1755
02:31:04,989 --> 02:31:07,287
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1756
02:31:11,062 --> 02:31:12,290
Karl.

1757
02:31:14,265 --> 02:31:17,723
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

1758
02:31:40,925 --> 02:31:42,756
Excellent, Karl.

1759
02:31:46,130 --> 02:31:49,258
I've not asked you where you
and your family are going.

1760
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,927
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1761
02:31:52,136 --> 02:31:55,867
Apparently we both suffer
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1762
02:31:56,774 --> 02:31:59,265
You never answered the telegram...

1763
02:31:59,477 --> 02:32:02,776
...from the Admiral of the Navy
of the Third Reich.

1764
02:32:03,013 --> 02:32:05,504
I was under the impression,
Herr Zeller...

1765
02:32:05,683 --> 02:32:09,244
...that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

1766
02:32:09,954 --> 02:32:13,481
At least, the Austria I know.

1767
02:32:14,625 --> 02:32:16,252
I have my orders...

1768
02:32:16,494 --> 02:32:18,655
...to take you
to Bremerhaven tonight...

1769
02:32:18,896 --> 02:32:21,126
...where you will accept
your commission.

1770
02:32:22,266 --> 02:32:27,659
I'm afraid that's going to be
quite impossible.

1771
02:32:28,305 --> 02:32:30,000
You see, we...

1772
02:32:30,574 --> 02:32:33,407
...all of us, the entire family,
will be...

1773
02:32:34,512 --> 02:32:36,537
...singing in the festival tonight.

1774
02:32:36,847 --> 02:32:39,270
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1775
02:32:39,917 --> 02:32:42,806
We couldn't possibly
let them down now.

1776
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:45,978
- I just hope we're not too late.
- Yes.

1777
02:32:46,223 --> 02:32:49,078
You ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp...

1778
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:50,850
...are singing in a concert?

1779
02:32:51,228 --> 02:32:55,358
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1780
02:32:55,699 --> 02:33:00,363
Like you, Herr Zeller,
I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1781
02:33:01,038 --> 02:33:02,403
Yes.

1782
02:33:02,673 --> 02:33:05,096
Here, program.

1783
02:33:10,181 --> 02:33:12,445
It says only the names
of the children.

1784
02:33:12,716 --> 02:33:16,015
It says
the von Trapp Family Singers...

1785
02:33:16,253 --> 02:33:19,313
...and I am the head of
the von Trapp family, am I not?

1786
02:33:21,592 --> 02:33:25,380
And these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

1787
02:33:26,230 --> 02:33:27,754
Our costumes, naturally.

1788
02:33:28,032 --> 02:33:31,388
This night air is not good
for the children's voices.

1789
02:33:37,641 --> 02:33:41,202
Well, a slight delay in my orders
will not be serious.

1790
02:33:42,413 --> 02:33:43,903
Therefore...

1791
02:33:44,782 --> 02:33:46,409
...you will sing.

1792
02:33:47,351 --> 02:33:49,342
You will all sing.

1793
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:52,245
But only because that's what I want.

1794
02:33:53,123 --> 02:33:56,615
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

1795
02:33:57,361 --> 02:33:59,556
And when you have finished singing...

1796
02:33:59,863 --> 02:34:02,991
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be
taken to Bremerhaven.

1797
02:34:04,301 --> 02:34:07,065
Now, if you will all get
into your car...

1798
02:34:07,271 --> 02:34:11,059
...we will escort the von Trapp Family
Singers to the festival.

1799
02:34:11,942 --> 02:34:14,137
No escort will be necessary.

1800
02:34:14,411 --> 02:34:16,902
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1801
02:34:17,781 --> 02:34:21,638
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

1802
02:34:22,886 --> 02:34:24,376
Would we?

1803
02:34:25,022 --> 02:34:26,182
No.

1804
02:34:43,407 --> 02:34:45,602
- <i>Sew, a needle pulling thread</i>
- <i>A needle pulling thread</i>

1805
02:34:45,809 --> 02:34:48,698
- <i>La, a note to follow sew</i>
- <i>A note to follow sew</i>

1806

- <i>A drink with jam and bread</i>

1808
02:34:55,953 --> 02:34:57,477

- <i>With jam and bread</i>

1809
02:34:57,655 --> 02:34:59,145
<i>Tea with jam and bread</i>

1810
02:34:59,323 --> 02:35:01,689
<i>Tea with jam and bread
Jam and bread</i>

1811
02:35:01,859 --> 02:35:04,953
<i>Jam and bread
Tea with jam, jam and bread</i>

1812

<i>Jam and bread
Tea with jam, jam and bread</i>

1813
02:35:14,371 --> 02:35:17,704
- <i>With jam</i>

02:35:28,552 --> 02:35:36,379
<i>And bread</i>

1819
02:35:59,316 --> 02:36:02,513
My fellow Austrians...

1820
02:36:03,821 --> 02:36:08,315
...I shall not be seeing you again,
perhaps for a very long time.

1821
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,557
I would like to sing for you now...

1822
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:14,588
...a love song.

1823
02:36:16,567 --> 02:36:18,762
I know you share this love.

1824
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:23,767
I pray that you will never let it die.

1825
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:39,614

<i>Bless my homeland forever</i>

1848
02:38:41,712 --> 02:38:43,270
I think it'll work.

1849
02:38:43,981 --> 02:38:45,778
I shall miss all of you.

1850
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:48,741
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

1851
02:38:52,122 --> 02:38:53,612
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1852
02:38:54,424 --> 02:38:57,086
The competition has come
to its conclusion...

1853
02:38:57,327 --> 02:39:00,455
...except, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

1854
02:39:01,431 --> 02:39:03,956
And while the judges
arrive at their decision...

1855
02:39:04,234 --> 02:39:07,260
...I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

1856
02:39:07,504 --> 02:39:10,735
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have...

1857
02:39:10,974 --> 02:39:13,340
...of singing together
for a long, long time.

1858
02:39:14,444 --> 02:39:18,437
Even now, officials are waiting
in this auditorium...

1859
02:39:18,715 --> 02:39:21,411
...to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command...

1860
02:39:21,618 --> 02:39:25,213
...in the naval forces
of the Third Reich.

1861
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:34,354
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again...

1862
02:39:35,032 --> 02:39:37,125
...to bid you farewell.

1863
02:39:44,508 --> 02:39:48,137
<i>There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall</i>

1864
02:39:48,412 --> 02:39:51,745
<i>And the bells in the steeple too</i>

1865
02:39:52,249 --> 02:39:56,071
<i>And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird</i>

1866
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:58,743
<i>Is popping out to say "coo-coo"</i>

1867
02:39:58,956 --> 02:40:00,617
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1868
02:40:00,857 --> 02:40:01,915
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1869
02:40:02,125 --> 02:40:03,752
- <i>Regretfully, they tell us</i>
- <i>Coo-coo</i>

1870
02:40:03,961 --> 02:40:05,758
- <i>But firmly they compel us</i>
- <i>Coo-coo</i>

1871
02:40:05,996 --> 02:40:08,419
<i>To say goodbye</i>

1872
02:40:08,966 --> 02:40:14,131
<i>To you</i>

1873
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:20,635
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night</i>

1874
02:40:20,844 --> 02:40:24,439
<i>We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight</i>

1875
02:40:30,821 --> 02:40:34,382
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu</i>

1876
02:40:34,625 --> 02:40:38,117
<i>Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you</i>

1877
02:40:44,568 --> 02:40:48,163
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1878
02:40:48,372 --> 02:40:49,862
<i>We flit, we float</i>

1879
02:40:50,273 --> 02:40:51,968
<i>We fleetly flee, we fly</i>

1880
02:40:58,348 --> 02:41:02,045
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1881
02:41:02,352 --> 02:41:05,708
<i>The sun has gone to bed
And so must I</i>

1882
02:41:05,989 --> 02:41:08,219
<i>Goodbye</i>

1883
02:41:10,027 --> 02:41:15,715
<i>Goodbye</i>

1884
02:41:15,932 --> 02:41:19,789
<i>Goodbye</i>

1885
02:41:21,338 --> 02:41:28,562
<i>Goodbye</i>

1886
02:42:00,377 --> 02:42:04,507
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
decision of our distinguished judges.

1887
02:42:04,748 --> 02:42:07,308
We will start with the award
for third prize.

1888
02:42:07,951 --> 02:42:10,283
For this honor,
the judges have named...

1889
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:15,150
...the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

1890
02:42:15,425 --> 02:42:17,655
Fräulein Schweiger.

1891
02:42:54,531 --> 02:42:58,490
Second prize
to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

1892
02:43:26,496 --> 02:43:30,660
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria...

1893
02:43:30,901 --> 02:43:33,995
...the von Trapp Family Singers.

1894
02:43:46,349 --> 02:43:48,044
The family von Trapp.

1895
02:44:02,632 --> 02:44:03,724
They're gone!

1896
02:44:22,419 --> 02:44:23,818
Come with me.

1897
02:44:27,657 --> 02:44:29,648
Quickly, quickly.

1898
02:44:30,594 --> 02:44:32,789
I have a place you can hide.

1899
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:36,761
Slowly, slowly.

1900
02:44:47,777 --> 02:44:49,472
Open this gate.

1901
02:44:50,614 --> 02:44:52,172
Good evening.

1902
02:44:54,684 --> 02:44:56,174
Hurry up, woman.

1903
02:45:16,006 --> 02:45:17,200
Two men in there.

1904
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:19,305
Six of you cover the yard.

1905
02:45:19,509 --> 02:45:21,807
You two, cover the corridor.

1906
02:45:36,293 --> 02:45:39,854
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize
we put the abbey in this danger.

1907
02:45:40,130 --> 02:45:42,655
No, Maria, it was right for you
to come here.

1908
02:45:42,866 --> 02:45:44,731
We thought we might borrow
your car.

1909
02:45:44,968 --> 02:45:46,856
I'm afraid our car will do you
no good now.

1910
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:49,131
I've been listening to the wires.

1911
02:45:49,339 --> 02:45:51,830
The borders have just been closed.

1912
02:45:57,714 --> 02:45:59,978
All right,
if the borders are closed...

1913
02:46:01,251 --> 02:46:04,607
...then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over the mountains on foot.

1914
02:46:05,188 --> 02:46:07,179
- The children--
- We'll help them.

1915
02:46:07,424 --> 02:46:09,619
We can do it without help, Father.

1916
02:46:10,694 --> 02:46:12,059
Maria.

1917
02:46:12,729 --> 02:46:15,391
You will not be alone.
Remember:

1918
02:46:15,632 --> 02:46:18,692
"I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help."

1919
02:46:19,703 --> 02:46:20,761
Yes, Mother.

1920
02:46:22,172 --> 02:46:24,333
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

1921
02:46:36,419 --> 02:46:37,579
God be with you.

1922
02:46:44,527 --> 02:46:46,051
- Mother.
- Yes?

1923
02:46:46,296 --> 02:46:49,527
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

1924
02:46:49,766 --> 02:46:52,758
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

1925
02:46:53,036 --> 02:46:56,233
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

1926
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:12,034
Let's try the roof.

1927
02:50:08,298 --> 02:50:10,596
Rolfe, please.

1928
02:50:15,638 --> 02:50:17,162
No, wait.

1929
02:50:26,950 --> 02:50:28,315
Maria.

1930
02:50:29,419 --> 02:50:30,818
Children.

1931
02:50:34,891 --> 02:50:37,917
It's you we want, not them.

1932
02:50:38,294 --> 02:50:39,989
Put that down.

1933
02:50:41,097 --> 02:50:44,396
Not another move,
or I'll shoot.

1934
02:50:46,102 --> 02:50:48,127
You're only a boy.

1935
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:54,803
- You don't really belong to them.
- Stay where you are.

1936
02:50:56,546 --> 02:50:58,537
Come away with us.

1937
02:50:59,816 --> 02:51:00,976
Before it's too late.

1938
02:51:01,551 --> 02:51:03,917
Not another step.
I'll kill you.

1939
02:51:06,189 --> 02:51:09,488
- You give that to me, Rolfe.
- Did you hear me?

1940
02:51:10,526 --> 02:51:12,118
I'll kill you.

1941
02:51:13,997 --> 02:51:15,487
Rolfe.

1942
02:51:33,816 --> 02:51:35,181
You'll never be one of them.

1943
02:51:37,954 --> 02:51:39,649
Lieutenant!

1944
02:51:39,889 --> 02:51:41,015
They're here!

1945
02:51:41,224 --> 02:51:42,748
They're here, lieutenant!

1946
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:25,727
Reverend Mother.

1947
02:52:27,070 --> 02:52:28,867
I have sinned.

1948
02:52:30,073 --> 02:52:32,200
I too, Reverend Mother.

1949
02:52:33,876 --> 02:52:36,140
What is this sin, my children?

1950
02:53:02,438 --> 02:53:05,771
<i>A dream that will need</i>

1951
02:53:05,942 --> 02:53:11,471
<i>All the love you can give</i>

1952
02:53:12,081 --> 02:53:15,573
<i>Every day of your life</i>

1953
02:53:15,752 --> 02:53:21,748
<i>For as long as you live</i>

1954
02:53:23,059 --> 02:53:27,814
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

1955
02:53:28,264 --> 02:53:32,963
<i>Ford every stream</i>

1956
02:53:33,136 --> 02:53:37,960
<i>Follow every rainbow</i>

1957
02:53:38,207 --> 02:53:42,530
<i>Till you find</i>

1958
02:53:42,712 --> 02:53:50,278
<i>Your dream</i>

1959
02:54:32,595 --> 02:54:34,586
