TSUTA HOUSE

11
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,682
I'm back!

12
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:24,661
Fujiko, you're really coming on

13
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:29,864
I'll do some practice
when it gets a bit cooler

14
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:33,301
Eh? Someone's been using this

15
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:39,605
Nanako... watch what you say.
We all have to live under one roof

16
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,514
Namie says her payment slips
don't tally up

17
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:50,486
She's got the cheek to suggest
we've been cheating her

18
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,149
I've got it all written down here

19
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,920
So what?

20
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,930
You could've simply
made them all up!

21
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:06,404
You've no right to point the finger
of suspicion at us

22
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,905
A country girl like you...

23
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,976
...with filthy hair and grubby hands!

24
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:16,537
That's right. When you first came here,
you were absolutely clueless

25
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,115
Exactly

26
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,675
You had no idea how to treat a client

27
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:26,451
I heard you even asked them
to feed you!

28
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,223
You didn't even know what salmon was
before you came here!

29
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,791
Well, where I come from in Chiba,
we don't have such food

30
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,961
Oh, dear me!

31
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,451
Yes? Tsuta House...

32
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:58,921
Yes? You want to speak to my mother?

33
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,034
Ponko, don't stray too far!

34
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,101
Mother, it's the Geisha Guild for you

35
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,045
- You told them I wasn't here?
- Hmm...

36
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,241
What's all the noise downstairs?

37
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,116
Well, Namie's complaining
about her pay

38
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:32,713
She's got to understand
we've a business to run here

39
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm getting no sleep at night, so at least
keep them quiet during the day

40
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:43,393
It's the end of the month, though,
and the bills are due

41
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:45,561
All they say is, "Where's our pay?"

42
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:49,300
Just pretend not to hear them

43
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,041
ACCOUNTS

44
00:05:56,615 --> 00:06:01,143
- How many for dinner tonight?
- You'll have to ask Yoneko

45
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:03,949
She never seems to lift a finger!

46
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:12,128
Where are you off to?

47
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,597
Just out

48
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,851
- Excuse me?
- Coming!

49
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,298
And you are?

50
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,335
I've been sent
by the employment agency

51
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,863
Here...

52
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,933
Just wait a moment, will you?

53
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,310
- Who is it?
- The new maid

54
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:14,087
Do you want these?

55
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,200
Come in

56
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,296
Thank you

57
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:37,538
Mrs... something... Yamanaka?
How do you read these characters?

58
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,243
It's pronounced "Rika"

59
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:44,186
- "Rika"? Oh!
- Unusual name, isn't it?

60
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:48,825
- Sounds foreign to me
- Hard to pronounce, too

61
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,196
At your service, mistress

62
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,827
Please, there's no need to be so formal

63
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:05,801
- Are you married?
- My husband died the year before last

64
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:10,280
And my child died last year.
Since then I've been supporting myself

65
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:12,612
Oh, really?

66
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:17,018
I would actually prefer to employ
an older person like you

67
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,956
You shouldn't talk
about the elderly like that!

68
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,426
Everyone over 30 here
is considered old!

69
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:30,399
Anyhow, you can order young people
around but they're not very sensible

70
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:36,168
- Older people know better...
- They're always whingeing, though!

71
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:40,404
I'll do my very best for you,
if you'll take me on

72
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:44,243
Everyone I've been to see
has said I'm too old

73
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:49,510
Let's try you out and see, shall we?

74
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:53,421
Well, this is where we all eat,
work and sleep

75
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:56,585
We don't have any special requirements

76
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:00,722
I'll do my best for you

77
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,931
Mother, I'm just going out

78
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,869
- Where to?
- Just out

79
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:11,773
Just because the new maid's here
doesn't mean you can swan around

80
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:14,641
- Where's Namie?
- Gone out somewhere

81
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:18,580
- Where's Fujiko?
- Gone for a cold drink

82
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:23,849
Not again? She's been having them
all day, she'll get stomach ache

83
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,617
Show her around the house

84
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,620
- Come on, then
- Yes...

85
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,933
There's the toilet

86
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,901
That's the kitchen

87
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:41,438
And this is your room

88
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,632
This is the bathroom

89
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:49,271
Nanako, show her around.
I'm going to get Fujiko

90
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:53,746
That's how the senior geisha can act!

91
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,113
- Let me help you there
- That's all right. I've finished now

92
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:04,992
I hope you don't mind getting your hands
dirty. Otherwise, you'd better leave now!

93
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:09,898
That was Yoneko, the mistress's
younger sister. She's bone idle

94
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:14,062
Katsuyo is the mistress's daughter.
She doesn't miss a trick!

95
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:16,697
- Nanako!
- Yes?

96
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,333
- Is Ponko down there?
- Ponko?

97
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:22,470
Isn't that Ponko I can hear wailing?

98
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,242
Well...

99
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,476
...I wonder where she could be

100
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,544
Look out for her.
She's not been very well recently

101
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,782
All right!

102
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:37,760
They look after the cats
better than the girls in this place!

103
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:51,374
Your name's difficult to say
so we'll call you "Oharu" instead, yes?

104
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:54,843
Whatever pleases you, mistress

105
00:10:55,847 --> 00:11:01,444
- Would you give this a rinse for me?
- Yes, mistress

106
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:07,716
It's all right, I'll get it

107
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,990
Hello? This is Tsuta House...

108
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:15,828
Oh, hello there again

109
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,424
Of course...

110
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:21,870
You're requesting Namie?
Very well

111
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:25,341
Yes, me, too...

112
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:28,674
No, not at all

113
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,807
Yes, let's make it next month

114
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,910
We all have to work for a living

115
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:40,851
Very well. All the best

116
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:45,294
Good morning

117
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:46,557
Morning

118
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,361
- When you've done that, run a bath
- Yes, mistress

119
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,560
Oharu, come here

120
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,797
Someka?

121
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,964
This is our new maid

122
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:58,269
Pleased to meet you

123
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:01,834
Someka lives in an apartment nearby

124
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,609
Nice to meet you

125
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:09,446
You're naughty, running off like that

126
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:13,953
Ponko's here now

127
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,189
- Did Namie say anything to you?
- No, nothing special

128
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:21,493
I just wish you girls would
come and talk to me straight

129
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,296
I'll tell them you said so

130
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:27,598
You there!

131
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,837
Be careful there

132
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:36,676
I shouldn't tell you this,
but we're not permitted to have a fire

133
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:38,442
Is that so?

134
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,041
It's against building regulations

135
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:44,178
Do you know that prayer
to guard against fires?

136
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:48,487
Trace the character for "water"
on your palm three times...

137
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:52,188
...then raise it towards the fire.
You should try it

138
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,121
Can I help you?

139
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:28,256
I'd like two bonito and three packets
of seaweed for Tsuta House

140
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,334
- For Tsuta House?
- Yes

141
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:34,032
Oh, welcome to the store

142
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,475
The problem is that your last bill
is still outstanding

143
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:45,174
I told the girl not to order anything more
until the bill's been settled

144
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:50,585
Oh... well, today is my first day working
for them so I know nothing about that

145
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:53,817
Well, I suppose you've been
a loyal customer...

146
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,916
...I can give you one bonito

147
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:57,858
And the seaweed?

148
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,727
Just let her have one packet

149
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,266
Oh, don't do that!

150
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,711
- How does that feel, madame?
- Fine

151
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:29,552
- Are you off to Fujimura's?
- Yes

152
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,822
Pass me that

153
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,931
Where on earth
has Namie disappeared to?

154
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,163
She's got two bookings tonight

155
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:44,002
Maybe she's gone looking
for extra work on her own?

156
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:48,409
Although she's young and resilient,
I wonder if she can handle it

157
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,504
I'm off now

158
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,782
See you later

159
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:06,595
Have you any sauce? Sauce?

160
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:12,960
Madame would like some sauce?

161
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,737
She's so untidy!

162
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,707
- Good evening!
- Yes?

163
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:27,482
Oh, it's you, sister

164
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:33,922
- They said you weren't feeling well
- I'm not. And I'm up to my neck in debt

165
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:37,688
I've got something to tell you.
Is anyone upstairs?

166
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:41,061
It's an untidy mess, but go ahead

167
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:52,300
- Oharu, tea for two upstairs
- Yes, mistress

168
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:01,216
I owe her a lot of money

169
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,119
That's her elder sister.
She lives near the Kishibojin Temple

170
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:06,884
Oh...

171
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:12,361
The two sisters have mortgaged
this place to the hilt

172
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,865
They are stepsisters
with different fathers, though

173
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:22,065
So, have you had any news
from Osaka?

174
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:25,040
There's no reason to expect any

175
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,911
We haven't signed on anything

176
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,709
Anyway, we're disconnected completely

177
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:37,948
To think you turned down Mr Hanayama
for that good-for-nothing, eh?

178
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:44,526
How much did he swindle from you
for his new business venture?

179
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,262
Have you just come here to scold me?

180
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:53,895
Not at all. I have a gentleman
I want to introduce to you

181
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:56,496
He's a director of a steel company

182
00:16:56,608 --> 00:17:00,066
He's invited us to go
to the theatre with him

183
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,773
Excuse me

184
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:08,080
- This is the new maid I told you about
- I see

185
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,416
Welcome, madame

186
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,615
We're relying on you...

187
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:16,125
...because nobody is perfect
in this place!

188
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:20,761
I look forward to being
of assistance, madame

189
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:29,600
Please excuse me

190
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:32,966
I'll have one of these

191
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:37,939
So, I think this fellow may help us out

192
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,315
The steel industry's big business
these days

193
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,414
- Do you think he'd lend us money?
- Well, that's all down to you

194
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,254
This is your last one, right?

195
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,528
Ponko! Naughty cat!

196
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,314
- Is Namie back?
- No, not yet

197
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:17,047
- Mummy, buy some more
- You've had enough

198
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,884
Is my aunt here?

199
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,620
Yes. She never forgets
to show up at the end of the month!

200
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:28,227
Oh!

201
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,995
So pleased to see you

202
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:34,128
You should be careful,
your voice travels

203
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,376
Are you hungry?
Not that we've much to offer

204
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,175
No, I ate earlier

205
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:46,512
And I always go to bed early, too

206
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:49,553
Good idea. It saves on electricity bills

207
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:52,885
And it keeps the wrinkles away!

208
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:57,325
Someka, I expect you to start
paying me some interest

209
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,527
Good evening

210
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:09,232
Yoneko, can't you start
working a little harder?

211
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,709
Enough. I'll be going grey
with all the worrying I do

212
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,683
That scared me to death!

213
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:58,182
Ponko?

214
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:17,002
They're so beautiful

215
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:20,874
A geisha's costume is her weapon.
We spend a lot on kimono

216
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:26,780
The one your mother was wearing
this morning was a real eye-catcher

217
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:32,985
I was once a geisha
for about six months, you know

218
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:37,391
- We were all bought these kimono
- Really?

219
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:40,692
My mother went into such debt
to buy them

220
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,461
Did you not like the life of a geisha,
Katsuyo?

221
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:48,203
I wasn't suited to it

222
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:52,709
Everybody said I'd never be successful
in this business

223
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,803
I'm just no good at flattering people
that I don't like

224
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,310
Mother's exactly the same,
but she has remarkable talent

225
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,853
She's beautiful, too

226
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:07,118
Still, it seems to bring her
nothing but bad luck

227
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:11,486
What kind of man will you marry,
Katsuyo?

228
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:17,296
- No one would marry me
- Why do you say that?

229
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:23,566
What did you used to do, Oharu?

230
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:25,198
Me?

231
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:29,639
Nothing in particular

232
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,181
I was just an ordinary housewife

233
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:36,276
But what becomes of girls like me?

234
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:39,288
My mother spends all day
flattering people...

235
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,086
...but no one really cares about her

236
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:45,321
That's why I fight for her

237
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:51,266
There's a guy here, says he's
Namie's uncle. And he's really angry

238
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:53,269
Namie's uncle?

239
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:56,272
Yes. And there's something
nasty about him

240
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,202
I'll see to him

241
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,514
Welcome, sir

242
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,716
How may I help you?

243
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,294
And who are you?

244
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:19,386
I'm the maid

245
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:22,193
I've only been here four or five days

246
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,632
I want to see the mistress of the house

247
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:28,603
I'm afraid you just missed her.
She's gone out

248
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:35,569
I bet she's hiding somewhere, eh?

249
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,117
It's better for her to eavesdrop
on me from behind the screens

250
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:44,052
She should come and talk to me
face-to-face

251
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,713
Eh?

252
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,917
I don't know if you know my niece...

253
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:53,827
...but they put her to work here
and then cheated her out of her wages!

254
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:56,559
We can have this talk elsewhere
if she wants

255
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:07,409
I can't wait around

256
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:12,482
Tell the mistress I'll be round later, eh?

257
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:16,246
I'll be back to pick up
all the money that my niece is due

258
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:27,357
She's the only one of our sisters
who succeeded in becoming a geisha

259
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:29,626
She's pretty and sings beautifully

260
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:32,168
There's only five years between us...

261
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,708
...but with my looks, people often think
we're mother and daughter!

262
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:45,039
Now where was it? You were
the best geisha at a party I attended

263
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:49,552
Mr Muramatsu says
he has heard you sing before

264
00:23:49,654 --> 00:23:52,714
Your reputation is well-deserved

265
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,347
Well...

266
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,020
Oh?

267
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,761
Isn't that Mizuno's wife?

268
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:07,269
From the Mizuno restaurant

269
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,204
She used to be a senior geisha
to my sister

270
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:17,270
Isn't that Mr Saeki with her?

271
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:23,319
- Excuse me for a moment
- Where do you think you're going?

272
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:33,221
At least it's a bit cooler today, isn't it?

273
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:36,528
I'm Mrs Tsurumoto
from across the way

274
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:39,626
I see. Very pleased to meet you

275
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:45,575
Everyone's been telling me
what a wonderful maid you are

276
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,111
Bye

277
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:55,008
Welcome back, mistress

278
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,145
Can I have a word, Oharu?

279
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,127
And now the rowing motion...

280
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,460
- Welcome home
- Afternoon

281
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:19,771
I don't want you talking to our
neighbours. All they do is gossip

282
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:22,277
I'll be careful from now on, mistress

283
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,315
Mother, something terrible has happened

284
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,475
What is it?

285
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,082
- Namie's uncle showed up
- From Mt Nokogiri?

286
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:35,488
He kicked up an awful fuss.
He said he'd be back

287
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:37,822
Oh...

288
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,963
<i>Oharu, do we have any sake left?</i>

289
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:47,202
Oh, there was some in it yesterday

290
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:52,742
You have to keep it under lock and key,
otherwise they'll just drink it all

291
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,708
- Go buy some more
- But...

292
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:58,748
It's almost the end of the month.
Tell them I'll settle up then

293
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,841
The mistress has so much
to worry about

294
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:04,648
Her elder sister keeps
tight control of everything

295
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:08,919
She's been swindled by her man,
and business isn't looking good

296
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,824
And some girls have left us this year ...

297
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:15,558
...Yukimaru, Tsutaji and now Namie

298
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:20,000
- That's three of them!
- There used to be seven girls there

299
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:22,197
Oharu! Over here!

300
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,500
There you are

301
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,137
- Come and have a drink with us
- Come on

302
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:33,011
Thank you, but maybe some other time

303
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:34,778
<i>- Buying sake?
- For a client?</i>

304
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,011
No

305
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,645
It's for the mistress
to drown her sorrows

306
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:42,590
Well, enjoy yourselves.
Please excuse me

307
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:48,362
- Why is she always so formal?
- She's not, is she?

308
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,551
I'm back

309
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:28,968
How come you went to the theatre?

310
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,909
Who did you go with?

311
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,080
Why do you want to know?

312
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:45,383
What's wrong with me going
to the theatre occasionally?

313
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:53,022
My aunt wouldn't invite you anywhere
without an ulterior motive

314
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,736
Stop worrying about me

315
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:21,554
<i>Shall I bring some sake
up for you, mistress?</i>

316
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:29,126
<i>Sake? Yes, please do</i>

317
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,795
Oharu...

318
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:40,644
...have you been on your own ever since
your husband passed away?

319
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,840
Yes

320
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:48,817
I never thought a woman
could live without a man

321
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:56,452
Oh, yes... I'd very much
like you to stay

322
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,120
Three free meals a day...

323
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,098
...two days off a month,
and 3000 yen monthly

324
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:07,726
I especially appreciate you being here

325
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:12,207
- Thank you, mistress. I accept
- Yes?

326
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,711
A geisha's life looks glamorous
from the outside...

327
00:29:19,817 --> 00:29:22,911
...but it's not always like that

328
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,989
It can be, sometimes, though...

329
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,490
Mother! Telephone!

330
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:32,989
You're not a little child any more!

331
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:36,965
You don't just disappear
when I've made all these arrangements

332
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,227
Eh?

333
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:41,998
Mr Muramatsu?
Yes, he's still here waiting for you

334
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,472
So come back right away

335
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,305
I arranged all this for your benefit!

336
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:52,508
Yes... yes.
Look, I know how you feel, sister...

337
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:57,781
...but, like you say, I'm not a child
any more, so I refuse

338
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:02,154
Right in front of Madame Mizuno,
as well! How embarrassing!

339
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,921
Carrying on like that at my age!

340
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,430
Look, leave it to me, I'll sort it out

341
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:11,160
Eh? The money?

342
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:16,069
I don't have it.
If I had it, I wouldn't be in this state

343
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:22,305
Look, I know you think I'm useless,
but just give me some time, OK?

344
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:42,296
Yoneko, you good-for-nothing!

345
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:07,956
TO: MR G IWATS U,
KIMITS U, CHIBA PREFECTURE

346
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:13,291
300,000 yen?
How do they reckon that much?

347
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:15,388
There's no way we're paying that!

348
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,763
They've got a cheek!

349
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,827
- Oharu!
- Yes?

350
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:25,205
- Will you check on Fujiko for me?
- Of course. Anything else?

351
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:28,472
- See if Nanako is at the beautician's
- Yes, madame

352
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:33,778
<i>- She plays mah -jong in the mornings
- That's her own business</i>

353
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:37,685
I have nothing but bad luck!

354
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:40,689
I'm just going out for a bit

355
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:49,989
I wonder what my sister's up to.
That man's coming tomorrow, right?

356
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:55,470
I just wish she'd tell us
where she's going and why

357
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:59,399
- Good day to you!
- Come on in

358
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,645
Is she in?

359
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,021
- Have you got a client this early?
- I'm sorry about the other day

360
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,868
I don't need any apologies.
Today's the last day of the month, right?

361
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,302
I know, I know

362
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:35,102
That Mr Muramatsu that you met,
he's such a nice man

363
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:39,171
Despite your behaviour,
he wants to see you again

364
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:43,913
He wants to offer you help.
You don't meet many like him nowadays

365
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:50,351
Look, I know I owe you money,
but I have to say...

366
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:54,591
...no matter how reduced
my circumstances become...

367
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:56,996
...if I don't like someone, then I can't...

368
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:03,600
Is that so?
You and Yoneko are both the same

369
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:06,835
You'd do anything for a man
that you liked

370
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:12,281
Yoneko's not a geisha girl,
but you can't live like that nowadays

371
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:16,216
But you? You've mortgaged
this place to pay your man's loans

372
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:19,889
Mortgaged to my rich sister

373
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:25,792
If you're trying to blame me,
then you're barking up the wrong tree!

374
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:48,983
- Where are you going?
- I'm going round to Mizuno's

375
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:54,418
I think she's got a temperature

376
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:57,392
I keep telling her to look after her

377
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:04,424
- What's happened? Where does it hurt?
- My head hurts

378
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:06,526
See what's happened?

379
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:07,831
Come in

380
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:10,463
Phone for a doctor!

381
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:13,771
Anyway, I'm going out

382
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,541
I await your return, mistress

383
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:55,510
Hold it there. Lean in a little more
with your shoulder

384
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,696
Catch it properly. And...

385
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,901
Good. That's all for today

386
00:35:24,314 --> 00:35:27,044
I'll see you now, Otsuta

387
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:31,710
- Thank you
- Say hello to your mother for me

388
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:34,382
- Bye-bye
- Goodbye

389
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,931
That's Umeka's daughter

390
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:47,560
Umeka's a housewife now

391
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:53,668
She's not keen on her daughter
becoming a geisha, though

392
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,836
Something wrong?

393
00:35:55,946 --> 00:36:00,849
There's something
I want to talk to you about...

394
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,851
I see...

395
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:07,022
I saw you at the theatre the other day

396
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,690
Please forgive me for not saying hello

397
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,360
- Shall we go outside?
- Yes

398
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,633
Coming!

399
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:23,001
You're very quiet

400
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:27,499
Last time I saw you,
you were yelping like a puppy!

401
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:33,640
I can't bear to watch injections

402
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,150
Stop it! Lt'll make you better

403
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:38,551
How old are you now?

404
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,751
I'll get Oharu to help. Oharu!

405
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:46,420
- Yes?
- Can you help me hold her?

406
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,022
- You want me to hold her?
- We need you

407
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,829
- Right, be still
- Excuse me

408
00:36:54,604 --> 00:36:56,265
Now, Fujiko...

409
00:36:57,774 --> 00:37:01,232
...you're such a clever little girl,
aren't you?

410
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,338
You'll listen carefully
to what I tell you, won't you?

411
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:12,685
If you wriggle around like that, the needle
will break and it'll be much more painful

412
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:18,955
Very brave! There's a clever girl.
It'll all be over in a second

413
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,234
Really? Well, come as soon as you can

414
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:29,464
She's waiting here, so hurry

415
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:32,701
What's Mr Hanayama doing?

416
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,471
Oh, I see. That's good

417
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:42,985
Mr Saeki will be here in five minutes.
Will you explain it all again to him?

418
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:44,883
Yes

419
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:50,984
I feel embarrassed in front of Mr Saeki
for causing you all this trouble

420
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,324
Not at all

421
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:00,393
It was all thanks to you that he got
the job as Mr Hanayama's secretary

422
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:04,770
I was thinking he'd make a good husband
for your daughter Katsuyo

423
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,672
Oh, really...

424
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:14,915
I just wished you'd come to me sooner
for help with your financial problems

425
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:23,784
Otoyo's treating you appallingly.
And what's with this fellow from Chiba?

426
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:27,830
It's like they're all trying
to tear off a piece of you!

427
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:33,927
I think you've been far too complacent
in your business dealings

428
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,569
Yes? This is Umemura's

429
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:44,209
Yes, she is here

430
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:47,206
Yes...

431
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:50,548
Yes, of course. I understand

432
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:53,253
For me?

433
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:58,259
Mr Saeki said Mr Hanayama has just
returned so he won't be able to make it

434
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:01,592
Is that so? Many thanks

435
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:04,360
- Well, that's a shame
- It is

436
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,799
Fujiko's not been feeling well,
so I should go back

437
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:13,569
May I suggest that
you meet with Mr Hanayama?

438
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:16,602
I couldn't

439
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:18,237
Why?

440
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:22,583
Apparently he still talks about you,
you know?

441
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:27,646
After what happened between us,
I couldn't possibly...

442
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:33,354
But you didn't agree to meet Mr Saeki
to ask for help from him alone, surely?

443
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:37,126
You wanted to enlist
Mr Hanayama's help, too

444
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,997
Isn't that the truth?

445
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:49,306
Dear, oh, dear! You're not a girl
of 20 any more, Otsuta

446
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:51,846
I know you too well

447
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,786
Just leave it to me, it's no trouble

448
00:39:57,888 --> 00:40:00,857
Thank you for everything, as always

449
00:40:01,825 --> 00:40:04,020
Take good care of her

450
00:40:04,127 --> 00:40:08,393
- Don't give her anything to eat today
- Very well

451
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:10,762
Thank you so much

452
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,358
Telephone for you, Aunt

453
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:20,768
- Who is it?
- Mr Momiji wants you to come over

454
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:26,406
I don't want to go out to work elsewhere
with Fujiko not being well

455
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:29,314
I'd prefer to do the maid's work here

456
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:33,479
Hello? Yes...

457
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:38,254
Yes, but unfortunately Fujiko's ill...

458
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:52,440
- Tell the mistress I'm off to Shinkine's
- I will

459
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:21,261
Sorry I took so long. The local store
was out of ice, so I had to go to another

460
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:25,372
Someka, I got what you asked for

461
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:27,272
Thank you

462
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:31,210
I'm really hungry

463
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:34,579
No food, or you'll have
to have another injection

464
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:39,352
I've no idea where
your mother's disappeared to

465
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,120
- There's your bread roll
- Thank you

466
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:52,327
- And three croquettes
- Croquettes are so cheap and tasty

467
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:54,062
You'll need these

468
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,866
I'll give you one

469
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,736
Thank you

470
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:02,005
I had them refried for you
to keep them hot

471
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:04,103
That's very kind of you

472
00:42:04,214 --> 00:42:06,045
- Any pepper?
- Yes

473
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:11,249
- Oh, it's empty
- I bet there's no chilli powder either

474
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:14,949
Buy some next time,
but don't tell them it's for me

475
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:16,889
Pass that sauce

476
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:20,321
And a little ice

477
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,664
Welcome home

478
00:42:31,775 --> 00:42:33,140
Evening

479
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:34,870
Welcome home

480
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:36,240
How's Fujiko?

481
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:40,407
Her stomach's hurting, but it doesn't
seem to be anything serious

482
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,816
Her mother ought to be looking after her

483
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,684
The doctor said no more injections!

484
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,816
Really? That's good

485
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:53,020
- Where's her mother?
- She had to rush out

486
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:55,791
Unbelievable, isn't she?

487
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,399
Welcome home, mistress

488
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,936
Sorry to keep you waiting

489
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,304
You must be feeling hot. There you go

490
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:09,378
That's nice and cool for you, isn't it?

491
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:39,034
Welcome home

492
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:40,803
Where did you go?

493
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,314
I went looking for him...
but he wasn't around

494
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:50,681
You should be ashamed of yourself,
chasing around after him like that

495
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:56,054
What was I supposed to do?
The child's sick and he's the father

496
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,926
What? He left the child with you
and disappeared!

497
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,591
Didn't Katsuyo's father
do the same thing to you?

498
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm going to take a bath

499
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:16,503
Sorry...

500
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:20,071
...I didn't mean to compare
my situation to yours, sister

501
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:24,813
I'm not even a geisha...
I'm just Fujiko's mother

502
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:28,684
And you let us live here with you...

503
00:44:52,615 --> 00:44:54,446
Is it raining?

504
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:57,915
Mother...

505
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:00,288
What is it?

506
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:06,724
I'd like to meet my father.
Would that be so bad?

507
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:15,300
I have no idea why you and he split up...

508
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:17,896
...but I can't bear it

509
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:22,574
As you have no one to turn to

510
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,771
Don't worry about me

511
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:32,082
It's parents that are supposed
to worry about their children

512
00:45:37,894 --> 00:45:39,555
Silly girl!

513
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,926
What are you crying about?

514
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:58,807
Listen, Mr Saeki is coming over
sometime soon

515
00:45:58,915 --> 00:46:02,078
Why don't you go
to the cinema with him?

516
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:09,714
You said you wanted
to take a boat trip on the river

517
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:12,693
It would be so lovely and cool
on the river

518
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,697
Look, stop hanging around your father,
will you?

519
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:35,849
Mr Momiji? It's Someka here

520
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,118
Thank you

521
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:45,090
Listen, if you need a geisha
to entertain you, please let me know

522
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:48,725
Please let me know, won't you?

523
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:16,121
WOMEN'S EMPLO YMENT OFFICE

524
00:47:48,424 --> 00:47:51,120
- She's gone to the temple, you say?
- Yes

525
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:56,494
She said she wanted to avoid
a rather troublesome visitor

526
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,660
Welcome, madame

527
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:03,705
Another polite greeting?

528
00:48:03,806 --> 00:48:07,833
Everyone says what a wonderful maid
you are

529
00:48:07,944 --> 00:48:09,912
Not at all. I'll bring tea...

530
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:13,813
Wait, wait! I have a favour to ask of you

531
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,077
Please give this to Madame Otsuta

532
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:20,645
There's 100,000 yen there.
Tell her I brought it for her

533
00:48:20,757 --> 00:48:24,249
I'll tell her more about it
when I see her next time

534
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,193
It's such a lot of money...

535
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:31,323
Well, I have to be somewhere
rather urgently...

536
00:48:31,434 --> 00:48:34,597
...so could you quickly write me
a receipt?

537
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:37,434
I see, madame...

538
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,534
Miss Katsuyo is out, I'm afraid,
but Miss Yoneko is in...

539
00:48:42,645 --> 00:48:46,877
...so maybe it would be better to hand
the money to her rather than me

540
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:53,218
I'm sure Madame Otsuta wouldn't
want them to know about the money

541
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:59,819
Very well, then. I'll take the liberty
of counting the money here?

542
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,063
Hey! Is there nobody in?

543
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,668
Oh, it's the man from Chiba...

544
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,132
Namie's uncle?

545
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,207
Yes

546
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,936
- I'll go and talk to him
- But...

547
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:17,638
- You count that
- Very well

548
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,682
Many thanks, madame

549
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:33,555
You always say she's out!

550
00:49:33,663 --> 00:49:39,295
She is out, I'm afraid.
Please come in and see for yourself

551
00:49:39,402 --> 00:49:41,233
And who are you?

552
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:44,773
- I'm an official from the Geisha Guild
- An official?

553
00:49:44,874 --> 00:49:50,779
This is my younger sister's
establishment so I'm no stranger here

554
00:49:51,914 --> 00:49:55,577
My mistress told me
to ask you to wait

555
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:59,815
I'm not leaving
until I get what I came here for!

556
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:01,583
I'll come in

557
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:06,457
Please come this way

558
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:10,856
Here's your receipt, madame

559
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:14,232
- Hey! Which way am I going?
- This way...

560
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:24,937
What shall we do?

561
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,742
Lt'll be all right

562
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,818
She went to the temple
for a lucky talisman

563
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:33,650
- And he turned up while she was out!
- Yes

564
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:36,350
He's not carrying a knife
or anything, is he?

565
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:38,757
Don't be silly!

566
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:51,371
You certainly can't judge a person
by their looks...

567
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:54,705
...and that mistress looks like
she wouldn't hurt a fly!

568
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,268
It's a violation of my niece's rights!
She used her like a whore!

569
00:50:58,381 --> 00:51:03,045
What does your Guild
have to say about that, eh?

570
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:09,522
Well, I don't get involved
in such difficult matters

571
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,423
- I really wouldn't understand
- Eh?

572
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:17,864
Tell me, is it true that there's still
a stone quarry on Mt Nokogiri?

573
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:22,427
A quarry? Of course there is!
I work there, don't I?

574
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:27,134
Just look at my hands.
I use a pick every day

575
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:29,677
Is that true?

576
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,113
Because "Nokogiri" means "saw"...

577
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:36,014
...I always thought
that's where saws came from!

578
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:38,177
You silly woman!

579
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:42,085
Hey! Isn't that her?

580
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:53,602
Mistress...

581
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:58,332
...I was given this for you
by Madame Mizuno

582
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:00,306
Really?

583
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,969
Listen, don't tell anyone about this

584
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:08,381
<i>And go and get some snacks
and two bottles of sake</i>

585
00:52:08,484 --> 00:52:12,921
<i>And bring three sake cups.
Plus we need some fruit...</i>

586
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:15,855
Pears will be fine. Get two

587
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:30,729
Right, I'm going home.
Your turn to take over!

588
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,934
I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble

589
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:37,945
You'll need more than a lucky talisman
to deal with him

590
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:39,446
Really?

591
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:42,642
- I gave Oharu some money for you
- Thank you

592
00:52:42,752 --> 00:52:46,745
It's 100,000 yen from Mr Hanayama.
Mr Saeki brought it round yesterday

593
00:52:46,856 --> 00:52:50,656
- Thank you so much
- Don't mention it

594
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,423
Don't let them get their hands on it

595
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,760
Hey! What's going on?

596
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:01,365
Quick! Or else
the whole neighbourhood will hear

597
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,600
- Hey!
- If you need me, give me a ring

598
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:09,735
- Thank Mr Saeki for me
- We'll talk about it later

599
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:11,107
Thank you

600
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:15,077
Are you all right, sis?

601
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:17,414
Mummy, I'm scared

602
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:22,352
- Hey!
- I'm awfully sorry

603
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:25,256
Let's go back upstairs, shall we?

604
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:32,492
There you go, two pears

605
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:36,335
And one apple

606
00:53:36,439 --> 00:53:39,966
- Can I pay for the apple separately?
- Yes

607
00:53:41,644 --> 00:53:45,671
What did you say?
What kind of a fool do you take me for?

608
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:49,148
You think you can settle this
without paying me?

609
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:54,450
Please lower your voice,
we have a sick child downstairs

610
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:01,626
Please excuse me

611
00:54:01,731 --> 00:54:04,097
Sorry for taking so long

612
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,730
Your change...

613
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:13,269
...440 yen, mistress

614
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:16,402
Oh? I only gave you 100 yen

615
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,412
Oh, that's right

616
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:21,950
I'm sorry. This is my change

617
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,289
There you are

618
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:30,553
Even the maid's making fun of me!

619
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:34,857
You tell me that business is down
and you can't give me any money...

620
00:54:34,964 --> 00:54:39,128
...and yet even the bloody maid's
got money to throw around!

621
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:43,797
Sorry, but the change was
from my own shopping

622
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,706
I bought an apple for Fujiko

623
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:53,481
Before he died, I remember my own
child was overjoyed to get an apple

624
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:57,541
Hey! We're not discussing the dead!

625
00:54:57,653 --> 00:55:01,350
- That's all, Oharu,
- Yes, mistress

626
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:06,958
I'm not leaving until I get my money!

627
00:55:15,004 --> 00:55:16,869
- Look...
- Good morning

628
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:20,533
Yoneko's man, the cook,
has turned up

629
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:27,545
Come on! You've come all this way,
at least just look at your child!

630
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:31,552
I don't want to.
We already discussed this

631
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:36,591
And what did you say?
"Fujiko's mine, I'll look after her!"

632
00:55:36,692 --> 00:55:41,925
I only came here because I feel
a duty towards your elder sister

633
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:44,659
Just look at him

634
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:49,431
He always thinks
he's so high and mighty

635
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:03,641
If you can't look after her properly,
then I'll have to take her away!

636
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:07,786
Pleased to see you

637
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,951
If you're going to yell at each other,
do it inside, not on the doorstep!

638
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:14,962
Sorry I haven't been round for a while

639
00:56:15,064 --> 00:56:19,467
Please take this
to cover the cost of the medicine

640
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:21,695
What's this?

641
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:23,897
You'd better come in

642
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:28,773
Listen, I've already settled everything
with her

643
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:33,645
But you ought to give her
a good talking to

644
00:56:33,749 --> 00:56:37,150
She still comes pestering me
for every little thing

645
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:42,986
Yoneko!

646
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:45,458
Well, you'd better come in anyway

647
00:56:45,561 --> 00:56:49,156
- Delivery!
- Round the back

648
00:56:53,335 --> 00:56:55,997
1000 YEN

649
00:56:57,473 --> 00:57:00,101
What time is your last train home?

650
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:04,407
Eh? I'm not leaving
with only 50,000 yen!

651
00:57:04,513 --> 00:57:07,038
You can't fool me!

652
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:09,515
I've given you all that I have

653
00:57:10,986 --> 00:57:16,754
You live here in the heart of Tokyo and
you say you haven't got any money?

654
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:23,462
Listen, I'm ready to settle this
in court if you want

655
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:25,727
All I need to do is inform them

656
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:31,970
I know you're all in this together

657
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:35,601
It would do no good
dragging this through the courts

658
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:39,704
No good to who?
I'm not the one in trouble!

659
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,339
Mother?

660
00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:47,719
Is that a client with you, Mother?
Shall I come up?

661
00:57:48,657 --> 00:57:50,318
Oh, you're back

662
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,621
I'm worried about you

663
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:56,391
What's all the shouting about?
Is he threatening you?

664
00:57:56,498 --> 00:57:59,365
- What?
- Now, now

665
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:03,268
Has he hit you, Mother?
Tell me if he has

666
00:58:03,372 --> 00:58:05,670
It's fine, it's nothing at all

667
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,004
What are you talking about?

668
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:15,642
Just stop worrying about me, it's fine.
It's nothing at all

669
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,647
Oharu, bring some food up.
One bowl of rice and tempura

670
00:58:21,757 --> 00:58:24,055
As soon as you can

671
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:25,421
Mother!

672
00:58:25,527 --> 00:58:31,397
I'm the one who should be worried.
Where have you been all day?

673
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,968
Hey! What's going on?

674
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:36,299
I'm coming now!

675
00:58:51,286 --> 00:58:54,050
- Always at your service
- Thank you

676
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:59,024
- Take him to a hotel, understand?
- Yes

677
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:01,426
I'll deal with him for you

678
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,090
I don't know if he'll like it, though

679
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,360
Please be careful

680
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:13,467
He'd better not be taking me
anywhere strange!

681
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:17,739
Not at all. Why on earth
would we do that to you?

682
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:21,873
You can get a good night's sleep
somewhere nice and quiet

683
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,880
Careful

684
00:59:33,295 --> 00:59:35,525
Take care, won't you?

685
01:00:06,128 --> 01:00:08,119
Welcome home

686
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,494
Quick, in here

687
01:00:12,468 --> 01:00:14,629
I've heard it's been awful

688
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:18,264
First, the shouting match between
the guy from Chiba and Katsuyo...

689
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:21,206
...and then Yoneko's Ex turned up!

690
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:24,438
- How do you know?
- Bad news travels fast

691
01:00:24,546 --> 01:00:26,639
Someka met Koito...

692
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,774
...Koito told Chiyoko...

693
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:32,047
...and Chiyoko told me,
that's how I know!

694
01:00:32,154 --> 01:00:33,951
It's so hot

695
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:37,685
- Where's Someka?
- She went home early today

696
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:39,988
Hey, did you know?

697
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:45,055
Someka lives with a man
ten years younger than her!

698
01:00:51,073 --> 01:00:54,133
Did you just hear a man's voice?

699
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,378
You've left your laundry out
on the floor above

700
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:04,611
Oh, I'd forgotten about it...

701
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,453
Take it down immediately.
You shouldn't leave it out

702
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:11,958
I'll see to it at once

703
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,528
- Are you new here?
- Yes

704
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,498
My name's Rika Yamanaka,
45-years-old

705
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:24,395
Long time no see, isn't it?
Are you on patrol?

706
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:28,567
- Oh, were you in bed?
- No, not yet

707
01:01:28,677 --> 01:01:31,976
Oharu, bring a hand towel
and some cold water

708
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:37,746
- No, it's all right
- Please just rest a while

709
01:01:45,894 --> 01:01:50,490
- Listen, order a bowl of noodles
- By telephone?

710
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,228
- No, from round the back at Hakuga's
- OK

711
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,512
- Mr Hakuga?
- Eh?

712
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:18,115
A bowl of noodles, as fast as you can

713
01:02:19,428 --> 01:02:22,591
Well, you can laugh all you like...

714
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:25,360
...but a police officer's life is hard

715
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:28,459
We often put our lives in danger
in the line of duty

716
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:32,529
That's why police officers
all look so strong

717
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,336
In handsome uniforms!

718
01:02:34,443 --> 01:02:38,072
You should marry one, Nanako,
then you'd never be afraid again

719
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,547
- He's got a gun and a truncheon
- You're right

720
01:02:43,352 --> 01:02:45,877
Right, I'd best be going

721
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:49,515
Just stay a little longer.
Oharu? Oharu!

722
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,321
I'll pass it up to you, OK?

723
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,889
Got it?

724
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:58,797
What's up? Has your phone broken?

725
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:01,062
Wait till you taste the flavour!

726
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:18,818
- Good morning, madame
- I bet they're all still in bed

727
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:28,425
CURRICULUM VITAE
MISS KATS U YO KANNO

728
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,957
Good morning

729
01:03:32,067 --> 01:03:35,036
You can't still be in bed, surely?

730
01:03:35,137 --> 01:03:37,605
I've already had my lunch

731
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:43,269
But geisha are never early risers,
it's bad for your health!

732
01:03:43,378 --> 01:03:46,040
It's because you're working so hard

733
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:52,651
What are you doing there, Katsuyo?
A curriculum vitae?

734
01:03:52,754 --> 01:03:54,779
What on earth for?

735
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:59,554
I apologise for not returning your money
for last month

736
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,462
Listen, Otsuta...

737
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:06,193
You, too, Katsuyo. Listen to me.

738
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:11,739
If it goes on like this,
you're going to go bankrupt...

739
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,968
...so why not change your business?

740
01:04:15,077 --> 01:04:17,944
What? Change business?

741
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:22,541
Well, is Katsuyo going to inherit
this business?

742
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:28,817
No, she detests the whole geisha
business. I was thinking more of Fujiko

743
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:33,327
Fujiko? That'll be ten years from now.
What will you do in the meantime?

744
01:04:33,428 --> 01:04:36,090
And this place is mortgaged...

745
01:04:36,198 --> 01:04:41,602
I know that. I shouldn't trouble you
any more with this

746
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:47,073
I know someone who may be interested
in running it as a hotel

747
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:51,202
You could sell this place
for a good price, pay me back...

748
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:53,907
...and then invest the remainder
in the hotel

749
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:57,247
Someone's interested
in buying this place?

750
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:01,812
Madame Ohama Mizuno wants
to start up her geisha business again

751
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:05,484
- Madame Ohama?
- Right

752
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:16,034
I'll be back. And tell her she won't
get rid of me for 50,000 yen!

753
01:05:16,138 --> 01:05:19,471
I'll come by and pick up Namie's things
later in my car

754
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,714
He's gone at last

755
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:35,313
You think that's the last you'll see
of him? What a carry on!

756
01:05:35,424 --> 01:05:39,190
Tsuta House has one of the best
reputations in the business...

757
01:05:39,294 --> 01:05:44,061
...and yet that fool swaggers
around here like he owns the place

758
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:49,133
And you think I should sell the place
despite its reputation?

759
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:52,729
It's not my idea, it's Madame Mizuno's!

760
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:55,708
Ask her yourself if you don't believe me

761
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,186
- Good morning
- Morning

762
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,691
It's so busy here that it's impossible
to get any sleep

763
01:06:23,705 --> 01:06:27,334
I don't know what Otoyo said to you...

764
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:33,210
...but unlike her I would never charge
interest on a loan to my own sister

765
01:06:33,315 --> 01:06:37,046
I know you're having trouble
and I worry about you...

766
01:06:37,152 --> 01:06:38,949
I'm sorry

767
01:06:39,054 --> 01:06:42,820
But whatever happens...

768
01:06:42,924 --> 01:06:46,860
...I would never reproach you
for anything

769
01:06:48,096 --> 01:06:51,930
But if you were to take over the house...

770
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:56,265
...then I would prefer you to have it
rather than my sister

771
01:06:57,272 --> 01:07:02,335
Oh, Otsuta, you're taking this
all so seriously

772
01:07:03,211 --> 01:07:07,307
I'm far too busy
running my own place, anyway

773
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:13,148
You're always summoning me urgently!

774
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:15,985
- It's been a while
- Yes, it has

775
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:18,821
That's because you'll only come
if it's urgent!

776
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:21,122
That way, Mr Hanayama can't complain

777
01:07:21,229 --> 01:07:26,724
He's not as patient as he used to be...
Like he's expecting the worst to happen!

778
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:32,273
Tell him he'll damage his liver
with all that stress

779
01:07:32,374 --> 01:07:35,070
He should arrange to see Otsuta
some time

780
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:42,312
Why don't you bring him round here
this evening?

781
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:44,408
This evening?

782
01:07:47,422 --> 01:07:50,391
You told me he'd made
the same suggestion

783
01:07:50,492 --> 01:07:54,895
"I haven't seen Otsuta
for such a long time," he said

784
01:07:54,996 --> 01:08:00,127
What I think he means is that
he'd like to see you

785
01:08:00,235 --> 01:08:03,671
As he's getting older, Otsuta...

786
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:06,832
...he's feeling nostalgic about you

787
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,902
I wonder...

788
01:08:11,012 --> 01:08:15,005
He was my patron
but we parted company

789
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:17,414
So what?

790
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:22,320
Tell him Otsuta is in a spot of trouble
and needs his advice

791
01:08:22,424 --> 01:08:25,757
He wouldn't say no, would he?
He's not that kind of person

792
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,725
He still has feelings for you

793
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:33,426
He always looked after you, never letting
you wear the same kimono twice!

794
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:36,663
And he gave you that 100,000 yen
the other day

795
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:39,331
About that 100,000 yen...

796
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:42,467
He gave it quite willingly, didn't he?

797
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:47,139
It was just like he was giving out
pocket money, wasn't it?

798
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:50,218
Listen, I'm fine...

799
01:08:50,318 --> 01:08:54,414
I felt terrible having to ask him
for the money

800
01:08:54,522 --> 01:08:57,389
I couldn't ever trouble him again...

801
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,291
And how long have you been a geisha?

802
01:09:03,465 --> 01:09:07,458
At any rate, you must meet up
with Mr Hanayama

803
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:12,438
And you, Mr Saeki,
owe a great deal to Otsuta, too

804
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,475
Let's make it 7:00 this evening

805
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:19,274
If you can't bring Mr Hanayama along,
then we'll go to him

806
01:09:50,845 --> 01:09:54,713
There's a strange atmosphere
here today, don't you think?

807
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:58,616
Not only today. There's always
a strange atmosphere in this house

808
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,486
But I'm glad the mistress is meeting
an old client

809
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:07,789
It'll do her good...
It'll do us all good

810
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:19,500
- Oharu, come with me
- Yes, mistress

811
01:10:26,715 --> 01:10:29,684
- Good day!
- Is that the kimono man?

812
01:10:34,889 --> 01:10:40,156
- Which sash will you wear, mistress?
- Help me with my hair, Oharu

813
01:10:50,071 --> 01:10:53,700
- You have such beautiful skin
- Not any more!

814
01:10:53,808 --> 01:10:57,972
Back in my day, we used to take
great care of our skin

815
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:04,848
Girls don't bother so much
these days. Or with their hairstyles...

816
01:11:04,953 --> 01:11:08,514
It just doesn't look the same somehow,
does it?

817
01:11:08,623 --> 01:11:10,147
No...

818
01:11:11,626 --> 01:11:17,394
When we were young, geisha were seen
as very different creatures

819
01:11:17,499 --> 01:11:23,404
We always tried to be better
than the other girls

820
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:26,531
But that's all changed nowadays

821
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:30,099
Our costumes, our hairstyles,
our artistry...

822
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:33,442
...all those special things
about a geisha are disappearing

823
01:11:33,548 --> 01:11:36,642
Young geisha today are just like
any other women

824
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,879
It will be autumn soon

825
01:11:39,988 --> 01:11:42,957
Last year's colours simply won't do

826
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:48,128
You can't go out to see clients
dressed inappropriately, now, can you?

827
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:52,723
Miss Someka, can I tempt you
with something new?

828
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:56,770
Let me see...
How about this one?

829
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:59,362
A very popular colour this season...

830
01:12:02,644 --> 01:12:07,240
Good day. I have the perfect colour
for you, madame

831
01:12:10,585 --> 01:12:16,888
If you get your hair done in a traditional
style, you'd look even more stunning

832
01:12:16,991 --> 01:12:20,791
- Oharu, would you call me a car?
- Yes, mistress

833
01:12:22,397 --> 01:12:25,127
Welcome back, madame

834
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:27,827
Are you going out somewhere?

835
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:30,200
Where have you been?

836
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:34,298
I heard from a high school friend
about a sewing machinist job

837
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:37,310
What? A sewing job?

838
01:12:37,412 --> 01:12:42,543
I feel bad staying here for nothing
and not paying my way

839
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,778
Are you being sarcastic?

840
01:12:45,887 --> 01:12:50,722
No daughter of mine should ever
have to do work like that

841
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:55,023
Please don't even think
about doing such work

842
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:58,428
Those machines make such a racket...

843
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,330
I'll be back later

844
01:13:34,602 --> 01:13:36,467
This way

845
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,892
Where's your sister seeing this client?

846
01:14:05,934 --> 01:14:08,164
Do you know, Yoneko?

847
01:14:09,304 --> 01:14:13,331
No idea. She can still turn heads, though

848
01:14:14,642 --> 01:14:18,510
That awful little man from Mt Nokogiri...

849
01:14:18,613 --> 01:14:21,980
...I heard he swindled her
out of 50,000 yen!

850
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:27,020
I suppose I am to blame for that
whole situation with Namie

851
01:14:27,121 --> 01:14:30,147
But she's such a disagreeable person

852
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,920
I couldn't stand her!

853
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:36,087
And I hate her even more
now that she's gone

854
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:40,566
I have nothing to apologise for

855
01:14:40,668 --> 01:14:44,536
I won't even deign to discuss the matter

856
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:47,369
It's difficult for my mother, though

857
01:14:47,475 --> 01:14:52,310
She has a heart of gold really
and that's her weakness

858
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:58,208
That's why she ended up
separating from my father

859
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:02,212
I guess she's just unlucky

860
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:05,554
I'm afraid Nanako's with a client
right now

861
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,026
Eh? Yes...

862
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:11,326
Number 1565, Koishikawa

863
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:14,733
Yes, I understand

864
01:15:15,737 --> 01:15:17,602
Is that a client?

865
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:20,299
Someone called Mr Takayama

866
01:15:20,408 --> 01:15:22,239
Takayama?

867
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:25,471
He said he's at that inn on Koishikawa

868
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,775
I see...

869
01:15:27,882 --> 01:15:32,717
I knew it! The embers of their love
have been rekindled!

870
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,754
He's her old employer

871
01:15:34,856 --> 01:15:39,122
- The guy who promised to marry her?
- That's the one

872
01:15:39,227 --> 01:15:41,957
Oh, it all makes me so jealous!

873
01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:46,966
Someka, why don't you treat yourself?
Might bring you luck...

874
01:15:47,068 --> 01:15:52,335
Don't you think the colour's
a bit dull for me?

875
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:56,467
I'm only just 50, you know

876
01:15:57,512 --> 01:16:02,006
Who knows how long I'll live,
or when I'll have a chance to wear it?

877
01:16:02,116 --> 01:16:06,644
I think a subtle colour suits you better.
It'll make you look younger, too

878
01:16:06,754 --> 01:16:09,018
You think so?

879
01:16:09,123 --> 01:16:11,148
Shall I buy it then?

880
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,597
Yes?

881
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:21,430
Madame Someka? Yes, she's here

882
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:25,836
Is that a client?
Tell them I'll be right over!

883
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,101
I understand, yes

884
01:16:30,111 --> 01:16:35,071
- They need another geisha at Ishimura's
- Any place will do me

885
01:16:35,183 --> 01:16:38,152
I've got to start paying
for my new kimono!

886
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,755
I'm off to find myself a new patron

887
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:46,258
Someka, your man won't be too pleased

888
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,521
Oh, so what?

889
01:17:01,142 --> 01:17:03,303
Your guest has arrived, madame

890
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,209
Really? Thank you

891
01:17:07,715 --> 01:17:09,444
This way

892
01:17:10,651 --> 01:17:13,211
Sorry to have kept you waiting

893
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:16,853
Oh? You've come alone?

894
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:20,689
Yes... I'm terribly sorry

895
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:29,735
I'm afraid it was impossible
for him to come this evening

896
01:17:29,837 --> 01:17:33,204
I told him I couldn't go without him...

897
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:36,367
...but he said he had some
pressing business

898
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:43,406
No... it was too much to expect him
to be able to attend

899
01:17:43,518 --> 01:17:45,611
It's not your fault

900
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:51,590
Madame Mizuno instructed me to offer
you whatever help you require

901
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,760
She even phoned him

902
01:17:54,862 --> 01:17:57,330
Thank you

903
01:17:57,431 --> 01:18:04,166
But... it was hard for me
to pluck up the courage to come here

904
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,475
But now...

905
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:12,838
Please excuse me...

906
01:18:14,081 --> 01:18:16,948
...but your meal is ready to be served

907
01:18:17,051 --> 01:18:19,986
- Please bring it in
- Yes, sir

908
01:18:24,592 --> 01:18:26,389
Hello?

909
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:31,693
Is that number 1565, Koishikawa?
May I speak to Mr Takayama, please?

910
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:33,767
Welcome back

911
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:36,166
Oh, that wasn't much fun after all

912
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:39,034
Oh... it's me

913
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:45,211
Well, I'm not sure...

914
01:18:46,647 --> 01:18:48,171
All right

915
01:18:48,282 --> 01:18:51,809
Why treat him so harshly?
It's been a long time

916
01:18:55,056 --> 01:18:57,923
- Do you have a 10 yen coin?
- What for?

917
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,358
- Just for a moment...
- Give it me back after

918
01:19:02,964 --> 01:19:07,025
It's heads. That's it, then. I'm going.
Thanks

919
01:19:07,134 --> 01:19:11,662
You know, that inn isn't that wonderful

920
01:19:11,772 --> 01:19:15,799
And to ask you to come to an inn...
well, that's just bad manners

921
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:18,335
She's right

922
01:19:18,446 --> 01:19:22,780
Hello, is that Takaya's?
Can you do me a chicken sandwich?

923
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:27,548
Plus vegetables for two. And bring them
over to Tsuta House, yes?

924
01:19:30,524 --> 01:19:34,051
- Is mother not home yet?
- I wonder where she's gone

925
01:19:34,996 --> 01:19:38,090
Should I wear a kimono
or a Western-style suit?

926
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:44,001
Why not put on fancy lingerie
and wear a kimono over the top?

927
01:19:44,105 --> 01:19:46,972
- You can get out of it quicker
- I beg your pardon!

928
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,871
Where are you off to?

929
01:19:50,177 --> 01:19:53,044
I know, don't I, Nanako?

930
01:19:53,147 --> 01:19:56,981
Please tell sister
that I'm taking a day off

931
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:02,018
- How are you getting there?
- By car

932
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:05,024
- Don't go too fast!
- Oharu!

933
01:20:05,126 --> 01:20:06,593
Yes?

934
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:11,256
- Get me a cab, will you?
- Yes

935
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,623
Welcome home, mistress

936
01:21:05,853 --> 01:21:09,846
Let's take this discussion elsewhere,
shall we?

937
01:21:09,957 --> 01:21:13,449
We can't have you coming to the house
and screaming at us

938
01:21:13,561 --> 01:21:16,826
You deserve to be screamed at!

939
01:21:16,931 --> 01:21:21,391
But we were the ones who were fooled,
you know?

940
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,699
She lied about her age by two years

941
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:29,333
I know I shouldn't say this,
but Namie and I never got along

942
01:21:29,443 --> 01:21:31,741
I never did anything against her...

943
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:35,577
...but what right did she have
to act like that?

944
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,617
I spoke to her harshly...

945
01:21:37,718 --> 01:21:43,315
There, you see?
You've just admitted you mistreated her!

946
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:47,827
- The police are here...
- What the hell did you call them for?

947
01:21:47,928 --> 01:21:53,867
He said that he'd like you to accompany
him down to the station, too, mistress

948
01:21:53,968 --> 01:21:57,096
What? Me as well?

949
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:59,968
If you're going, Mother,
then I'll go with you

950
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:37,410
She's had to go with that Chiba man
to the police station?

951
01:22:37,511 --> 01:22:41,003
Well, I'll go straight to the station, too

952
01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:44,175
It's nothing serious.
I know someone there

953
01:22:44,285 --> 01:22:47,083
Is that so, madame?

954
01:22:47,188 --> 01:22:49,554
Well, thank you so much, madame

955
01:22:49,657 --> 01:22:51,989
What's going to happen?

956
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:56,223
They'll be fine. This geisha house
has one of the highest reputations

957
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:59,891
Is it really that bad
for the mistress and Katsuyo?

958
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,935
- It's true
- What will we do?

959
01:23:03,037 --> 01:23:07,064
- What's going to happen?
- Oharu! Is the bath free?

960
01:23:07,174 --> 01:23:09,108
Yes, it is

961
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:12,976
- I'd like to take a shower
- A shower?

962
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,710
Still burning with all that passion
from last night, eh?

963
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:22,551
No, not passion, just disappointment.
I wish I hadn't gone

964
01:23:22,656 --> 01:23:26,854
There's nothing worse than a stingy guy
down on his luck

965
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:29,725
What are you talking about?

966
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:34,597
I think now is definitely the time
to break up

967
01:23:35,903 --> 01:23:41,705
He thinks he can have me for old time's
sake without spending any money!

968
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,812
I'm so hungry.
I haven't had breakfast yet

969
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:55,455
- I'd love curry and rice
- I'd like that, too!

970
01:23:55,556 --> 01:23:59,788
- No, you're still only allowed porridge
- Only porridge?

971
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:05,230
Lt'll be ready in a minute.
And I've got you some pickled plums

972
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:09,393
Oharu, pickled plums
always bring bad luck!

973
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,669
I don't know, even talking about them
is unlucky!

974
01:24:15,776 --> 01:24:18,745
Is that so, madame?

975
01:24:23,784 --> 01:24:25,809
Hello?

976
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,820
Yes, that's right

977
01:24:27,922 --> 01:24:29,651
Madame Someka?

978
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:34,526
Oh, Someka's there, is she?
Perfect

979
01:24:34,628 --> 01:24:36,755
Call her for me

980
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:41,129
Hello, Someka?

981
01:24:41,235 --> 01:24:46,138
Listen, I promised to entertain a client
for Madame Mizuno this evening

982
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:52,577
- Could you stand in for me?
- Who, me? Well...

983
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,944
Thank you so much

984
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:56,983
Yes... yes...

985
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:02,020
Thank you so much for considering me
in your place

986
01:25:02,122 --> 01:25:08,118
Can I just ask you, are the songs
timed to five beats or seven beats?

987
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:22,600
...and it changes there?

988
01:25:31,185 --> 01:25:35,918
It's such an honour to be asked
to take your place, mistress

989
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,882
Who'll pick you up
from the police station?

990
01:25:40,995 --> 01:25:43,088
Oh, really?

991
01:25:43,197 --> 01:25:45,688
Well, please take care

992
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,595
Good afternoon

993
01:25:48,702 --> 01:25:51,933
Oh, welcome, madame

994
01:25:56,477 --> 01:26:01,710
I've just been at the police station
and it's not looking too good

995
01:26:01,815 --> 01:26:06,047
Anyway, they'll be home later
after they've been questioned

996
01:26:06,153 --> 01:26:07,950
Really?

997
01:26:08,922 --> 01:26:13,586
The mistress just called to ask me
to take her place this evening

998
01:26:13,694 --> 01:26:16,128
I'm all excited about it...

999
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:19,722
...but it's too bad that
she can't make it herself

1000
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:23,098
I see... She asked you?

1001
01:26:23,203 --> 01:26:25,933
Well, do your best for Otsuta, won't you?

1002
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,565
Yes, of course

1003
01:26:28,676 --> 01:26:34,911
I'll telephone Mr Saeki to come.
You should have a man in the house

1004
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,835
- You must be exhausted
- Welcome home

1005
01:26:57,338 --> 01:27:00,967
Sorry to have caused you
so much worry

1006
01:27:01,075 --> 01:27:04,238
Sometimes these things just happen

1007
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:07,770
Tomorrow Mr Saeki will come here

1008
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:10,679
- He'll speak to the police for you
- Thank you

1009
01:27:10,784 --> 01:27:13,753
I've learned a lot from the experience

1010
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:17,255
Aunty, mummy's gone

1011
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:21,988
- Oh? Where's Yoneko?
- She just popped out

1012
01:27:22,096 --> 01:27:25,623
She's always popping out, that one

1013
01:27:25,733 --> 01:27:30,568
I have some things
I'd like to discuss with you...

1014
01:27:30,671 --> 01:27:33,663
- Can we go upstairs?
- Very well

1015
01:27:35,075 --> 01:27:38,567
It's late, Fujiko. Go back to sleep

1016
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:54,586
I've been thinking things over
at the police station...

1017
01:27:54,695 --> 01:27:58,461
...and I'd very much like you
to buy this house

1018
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:01,398
Oh? Why is that?

1019
01:28:01,502 --> 01:28:05,131
Do you not see that's the only way?

1020
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:10,506
After this, the reputation of this house
will be in tatters

1021
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:15,742
It would be better
than watching it fall into ruin

1022
01:28:15,849 --> 01:28:17,646
Really?

1023
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:22,278
Well, I'll have to think about it

1024
01:28:23,357 --> 01:28:26,053
I don't know if I'd want to...

1025
01:28:28,695 --> 01:28:34,224
It would be much better for us
if you were to buy the place

1026
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:39,000
Well, I'll talk the matter over
with Mr Saeki

1027
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:46,005
I didn't tell you this before...

1028
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:51,176
...but that money from Mr Hanayama
was given as a final favour

1029
01:28:51,285 --> 01:28:53,981
Say no more

1030
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:56,078
I thought as much

1031
01:28:57,424 --> 01:28:59,153
Forgive me

1032
01:29:00,727 --> 01:29:06,393
I can no longer depend on men
for my welfare

1033
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,866
Please excuse me

1034
01:29:20,514 --> 01:29:22,482
Someka's back!

1035
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:27,020
Oh, I fancy going to Hawaii!
By plane, of course

1036
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,588
And say goodbye to Japan

1037
01:29:30,524 --> 01:29:33,220
Welcome home. Everybody's back

1038
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:37,764
I thought so.
I knew everything would be all right

1039
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,091
Oh, I'm so drunk

1040
01:29:42,936 --> 01:29:45,666
It's great work, being a geisha

1041
01:29:45,772 --> 01:29:47,865
The bright lights...

1042
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:52,944
...and the beautiful arrangements
of yellow flowers!

1043
01:29:53,046 --> 01:29:55,276
Fine food to eat...

1044
01:29:55,382 --> 01:29:57,680
...gorgeous kimono to wear...

1045
01:29:57,784 --> 01:30:00,184
...and making money
through entertainment

1046
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:03,450
- There's no other work like it
- You're right!

1047
01:30:13,901 --> 01:30:18,235
It's always such fun
when you can fool the punters

1048
01:30:18,338 --> 01:30:21,933
And fooling them is my best trick!

1049
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:39,559
What's wrong?

1050
01:30:41,962 --> 01:30:44,522
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine!

1051
01:30:44,631 --> 01:30:46,189
I'm fine!

1052
01:30:49,937 --> 01:30:53,065
Oh, no, I feel terrible... terrible!

1053
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:12,248
I heard that
Otsuta has been in a spot of bother

1054
01:31:12,359 --> 01:31:16,318
- Are they all back home now?
- Yes, they've all returned

1055
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:19,729
It wasn't anything
the mistress couldn't handle

1056
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:21,460
Listen...

1057
01:31:21,568 --> 01:31:26,096
...we're looking for another maid
and I thought of you...

1058
01:31:26,206 --> 01:31:29,232
- You're just joking
- No, I'm serious

1059
01:31:29,343 --> 01:31:33,074
You must excuse me,
I'm in the middle of cooking

1060
01:31:34,014 --> 01:31:39,543
It's an absolute travesty for us all,
being taken off by the police

1061
01:31:41,154 --> 01:31:45,454
And your reputation will be tarnished
from now on, too

1062
01:31:45,559 --> 01:31:50,019
I wanted to talk it over with you...

1063
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:54,226
...about selling this house
and paying off my debts

1064
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:58,395
Really? So you're going to open an inn
like we discussed?

1065
01:31:58,505 --> 01:32:02,498
No, I'll continue here in my profession
as a geisha

1066
01:32:03,443 --> 01:32:06,435
This is the only profession I know

1067
01:32:06,546 --> 01:32:09,208
Continue at Tsuta House?

1068
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:12,683
Madame Mizuno agrees it's a good idea

1069
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:16,244
She'll buy the house
and then rent it to me

1070
01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:21,293
Eh? And when did you reach
this momentous decision?

1071
01:32:21,395 --> 01:32:23,329
Last night

1072
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:27,990
- It's settled, then?
- Yes

1073
01:32:28,101 --> 01:32:32,401
I'll receive half the money
when we sign the contract

1074
01:32:32,506 --> 01:32:36,704
At last, I'll be able to pay you back
all the money I owe you

1075
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,641
Please excuse me

1076
01:32:38,745 --> 01:32:42,272
Mr Saeki has just arrived
from the police station

1077
01:32:42,382 --> 01:32:45,681
Really? I'll be down in a moment

1078
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,382
Excuse me

1079
01:32:48,488 --> 01:32:50,080
- Mr Saeki?
- Yes

1080
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:55,492
Now I see. Madame Mizuno's
putting up all the money...

1081
01:32:55,595 --> 01:32:59,156
...but Mr Hanayama
will be the actual owner

1082
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:00,460
Very smart

1083
01:33:00,567 --> 01:33:03,127
That's not how it is at all

1084
01:33:03,236 --> 01:33:06,763
I have no idea what you're up to...

1085
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:09,865
...but I know it's not what it seems

1086
01:33:09,976 --> 01:33:12,706
It's all very typical of a geisha!

1087
01:33:12,813 --> 01:33:16,613
You'll get your money back
with interest

1088
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:21,710
- Can I offer you one?
- No

1089
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:38,636
- Oh, thank you so much, Mr Saeki
- It took slightly longer than I thought

1090
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:42,573
Carting me off to the police station?
You amaze me!

1091
01:33:42,676 --> 01:33:45,543
We've been through all of this

1092
01:33:45,645 --> 01:33:48,773
You were almost up
on a blackmail charge...

1093
01:33:48,882 --> 01:33:52,682
...and wouldn't have been
going home for quite a while

1094
01:33:52,786 --> 01:33:55,812
Well, let's have Namie's things, then

1095
01:33:55,922 --> 01:34:01,019
Well, now it's all over.
Let's drink to that. Oharu?

1096
01:34:01,128 --> 01:34:03,062
Yes, coming

1097
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:05,429
Excuse me

1098
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:13,036
<i>Sake at midday?
Things are looking up</i>

1099
01:34:15,475 --> 01:34:20,071
- Mr Saeki...
- Pleased to see you

1100
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:25,049
I must thank you for all that your aunt
is doing for my younger sister

1101
01:34:25,152 --> 01:34:31,523
I hear she's willing to buy this place.
I really am most grateful to her

1102
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:34,753
Please give her my best regards

1103
01:34:34,861 --> 01:34:38,388
I'll call on her soon to thank her

1104
01:34:38,498 --> 01:34:40,898
Sister, won't you have a glass?

1105
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:46,132
No, I never partake between meals,
that's my rule. Thanks anyway

1106
01:34:47,774 --> 01:34:49,435
Please...

1107
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:54,970
Oh, don't bother doing that for me!

1108
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:58,949
You have much more
important guests here

1109
01:34:59,052 --> 01:35:04,217
Tell Someka that she has to pay me
back everything this month

1110
01:35:05,792 --> 01:35:07,783
Another one?

1111
01:35:07,894 --> 01:35:09,759
It's got a funny taste

1112
01:35:09,863 --> 01:35:12,195
Well, that's the end of it

1113
01:35:12,299 --> 01:35:15,063
And Namie has a new job

1114
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:17,693
At some third-rate place

1115
01:35:17,804 --> 01:35:20,637
Well, tell her to drop in to see us
some time

1116
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:22,571
I wonder...

1117
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:26,874
She's stuck as a third-rate geisha now,
so she wouldn't come round here

1118
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:30,143
Oi! Call me a rickshaw, will you?

1119
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:34,914
A rickshaw? Certainly, sir

1120
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,420
Please...

1121
01:35:38,091 --> 01:35:41,288
- I'll get going now
- Thank you

1122
01:35:41,394 --> 01:35:46,991
From now on you, your aunt and I
will have many dealings together

1123
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:51,969
Mr Saeki, I'm going out, too.
Will you walk with me?

1124
01:35:52,072 --> 01:35:54,540
I'm going back to my office

1125
01:35:54,641 --> 01:35:57,109
Just as far as the bus stop, then?

1126
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:01,874
What she really wants is for you
to take her to see a film

1127
01:36:01,982 --> 01:36:05,509
Good job they had you around...

1128
01:36:05,619 --> 01:36:09,612
...otherwise this place
would've been finished

1129
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:12,954
- Bye
- Many thanks

1130
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:33,307
So, you think my mother should continue
in her profession as a geisha?

1131
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:35,881
Well...

1132
01:36:35,982 --> 01:36:40,112
I want her to leave the profession
for good

1133
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:43,656
If only you could advise her...

1134
01:36:43,757 --> 01:36:46,419
There's no way I could do that

1135
01:36:49,729 --> 01:36:53,722
I shouldn't really say this to you,
Katsuyo...

1136
01:36:54,701 --> 01:36:59,934
...but I think that life as a geisha
probably suits your mother best

1137
01:37:00,907 --> 01:37:03,899
My aunt thinks so, too

1138
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,678
I feel sorry for my mother

1139
01:37:11,851 --> 01:37:14,547
Do you have any marriage plans,
Katsuyo?

1140
01:37:16,022 --> 01:37:19,685
- I haven't given it a thought
- Why not?

1141
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:23,229
To be given away as a bride?
Or take a husband into my home?

1142
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:25,958
You're free to choose whichever

1143
01:37:26,066 --> 01:37:28,398
Yes, it's up to me

1144
01:37:28,501 --> 01:37:34,497
But I'm from a disreputable geisha house
that has little earning potential

1145
01:37:34,607 --> 01:37:37,599
Who would want to marry
a woman like me?

1146
01:37:37,711 --> 01:37:40,509
My husband could become
the house manager...

1147
01:37:40,613 --> 01:37:44,674
...but young people nowadays
aren't interested in the business

1148
01:37:44,784 --> 01:37:48,948
- I don't know if that's true
- I wonder...

1149
01:37:50,757 --> 01:37:53,749
But it can't be helped now

1150
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:58,059
I'd only feel ashamed if I got married

1151
01:38:01,968 --> 01:38:05,802
I was born into a famous geisha house
but only trained as a beginner

1152
01:38:05,905 --> 01:38:09,500
It feels like I'm only a half-geisha

1153
01:38:09,609 --> 01:38:12,100
I don't know what I am

1154
01:38:12,212 --> 01:38:14,703
Marriage is just a dream

1155
01:38:14,814 --> 01:38:19,478
More importantly, though, I worry
about how I'm going to make a living

1156
01:38:38,805 --> 01:38:44,266
"...and they all agreed."
Understand?

1157
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,645
- What's this?
- This?

1158
01:38:47,747 --> 01:38:49,715
Just hold on a moment

1159
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,880
Yes... that's right

1160
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:59,458
She hasn't returned home yet

1161
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:03,325
- Who is it?
- I understand, yes...

1162
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:12,100
- It was Madame Otoyo for Someka
- Oh, pay no attention to her

1163
01:39:12,205 --> 01:39:15,504
- Aunty...
- Coming

1164
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,311
Morning

1165
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:31,413
Have you been drinking, Someka?

1166
01:39:31,524 --> 01:39:34,186
Forgive me, mistress

1167
01:39:34,294 --> 01:39:36,694
My sister just phoned for you

1168
01:39:36,796 --> 01:39:38,127
Mistress...

1169
01:39:39,966 --> 01:39:44,460
...that man of mine went back home
to the provinces...

1170
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,030
...yesterday evening

1171
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:50,234
Are you talking about your boyfriend?

1172
01:39:51,678 --> 01:39:55,671
He probably thought
nothing would ever become of us

1173
01:39:56,649 --> 01:40:00,642
Seems he's gone back home
to get married

1174
01:40:01,754 --> 01:40:05,952
I did everything for him!
Men can be so heartless!

1175
01:40:06,893 --> 01:40:09,088
Let's read over there

1176
01:40:10,697 --> 01:40:14,724
Listen, Someka,
you may not want to hear this...

1177
01:40:14,834 --> 01:40:18,429
...but I think it's for your own good

1178
01:40:18,538 --> 01:40:22,338
After all, he was ten years
younger than you

1179
01:40:22,442 --> 01:40:26,310
Better to be done with him
while you still have another chance

1180
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,444
Please! Don't be so harsh on me!

1181
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:34,384
Did you feel the same
when you separated?

1182
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:41,188
But you'd never have got married
so it's better that you've separated

1183
01:40:42,362 --> 01:40:46,321
And you should repay my sister's loan
as soon as possible

1184
01:40:46,432 --> 01:40:49,959
I'm relieved that I'm selling this house

1185
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:55,063
Lucky for you,
you have something to sell

1186
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:58,838
<i>I've only got myself
and my samisen - playing to sell</i>

1187
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:02,479
I can't earn enough to repay my debts

1188
01:41:02,582 --> 01:41:06,416
But now you've only yourself to feed

1189
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:11,650
Mistress, I'm working as hard as I can
every day...

1190
01:41:11,758 --> 01:41:13,851
...but it's still not enough

1191
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:19,962
You know what?
I checked at the Guild office

1192
01:41:20,066 --> 01:41:23,035
They said they'd received
all my payment slips

1193
01:41:23,136 --> 01:41:27,038
But when I asked the accountant,
the amount you'd sent was lower

1194
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,608
So however much I work... Listen to me!

1195
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:35,640
Isn't that right, Nanako?
You said the same when Namie left

1196
01:41:35,748 --> 01:41:40,617
"These payments don't add up."
You showed me your notes, didn't you?

1197
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,054
- Yes...
- They can hear you on the street!

1198
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:50,056
Someka's making the same complaint
as Namie

1199
01:41:50,163 --> 01:41:53,155
You can't give us back
the hours we worked...

1200
01:41:53,266 --> 01:41:56,235
...but you can give us back the money

1201
01:41:56,336 --> 01:42:00,670
Well, you never settle up
what you owe me...

1202
01:42:00,773 --> 01:42:03,003
...so I don't pay attention
to the slips

1203
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:07,068
So you admit it, then,
you fix the payment slips?

1204
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:11,617
Maybe Mother makes
the odd mistake now and again...

1205
01:42:11,718 --> 01:42:13,549
...but that happens everywhere!

1206
01:42:13,653 --> 01:42:18,317
- Oh, is that so?
- All geisha should quit their jobs!

1207
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:22,656
- Katsuyo...
- You're just feeling sorry for yourself

1208
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:25,856
If you don't like the work
then you should leave

1209
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:30,700
Thanks for your kind advice!
Let's go, Nanako

1210
01:42:30,803 --> 01:42:32,134
Someka...

1211
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:38,837
Come on, we can find work elsewhere,
this isn't the only geisha house

1212
01:42:38,945 --> 01:42:44,611
I know I have obligations to you,
but I also have reproaches!

1213
01:42:44,717 --> 01:42:47,515
- Someka...
- Why don't you get out, then?

1214
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,612
OK, then... I will get out

1215
01:42:51,991 --> 01:42:53,982
I will get out...

1216
01:42:55,862 --> 01:43:00,629
I'm crying... but it's not
because of what you've said

1217
01:43:02,268 --> 01:43:06,261
I'm crying... because my lover has left me

1218
01:43:07,774 --> 01:43:09,765
You know nothing about men!

1219
01:43:09,876 --> 01:43:12,777
What's so good about knowing
about men?

1220
01:43:12,879 --> 01:43:18,010
Eh? What does your daughter
think she's talking about?

1221
01:43:20,853 --> 01:43:24,914
So, women don't have to depend
on men? Is that right, mistress?

1222
01:43:25,024 --> 01:43:26,958
Mother!

1223
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,255
Enough, Katsuyo!

1224
01:43:32,932 --> 01:43:36,925
She thinks that women
don't have to depend on men!

1225
01:43:38,371 --> 01:43:41,932
Right? She says women don't need men!

1226
01:43:47,447 --> 01:43:48,971
Mummy!

1227
01:44:25,051 --> 01:44:26,382
Good

1228
01:44:27,053 --> 01:44:32,320
No, that's wrong. I told you before.
Do it again...

1229
01:44:34,026 --> 01:44:35,584
Yes...

1230
01:44:38,931 --> 01:44:41,229
Careful...

1231
01:44:43,669 --> 01:44:45,830
Careful... good...

1232
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,007
Good

1233
01:44:52,111 --> 01:44:54,409
That's enough for today

1234
01:44:54,514 --> 01:44:58,473
You have to study very hard
if you want to become a geisha

1235
01:45:07,894 --> 01:45:10,795
- Oh!
- Mistress...

1236
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:20,396
I had far too much to drink
the other day and spoke out of turn

1237
01:45:20,506 --> 01:45:24,966
I can't apologise enough, forgive me

1238
01:45:25,077 --> 01:45:27,739
Please forgive me, mistress

1239
01:45:30,116 --> 01:45:34,712
Stop that, Someka.
There's no need to apologise

1240
01:45:36,088 --> 01:45:37,988
Mistress...

1241
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:41,082
...will you let me come back?

1242
01:45:42,295 --> 01:45:47,665
It feels so good coming back here
and seeing the new trainees...

1243
01:45:47,767 --> 01:45:50,258
...I think I'm going to cry

1244
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:57,198
I intend to make a completely fresh start.
I hope we can work something out

1245
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,279
Mistress...

1246
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:06,113
...that Nanako is awful, isn't she?
She's working at Tsutaji's now

1247
01:46:07,887 --> 01:46:09,548
As she wishes

1248
01:46:11,123 --> 01:46:14,422
- Where's Katsuyo?
- She's upstairs sewing

1249
01:46:14,527 --> 01:46:17,360
Is she really? Katsuyo?

1250
01:46:17,463 --> 01:46:19,328
How nice!

1251
01:46:19,432 --> 01:46:23,732
I love that noise the machines make.
I'll go up and see her

1252
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:25,804
This is for you...

1253
01:46:25,905 --> 01:46:29,306
Oh, you shouldn't have

1254
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:36,204
I'll let Otsuta keep
the house for a while...

1255
01:46:36,315 --> 01:46:42,117
...but I may move her out and open
a branch of my restaurant there instead

1256
01:46:42,221 --> 01:46:44,212
At the house?

1257
01:46:45,124 --> 01:46:47,991
And what will become of the girls there?

1258
01:46:50,096 --> 01:46:52,326
If they want to continue as geisha...

1259
01:46:52,431 --> 01:46:56,527
...then they can all go across the river
and find work there

1260
01:46:57,503 --> 01:47:03,669
Still, I've seen their new trainees
and none of them has any potential

1261
01:47:04,577 --> 01:47:09,708
Otsuta's been a geisha many years
but she's still no judge of character

1262
01:47:09,815 --> 01:47:13,751
They'll all turn out just like Namie

1263
01:47:13,853 --> 01:47:17,846
One has to put in years of hard work
to become a geisha

1264
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:22,251
I'd like you to consider this...

1265
01:47:22,361 --> 01:47:26,195
...you're a woman
with many fine qualities...

1266
01:47:26,299 --> 01:47:30,292
...and I think you're wasting
your talents as a mere maid

1267
01:47:30,403 --> 01:47:33,201
What do you think?

1268
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,675
I don't require an immediate answer...

1269
01:47:38,778 --> 01:47:43,272
...but I'll give you a month or so
to make up your mind

1270
01:47:46,352 --> 01:47:49,753
I was also considering Katsuyo...

1271
01:47:49,855 --> 01:47:54,849
...but on reflection
I don't think she'd fit in at all

1272
01:47:58,631 --> 01:48:03,000
If you say no, I have plenty of others
to choose from

1273
01:48:04,303 --> 01:48:07,238
And the mistress knows all about this?

1274
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:10,174
Of course not

1275
01:48:14,614 --> 01:48:17,082
So?

1276
01:48:18,351 --> 01:48:21,013
Well...

1277
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:25,079
...I don't think I can accept your offer,
madame

1278
01:48:25,191 --> 01:48:27,853
I'm terribly sorry

1279
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,928
Really?

1280
01:48:30,997 --> 01:48:32,988
Very well, then

1281
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:37,995
Don't breathe a word of this
to Otsuta or anyone, will you?

1282
01:48:38,104 --> 01:48:39,435
No...

1283
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,436
Well, then, if you'll excuse me...

1284
01:49:35,561 --> 01:49:38,587
- Good
- Fujiko's coming on, isn't she?

1285
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:41,690
- You think so?
- Oh, very promising

1286
01:49:42,968 --> 01:49:45,664
I have a new geisha to present to you!

1287
01:49:49,175 --> 01:49:51,541
Oh, I say!

1288
01:49:52,478 --> 01:49:57,347
- May I present Takiko to you
- It's a honour to meet you

1289
01:49:57,450 --> 01:50:02,683
- How wonderful she looks!
- Congratulations

1290
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:09,659
I see that you've fully recovered,
Madame Otsuta. I'm so pleased

1291
01:50:09,762 --> 01:50:12,230
Thank you so much

1292
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:15,789
We're starting up our business again
with some new faces

1293
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,768
I wish you all the best

1294
01:50:18,871 --> 01:50:20,600
Please excuse us

1295
01:50:28,314 --> 01:50:33,980
- She must've cost her 300,000 yen
- You reckon that much?

1296
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:36,850
That sash she was wearing
was nothing special

1297
01:50:36,956 --> 01:50:40,687
And her hair wasn't arranged properly
at all, was it?

1298
01:50:40,793 --> 01:50:44,388
But they don't care about
those things nowadays

1299
01:50:44,497 --> 01:50:46,294
That's true

1300
01:50:46,398 --> 01:50:52,200
Mistress, I bought these for everyone
as they looked so tasty

1301
01:50:52,304 --> 01:50:54,772
It's my treat

1302
01:50:56,308 --> 01:51:00,142
Oharu, you're such a kind person

1303
01:51:00,246 --> 01:51:04,706
Isn't she? I don't know what I'd do
without her help

1304
01:51:06,485 --> 01:51:10,717
Not at all. I'll bring the tea through
in a moment

1305
01:51:10,823 --> 01:51:14,156
Oharu, get the girls
to give you some help

1306
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,091
- Kiyo!
- Yes?

1307
01:51:27,873 --> 01:51:31,172
- What is it you're making?
- I'm no good

1308
01:51:31,277 --> 01:51:34,735
I'm not sure I'll be able to make anything!
I'm just practising

1309
01:51:35,815 --> 01:51:38,545
You're very diligent, Katsuyo

1310
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:41,484
No, not really

1311
01:51:41,587 --> 01:51:45,648
I just know that
I have to find some kind of work

1312
01:51:45,758 --> 01:51:48,192
I can't do what my mother does

1313
01:51:49,428 --> 01:51:53,762
I have to find some means
to support us both when she gets old

1314
01:51:55,668 --> 01:51:57,693
You're right

1315
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:06,006
You know, I'm so glad
that you're here, Oharu

1316
01:52:06,111 --> 01:52:09,740
I can always talk to you
and ask your advice

1317
01:52:10,883 --> 01:52:16,344
Of course, I'd be happy
to offer you help and advice anytime

1318
01:52:17,723 --> 01:52:21,215
Yes... I know that

1319
01:52:22,428 --> 01:52:27,331
And I realise that
you may not be here forever...

1320
01:52:27,433 --> 01:52:33,429
Well, I'd like to take a short trip
to my late husband's hometown

1321
01:52:33,539 --> 01:52:35,632
- In the provinces?
- Yes

1322
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:40,769
I have to visit the graves
of my husband and child

1323
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,542
After that, who knows?

1324
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:47,713
My husband's relatives are very strict

1325
01:52:48,854 --> 01:52:53,814
I left home so I could be free
from their constraints...

1326
01:52:53,926 --> 01:52:57,885
...but now I feel it's selfish of me
to stay away

1327
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,560
I see...

1328
01:53:06,538 --> 01:53:11,441
Please try one of these sweet buns,
they're delicious

1329
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:28,937
The End



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
