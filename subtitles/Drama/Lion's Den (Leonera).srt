00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,389

00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,896

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,192
who's that kid?

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,699
my neighbour

6
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,861
where does he live?

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,335
in that house

8
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,496
where is the house?

9
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,868
on a street

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,066
where is the street?

11
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,166
in the city

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,571
where is the city?

13
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,870
between the mountains

14
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,934
which mountains?

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,071
the andes mountains

16
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,681
where are the andes?

17
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,245
in south america,

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,682
american continent

19
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,912
washed by the seas

20
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,453
at the heart of the planet

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,218
and how is the planet?

22
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,759
a ball that bounces in the sky

23
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:40,291
LlON'S DEN

24
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,356
-Want some lunch?
-No, thanks.

25
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,982
See you later.

26
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:47,110
There's a lot of blood.
Lots of blood everywhere.

27
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,347
-Take it easy.
-Please help me.

28
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,290
-Tell me what happened.
-Don't know. I don't understand.

29
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,486
There's a lot of blood.
I don't know if they're okay.

30
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,029
I can't go near them.
Ramiro!

31
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,533
Ramiro, are you okay?

32
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,865
Nahuel, come here.

33
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,635
Listen to me, Julia.

34
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,478
-See Nahuel?
-I think he's in the kitchen.

35
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,337
-And Ramiro?
-He's in the bedroom.

36
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,278
Or in the corridor,
but I can't go...

37
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,820
-See if he can move.
-I can't.

38
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,383
Listen to me.

39
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,218
It'll be alright.
Do you hear me?

40
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,658
-ls he breathing?
-Yes, he is.

41
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,960
Is he a friend of yours?

42
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,126
Stay calm, we'll help you.

43
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,568
-Police!
-Someone's at the door.

44
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,400
Open the door! Police!

45
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,474
-I won't.
-lt'll be okay.

46
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,074
Do you hear me?
Open the door!

47
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,669
-Please tell them to leave!
-Open up!

48
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,907
Easy.

49
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,583
-They're knocking too hard.
-They're there to help you.

50
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,755
I can't move.

51
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,381
Do you hear?
We're coming in!

52
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,752
Take a shot of this.

53
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,755
Take the chest.

54
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,102
The belly.

55
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,729
Hand over the chalk.

56
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,902
Get the neck wound.

57
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,143
Got it?
Okay, let's turn him over...

58
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,872
and see what happens.

59
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,739
That'll do.

60
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,449
Ramiro? Can you hear me?

61
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,609
Don't move.

62
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,214
I'll get the stuff,
we'll take him out.

63
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,951
Take it easy, Ramiro.

64
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,028
Julia...

65
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,695
Look at me. Are you okay?

66
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,966
Take it easy.

67
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,600
Do you want to talk?

68
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,764
I won't hurt you.

69
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,254
I'm Mr. Jauregui,
your defense counsel.

70
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,423
I'll represent you before the judge
and the D.A.

71
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,553
for your statement.

72
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,991
You're accused of the murder
of Nahuel Heredia.

73
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,667
We knowthe circumstances...

74
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,738
around the case are complicated.

75
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,639
The other accused in this case
is Ramiro Nievas,

76
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,641
who was arrested and hospitalized.

77
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,310
He must sign the statement, too.

78
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,778
Draw your home, Julia.

79
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,417
And now draw yourself.

80
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,745
See a gap...

81
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,119
between your thoughts
and what you want to say?

82
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,856
Do you remember Nahuel?

83
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,089
And Ramiro?

84
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,300
I must inform you
you cannot be released...

85
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,203
due to the nature
of the crime you're accused of,

86
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,311
and that you are to remain
at the Court's disposal.

87
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,980
Julia Zárate
is to be remanded on custody.

88
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,643
Notify the state prison authorities
of her confinement.

89
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,447
Pleased to meet you, young lady.

90
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,490
Guard, take her away.

91
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,029
Stay calm.

92
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,163
Stay calm.

93
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,041
'Evening.

94
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,778

95
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,681

00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,060

104
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,882
Wipe your hands.

105
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,617
Take her away, please.

106
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,484
Let's go.

107
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,122
Hey, new girl!

108
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,785
Blondie, give me a cigarette.

109
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,156
Undress.

110
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,968
Blonde bitch, give us your cigs.

111
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,750
Raise your arms.

112
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,309
Raise your arms.

113
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,423
Turn around.

114
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,269
-Howfar pregnant?
-I don't know.

115
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,463
Pull your pants down and crouch.

116
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,704
Pull open your panties.

117
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,679
Get up.

118
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,276
Pull up your pants.

119
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,448
How long since you slept?

120
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,723
I don't know.

121
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,384
I'll give you something later.

122
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,518
Let's go.
Hurry up!

123
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,357
I'm going to read to you...

124
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,458
the rules in here.

125
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,397

Physically, psychologically

132
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,526
Is that clear?

133
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,701
You're not here
'cause I want you to be,

134
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,101
or because I have space
and I sent for you.

135
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,767
You know
what got you here.

136
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,568
Easy...

137

Easy...

138
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,121
This is your cell block.

139
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,753
You're free to walk around.

140
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,019
You can go to any inmate's cell,

141
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,129
and she can go to yours.

142
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,728
One of you stands outside.
Understand?

143
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,091
I can't hear you.

144
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,065
-Yes.
-'Yes, Madam."

145
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,873

150
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,844
Hey, skinny blonde!

151
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,675
Hey, honey, do you have a smoke?

152
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,455
-Ponce?

00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,137
Zárate.

163
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,284
!Zárate, Julia!

164
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,087

?Zárate, Julia?

167
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,462
Out here at seven.
Can't hear you.

168
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,974
-Yes, okay.
-Yes what?

169
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,637
-Yes what?
-Yes, Madam.

170
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,708
García.

171
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,450
Here.

172
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,881
-Ratti.
-Here.

173
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,015
Here.

174
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,190
-Thanks.
-It's nothing.

175
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,405
-Nice body you got.
-Try it out, blondie.

176
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,135
What tender breasts you got, darling.

177
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,245
-Stop it.
-You don't like this? Don't be shy.

178
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,145
Stop it. Get off me!

179
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,079
Stay away, Gauchita.

180
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,417
You brat,
give me back my shampoo!

181
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,826
What's wrong, dumb ass?

182
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,063
I'm tired of your brat,
you hear?

183
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,208
Shut up, you bitch!

184
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,543
Guard! Fight in the showers.

185
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,881
Alegre! Quinoche!

186
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,088
Shut up!

187
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,296
That's enough.
That's enough, I said.

188
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,928
Miòo, Ponce, visit.

189
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,034
Zárate, no visit.

190
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,375
Rojo, no visit.

191
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,438
-Alegre, Escalante...
-Nobody came?

192
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,309
-See you, Marta.
-Good luck.

193
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,751
Ávalos, Núòez, visita.

194
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,390
And your family?

195
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,220
I don't have a family.

196
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,431
Mine is far away.

197
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,328
In Anauá. Been there?

198
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,462
Come, I have pictures.

199
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,907
-See you later.
-Bye, girls.

200
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,945
My sister.

201
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,985
She stayed with my other kids.

202
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,683
I send her my allowance, but...

203
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,619
it's useless.

204
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,492
You don't have anyone?

205
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,266
My old lady, but she lives abroad.

206
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,000
You don't belong here.
Why are you here?

207
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,003
-You don't know?.
-I knowwhat we all know.

208
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,211
What exactly?

209
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,940
You killed your boyfriend.
Is it true?

210
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,482
He wasn't my boyfriend.

211
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,550
Why are you here?

212
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,146
'Cause I'm poor.
And a fucking fool.

213
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,483
That's all.

214
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,326
-Some maté tea?
-Okay.

215
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,326
You're rich, aren't you?

216
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,563
If you've got money,
everything will be easier for us.

217
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,005
This is Julia.

218
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,543
Noelia...
Noelia's about to leave.

219
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,038
Rusa.

220
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,043
Susana.

221
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,749
Pacha.

222
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,680
Anything you want to know
about Julia, ask me.

223
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,586
You too.
Any doubt, you ask me.

224
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,528
What're you doing?
Go away with that cigarette.

225
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,595
No smoking around the kids.

226
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,823
Transfer!

227
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,608
Transfer!

228
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,860
Transfer!

229
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,403
Hello, Julia.

230
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,944
I'm Hugo Casman,
your defense attorney.

231
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,940
Your mother sent me.

232
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,080
I've been reading your case,
the evidence.

233
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,484
I need to understand.
You want to tell me?

234
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,597
You don't?

235
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,398
If you're not interested,
I can get up and leave.

236
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,767
Okay?

237
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,342
I wanted them
to get out of my house.

238
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,578
What was your relationship
with them?

239
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,084
One was my boyfriend
and the other, his lover.

240
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,418
Inmate Julia Zárate?

241
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,486
Any relative by the name of
Giusti, Sofía?

242
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,532
My mother.

243
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,295
You've got a package.

244
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,299
Three pacifiers.

245
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,275
Baby shoes.

246
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,278
An undershirt.

247
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,392
A baby bottle.

248
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,796
Family photos.

249
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,500
A letter.

250
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,011
Here.

251
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,747
No, thanks.

252
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,886
Still vomiting?

253
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,321
Did you sleep?

254
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,589
You're lucky you're pregnant.
This cell block isn't a prison.

255
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,936
Get me cards, Julia.

256
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,007
-Cards?
-Phone cards.

257
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,769
I can't.

258
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,244
Yes, you can.
Who sent you this stuff?

259
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,453
Shit!

260
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,053
I'll be back.

261
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,006
Raise your arms.

262
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,437
Take a deep breath.

263
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,513
Up and down.

264
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,779
Okay, now your legs.

265
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,253
Now let's do the legs.

266
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,424
Take deep breaths.

267
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,258
Very good.

268
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,726
-Howfar along are you?
-Eight months.

269
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,026
All set to go.

270
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,728
We're outcasts, you're in heaven.

271
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,962
Zárate, Julia.

272
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,561
Hand over some cigarettes.

273
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,731
So you're Zárate Julia?

274
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,639
Bitch, you're no kitten.

275
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,803
What's your problem?

276
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,872
You see her get off her ass?

277
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,984
Fat bitch!

278
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,182
She should stop eating.

279
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,812
The filthy bitch is ready to lay!

280
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,016
We tie pussy cats
to the cell bars.

281
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,218
Tie 'em tight
so they don't come loose.

282
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,932
This is what you tell the judge.

283
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,365
Read it out loud.

284
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,832
Why out loud?

285
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,233
To practice.

286
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,066
"l live in my family's apartment.

287
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,665
My mom's been in France for 1 3 years.

288
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,002
I lived alone for 4 years.
I met Nahuel.

289
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,579
He asked to stay.

290
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,319
First, for a week,
then he stayed on.

291
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,946
Later...

292
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,253
he brought a friend, Ramiro,
to live with us."

293
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,183
Do I have to learn it?

294
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,955
No, not by heart,

295
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,529
you've got to believe it.

296
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:10,128
In court you'll face the judge,
the prosecutor, the legal experts.

297
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,030
You'll shit your pants.

298
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,201
You have to convince them.

299
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,098
"Little by little,
they started to edge me out.

300
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,635
I supported them.

301
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,613
I was a stranger in my own house.

302
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,647
But I tried not to make trouble,
to get along as best we could.

303
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,815
One day I found them both in my bed,
but they never left.

304
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,656
It all started
about two years ago."

305
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,793
They must believe you,
not Ramiro.

306
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,431
Stick to the script.

307
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,764
Don't go for pity. Be strong.

308
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,801
And don't you dare cry.
That's very important.

309
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,280
What are you looking at?
Hey, can't you see she's pregnant?

310
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,784
Is this gonna take long?

311
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,792
We've been here since 6 AM!

312
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,186
It's damn hot in here.

313
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:15,356
Those bastards jacking off all day!

314
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,627
Here we are,
shitting ourselves in the heat.

315
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,829
Son of a bitch.
Look at this.

316
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,165
Look at those hungry chimps.

317
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,934
You guys from Campana?
Campana, right?

318
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,875
Who are you to ask?.

319
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,774
Well, I'm asking.

320
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,940
-Where are you from?
-None of your business.

321
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,041
Never seen you before.

322
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,641
-Where you from?
-Olmos.

323
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,450
Olmos? I was told that at Olmos,
they're all faggots.

324
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,702
Go sew your panties!

325
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,969
Don't be jealous
or I'll steal him from you.

326
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,979
Zárate, Julia.
Come here.

327
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,479
About time.
Why make her suffer?

328
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,521
Why not come get her earlier?

329
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,982
Good luck, Julia.

330
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:24,398
I met Nahuel,
he spent a few days at my place.

331
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,666
He stayed on.

332
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,673
Then, Ramiro showed up,
a friend of Nahuel's.

333
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,709
-He stayed for a few days.
-Alright.

334
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,110
What exactly happened that night?

335
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,442
That night, when I came home,

336
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,222
they were arguing in my room.

337
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,746
I heard fighting.

338
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,691
Then, Ramiro came out.

339
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,795
He had bruises on his face.

340
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,423
He went to the kitchen
and grabbed a knife.

341
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,030
He went back.
Nahuel came out.

342
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,531
I think he hit me.

343
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,801
The knife was on the floor.
There was a lot of blood.

344
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,778
I grabbed the knife.
I don't remember any more.

345
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,411
Did they know
you were pregnant?

346
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,379
-No.
-Why didn't you tell them?

347
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,051
I didn't have time.
It went so fast.

348
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,084
-Do you knowwho the father is?
-Nahuel.

349
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,153
You mean Nahuel Heredia,
the victim?

350
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,576
Please, help me!

351
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,082
What'll you do to me?

352
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,987
A Caesarean.
Don't worry, everything is fine.

353
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,830
No, don't cry.

354
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,660
You're drugged.
You won'tfeel a thing.

355
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,132
-You're gonna cut me open?
-A little.

356
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,971
-You won't feel a thing.
-No, please.

357
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,312
Easy now.

358
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,474
It'll be over soon.

359
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,612
Do you feel anything?

360
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,184
-No...
-No? Okay...

361
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,782
Don't be afraid.
Your baby will be born soon.

362
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,554
We're almost there.

363
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,667
Can I sit up?

364
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,200
Madam, you're here to see Zárate?

365
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,230
Please, come in.

366
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,376
Wait here.

367
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,797
How are you?

368
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,968
Took me forever to get here.

369
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,798
Why are you here?

370
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,040
Casman called me.

371
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,273
When did you arrive?

372
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,611
Two hours ago.

373
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,911
Couldn't get a better flight.

374
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,754
How do you feel?

375
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,925
Okay. The stitches bother me.

376
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,167
You were also born by Caesarean.

377
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,337
Yes, I know.

378
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,605
Hello, baby.

379
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,347
He's cute.
What's his name?

380
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,947
I don't know yet.

381
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,522
Did you get the things I sent?

382
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,753
-Excuse me...
-Yes, thank you.

383
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,489
I'll change your lV drip.

384
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,932
Why are you here, Mother?

385
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,799
I want to be with you both.

386
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,306
I'm tired. I need to sleep.
Go away.

387
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,339
Go home, Mom.

388
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,510
Okay, I'll be outside. Sleep tight.

389
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,681
This way, Madam.

390
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,134
-Last name?
-Zárate.

391
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,235
-First name?
-Tomás.

392
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,710
-Mother's name?
-Julia Zárate.

393
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,016
-Single or married?
-Single.

394
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,316
-Father's name?
-He has none.

395
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,416
I'll organize
a vaccination control plan...

396
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,685
to have the baby take
all the required shots.

397
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,855
Ms. Zárate, you need to know...

398
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,592
that the minor will stay with you
until he's four years old.

399
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,191
After that, a relative
will have custody,

400
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,200
or if not,

401
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,862
he'll be sent
to the Court of Minors.

402
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,373
Make your boy shut up,
you bitch!

403
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,082
Let us sleep, you fucking bitch!

404
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,215
Feed him!

405
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,151
Shut him up!

406
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,454
Make that brat shut the fuck up!

407
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,593
We want to sleep!

408
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,494
Hey, make the brat shut up,
you fucking bitch!

409
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,339
Give him to me.

410
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,913
Stop crying,
give me the pacifier.

411
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,151
Now, now, Tomás.

412
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:29,485
That's it, love.

413
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,798
Come and get him.
I'm with the others.

414
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,635
They're awake, too, goddammit.

415
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:56,547
Come on.

416
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,665
Take some milk.

417
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,338
Very good, Tomás.

418
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,311
There's clothes to wash.

419
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,542
-I'll do it later.
-Do it now.

420
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,223
Phone cards.

421
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:43,392
-Cotton, towels, diapers.
-Hold on, I'm writing it down.

422
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,065
How many?

423
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,162
Enough for all of us.

424
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,366
-My family is waiting, too.
-Nearly done.

425
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,101
-What about Tomás?
-You heard from Casman?

426
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,444
-Cut it short.
-Okay.

427
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,208
-Come on.
-Okay.

428
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,210
Did you talk to him?

429
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,753
-Yes, take care.
-Okay.

430
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,613
"l ignored them,
I made myself something to eat.

431
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,952
I heard Nahuel screaming
in the bedroom,

432
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,891
I went there
and he was hurt,

433
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,288
all bloody, and Julia
with the knife in her hand.

434
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,527
She threw herself at me,

435
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,036
-and stabbed me in the arm."
-He's a son of a bitch.

436
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,696
Hold on.

437
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,806
"l ran back to the living room,

438
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,637
she attacked me from behind."

439
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,247
It's only logical that Nievas'
defense...

440
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,875
consists in blaming you.

441
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,118
We'll prepare for a confrontation,

442
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,949
we're going to be well prepared,

443
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,647
and get a trial date.

444
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,656
Don't get like this.

445
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,819
You know he's lying!

446
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,493
I know Ramiro! Why?

447
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,571
Come on, take it easy,
you're not alone.

448
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,413
-Stop.
-I'll kill Ramiro.

449
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,728
-Stop, Marta.
-Come on, Julia.

450
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,494
No, leave me alone.
Hand me a clothes peg.

451
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,671
We welcome little Tomás,

452
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,537
Julia's son.

453
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,043
Tomás, I bless you...

454
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,714
in the name of the Father,
the Son,

455
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,979
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

456
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,019
Another soul for our church.

457
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,991
A big hand for Tomás.

458
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,468
I'm staying in Buenos Aires.

459
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,510
Why stay?

460
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,476
-Everything is fine.
-To be closer to both of you.

461
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,844
I can help you.

462
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,909
Where will you stay?

463
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,651
I thought I'd move
into the apartment.

464
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,321
Okay.

465
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,732
How could this happen to you?

466
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,764
How could it end like this?

467
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,832
-I feel so guilty.
-Stop it, Mother.

468
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,406
Stop it. Stop crying!

469
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,911
Putting on a show!

470
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,674
What's wrong with you?

471
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,943
Control yourself.

472
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,109
Get a grip.
Everything is okay.

473
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,752
Stop it.

474
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,448
Will you bring Tomás to me?

475
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,752
Will you stop crying?

476
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,200
Yes.

477
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,737
Alright?

478
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,264
Will you control yourself?

479
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,035
Marta!

480
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,141
Marta, this is Sofía, my mother.

481
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,878
-Hi, Marta.
-Let her hold Tomás.

482
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,751
He's asleep.

483
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,380
That's okay.
Let her have him.

484
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,787
Don't wake him up.

485
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,303
Hello, Tomás.

486
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,270
Your father wanted
to call you Tomás. Did you know?

487
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,076
No.

488
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,614
You want anything? Water?

489
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,620
Mom!
You wantwater, something?

490
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,921
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm okay.

491
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,688
You want to hold him a while?

492
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,461
Yes.

493
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,293
Come on, let's go.

494
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,210
Candela, go to sleep.
This kid never sleeps.

495
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:52,065
Kindergarten, girls!

496
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,641
Let's go, girls!

497
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,473
-Rojo, Zárate, cell block.
-Just a minute.

498
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:15,010
-Hurry up.
-I'm coming. Just a second.

499
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,547
Come on, let's go.

500
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,100
What do you want, Tommy?

501
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,873
You want to play?

502
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,478
Do you want me to swing you?

503
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,545
What do you want?
You can't go out now.

504
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,552
You like that?

505
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,156
Come on, Tomás. Let's go play.

506
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,618
Come here, you'll fall down.

507
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,122
Come. Come on, Tommy.

508
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,363
Come with me.
You'll fall down.

509
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,233
Sofi, will you take this letter?

510
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,445
It's for my wife.

511
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,158
Go on.

512
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,931
-Names?
-Julia and Tomás Zárate.

513
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,666
Lift your T-shirt.

514
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,132
Turn around.

515
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,909
Spread your arms.

516
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,109
Pull down your T-shirt.

517
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,655
Turn around.

518
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,179
Open your mouth.

519
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,183
Your pants.

520
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,422
Crouch.

521
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,661
Pull open your panties.

522
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,362
Get up.

523
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,977
-Now, the kid.
-Don't touch him.

524
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,841
Then, you can't come in.

525
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,938
Pull up his shirt,
pull down his pants.

526
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,290
Nearly done.

527
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,526
-Don't touch him.
-I have to examine him.

528
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,829
His pants and diapers.

529
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,332
That's it. Okay, love, that's it.

530
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,382
-Anything else?
-No, go ahead.

531
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,431
Look at your hands.

532
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,126
Is that your son?

533
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,934
Say hello.

534
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,809
What's your name?

535
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,716
Tomás.

536
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,212
Hi.

537
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,926
Sure he's Nahuel's kid?

538
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,434
Yes.

539
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,665
How do you know?.

540
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,409
I read your statement.

541
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,952
Why did you say that?

542
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,414
I stopped smoking.

543
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:13,986
Julia...

544
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,594
I have to help myself, not you.

545
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,534
Get it?

546
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,004
Look, Tomás.

547
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,644
I can't stand it anymore.
I have to get out.

548
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,644
You didn't tell the truth.

549
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,316
I don't remember what happened.
Do you?

550
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,518
I don't knowwhat I remember.

551
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,186
We're on our own.

552
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,886
I'm not alone.

553
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,963
Look.

554
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,304
Let's get nice and pretty
for Lucía's birthday.

555
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,548
Tommy...

556
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,221
Tomás...

557
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,716
Come on, Tommy.

558
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,055
Let's get ready
for Lucía's birthday.

559
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,357
It's Lucía's birthday.

560
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,330
Come on.
Hot, isn't it?

561
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,840
Come on, let's go.

562
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,248
Marta, bring out the cake
so we can blowthe candles.

563
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,517
Kids, come blowthe candles.

564
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,379
-What happens?
-Guard!

565
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,424
-What happened?
-Guard!

566
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,120
-Guard, call the chief!
-What's going on, Marta?

567
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,021
-Hold Candela.
-Guard!

568
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,061
Call the chief!

569
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,592
What did you do?

570
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,261
Let me go!
You don't understand!

571
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,301
Don't take her away from me!

572
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,935
Lucía is all I've got.
Let go!

573
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,111
-Let me go, you bitch!
-Easy, easy!

574
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,447
Raise her arms!

575
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,486
-Open!
-Don't take her away from me!

576
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,620
Open!
Take her to the nurse!

577
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,384
-She's my baby. Don't take her!
-Close!

578
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,323
Don't take her away!

579
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,592
Merry Christmas!

580
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,938
Tommy, Merry Christmas.

581
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,917
Can I give him his presents?

582
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,952
I'll give them to him later.

583
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,112
Tell him they're from me.

584
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,657
I'm planning something at home
for NewYear's Eve.

585
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,354
I want to take Tommy.

586
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,171
I told you
I don't wantTomás to leave here.

587
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,274
It's time he got out.

588
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,336
He has to leave one day.

589
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,106
He's staying with me.

590
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,810
He's leaving with me,
you understand?

591
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,849
-Want something to eat?
-No.

592
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,480
Hey, Santa Claus!

593
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,359
The icebox is for Rusa.

594
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:03,264
She'll pay you,
then you send me the money.

595
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,100
Okay.

596
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,267
Keep the diapers and the food.

597
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,518
You're leaving...

598
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:28,029
-Bye, Marta!
-See you on the outside!

599
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,067
You take care.

600
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,774
-Hey!
-I'll go with her.

601
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,545
-Will you behave?
-Yes.

602
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,296
No further, Zárate.

603
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,764
-Candela, kiss Julia goodbye.
-Bye, Cande.

604
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,164
Let's go, Zárate.

605
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,835
Let's go.

606
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,710
-Let's go.
-Coming!

607
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,503
Come on.

608
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,542
Take care of your mommy.

609
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,650
-Take care.
-Come on, Rojo.

610
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,345
-I'll come visit.
-Have fun.

611
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,051
-Bye.
-Take care.

612
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,524
Who's the bear's friend?

613
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,228
-Here's another bear.
-I don't know.

614
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,431
What's his name?
Stick it up there.

615
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:52,908
What's his name?

616
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,978
Pepe.

617
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,378
Pepe? Good.

618
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,609
Here comes the witch.

619
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,345
And the knight attacks her.
Look.

620
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:07,014
The butterfly comes to see
if the witch is okay.

621
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,686
Show me.

622
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,357
He covers her up?

623
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,927
He's upside down?

624
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,559
Look at the witch
all covered up.

625
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,622
-Hello.
-Hello.

626
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,421
Where's Tomás?

627
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,724
At kindergarten.

628
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,567
They didn't tell you
I'd come to see you both?

629
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:58,266
They did, but...
he's better off there.

630
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,608
Well...

631
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,812
This is for him.

632
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,278
It's very pretty.
Did you make it?

633
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,249
-Yes.
-What is it?

634
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,319
A cement truck.

635
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,097
Why did you come?

636
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,804
After the last time we met...

637
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,779
I started thinking.

638
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,885
The truth is,
I'm not alone, either.

639
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,690
I think of you and Tomás
all the time.

640
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,028
Maybe...

641
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,740
we could be together
when we get out.

642
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,402
That's ridiculous.

643
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,348
Why?

644
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,411
I'm not getting out, Ramiro.

645
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,583
I could talkto the lawyer,

646
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,488
change my statement.

647
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,509
Guard, may l?

648
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,784
-No, don't touch me.
-Julia...

649
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,755
-Look at me.
-No.

650
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,857
It's me.

651
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,414
Stop, please.

652
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,999
You look pretty.

653
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,179
Slowly, a little more.

654
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:56,249
A little more?

655
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,345
Let me see.

656
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:07,488
Want me to carry you?

657
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,168
-ls he any better?
-The fever's down.

658
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,963
He's much better.
Did you get an appointment?

659
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,131
Yes, this afternoon.

660
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,368
Tomorrow he gets
a complete check-up...

661
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,838
to make sure
everything's okay.

662
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,879
You get results the same day?

663
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,107
I think so. It's quick.

664
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,647
-Be a good boy.

665
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,447
-Yes?
-Yes.

666
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,186
-Bye.

667
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,190
-Don't worry.
-Take care of him.

668
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,334
Bye, Tommy. Love you.

669
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,665
Take him out to play.

670
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,083
Here we are.

671
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,090
Hello. Give me a hand.

672
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,419
Hi. Yes.

673
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,427
Is his room ready?

674
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,772
I don't like you washing my hair.

675
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,363
Yes, an appointment.

676
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,365
I need to set a date.

677
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,905
I'll just have a look.

678
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:08,609
-I don't like elephants.
-What's wrong?

679
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,086
You liked the pictures.

680
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,417
-It's a nice elephant.
-I'm scared. Let's go home.

681
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,064
This is Sofía, leave a message.

682
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,472
Mother, it's me.

683
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,140
I want to know about Tomás.
I'm worried. Call me back.

684
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,975
I left lots of messages.

685
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,165
Hello, Casman.
It's Julia Zárate.

686
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,432
I must talk to you.

687
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,796
Where's Tomás?
Please call me.

688
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,447
-Where's Tomás?
-At home.

689
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,814
-ls he okay?
-He's okay.

690
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,981
It's better this way.

691
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,457
For your file.

692
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,323
Just for a few days.
He's with your mom.

693
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,296
-It's important.
-Tell him to leave.

694
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,996
I have to talk to you.

695
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,506
Okay.

696
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,140
Bring Tomás to me.

697
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,007
Tomás is at home.

698
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,246
He had a slight fever.
He's with Estela.

699
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,549
-Who?
-She takes care of him.

700
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,714
I take care of him.
Bring him to me.

701
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,488
At the start, it was good
for him to be with you,

702
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,326
you were feeding him,
but he's got to get out.

703
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,929
Mother, bring me Tomás.
I beg you.

704
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,594
Go get him.

705
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,529
He shouldn't be here.

706
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,407
You have no right to decide.

707
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,669
You can't bring that fucker here.

708
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,335
Go getTomás.
I beg you to do so!

709
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:20,439
-He's your son, but he's not yours.
-He's mine, my son!

710
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,778
-So go get him.
-You don't want to listen...

711
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,113
but deep inside,
you know I'm right.

712
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,412
-Look, mom...
-There's no reason for him...

713
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,182
-to be locked up here!
-Look, mom...

714
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,781
You don't decide whatTomás does!

715
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,419
I decide.
You understand? Fucking bitch!

716
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,587
Bring him back!
I'll kill you!

717
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:36,858
I'm going to kill you!

718
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,526
-Easy.
-Let me go!

719
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,796
Stop it, Julia!

720
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,528
Bring him back!

721
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:49,403
-Fucking bitch!
-Calm down, please!

722
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,739
Bring him or I'll kill you!

723
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:52,973
-I'll kill you!
-Leave her!

724
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,777
I'll get you and kill you,
you bitch!

725
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,714
-Don't hit her!
-Stop!

726
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,078
Fucking bitch!

727
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,782
Let me go!
I'll kill you!

728
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:04,584
I'm going to get you
and I'll kill you, bitch!

729
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,718
Julia, calm down!
Leave her!

730
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,126
-Don't hit her!
-Did you hear?

731
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,631
-Don't hit her!
-Let me go!

732
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,892
Let me go, bitch!

733
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,468
-Let me go!
-Julia!

734
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,594
Fucking bitch!

735
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,097
Leave her alone!
You're hurting her!

736
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,239
Let me go!

737
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,473
Let me go!
You're hurting me!

738
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,113
I'll call the head warden!

739
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,685
Let me go!
I wantTomás back!

740
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,184
Let me go!

741
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:37,289
You don't understand!

742
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,825
Leave me alone!
Let me go!

743
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,328

749
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:23,929
Rusa! Call Marta!

750
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,365
-Rusa!
-Julia!

751
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,063
Tell her
they tookTomás away from me!

752
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,405
I'll tell her.

753
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,245
Take care!

754
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,092
Guard!

755
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,301
Do you know anything
about my son?

756
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:04,100
Guard! Guard!

757

-I won't go.
-Look at the mess you've made!

797
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:03,814
Come on, girls!

-Shut up!
-What's the problem?

802
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,125
What's the problem?

803
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,332
I want to see the head warden.

804
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:22,092
Bring her son.
This is a mess.

805
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,662
No diapers, no milk...

806
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,808
He's her son. Give him back.

807
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,343
-We can't go on like this!
-Shut up!

808
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,151
Not in these conditions.
Let's try to talk.

809
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,655
They are telling you he's not here
and he's not!

810
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,693
Stop it, girls. Cool it.

811
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,786
Calm down, everyone, please.
Just a second.

812
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,866
Wait a second!
Stop, stop!

813
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,128
She won't come out
in these conditions.

814
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,828
You want her to come out?

815
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,467
Get down off the table.

816
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,366
-Get down off the table!
-Open the door!

817
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,841
Get down off the table!

818
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,350
Hurry up, kids!

01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:50,088
!Come on, Pacha!

820

The pillows, quick!
Get some water!

821
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,027
Come on, girls, hurry up!

822
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,185
It's inadmissible!

823
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,710
Things like this
are not supposed to happen here.

824
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,650
You'll getTomás back,

825
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,313
but first, calm down.

826
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,824
Okay?

827
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,552
The head warden is on his way.

828
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,676
-What's going on?
-I just want to talk to you.

829
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,685
-I need my son!
-Calm down! What's going on there?

830
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,080
She wants her son.
See what she's done.

831
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,791
What happened here?
What did you do?

832
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,156
Nothing. I've been asking
to see you...

833
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:59,183
for five hours!

834
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,626
-Look what you did.
-I didn't startthis.

835
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:02,958
I only wanted to talk to you!

836
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,589
Calm down.
If not, we can't talk.

837
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,527
I have a family.
This is your fault.

838
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,603
Okay! Butthis is your job!

839
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,137
-My son is all I have.
-Look. What do I do now?.

840
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:12,673
Look at all this mess.
What do I do now?.

841
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,766
-lt has nothing to do with me.
-Okay, calm down...

842
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:16,374
-Stop shouting at me.
-I want him back!

843
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,446
-Don't shout. We'll talk.
-You let them take him away.

844
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,274
-You let my mother take him away!
-I won't help you like this.

845
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,848
This is no way to ask.

846
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:28,986
-I didn't ask for this.
-You stirred everyone up.

847
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:31,457
No one listened to me.

848
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,118
Now, I'm listening.

849
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:35,162
Let's agree on something.
Can we talk?

850
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:39,363
Let's do something.
I'll help you with the court...

851
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:42,062
to get your kid back.

852
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,535
You want your son?
But you put an end to this mess.

853
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,500
The girls are worked up
because of you.

854
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,571
There are kids there.

855
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,505
They've started a fire.

856
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:55,549
Kids like your son,
kids who played with your son.

857
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,516
So, let's calm things down.

858
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,917
I help you, you help me.

859
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,685
This isn't the way
a jail operates.

860
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:10,227
Do we have a deal?

861
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,897
Calm down.

862
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,336
It's over.

863
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,731
Fucker! Bunch of assholes!

864
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:30,751
Faggots!

865
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,717
Let's go get them!
Motherfucker!

866
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,687
Julia... After our talk,

867
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:50,491
we organized
this assessment meeting,

868
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:54,433
to decide whether Tomás stays
with you until he's four.

869
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,028
This is not our decision.

870
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,764
The Court decides.

871
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,471
Through this one-way mirror,

872
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,875
we'll observe Tomás.

873
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,375
I'll see him alone first.

874
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,641
Okay, Tommy, pile them up.

875
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,714
Which is the smallest?

876
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:26,033
-A big one.
-A really big one.

877
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,630
Hi...

878
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,371
Hi there, precious.

879
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,975
Hey, look at me.

880
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,748
Hi.

881
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,513
Miss me? No?

882
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:50,014
I missed you a lot, you know?.

883
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,222
Give me a kiss? A hug?

884
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,067
These gentlemen over there...

885
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:04,728
are the ones who think
you shouldn't be with me.

886
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,585
-Were you hurt?
-No, that's old.

887
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,685
Good, here we are.

888
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:29,230
Marta knows me well,
she knows how I work.

889
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,364
I need your trust...

890
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,230
and your honesty.

891
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:38,261
First, we need to solve
your legal status,

892
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,100
and get a prison term
as short as possible.

893
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,213
The best we can hope for
is eight years.

894
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,910
-No, that's too long...
-You've done four.

895
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:53,951
In 1 year and 6 to 1 0 months,
you're out of here.

896
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:56,991
-I can't stand it.
-Calm down.

897
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,559
-Then...
-And Tomás?

898
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:00,491
Once you've been sentenced,

899
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,994
you'll get leave.

900
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,925
-Do you trust me?
-Yes.

901
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,933
That's very important.

902
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:22,173
What was the relationship
between Nahuel and Ramiro?

903
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,978
What was your relationship
with them?

904
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:30,787
Following the Penal Code,
we'll now proceed...

905
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,755
with a confrontation
between the accused,

906
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,690
Ramiro Nievas and Julia Zárate.

907
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:43,670
I was sleeping with...
Nahuel Heredia,

908
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,868
when I heard the door open.

909
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,611
She came in,
she started to scream at us.

910
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,012
-I didn't want a fight.
-That's a lie.

911
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,673
-lt wasn't an accident.
-Silence.

912
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,514
Silence, young lady.
Carry on. Look at her, please.

913
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:03,122
Ramiro, tell the truth.
Don't lie.

914
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:05,658
It's not a lie.

915
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:11,028
She started to shout,
pulled us out of bed...

916
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,723
and started throwing things at us.

917
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:16,234
-Nahuel tried to restrain her.
-He's lying!

918
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:19,363
She grabbed the knife.
It was very complicated.

919
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,873
-He's lying. Ramiro, don't lie.
-Please, Zárate.

920
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,237
-He's lying!
-Zárate...

921
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,411
-Do you have something to say? Do it!
-Yes, of course!

922
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,741
He's lying.
That's not what happened.

923
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:30,077
-I came home...
-Tell me what happened.

924
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,216
-I came home and they were...
-Look at him.

925
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:35,484
They were in my bed, arguing.

926
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:36,818
They weren't sleeping?

927
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,382
No! They were arguing,
hitting each other.

928
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,189
Why were they arguing?
Do you knowwhy?

929
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,059
-That's not true.
-lt is!

930
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:44,928
What did you do, then?

931
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,901
-I went in...
-Look at him.

932
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,233
Ramiro was all bloody.
Nahuel was holding the knife.

933
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:52,000
-Ramiro, tell the truth!
-You know it wasn't me.

934
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,605
-I didn't say that!
- Look at me.

935
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,734
I didn't say it was you!
I tried to defend you!

936
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,606
-But I didn't have the knife!
-But it was an accident.

937
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,704
But I didn't have the knife!
You did!

938
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,407
I arrived
and you were both fighting.

939
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,848
-You were holding the knife.
-I didn't have it.

940
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:06,546
No, Nahuel had it!

941
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:08,248
-What are you saying?
-I didn't bring it.

942
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:11,588
Why do you say that I had it?
I didn't have the knife!

943
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,996
-You two were arguing.
-lt wasn't me.

944
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,793
I'm not saying
it was you,

945
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,626
I'm saying I didn't bring the knife,

946
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,133
but you both had the knife.
You were fighting in my bed.

947
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,864
-ln my house, in my bed!
-I didn't kill anyone!

948
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:26,431
You're a son of a bitch.

949
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:29,310
Please, no insults.
Continue.

950
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,369
I don't remember anything else.

951
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:39,320
I don't get you.

952
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,918
As a child, her mother left her...

953
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,458
in the care of her sickfather.

954
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:49,388
As a grown-up, two men subject her
to all sorts of humiliations.

955
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:53,266
The abuse suffered by Julia
is not a crime,

956
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:57,668
but it served to crush her,
insult her, humiliate her...

957
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:59,899
beyond tolerable limits.

958
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:02,408
As a result of this abuse,
on July 14,

959
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:05,411
Julia Zárate discovered
she was pregnant.

960
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:07,909
Anything else?

961
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,110
No, Your Honour.

962
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:11,742
In relation to Ramiro Nievas,

963
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:14,947
considering what is in his file,

964
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,490
he is to be acquitted,

965
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:18,853
as there is insufficient evidence...

966
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:20,927
to find him guilty.

967
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,487
The Court sentences Julia Zárate,

968
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:28,166
Argentinean, single,
a college student,

969
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:31,103
born November 8, 1980,

970
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:34,603
the daughter of Tomás Zárate
and Sofía Angélica Giusti,

971
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:38,468
responsible
for first-degree murder,

972
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,214
to 1 0 years' imprisonment.

973
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,882
Let it be notified,

974
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:51,689
recorded and filed.

975
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:55,290
Lead the accused out.

976
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,680
-Miss me?
-Yes, I do.

977
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:23,991
-You want to see me?
-A little.

978
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:28,722
-Are you crying, Mommy?
-No, I have a cold.

979
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,657
-Let me talk to Grandma.
-She's not here.

980
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:36,704
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

981
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:41,166
-Are you alone?
-No, with Andrea.

982
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:46,079
-ls Andrea nice to you?
-Yes.

983
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,351
-Tell Grandma to bring you.
-I told her.

984
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:54,080
Tell her I want to see you.

985
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,122
Okay, I'll tell her again.

986
01:29:56,391 --> 01:30:00,418
When are you coming to visit?
Soon?

987
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,087
Yes, soon.

988
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:06,422
"Gato". What type of word is it?
Oxytone, paroxytone, proparoxytone?

989
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:08,068
-It's paroxytone.
-Paroxytone.

990
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:10,400
Right. "Pájaro".

991
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:15,537
-An oxyotone word?
-"Arroz".

992
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:20,276
-"Arroz".
-"Arroz".

993
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,916
-Do you have the cards?
-Yes.

994
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,212
-How many?
-Ten.

995
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:26,310
Okay, check them.

996
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:30,150
Better count them.

997
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:34,751
-I can't take it anymore, Marta.
-You can. Take it easy.

998
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:37,898
-You got the papers?
-It's being arranged.

999
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,327
You said that last week.

1000
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,462
I'm on it.

1001
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:46,835
-You're sure?
-Positive.

1002
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:50,277
-It's so close.
-See you soon.

1003
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,505
A big kiss. Love you.

1004
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,911
-See you soon.
-Bye.

1005
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:06,352
-How long's the trip?
-Two hours.

1006
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:09,124
-How long is your leave?

1007
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,100
You only have eight hours.
Give this to your kid.

1008
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,667
-Thank you.
-Kiss Tommy for me.

1009
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,861
I love you.

1010
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:20,106
-You look real cute.
-Okay.

1011
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,333
-Zárate, let's go!
-I'm coming!

1012
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:24,971
-Bye, Julia, take care.
-Bye...

1013
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,172
-Bye, Julia.
-Bye.

1014
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,348
-Good luck.
-Zárate!

1015
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,047
-Coming.
-Don't forget the smokes.

1016
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,621
No, I'll get them.

1017
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:40,888
In a hurry, huh?

1018
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,865
Door!

1019
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:13,484
Door!

1020
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:35,675
Send this to my cousin.

1021
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,445
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

1022
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:41,579
-Good luck. Kiss your baby for me.
-Thanks.

1023
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:53,395
Bye, Julia! Don't look back!

1024
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:01,900
Processing.

1025
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:06,272
-Full name?

1028
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:14,319

1029
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:15,915

1030
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:18,319
-Ready?
-Yes.

1031
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:24,055
Transfer!

1032
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:43,536
-Hello.
-Hi.

1033
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:45,806
Good, you're here.

1034
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:47,637
I'm on my way out.

1035
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:49,375
That suits you.

1036
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,883
-Tomás?
-He's waiting for you in his room.

1037
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:54,721
-Okay.
-I'll be back in a little while.

1038
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,917
Guard, can I see my son?

1039
01:34:58,025 --> 01:34:59,185
Go ahead.

1040
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:05,397
Hey, will you give a hug?

1041
01:35:10,771 --> 01:35:12,830
What's this? A dragon's tail?

1042
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:16,868
Cool! A cap, too.

1043
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:22,508
A cape!

1044
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:24,345
Excuse me, guard.
Can I speak to her?

1045
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,019
Go ahead.

1046
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:30,553
-Tomás wants his snack.
-I'll get it.

1047
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:32,783
-Okay.
-Would you like some tea?

1048
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,087
Sure.

1049
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:38,165
-Go ahead.
-I'll take it to him.

1050
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:39,757
Thank you.

1051
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:44,199
-You give him chocolate, too?
-Yes, of course.

1052
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:45,397
Thanks.

1053
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,234
Do you want to go to the beach?

1054
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,932
Yes? We go to the beach...

1055
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:51,068
And we'll fight the dragons?

1056
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:53,742
What do we take?

1057
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:56,305
What do we take?

1058
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,614
We take the dog.

1059
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,745
Let's go to the beach! Let's go!

1060
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:04,154
Do we go to the beach? Yes?

1061
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,424
To the beach!

1062
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:10,293
To the beach, this way...

1063
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:14,558
Don't make a sound. Shush!

1064
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:20,173
So what did the prince do?

1065
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,130
What did the prince do, Tommy?
Come on.

1066
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,824
Come with me.

1067
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:53,331
Guard... Can I have
some water, please?

1068
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,707
-A glass of water?
-Yes, come in.

1069
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:04,049
-Where can I get a glass?
-Up there.

1070
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,051
Zárate, open this door!

1071
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:12,688
Zárate, open up! Are you crazy?

1072
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,823
Okay, let's go. Come, Tommy.

1073
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:17,022
Zárate, open the door!

1074
01:37:17,097 --> 01:37:20,032
You're taking the kid?
They'll kill you.

1075
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:23,698
-Mom.
-Let's go.

1076
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:26,667
Let's go.

1077
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,342
-And the dog?
-What?

1078
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:33,502
-What?
-Where's the dog?

1079
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:38,574
Zárate, open the door.
I know you're there!

1080
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:42,856
Don't do something crazy!

1081
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:58,336
Okay, let's take the stairs.

1082
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:00,335
Give me your hand.

1083
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:02,675
Here's the dog.

1084
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:05,039
Come on.

1085
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,040
Come.

1086
01:38:08,115 --> 01:38:09,605
Let me carry you.

1087
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:13,953
Here.

1088
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,723
I cut my hair like you.

1089
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:25,458
-You did?
-Yes.

1090
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:28,558
-You like it like that?
-Yes.

1091
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,261
Great.

1092
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:36,568
Look.

1093
01:38:36,677 --> 01:38:38,907
Do you want to go
to the beach?

1094
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:41,604
What kind of beach?

1095
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:45,579
With water and lots of sand.

1096
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,586
-Lots of sand?
-Yes. Lots of sand.

1097
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:50,317
Cool!

1098
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,656
A beach with lots of sand?

1099
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:58,731
Let's go to the mountains.
Where can we go?

1100
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:06,232
-To a park?
-I said I want to go to a beach.

1101
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:07,997
Watch your head.

1102
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:18,078
-Tickets.
-When do we go back?.

1103
01:39:18,152 --> 01:39:22,145
-Tickets, thank you...
-When do we go back?.

1104
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:25,680
-We'll see. A little later.
-When is Grandma coming?

1105
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:31,297
-Do you want to see the river?
-Yes.

1106
01:39:53,921 --> 01:39:55,821
-How are you?
-Good.

1107
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:57,887
He's grown!

1108
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,794
Don't wake him up.

1109
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,319
This is yours.

1110
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:06,966
-Look at the picture.
-Here'sTommy's.

1111
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:10,465
-Are they good?
-Sure, they're fine.

1112
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:12,296
Put them away.

1113
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:16,407
Some clothes for you
and for him.

1114
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:18,678
Thank you.

1115
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:22,708
You look pretty.

1116
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:25,150
How much longer?

1117
01:40:25,419 --> 01:40:27,512
About five hours.

1118
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,346
Put this away.

1119
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:37,092
How are things?

1120
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:39,056
I'm working a little.

1121
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:42,027
-The kids?
-We get by.

1122
01:40:43,237 --> 01:40:45,068
-What?
-It's a mess.

1123
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:47,740
With all of them, it's a mess.

1124
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:50,669
-Not in trouble, huh?
-Nah.

1125
01:41:11,965 --> 01:41:15,401
Hey, come here! Don't run.

1126
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:17,399
Give me your hand.

1127
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,298
Wait for me.

1128
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:26,139
I'll get you!

1129
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:32,985
-Good afternoon. Name?
-Zarategui.

1130
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:46,431
-Where d'you come from?
-Buenos Aires.

1131
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,296
-What part?
-The city.

1132
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:52,301
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1133
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,899
-Pick me up.
-Yes, come with me.

1134
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,074
Careful, Mom.

1135
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:03,778
Look at the water.

1136
01:42:05,886 --> 01:42:08,821
-Are we going to cross it?
-Yes.

1137
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:16,920
-My hand is a rock.
-Then, throw it away.

1138
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:24,433
Are you happy?
We're almost there.

1139
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:27,367
Yes, nearly. See?

1140
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:33,376
Look over there.

1141
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:36,208
See how close?

1142
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:41,549
Look over there,
where the flag is.

1143
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:44,017
Like it?

1144
01:42:58,438 --> 01:43:00,133
Here we are.

1145
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,135
Off we go.
