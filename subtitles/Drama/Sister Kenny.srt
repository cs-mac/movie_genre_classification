1
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,250
Hee-yah!
I'm first!

2
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,250
♫ This is the way we go to church

3
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,690
♫ Go to church, go to church

4
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,850
♫ This is the way
we go to church... ♫

5
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,210
The party's over.
You men can get movin'.

6
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,690
Hell, I don't know
who you are but, uh...

7
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,210
Why be a hog, man?

8
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,650
She can handle four of us.

9
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,050
We also got some mighty fine whiskey.

10
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,330
- Waiting for you!
- Besides...

11
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,050
Now what are you gonna do,
you bastard?

12
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,970
You may get me... but you sure as hell
ain't gonna get any part of her,

13
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,170
unless you like to have your fun
with a corpse!

14
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,490
You keep standing around like that,

15
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,210
the sun's gonna
burn the hell out of you.

16
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,610
They told me they were gonna kill me,

17
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,370
kill me so I couldn't report them.

18
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,810
They told me...

19
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,210
Well, they ain't
telling you much now.

20
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,410
So get dressed, hm?

21
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,210
You're a good man.

22
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,330
All my life I will pray to the Virgin
to protect you from harm.

23
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,770
Jesus Christ.

24
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,650
And I will also pray that for all
your life you have what you desire.

25
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,490
What the hell's
a nun doin' out here?

26
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,530
I'm on a mission.
In Mexico a nun can travel safely

27
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,770
among murderers and thieves.

28
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,130
I could have avoided these men
but I came to ask for food.

29
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,810
- They give you any?
- No.

30
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,970
- There's probably some leftovers.
- I couldn't eat just now.

31
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,450
Well, you look like you could use
a shot of whiskey.

32
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,250
Whiskey? Thank you.

33
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,770
- Your mule?
- Yes.

34
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,410
No provisions, no canteen?
Just how'd you figure on existing?

35
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,530
I was confident
the Lord would provide.

36
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,970
Three more like them?

37
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,330
He also provided you.

38
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,770
- Which way you headed?
- North.

39
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,890
North, huh?

40
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,930
Well, I'm headed south.

41
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,770
So I'll take those ponies
and be on my way.

42
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,290
First we must cover them with stones.

43
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,130
We can't leave without giving them
a Christian burial of some kind.

44
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,130
- After the way they treated you?
- Of course.

45
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,930
You got to be touched in the head.

46
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,170
Do you have a shovel?

47
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,730
Sister, raise your eyes to heaven.

48
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,010
Now, are they or are they not
God's creatures?

49
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,610
- Of course they are.
- Why rob them of this nourishment?

50
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,490
Do you have a shovel?

51
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,530
Yeah, it's on my packhorse.

52
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,250
Would you get it, please, for the
sake of my soul if not your own?

53
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,210
Sister, I don't mind shootin' 'em
but I'm not gonna sweat over 'em.

54
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,730
You're as stubborn as my mule,
you know?

55
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,770
Worse.

56
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,210
How are the blisters?

57
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,890
Other things in life have hurt more.

58
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,690
Thank you, Brother.

59
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,610
- It's Hogan.
- I'm Sister Sara.

60
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,090
Well, Sister Sara,
if you ever get tired of being a nun,

61
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,730
you'll be an A-1 gravedigger.

62
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,770
Have some of these beans.

63
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,890
Those fellas weren't much in a fight
but one of 'em wasn't a bad cook.

64
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,890
I couldn't eat anything they cooked
but I'll have some water, please.

65
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,930
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

66
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,770
- You really are touched!
- Give that back, please.

67
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,490
Sister, you wanna bless 'em,
bless 'em dry.

68
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,930
I've obliged you 'bout all I'm
going to and now I'll say goodbye.

69
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,530
You stay out of that sun now,
you hear?

70
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,690
Or you're gonna really be in trouble.

71
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,530
Goodbye. Thank you again.

72
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,570
God go with you.

73
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,730
Hey, you're in luck.
Looks like a French cavalry.

74
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,770
You can probably travel
along with them.

75
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,650
Please help me.
They're looking for me.

76
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,210
Why?

77
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,850
I was raising money
for the Mexican army.

78
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,010
I had to escape in the night.

79
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,490
Lady, if you weren't a nun
I'd let you save your own bacon.

80
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,770
All right, do as I say and act fast.

81
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,730
Get rid of that cross,
it shines like a mirror.

82
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,490
You bring that last horse
and follow me.

83
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,130
Son of a bitch.

84
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,290
What are you doing?

85
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,650
I'm doing for you what...

86
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,770
No Holy Virgin's
in any position to do.

87
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,410
Hah!

88
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,530
We'll walk slowly
so as not to stir up this stream bed

89
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,570
any more than we have to.

90
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,210
Why did you put that dead man
on the horse?

91
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,050
A horse with a rider makes
a deeper print than a horse without.

92
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,210
If we're lucky,
the French will follow those ponies.

93
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,450
Here. Eat this.

94
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,010
I told you to eat something
back there.

95
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,290
Your stomach keeps growling, we'll
have the whole French army on us.

96
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,210
These little noises can't be heard.
Why are you so angry with me?

97
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,890
Well... maybe a nun ought not
be so good-lookin'.

98
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,530
The way I look is of no importance.

99
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,570
I'm married to
our Lord Jesus Christ.

100
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,010
That's what I'm steamed up about,
if you'll pardon my being frank.

101
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,050
- I'm not offended, Brother Hogan.
- Don't "Brother" me.

102
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,970
Excuse me.

103
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,970
Soldats, concentrez-vous de ce côté.

104
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,010
Les autres, avec moi.

105
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,730
They split up, damn it,
and they're catchin' up.

106
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,690
I wouldn't just sit there, move.

107
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,690
We can't outrun 'em.
You can get in there.

108
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,130
I may not shoot all of them
but I'll get their attention.

109
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,450
Wait, then head on out the other way.

110
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,810
You've been a wonderful friend,
Mr Hogan. Go with God.

111
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,610
Leave Him out of this, huh?
Get movin'.

112
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,210
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?

113
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,810
There's a rattlesnake in there.

114
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,930
Keep singin', partner.

115
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,450
Get that mule in here.

116
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,010
Here, if we get split up,
this'll make good eatin'.

117
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,850
Vous regardez là-dedans.

118
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,570
Il n'y a rien.

119
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,770
Au galop!

120
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,570
Well, well. Too bad nuns don't play
poker, you'd be sharp at it.

121
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,610
There's no way I can thank you.

122
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,290
I suppose you'll
be starting south now.

123
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,450
No, it's gettin' too close to dark.
We'll have a hot meal first.

124
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,010
- Can nuns cook?
- I do.

125
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,450
Good. Your late gentlemen friends
donated us some beans and coffee.

126
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,650
But first I'll scratch up
some firewood.

127
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,610
It's hard to believe that rattlesnake
could taste so delicious.

128
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,650
Here. Ladies first.

129
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,890
Thank you.

130
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,210
So you were headed north.
Any particular place?

131
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,570
I want to try to find a Juarista
band, I'll be safe with them.

132
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,370
- Where were you comin' from?
- Chihuahua.

133
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,010
- Chihuahua? You live there?
- Mm-hm, for several years.

134
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,610
- French garrison in Chihuahua.
- Mm-hm, right next to the church.

135
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,330
You wouldn't by any chance know
how many soldiers in the garrison?

136
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,410
- More or less.
- About 200 and some cannon.

137
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,970
How do you know all that?

138
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,330
The French officers
wanted to learn Spanish

139
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,050
so my mother superior assigned
the task to me, I also speak French.

140
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,450
I went into the garrison
three times a week.

141
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,250
I hate them. Oh, how I hate them.

142
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,410
- Ain't it a sin for nuns to hate?
- Not if it's something evil.

143
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,370
The French army
killing and torturing Mexicans,

144
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,530
trying to force them
to become one of their colonies.

145
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,610
- How big is the garrison?
- Two stories. It was a monastery.

146
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,570
- A building with an open patio?
- A beautiful patio...

147
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,810
- A balcony and stairs leading down?
- That's right.

148
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,770
You say it's next to a church.
How far apart are they exactly?

149
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,570
In some places
not more than ten or twelve feet.

150
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,610
From the roof of the church,
is the garrison higher or lower?

151
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,170
- Lower. Much lower.
- Oh.

152
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,210
- Sentries?
- Day and night at the front gate.

153
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,490
Sister Sara,
you're gonna slow me up some,

154
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,810
but I'll take you to one of those
guerrilla bands you're lookin' for.

155
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,890
- Do you belong to one of them?
- Till I get paid, yeah.

156
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,170
Paid? You mean in gold?

157
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,930
Well, if they pay me off
in tortillas,

158
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,530
I'm gonna shoot 'em right in the eye.

159
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,770
But the Juaristas are too poor
to hire anybody.

160
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,130
I made a deal to work out
a plan to take the garrison.

161
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,050
If it pays off,
I get half the French treasury.

162
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,770
Then you don't have any sympathy
for their cause?

163
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,330
Not theirs or anybody else's.

164
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,850
See, I spent two years
in a war in the States.

165
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,770
Right now,
all I'm interested in is money.

166
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,370
If money is all you care about,
then why did you fight in that war?

167
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,930
Everybody's got a right
to be a sucker once.

168
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,090
- Mr Hogan.
- Hmm?

169
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,650
The 14th of July is a French holiday.

170
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,930
By noon of that day last year
the entire French garrison was drunk.

171
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,930
- What's the date today?
- July the 6th.

172
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,970
Beautiful.

173
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,130
That information
puts gold right in my pocket.

174
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,170
This calls for a drink.

175
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,970
Well, I'll be leaving you
for a few moments.

176
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,810
Be careful not to go too far,
there may be another rattler.

177
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,050
I'll pray as I walk.

178
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,290
I'll keep my back turned.
Don't worry.

179
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,930
You're a real gentleman, Mr Hogan.

180
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,370
I guess you haven't slept much
on the ground.

181
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,410
Oh, I'm very tired. I'll sleep.

182
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,730
For somebody who's wore out,
you sure got a happy look.

183
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,210
It was a miracle you found me
when you did, Mr Hogan.

184
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,410
That was no miracle, just an accident
and life is full of 'em.

185
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,730
No. It was a miracle.

186
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,330
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,770
Two men are ridin' along
side by side,

188
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,890
a bullet ricochets off a rock,
kills one of them but not the other...

189
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,930
Just an accident, no miracle.

190
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,330
Then you believe
there are no miracles?

191
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,370
Well, um... Now, you take
that fella this morning.

192
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,210
He could've picked up
that stick of dynamite

193
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,890
and thrown it back at me
before I shot him.

194
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,530
Now, that would have been a miracle.

195
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,410
It's nice to hear you laugh, ma'am.

196
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,570
You think nuns don't laugh?

197
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,970
I don't know. I never
spent the night with one before.

198
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,650
Good night, Mr Hogan.

199
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,930
Thank you again for everything.

200
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,570
Hey, wake up, Sister.

201
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,130
- Time to get movin'.
- Couldn't I sleep a little longer?

202
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,930
Not if you want to travel with me,
you don't.

203
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,050
I'm so stiff.

204
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,570
I'm not accustomed
to riding like that.

205
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,610
Would you please help me up?

206
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,210
Thank you.

207
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,490
Oh, my every muscle is aching.

208
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,930
How can I possibly ride again today?

209
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,130
I ride from sunup to sundown.

210
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,330
You either keep up or you don't.

211
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,450
You'll feel better
after a few hours on your mule.

212
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,770
You make very good coffee.

213
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,050
A man on his own
has to take care of himself.

214
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,570
- So you're not married?
- Nope.

215
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,610
- Ever been?
- Nope.

216
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,690
- Want to be?
- Nope.

217
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,290
- Don't you want a woman of your own?
- What for?

218
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,090
Share your name, bear your children,
be a companion?

219
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,570
To ask me to quit drinkin',
quit gamblin', save my money

220
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,010
and to bitch about her
aches and pains? No, thanks.

221
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,130
- Must be a lonely life.
- It's a great life.

222
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,770
Women when I want 'em
and none with the name of Hogan.

223
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,890
How about you, ma'am? Haven't you
ever wanted to be a whole woman?

224
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,170
Have a man make love to you?
Have children?

225
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,330
I've chosen a different way of life.

226
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,530
What about those feelings your god
gave every woman, including you?

227
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,370
- I've always wondered.
- Well, we're human, of course.

228
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,050
When we get those feelings,
we pray until they pass.

229
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,770
In your case,
just how much praying does that take?

230
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,050
What about before you became a nun?
Did you ever have a man?

231
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,770
No.

232
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,970
- Ever been kissed by one?
- No.

233
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,930
Haven't you ever laid awake
wondering what it would be like?

234
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,250
No.

235
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,610
All the women I've ever met
were natural-born liars

236
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,610
but I never knew about nuns till now.

237
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,050
You're right. I lied.

238
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,250
I'll say one thing, Sister.

239
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,690
I sure woulda liked to have
met up with you

240
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,570
before you took to them clothes
and them vows.

241
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,890
That limp's getting worse.

242
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,290
Stone bruised.

243
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,730
It'll take a week
for that to heal up.

244
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,450
Maybe the people in this village
will hide you out

245
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,730
until this animal comes around.

246
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,650
- Why couldn't I ride the packhorse?
- He carries my equipment.

247
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,530
I ain't gonna miss
bein' in Chihuahua on the 14th.

248
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,170
- Please, Brother Hogan...
- I told you not to "Brother" me.

249
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,570
All right, Mr Mule. You were right.
You are as stubborn as my mule.

250
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,610
When we get up to that village,
Sister, then I'll say adiós.

251
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,130
This is where we part company.

252
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,170
- Now what are you doin'?
- I must say a prayer at this shrine.

253
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,610
You said your prayers last night.

254
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,610
It's a sin to pass a shrine
without praying.

255
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,770
- Not if you shut your eyes.
- Please, Mr Hogan.

256
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,530
All right, it's a small shrine,
let's make it a small prayer.

257
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,170
Buenos días, hermana.

258
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,850
You see, Mr Hogan,
what a little prayer can do?

259
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,130
The Lord provided a kind gentleman

260
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,050
who accepted my mule
for this creature of God.

261
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,770
Now I can still be with you.

262
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,810
Your mule for that burro?

263
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,530
If that kind gentleman
traded you even,

264
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,770
you won't be meeting up with him
in heaven.

265
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,730
25 centavos la rebanada de papaya.

266
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,570
Gracias.

267
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,370
This man lives in the hills there.

268
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:21,530
Three hours ago on his way to the
market he passed a French patrol.

269
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,570
Which way were they headed?

270
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,850
- ¿A qué dirección iba marchando?
- En esa dirección.

271
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,650
All right. Let's get the supplies
we need and move out.

272
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,570
- I want you up in that tree.
- What tree? Why?

273
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,090
Please, Mr Hogan, looking down
from heights frighten me.

274
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,610
Then look up.

275
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,250
I think there's a mountain lion
around here and I want you up here.

276
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,610
Excuse me, Sister.

277
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,410
What are you doing?

278
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,330
If you can't see him,
you can't shoot him.

279
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,690
How are you doin', Sister?

280
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,330
- Looking up.
- Good.

281
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,410
We won't talk now.

282
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,010
I'd like him to make his run
if he's going to.

283
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,330
What the hell?

284
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,090
Who the hell are these people?

285
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,610
Oigan, soy monja.

286
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:27,090
El señor trata de proteger
nuestros animales.

287
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,170
Come on, get down from there.
Turn around, I'll catch you.

288
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,850
Amigos, ¿qué hacen ustedes
aquí de noche?

289
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:47,770
Venimos huyendo de los franceses
que están en la estación de Satevo.

290
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,290
Están esperando el tren
de Santa María.

291
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,330
What about Santa Maria?

292
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,610
French soldiers at Satevo were
waiting for a train for Santa Maria.

293
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,970
Santa Maria's where I'm headed.
Those Juaristas are hiding out there.

294
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,770
Find out why the French
are going there.

295
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,370
All right. You can be sure I will.

296
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,930
All right, Satevo's a long way away,
so let's get some sleep.

297
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,970
Muchas gracias, pobrecitos.

298
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,210
- Hasta mañana.
- Adiós, hermana.

299
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,770
By the way, Sister,
I guess I owe you an apology.

300
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,450
When I was trying to get you
up the tree, I...

301
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,530
Oh, no apology is necessary,
Mr Hogan.

302
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,170
In emergencies,
the Church grants dispensation.

303
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,010
It's no sin that you pushed me up
the tree with your hands on my ass.

304
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,970
Where'd you learn
that kind of English?

305
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,650
- What kind?
- Ass.

306
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,690
Oh, in the convent.

307
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,410
Sister Harriet taught us
words for parts of the body.

308
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,090
This part she called the ass.

309
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,290
Where is this Sister Harriet from,
anyway?

310
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,410
New Orleans. Why?

311
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,250
I'd sure as hell like to know
what she did before she became a nun.

312
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,050
En arme!

313
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,170
Par ici, mon capitaine!

314
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,010
- Bonjour, ma soeur.
- Que Dieu vous bénisse.

315
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,410
Tournez à gauche! En avant! Marche!

316
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,250
Demi-tour à gauche! En avant!

317
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,210
Marche!

318
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,050
En arrêt!

319
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,530
Demi-tour en arrière!

320
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,250
Préparez-vous!

321
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,850
¡Viva Juarez!

322
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,890
¡Felipe!

323
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,250
¡Viva Méjico libre!

324
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,730
Feu!

325
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,690
Demi-tour à gauche!

326
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,250
En avant. Marche!

327
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,650
Asesinos! ¡Asesinos!

328
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,090
Ma soeur. Ma soeur, s'il vous plaît.

329
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,890
- Venez avec moi.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

330
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,210
Please. An officer is dying.
Come with me, please.

331
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,210
- Prenez garde de son animal.
- Oui, mon capitaine.

332
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,250
Even though you are not a priest, you
can give him some spiritual comfort.

333
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,450
Our colonel is very, very ill.

334
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,410
Il est sur le point de mourir.

335
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,850
Docteur,
permettez que la soeur le bénisse.

336
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,810
Deliver his soul
into your soul,

337
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,250
Mary Mother of God...

338
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,410
C'est toi. You filthy bitch!

339
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,410
Kiss the cross. Kiss the cross.

340
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,130
Sister, he was delirious.
Forgive him.

341
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,770
I forgive him.
I forgive him with all my heart.

342
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,850
Now he is with God.

343
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,530
God damn it!

344
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,170
I don't see how
you can drink this stuff.

345
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,970
You'll get cockeyed drunk!
What happened?

346
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,010
I was recognised,
that's what happened.

347
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,530
- By who?
- I've never been so frightened.

348
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,570
I had visions of being shot.

349
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,650
- Who recognised you? What did he do?
- He died.

350
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,570
What the hell are you talking about?

351
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,930
I was asked to give comfort
to a colonel dying of fever.

352
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,370
He was one of the officers I taught
Spanish at the fort in Chihuahua.

353
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,730
Oh, thank God no one
believed what he called me.

354
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,730
What did he call you?

355
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,770
A filthy Juarista.

356
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,650
All right, he died and you're safe.
Now, what did you find out?

357
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,250
They're waiting for a train
due today for Santa Maria

358
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,650
so they can load it
with supplies and ammunition.

359
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,810
You did all right, Sister.

360
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,330
Between here and Santa Maria
there's got to be a gorge.

361
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,970
Where there's a gorge
there's a trestle.

362
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,170
All we got to do is get there
before the train does.

363
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,650
Will you burn it?

364
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,690
I'll blow it to hell
with the train on it!

365
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,410
Come on, you'll have to ride,
else I'll have to leave you.

366
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,130
- I am not intoxicated.
- That's a hell of a lot of whiskey.

367
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,290
My faith in God
will turn it to water.

368
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:03,130
We'd better hurry. I've never seen
a train blown to hell before.

369
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:12,410
- Get out of my line of fire, Sister.
- Can you kill them all with that?

370
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,250
Put it away. These are Yaquis.

371
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,170
They're wild and pagan but
the Church has reached some of them.

372
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,170
Can you get on your horse?

373
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,650
I think so. I think so.

374
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,930
Then tell me when you're on it.

375
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,370
Be very careful not to show any pain
or weakness.

376
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,530
- You must stop that. Are you on?
- I'm on.

377
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,650
♫ Yes, I killed a man
one day, so they say

378
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,490
♫ I beat him on the head
and I left him there for dead

379
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,530
♫ Yes, I left him there for dead,
damn his eyes ♫

380
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,570
Oh, you got the moss.
That'll stop the flesh putrefying.

381
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:05,570
- What should I do with it?
- I'll take you through step by step.

382
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,250
First, I got to get drunker
than hell.

383
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:13,490
- How long since I got hit?
- You asked me that ten minutes ago.

384
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,170
- What was your answer?
- About an hour.

385
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,210
All right. I want you to cut a groove
in the shaft of this arrow

386
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,690
just deep enough
for a good pinch of gunpowder.

387
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,370
Gunpowder?

388
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,850
Gunpowder, that's right.

389
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,010
That'll cauterise the insides,
they tell me.

390
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,490
I don't know if this arrow...

391
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,730
Is near my heart
but I don't think so.

392
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,490
Some women have said my heart
ain't exactly...

393
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,530
In the right place.

394
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,690
All right, start cutting

395
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,730
and don't worry
if I yell a little bit.

396
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,090
Come on, my beautiful Sister
who saved my damn life

397
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,130
from those damn Yaquis.

398
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,290
You don't want me to lose
my deal now, do you?

399
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,290
♫ And the parson, he did come,
he did come... ♫

400
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,450
This ain't such a nice song

401
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,290
but it's the only one I know
well enough I can sing drunk.

402
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:32,810
- I don't care what you sing.
- You got a beautiful character.

403
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:37,170
Anyway, it's about a Protestant
parson, not a Catholic one.

404
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,490
♫ And the parson, he did come,
he did come

405
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,050
♫ And he looked so bloody glum,
as he talked of kingdom come

406
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,050
♫ Well, he can kiss my ruddy bum

407
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,690
♫ Damn his eyes ♫

408
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,370
I need another bottle.

409
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,170
More whiskey.

410
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,050
That's the last bottle you got.

411
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,010
Last one?

412
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:41,450
Oh, that's bad news, Sister.

413
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:46,290
I'm sorry I can't share any with you
but you've got to have a steady hand.

414
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,370
♫ The sheriff, he did come too,
he came too

415
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,370
♫ Yes, the sheriff,
he came too, he came too

416
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,410
♫ The sheriff, he came too

417
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,090
♫ With his men all dressed in blue

418
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,610
♫ Lord, they were a bloody crew

419
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,250
♫ Damn their eyes ♫

420
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,170
- There, finished.
- That's not bad. Not bad.

421
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,050
- You're married to a carpenter.
- Now what?

422
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,930
Cut the shaft off right there.

423
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,130
- Cut it?
- Yep.

424
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,210
♫ Now it's up the rope I'll go

425
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,530
♫ Yes, it's up the rope I'll go,
up I'll go

426
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,930
♫ And those bastards down below

427
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,610
♫ They'll say, Sam, we told you so

428
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,610
♫ Sam, we told you so

429
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,690
♫ Damn their eyes ♫

430
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,730
May I break it?

431
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,490
All right. How much time's gone by?

432
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,970
- Over an hour.
- Oh, that damn train.

433
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,490
That train is on its way,
I know it is.

434
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,530
Remember what I told you
about accidents?

435
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,170
We didn't have to run across
those damn Yaquis but we did.

436
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,410
No miracle,
just a rotten, lousy accident

437
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,210
that's gonna cost me my whole deal.

438
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,050
Get me up straight.
Get me up straight.

439
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,570
You are a beautiful woman,
Sister Sara.

440
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,290
You feel like a beautiful woman,
you smell like beautiful woman.

441
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,330
- Please, Mr Hogan.
- I can't help thinking,

442
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,370
that first time I saw you
and you were almost naked...

443
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,010
- You must forget that.
- I can't, my beautiful Sister.

444
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,570
I don't want to forget.

445
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:43,450
Every night when we bed down next to
each other I think of you that way

446
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:48,290
and I want to reach out and touch you
and hold you and feel you.

447
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:52,050
I forgive you because I know
that if you weren't drunk...

448
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,170
Maybe. Maybe so.

449
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,450
But you can't stop
a man from wishing.

450
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,930
I sure wish you weren't a nun.

451
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,970
Please, Mr Hogan.

452
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,370
All right.

453
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,890
Get me some gunpowder
out of my saddle bag.

454
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,930
Don't come near me till I tell you.

455
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,770
Pour some in your hand...

456
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,410
And leave the pouch there.

457
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,490
Fill the groove. Fill the groove.

458
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,290
That's fine.

459
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,970
All right, now comes the hard part.

460
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,570
Cos we gotta time this perfect.

461
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,690
As soon as I light the powder,

462
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,130
you drive the arrow through me
and pull it out the other side.

463
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,530
What do I hit it with?

464
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,490
Take the knife,
put the flat part over the end...

465
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,330
And hit it with the gun.

466
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,570
And please, Sister Sara,

467
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:33,610
please hit it a straight blow,
not a glancing one, huh?

468
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,890
What if I don't hit it straight?

469
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,890
The hell with that,
my beautiful Sister.

470
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,570
The arrow will break off inside me.

471
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,170
Now, I know you're
an A-1 gravedigger but...

472
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,330
All right.
What do I do with the moss?

473
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:00,490
Plug the holes both sides.

474
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,330
Push it in about a half-inch.

475
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,170
All right.

476
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,170
One last swallow
and it's up to you, Doc.

477
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,930
- Prayin' for me?
- Yes.

478
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,770
Well, then I must be drunk enough.

479
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,490
Damn my eyes,
I find that kind of touchin'.

480
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,130
One last thing, Sister.

481
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,930
The powder will flare up
when I light it, so watch yourself.

482
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,250
Now, you can load up the animals.

483
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,690
We'll be on our way as soon
as you get this stick out of me.

484
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,050
Ready?

485
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,450
Ooh.

486
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,330
Mr Hogan!

487
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:41,010
Mr Hogan... Mr Hogan, remember
the train with the French supplies.

488
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,250
You have to blow it up.

489
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,530
- How long since I been hit?
- Hours.

490
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,890
What?

491
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,290
- You fell unconscious.
- Why didn't you wake me up?

492
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,690
- I thought you were...
- You thought. The hell you thought.

493
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,250
You let me down, Sister.
You let me down.

494
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,330
Then why don't you get on your horse?

495
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,370
Because...

496
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,170
You're too drunk to ride alone.
I'll have to get on with you.

497
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,210
Hold on to the mane.

498
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,570
Lean back against me. Lean back.

499
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,370
Tell your horse to get moving.

500
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,250
I like being in the arms
of a good-looking nun.

501
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,530
How do you like it, Sister?

502
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,210
The Church allows this
for your safety

503
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,330
but you may not take liberties.

504
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:56,170
I apologise, ma'am.
I most sincerely do.

505
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,610
Will you look at
that trestle? Couldn't be sweeter.

506
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,770
- It's a miracle.
- A great place for an accident.

507
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:33,170
Is this small package of dynamite
powerful enough?

508
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,330
Not if you put it at the base

509
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,610
but if you put it up high
on those braces - pow!

510
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,850
How can you climb that trestle
with your shoulder...?

511
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:54,610
- Oh, no, Mr Hogan. No.
- Now, wait a minute.

512
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,210
- Remember I saved your life.
- I saved yours today, too.

513
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,530
I saved yours twice from the French.

514
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,690
I saved yours twice - the arrow?

515
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,650
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
desert me in my hour of need?

516
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,930
What about that rattlesnake
when you were hiding?

517
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,090
That was easy, no risk at all.

518
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:15,210
Did I or did I not come to you
in your hour of need?

519
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,250
This is my hour of need.

520
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:22,170
What kind of need is your need?
All you have on your mind is money.

521
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,610
What's more important than that?

522
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,890
My life.
If I climb that trestle, I'll fall.

523
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:32,090
A fine psalm-singing hypocrite
you are.

524
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,570
The French are gonna slaughter
a whole outfit of your Juaristas

525
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,210
and you're the only one
who can help 'em

526
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,450
and you won't climb one lousy,
stinkin' trestle.

527
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,690
That's right, Sister, lean on it.

528
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,690
A little good,
old-fashioned Christian faith

529
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:52,010
will carry you up there like a bird.

530
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:56,210
I know you're scared, Sara,
but those braces are easy to climb.

531
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:01,130
You just keep thinking of all those
Christian lives you'll be saving.

532
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,890
Have faith in that shiny cross
and God and all those saints

533
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,930
will be right up there with you.

534
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,650
You haven't yet told me
how you'll set this off when I...

535
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:14,330
Let me worry about that. I'll do it
with my rifle. Now get going.

536
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,450
Surely that train's on its way.

537
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,010
Keep goin'.

538
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:49,010
I want the dynamite up on top
so I can get a clear shot at it.

539
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,850
That's it, Sister.

540
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:34,170
You're entitled,
you certainly are entitled,

541
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,130
but I never did see anybody
get used to hard liquor so fast.

542
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,770
I want to take a few practice shots
without ammunition.

543
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,650
You turn around and face the bridge.
Come on, turn around.

544
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,970
Just like that.

545
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,130
Now, when I tell you to,

546
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,250
I want you to take a deep breath
and hold it.

547
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:03,850
Come on, grab the end of the barrel.
This ain't easy.

548
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,210
Take your fingers off the top of it.

549
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,370
All right, now take a deep breath.
Hold it.

550
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,970
- You wouldn't have hit it.
- Yes, I would've.

551
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,250
- The gun moved when you fired.
- I'd have hit it.

552
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,090
Put out your hand.
Let's see how steady it is.

553
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,770
You're still drunk,
you'll never hit that.

554
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,010
- I'll hit it.
- Put a bullet in it.

555
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:31,930
Let's see if you can hit
something about the same size.

556
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,970
That little rock over there,
the one on top of the big rock,

557
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,850
let's see if you can hit that.

558
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,770
Will you cock this for me?

559
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:44,650
Pull down that lever as hard as
you can, then slam it shut.

560
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:51,090
Perfect. All right. Yeah.

561
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,490
Now... take a breath.

562
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,210
Now cock it again.

563
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,050
We'd better try it
with you sitting and me kneeling.

564
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,170
Go ahead. Get down.

565
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,370
This ain't easy, now.

566
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:19,090
All right, take a breath.

567
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,650
Can you shoot?

568
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:34,530
No, and I climbed that thing
for nothing!

569
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,050
Take it easy, just wait.
I'm sobering up fast.

570
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,330
Meanwhile,
you fix me a cup of hot coffee.

571
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,330
I'll fix you some hot coffee!

572
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,930
Sober up! You sober up,
you dirty bastard or I'll kill you!

573
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,970
Sit up!

574
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,130
Now, tell me when to hold my breath.

575
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,970
Dear Mary, Mother of God, help this
no-good atheist to shoot straight.

576
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,850
Hold your breath.

577
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,010
Hold your breath.

578
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,930
What did I tell you?

579
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:54,730
Did I or did I not
hear you call me a bastard?

580
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:58,210
Well, I suppose whiskey
can make a man hear anything.

581
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,570
Dear Lord, forgive him
for the impurity of his thoughts.

582
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:08,090
There's the cantina I'm looking for.
I may need your help.

583
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,290
- Can you go into a saloon?
- In times like this...

584
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,210
The Church grants dispensations,
I know.

585
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,290
- Buenas tardes. ¿Habla inglés?
- Buenas tardes, hermana.

586
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,970
- Yes, I am speaking English.
- Good. Tequila.

587
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,890
- Oh. Would you like something?
- Do you have lemonade?

588
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,570
I'll have lemonade.
You're getting drunk again, are you?

589
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:58,930
Oh, I never get drunk
unless I'm shot by Yaquis.

590
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:03,010
- Then why the tequila?
- Just to oil up my arm. That's all.

591
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:10,690
I don't think they've seen a nun
in here for some time.

592
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,530
Not one like you, that's for sure.

593
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,250
- Gracias.
- Hey!

594
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,770
- Any of these men speak English?
- No, señor.

595
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:25,970
- You're sure?
- Sure. Me only.

596
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:31,770
Good. I'd like to order a bottle
of French champagne, year 1789.

597
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:37,090
French champagne, 1789.

598
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:40,290
- What is it, señor?
- What's what?

599
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,330
This "champagne"?

600
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:47,250
Is there another
El Gato Negro saloon in this town?

601
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,050
- Are you the owner of this one?
- No.

602
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,210
- Well, who is?
- Mi padre. My father.

603
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,290
- When does he get here?
- Psst.

604
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:58,330
Por favor, señor.

605
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,530
That's swell, that's my luck.

606
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:06,010
They give me a code
and the man who has it isn't here.

607
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,850
He'll probably show up
on the 15th of July.

608
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:14,050
Mr Hogan, you should be happy
you're still alive.

609
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,330
What do you want from your life?

610
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,770
A ranch? Cattle? What do you want?

611
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,810
A ranch?

612
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:25,050
You mean get up at sunrise,
go to bed at sunset?

613
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:29,250
Rear end in the saddle all day?
No, thanks, I'd rather be dead.

614
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:34,130
There's this town called
San Francisco that's booming.

615
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,170
And if I get this stake,

616
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:40,450
I'm gonna open up the biggest
gambling saloon in the whole area

617
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:44,370
with long, red mahogany bars
and green felt tables

618
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:49,130
and we'll play roulette, dice, faro
and all those wonderful games.

619
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:53,610
I realise that doesn't mean much
to you but to me, that's living.

620
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:56,650
Some men have strange desires.

621
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:02,130
- Where the hell's your father?
- Señor, he is sick. Enfermo.

622
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,410
It's important I see him.
Where is he?

623
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,170
Since three days now,
he cannot talk.

624
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,330
All this side, no move.

625
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:12,090
- Does he understand when you speak?
- Sí, señor.

626
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,050
Does he understand English?

627
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:19,010
Not so good like me but...
my mother, she with him.

628
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,090
Un memento. Madre!

629
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:37,530
He no can speak.

630
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,730
- May we see him?
- Bien, hermana.

631
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,290
Please to come.

632
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:03,130
Francisco.

633
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,810
Can you understand me, señor?

634
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:16,010
That means yes.

635
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:20,930
I need a bottle of French champagne,
year 1789.

636
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:27,890
I must see Colonel Beltran at once.

637
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:31,010
Can you take me to where his camp is?

638
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,330
What about your son?
Can he take me there?

639
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:41,650
Does anybody in this town
know where the camp is?

640
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,450
Don Ezekiel, el hacendado.

641
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,410
¿Horacio, el velero?

642
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,650
She says the candle-maker knows.

643
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:29,810
In Mexico when somebody is killed
on the road, we put crosses.

644
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:33,610
So these crosses not make anybody
think anything.

645
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,930
Now, we go that way.

646
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:39,410
- How far, Horacio?
- Not far.

647
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,490
Put away your gun, gringo.

648
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:17,090
Name's Hogan. Beltran's expecting me.

649
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:19,850
You mean Colonel Beltran.

650
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:24,090
Colonel, general, what difference
does it make? Take me to him.

651
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,130
Síganme.

652
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:47,890
I have been waiting for you, Hogan.
What happened to you?

653
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,170
I stopped a Yaquis arrow.

654
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,290
- So you never got to Chihuahua?
- Nope.

655
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:56,330
Sister Sara here saved me
a good part of the trip.

656
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:59,250
Sister? How?

657
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:02,570
- Is the deal still on?
- I keep to my word. And you?

658
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,810
Good. You get me a bottle of tequila

659
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,450
and I'll lay you out a plan
as smooth as a baby's behind.

660
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:13,010
You tell me the plan,
I will tell you how smooth it is.

661
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:19,530
The roof of the garrison
is lower than the roof of the church

662
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:22,930
and on the 14th of July
you have promised us, Sister,

663
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,130
all the Frenchmen will be drunk.

664
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:29,210
Not bad, Hogan. Not bad.
Thank you, Sister.

665
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,250
Yeah, we make quite a team.

666
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:35,810
If we pull this off, we might go in
the garrison business again, right?

667
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:39,930
If we follow what you did to
the train by capturing the garrison,

668
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:43,970
- all of my people will take heart.
- How many men do you have?

669
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,330
40, but there'll be more
by the time we reach Chihuahua.

670
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:50,170
- How many more?
- 50 to 60.

671
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:53,930
- I thought you were an army colonel.
- I am.

672
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:57,930
Any army I ever heard about,
a colonel commands a full regiment.

673
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:01,170
Not after all the fighting
we've been through.

674
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,770
When you got me into this,
you said you had no artillery.

675
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:09,450
- What about dynamite? You have any?
- None.

676
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:13,410
Less than a hundred rifles,
a few machetes and not much more.

677
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:16,450
Even drunk,
the French'll blow your heads off.

678
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:21,370
You don't know my men. Each one
tough, courageous, a Mexican patriot.

679
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:28,290
Isn't that sweet?
But I happen to be a Hogan patriot

680
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,730
and I'd like to have some dynamite.

681
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:35,290
You show me the tree it's growing on,
I'll have my men pick it.

682
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:38,970
Probably plenty for sale
across the border in Texas.

683
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:41,770
Yeah, but that takes money.

684
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:45,370
Even the food you ate
and that bottle were donated to us.

685
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:48,210
Bien.
We leave for Chihuahua tomorrow.

686
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:51,770
You can come with us
and fight under my orders, my way,

687
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:55,090
or go back to that Texas bar
that I found you in.

688
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,850
I'm in on this deal and no son
of a bitch is taking me out of it.

689
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:17,530
If any other bastard spoke to me
like that, he would be dead.

690
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:19,810
But since you have helped Mexico,

691
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:24,530
I am giving you a chance to get on
your horse and leave this camp alive.

692
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:30,490
- Now get out of here fast.
- I ain't leavin' here.

693
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:36,930
Colonel, please. This ring,
it's gold. It'll buy dynamite.

694
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:40,370
Perhaps your people
have other things that could be sold.

695
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:44,610
If someone shows me back to Santa
Maria, I'll go begging for help.

696
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:48,650
Dynamite would save the lives
of some of my men.

697
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:52,930
I told you
I was staying in this deal, Colonel,

698
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:58,290
cos you know nobody in Texas is gonna
sell a load of dynamite to a Mexican.

699
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:03,890
I am asking you,
buy dynamite for us.

700
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:07,170
I'd love to.

701
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:11,050
Oh, Sister.
You better sew this back on.

702
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:18,570
You don't want to have those people
see you going around half-dressed.

703
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,970
This is better than
killing each other, no?

704
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:28,450
I only figured there was gonna be
one funeral - Catholic.

705
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:33,010
Oh? I didn't know
that you were Catholic.

706
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:12,690
- ¿Cómo le fue, hermana?
- Muy bien. Magnífico.

707
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,290
Hogan.

708
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:22,210
Easy, Hogan. There are no
Yaquis arrows here, just a nun.

709
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:30,010
- How did you do?
- I'm not sure.

710
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,290
You must know if
you've got something worthwhile.

711
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,530
I just don't know how much
it'll bring in Texas.

712
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,970
You don't?

713
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:45,850
This will buy enough
dynamite to give my horse a rupture.

714
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:48,810
You did real well for me, Sister.

715
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:52,130
Uh... for the cause.

716
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:58,170
Maybe this will buy you a bottle of
medicine to keep your arm well-oiled.

717
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,250
- Can you give this?
- I want to.

718
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:04,370
I like you better as a Juarista
than as a nun, little Sister.

719
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,770
Well, I'll just see you in Chihuahua.

720
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:14,890
Right. If we take the fort,
we'll owe ourselves a celebration.

721
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,130
I might even put a little whiskey
in your lemonade.

722
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,290
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Your horses are here.

723
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:24,930
My packhorse has some handguns
and some Winchesters.

724
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,930
- You'll know what to do with them.
- Gracias.

725
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,930
A gift from some old friends
of Sister Sara's.

726
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:34,250
- Saquen las armas en la remonta.
- Could we talk?

727
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:38,970
I can't, Sister. I need every second
to get where I'm going.

728
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,050
Where are we gonna meet up?

729
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:46,410
Just outside of Chihuahua riding
south, there is a little church.

730
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:50,050
Be there as early as you can
on the morning of the 14th.

731
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,930
Good riding.

732
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:55,890
Don't let those French spend
that money before we can get there.

733
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:58,170
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye.

734
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:16,690
- Hello, Mr Hogan.
- How do, Sister?

735
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:20,610
- Glad to see you're back safe.
- Waiting for the dynamite?

736
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:23,090
- And you.
- What, me personal?

737
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,330
- Mm, I missed you.
- Yeah.

738
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:30,050
It's felt kinda wrong the past few
days not having you slowing me up.

739
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,770
- Did it?
- Yeah, damn it.

740
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,690
What's the matter?

741
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:40,490
Well, you see,
there's a problem, Sister...

742
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:44,170
I should have never met up with you
in the first place.

743
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,210
Come, Beltran's waiting.

744
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:21,930
Where have you been? There are
only a few more hours of daylight.

745
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:25,570
I had to go to three towns but
I've got all the dynamite we need,

746
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:27,410
plus plenty of cigars.

747
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:31,570
Ignacio. Agarra esa dinamita y
llévese a los hombres del campamento.

748
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:34,010
Salimos para la iglesia enseguida.

749
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,250
My men will leave for the church.

750
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:40,610
- How many men do you have?
- Over 100. Let us go.

751
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,050
The garrison's on that side.

752
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,450
They must be drunk already,
I don't hear any singing.

753
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,650
Agachados y en una sola fila.

754
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:20,690
Hogan.

755
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:29,890
En avant.

756
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:33,810
En avant. Marche!

757
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:37,850
En avant. En avant.

758
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,530
Nobody's drunk.
Nobody's even drinking.

759
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,210
You got your calendars mixed up.

760
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,210
No. It is their
independence Day, July the 14th.

761
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,970
It is the train you blew up.
It put them on the alert.

762
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:08,450
To attack now would be suicide.
Surprise is impossible.

763
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:11,930
Without surprise,
I never attack superior forces.

764
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:14,250
Instead of giving up,
listen a minute.

765
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:18,770
I am listening but I have my mind
on my men, yours is only on money.

766
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,930
I know how we can get a surprise.

767
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,730
Three streets from here
is the bishop's old house.

768
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:27,610
To protect him in the rainy season
there was a tunnel.

769
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:30,690
It led to the garrison
when it used to be a monastery.

770
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:35,290
After the bishop moved, it was
walled up. You can break through.

771
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:38,370
- Who lives there now?
- Very good friends of mine.

772
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:41,290
- Trustworthy?
- Yes. Very trustworthy.

773
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:43,810
Good, I got something that'll work.

774
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:45,890
- What?
- Fire.

775
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:49,010
When you were giving
those Spanish lessons,

776
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:52,890
you ever get a peek at
where they kept the garrison money?

777
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:09,330
They used to pay me from a strongbox
in the general's office.

778
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:11,770
Second floor in that building there.

779
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:14,690
Was it iron or wood?
Iron.

780
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:17,730
Great. That means it won't burn.

781
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:22,450
Now, I figure we separate
your men into four groups,

782
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:24,890
giving them coal oil and dynamite,

783
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,570
and let the first group
hit that main gate.

784
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:31,290
The second group goes through
that tunnel into the courtyard.

785
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:33,850
The third group
hits that gate over there.

786
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:38,530
The fourth group, made up of your
best riflemen, we'll have up here.

787
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:42,570
They can pick off the sentries
and set fire to the garrison.

788
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,250
This all has to happen
at the same time.

789
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:48,810
First we shall wait
for the cover of night.

790
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:51,290
And second, some women and children

791
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,850
carrying a piñata
filled with dynamite

792
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:56,130
might get close enough to that gate.

793
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,970
What's a piñata?

794
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:02,130
It's an old Mexican way
of livening up a party.

795
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:03,970
Come, come.

796
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:24,090
Atáquense, una monja.

797
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:32,290
- Sarita, baby!
- Rosanna!

798
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:36,370
You are safe.
They didn't get you!

799
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:38,690
They didn't get my favourite girl!

800
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:42,810
Sister Sara, this here's a cathouse.

801
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:45,930
Oh, no, Hogan. This is no cathouse.

802
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:49,730
It's the best whorehouse in town.

803
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,490
Day and night
out there in that desert,

804
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:56,530
you made a sucker out of me?

805
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:58,690
I didn't want to. You forced me to.

806
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,610
What are you talking about,
I forced you to?

807
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:04,450
What did you say
when we saw the cavalry?

808
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:07,490
If I wasn't a nun,
you'd let me save my own bacon.

809
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:11,170
After I told you about the garrison
you said if I wasn't a nun,

810
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,690
you'd say adiós.

811
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:15,290
I wanted to be with you,
I wanted to be safe.

812
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:18,730
I tried to tell you at the camp
but you were too busy.

813
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,490
Don't look so surprised,
you no-good atheist, move!

814
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:26,170
It could be, you know,
I saved your bacon - again.

815
01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:31,650
Trae al resto de los hombres.

816
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,650
Hogan, the piñata.

817
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:03,170
- Got the coal oil?
- Yes.

818
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:08,570
Have them put this thing against
the building outside the gate.

819
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,930
- How long is the fuse?
- Approximately 30 seconds.

820
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:14,250
That'll be enough time to get away.

821
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:17,330
There will be
women and children, remember.

822
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:19,810
Any longer fuse might be seen.

823
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:22,770
Don't make the children too young
or the women too old

824
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:24,810
and tell 'em not to trip.

825
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:27,850
Fill the jar with candies and nuts,

826
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:31,410
just like we do
at the birthday party.

827
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,450
- Colonel?
- Llévensela.

828
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:50,170
Hogan, the tunnel is open.

829
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:38,850
Libérenlos.
My men will have them free.

830
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:47,130
- ¿Por dónde los metieron?
- Por arriba. Por la escalera.

831
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:26,810
I can't budge it.

832
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:30,970
If we use dynamite,
the element of surprise is gone.

833
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:34,410
They'd have to open the door
if they had another prisoner.

834
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,450
The French want me very badly.

835
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:39,330
Why don't you turn me over
and ask for a reward?

836
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,410
Está bien.

837
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:45,970
Even if they don't put you in here,
it will get Hogan inside the gate.

838
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:48,650
It is a chance to open this door.

839
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:58,650
I don't like it.
We'll find another way.

840
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:01,450
- What other way?
- Let me think about it.

841
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:04,810
- There's no time to think about it.
- I still don't like it.

842
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:07,690
We have to get that
trap door open, don't we?

843
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:10,770
What you're talking about's
crazy, Sara.

844
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:14,770
Listen, Hogan, everybody's got
a right to be a sucker once.

845
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:29,170
How can we be sure we hit 'em
all at the same time?

846
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,170
I will put a man
in the belfry of the church.

847
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:35,410
When he sees you and Sara
entering the garrison,

848
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:38,410
he will ring the bells three times.

849
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:42,370
The women with the piñata
will start up the street slowly.

850
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:45,770
From the time you enter the gate
and the bells ring,

851
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:49,570
it will be four minutes
till the explosion.

852
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:54,770
- Slow 'em up. Make it six.
- Bien. Six.

853
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:57,690
All right.
Let's go give a Spanish lesson.

854
01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:02,210
Quédense hasta que
el americano abra la alcantarilla.

855
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:27,730
Hold it.

856
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:32,010
I don't know how this is gonna
come out but I owe this to myself.

857
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:41,090
- We'd better go.
- Bad time for a war.

858
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,650
Bad time.

859
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:27,090
Anybody in there speak English?

860
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:31,370
Oui, monsieur.
What is it you wish here?

861
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:35,050
I... have something out here
I think will interest you.

862
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:37,890
Sergent, ouvrez la porte.

863
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:43,250
Oui, monsieur?

864
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:47,650
Ah, mon Dieu, mais c'est Sara.
Entrez! Entrez!

865
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:51,410
Come on, you little cottontail.

866
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:56,770
Sergent, fermez la porte.

867
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,970
The Général himself
will want to meet you. Un moment.

868
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:04,410
Oh, Captain, wait just a minute.

869
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:08,210
I've just about had a bellyful
of this little Juarista.

870
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,210
She's been yapping at me
for three days now.

871
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:14,330
If your general wants to socialise
that's up to him

872
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:17,250
but I'd sooner have her locked up
while we talk.

873
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:19,490
Je regrette.

874
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:26,290
Entrez.

875
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:40,450
They're gonna place
that piñata right outside.

876
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:43,690
When I give you the signal,
you get ready to move.

877
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:47,810
This little cottontail
sure wishes she had that cross back.

878
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:50,490
Approchez, s'il vous plaît.

879
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,850
Entrez.

880
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,490
Passez, s'il vous plaît.

881
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:21,370
Excuse me, monsieur,
I'm certainly not laughing at you

882
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,930
but at this, this costume.

883
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:30,530
Come to think of it, we shall have
to shoot you dressed like that.

884
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:36,650
I understand that raisin' money
for the Mexican army is a crime...

885
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:41,010
- So is shooting a lieutenant.
- Did that bastard die?

886
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:44,170
Yes, the lieutenant died
and you will, too.

887
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:47,530
Monsieur, I am Général le Claire.

888
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:49,770
My name's Hamilton, Général.

889
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:53,210
- Tex to my friends.
- How do you do, monsieur?

890
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,690
How come you caught
this little pigeon for us?

891
01:36:56,730 --> 01:37:00,610
Well, you see,
I have this spread up north

892
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:03,170
and in rides this nun...

893
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:31,050
♫ Te las cantamos a ti

894
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:34,090
♫ Despierta, mi bien, despierta

895
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:36,930
♫ Mira que ya amaneció

896
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:40,170
♫ Ya los pajarillos cantan

897
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:42,730
♫ La luna ya se metió... ♫

898
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,890
And when I heard that,
I said to myself,

899
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:50,250
"Tex, you just got to haul her
on down here and turn her in."

900
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:55,370
I hate them damn Juaristas.
Do nothing but cause me trouble.

901
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:59,450
They got my Mexes laying around
just praying for independence.

902
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:02,130
You didn't know
we had posted a reward?

903
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:04,810
- A reward?
- 200 gold francs.

904
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:06,970
How about that?

905
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:11,010
Certainly better than
a stab in the eye with a sharp stick.

906
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,850
Why don't you just lock her up
and send me on my way?

907
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,970
Lock her up? No, monsieur.

908
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:22,170
Condemned prisoners are entitled
to a last night of relaxation.

909
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:26,050
- Wine or cognac, Sara?
- Cognac, a full glass, please.

910
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:29,690
Anything my sweet-tempered
little pigeon desires.

911
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:34,490
Colonel, please bring 200 francs.

912
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:39,170
- Oui, mon général.
- Monsieur Hamilton? Tex?

913
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:43,690
Make mine smaller than the one you
poured her. I'm just a country boy.

914
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:48,130
None of us can keep pace with Sara,
in cognac or any other way.

915
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:53,570
To your virtues
and especially your vices, Sara.

916
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,850
What a pity to bury them both.

917
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:13,410
Excuse me, Monsieur Hamilton.

918
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:16,490
A people who know how to sing -
the Mexicans.

919
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:20,250
- Are you familiar with that melody?
- Can't say that I am.

920
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:25,850
Las Mañanitas, for birthdays
and weddings and whatnot. Lovely.

921
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:29,010
♫ Las mañanitas que cantaba

922
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:33,410
♫ El rey David,
hoy por ser día de tu santo

923
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:36,210
♫ Te las cantamos a ti... ♫

924
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:38,650
My, how touching.

925
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:42,290
They know it is our independence day
and they come to toast us.

926
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:45,930
- Do you know what a piñata is?
- Can't say that I do.

927
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:48,450
Come and see. A charming invention.

928
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:55,730
They build an animal figure
from papier-mâché

929
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:58,690
with a clay jar hidden
in the centre of the body.

930
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:01,890
They fill it with candies,
nuts, fruits and toys

931
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:04,130
and suspend it from a tree.

932
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:06,410
♫ Despierta que ya amaneció

933
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:09,290
♫ Ya los pajarillos cantan

934
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:12,330
♫ La luna ya se metió

935
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:15,330
♫ Ahora sí que yo seré... ♫

936
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:18,170
Now, that's real cute.

937
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,410
¡Córranla!

938
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:37,570
¡Viva Méjico!

939
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:45,210
Come on.

940
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:53,370
Over here.

941
01:40:56,170 --> 01:41:01,010
Get back to the house and pour
yourself another... cognac.

942
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:25,570
¡Viva Méjico!

943
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:27,610
¡Viva Juarez! ¡Viva Méjico!

944
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:35,450
- Where's Sara?
- Last door. Hall left. My room.

945
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:55,250
- Sara, open up.
- I'm taking a bath!

946
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:57,090
Well, get out of the bath.

947
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:01,930
Will you come back later?
I want to be all dressed up for you.

948
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:04,530
Who the hell
wants to see you dressed?

949
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:27,290
The least you can do
is take off your hat.

950
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:30,170
I haven't got time for that.

951
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:04,130
Come on!
