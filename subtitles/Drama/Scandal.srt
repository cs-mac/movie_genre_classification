1
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,708
Thank you. There you are, guv'nor.

2
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,774
Hello!.

3
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,276
- How are you?
- And Barbara.

4
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,779
Barbara's going to be
a big movie star.

5
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,442
Good to see you.
Come on, darling.

6
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,866
Here we go.

7
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,898
Cigarettes?

8
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,221
I'm so glad I could come.

9
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,476
You're looking great, Bill.

10
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,009
I have to go. I'll call back.
See you soon.

11
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,623
Well, well, well.

12
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,124
- Who's this, then?
- He is a very wicked fellow.

13
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,229
- Wonderful show. Great fun.
- It's fun to do.

14
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,798
- You shone.
- I didn't have that much to do.

15
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,335
Didn't she?
Like a light, to the trained eye.

16
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,996
Dr Ward has the most
highly-trained eye in London.

17
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,177
Isn't that right, Stephen?

18
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,680
Care to dance?

19
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,349
She's upset, your girlfriend.

20
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,422
You must give me
your telephone number.

21
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,024
Impossible.

22
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,855
Nothing's impossible, not for you.

23
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,728
I've seen her on the telly.
She's on the telly, isn't she?

24
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,235
Except when she's flat on her back.

25
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,157
Oh, Chris, it's lovely.
it must've been ever so dear!

26
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,328
It's from Marshall & Snelgrove.

27
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,862
- Don't spend your money on me.
- Why not? I enjoy it.

28
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,035
Oh, it's lovely. I love yellow.

29
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,371
It suits you.

30
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,902
I don't know
what your father's going to say.

31
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,444
- How is he?
- He worries about you. We both do.

32
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,213
Well, you shouldn't.

33
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,910
I'm having a smashing time.

34
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,955
You can always come home,
you know that?

35
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,956
If...anything should happen.

36
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,564
Nothing's going to happen.

37
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,300
Oh, Lord!

38
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,082
- Who is he?
- I met him last week.

39
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,252
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor?

40
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,785
- An osteopath.
- A what?

41
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,254
He does people's backs.
All sorts of famous people.

42
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,825
Whatever next?

43
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,996
Christine! I was just passing.

44
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,966
This must be Mrs Keeler.
Delighted to meet you.

45
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:53,043
Well, very nice. Lovely setting.
Perfectly lovely. Looks a picture.

46
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,737
This is Dr Ward.

47
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,008
It's nice in the summer.

48
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:06,348
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

49
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,790
I'm a very determined fellow, my dear.

50
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:14,365
I'll stop at nothing, when aroused.

51
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:34,443
Stephen, it's wonderful!
You said a cottage.

52
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,613
It's just a little place
for weekends.

53
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,793
Bill lets me have it
for a pound a year.

54
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,587
- I let him cheat at bridge.
- Who's Bill?

55
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,199
Lord Astor. He's very sweet.
You'll meet him. Come.

56
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,962
- Are you married?
- Good heavens, no!

57
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:58,200
I was married once for 40 days,
years ago.

58
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,244
The worst mistake I ever made.

59
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,473
Come look at the gardens.
They're widely acclaimed.

60
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,745
You may have seen them
on the front of Country Life.

61
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,451
- Feels like a million miles away.
- It is.

62
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,723
This is all Bill's,
as far as you can see.

63
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,901
1 8th century.

64
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,113
God gave you beauty.
You're lucky. You should enjoy it.

65
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:44,779
You move like a racehorse.
You walk like a Derby winner.

66
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,119
Let me help you.
Introduce you to some friends of mine.

67
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,127
Some photographers,
film people, television people.

68
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,594
It's my vocation, you see. My vice.

69
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,641
When I see beauty like yours,

70
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,745
wild, untutored, elemental beauty...

71
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,782
...I long to liberate it.
It's my life's work, in a way.

72
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,622
I could do wonders with you, little baby.

73
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,486
I could shock the world.

74
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,889
I should be getting back.
Mum will be wondering.

75
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:32,332
No. Don't say anything.
I'm doing your lips.

76
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,849
So I tell Frank
and he has a bloody fit.

77
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,891
I said, "Look, I don't mind."

78
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,995
You got one,
you might as well have two.

79
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,999
it's only small,
but there's hot and cold water.

80
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,336
And the bathroom is a scandal.

81
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,412
You're out all night.
I'm in the surgery all day.

82
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,848
- What could be better?
- Where would I sleep?

83
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,851
You could always curl up with me.

84
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,251
- So, that's it.
- Don't be silly.

85
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,427
That's not what I meant.

86
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,396
You can if you like.
It's really up to you.

87
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,464
We're going to be friends.

88
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,126
Very good friends for a very long time.

89
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:44,139
- We must do something about that hair.
- You don't like my hair?

90
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,573
You'll be happy here. With me.

91
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,443
With my friends.

92
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,711
- You make it sound like a dare.
- Do l? Perhaps I do.

93
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,381
Never say no to a dare.
You never know what you might miss.

94
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,558
Wait.

95
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,797
Little baby.

96
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,799
Thank you.

97
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,109
Are you going to be in there forever?

98
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,927
Little baby!

99
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,098
That is wonderful.

100
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:03,654
- You don't like my eyelashes?
- I prefer your eyes.

101
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,630
It's wonderful.

102
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,827
Today's victory marks
an unprecedented third term

103
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,869
for the Conservatives.

104
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,032
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
is understandably...

105
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:35,551
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
you lucky people.

106
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:41,125
All together now,
you've never had it so good!

107
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:49,423
I'm sure I speak for each
and every one of you lucky people

108
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:54,470
when I call three cheers for
the Conservative Party and Macmillan.

109
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,939
I give you
the new Conservative government.

110
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,886
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

111
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,588
For he's a jolly good fellow

112
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,294
He is indeed a man to watch.

113
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,091
Rising star of the Conservatives,

114
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,432
John Profumo is rumoured
to be the next Minister for War.

115
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,276
I always had a preference for what
the Americans call "heavy petting".

116
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,813
It's something I studied
at college in Missouri.

117
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:45,724
I adore the oh, so painfully slow
escalation of touch and caress,

118
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:52,489
the tiny nibbling kisses,
the sigh of silk on milk-white flesh.

119
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:57,328
I love the ache.
It can go on for hours and hours.

120
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,835
Stephen, you're such a tease.

121
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,501
But it's worth the wait.
When you come, it's like a sigh.

122
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,909
It's like a delicious drawn-out sigh.

123
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,415
Dr Ward is the son of a vicar.
He's a connoisseur of sin.

124
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,952
Rather fun, isn't it?
Clive picked it up in Copenhagen.

125
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,855
Where's Jennifer?

126
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,691
"A" deck. Popped up
to tuck the kiddies in.

127
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,235
They come in all shapes and sizes.

128
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,896
Bound to come in handy,
don't you think? For something.

129
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,011
Well!

130
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,275
All hands on deck.

131
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,076
- I'll just put a record on.
- Ayee aye, Captain.

132
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,094
Wet your lips.

133
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,796
You could have said something.

134
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,636
- Were you shocked?
- Just a bit.

135
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:16,645
- But you enjoyed yourself.
- It was funny.

136
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,477
That thing on the table.

137
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,855
I hated that Clive.

138
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,492
Nasty piece of work.
I'm told he killed his first wife.

139
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,162
It never came out, of course.

140
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,662
- Were you frightened?
- No, I was not.

141
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,736
You mustn't be. Nothing to be
afraid of. We're all flesh.

142
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,608
No harm in it,
so long as nobody gets hurt.

143
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,874
Everybody is afraid
to enjoy themselves

144
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,485
or they're too ashamed to admit it.

145
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,815
You're the doctor.

146
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,659
You won't leave me, little baby?
You won't run away?

147
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,807
- Would you run after me?
- I don't know what I'd do.

148
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:22,538
You'd find someone else.
Another racehorse.

149
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,342
I'd never find another Derby winner.

150
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,724
What's she doing?

151
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,801
Chris, this is Mandy. She's new.

152
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,134
She's in my place.
Tell her, somebody. She's in my place

153
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,310
- Tell her yourself.
- I'll sit where I like.

154
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,712
Move it.
Take all this rubbish and move.

155
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,183
She can't just barge in
like the Queen of bloody Sheba.

156
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,086
Do as she says. There's a space
next door. It's cooler.

157
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,919
Thank you.

158
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:21,535
Where's my top? Don't be silly.
Which one of you stole my top?

159
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,368
Don't worry. Nobody will notice.

160
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,476
Mandy! Where are you?

161
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,357
Hello, Mum. It's me.

162
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,893
I'm in London.
No, I'm all right, really.

163
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,564
Goodnight, Christine.

164
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:31,395
I've got a job.
I got a part in a West End show.

165
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,596
No, it's only a small part,
but if I do well, Mr Murray says...

166
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,172
He's the producer.

167
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,777
They're putting me up in a hotel.
Ever so smart, it is.

168
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,576
It's the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.
Right on Piccadilly.

169
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:53,019
Yes. Well, it's not really a theatre.
It's more like a nightclub, really.

170
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,058
Of course I miss you.
I miss you both.

171
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,697
You mustn't worry, really.
I'm a big girl now.

172
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,061
I've got to go.
There are people waiting for me.

173
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,227
I'll write to you, I promise.
All right. Bye-bye.

174
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,877
Fancy a drink?

175
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,459
Where will we go?

176
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,621
We could always try the bar
at the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.

177
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,945
Caught you!

178
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,530
Forty quid, Miss. Or it's the police.

179
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,363
- Bill, it was awful.
- What's happened?

180
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,271
I was so frightened.
Mandy's been caught.

181
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,174
We can't leave her.
She'll go to jail. She's only 1 6.

182
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,613
- What exactly has she done?
- She owes the landlady £40.

183
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,782
It's a bit steep, you know.
It is, honestly.

184
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:41,025
I don't mind giving you a lift.
I don't mind that.

185
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,794
You could have told me
you were doing a bunk.

186
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,300
It's really unfair.

187
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:52,501
I didn't want you to know.
I'm sorry. I feel awful, really.

188
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,575
I don't know why I do this.

189
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,454
I feel so ashamed.

190
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,323
Hmm. £40.

191
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,862
She'd better be worth it.

192
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,863
Peter!

193
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,637
Ex-boyfriend.

194
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,470
He's filthy rich.
Owns half of Notting Hill.

195
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,707
You like older men, don't you?

196
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,382
Christine.

197
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,450
- This is my friend, Mandy.
- Hello.

198
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,950
Peter Rachman.

199
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,122
What did he say?

200
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,851
He said he likes your tits.
Cigarette?

201
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,530
- Thank you, Peter.
- Ward.

202
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,598
Eugene lvanov. Peter Rachman.

203
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,636
- Peter disapproves of me.
- Not at all.

204
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,775
- He thinks I'm wicked.
- Are you wicked?

205
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,274
Not as wicked as Peter.

206
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:08,042
I did some sketches of Madame
Furtseva. Whatever became of her?

207
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:13,156
- Madame Furtseva?
- She's delightful.

208
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:17,226
She says that Khrushchev
eats with his fingers. Is that true?

209
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:25,496
Drinks straight from the bottle,
so she says.

210
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,476
It's good, this. Peter said
he'd take me to the opera.

211
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,806
Lucky duck.

212
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,180
I rather like opera. Mozart and that.

213
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,412
You've never been to the opera.

214
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,682
- How do you know?
- It's obvious.

215
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,658
- I've been to The Mikado.
- Where's the hairdryer?

216
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,989
Where are you going?
Where's Stephen?

217
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,332
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.

218
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,504
- Where?
- The 21 Club.

219
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,339
I know all about the 21 Club.
It's a knocking shop.

220
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,239
- Don't tell Stephen.
- He'll be furious.

221
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,244
Not if you don't tell him, he won't.

222
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,753
You can come if you like.
You don't have to do anything.

223
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,515
Not if you don't want to.
That's what Nicky says.

224
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,995
Nicky's on the game. She's a prostitute.

225
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,495
So? There's no harm in it.

226
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,658
- We're all flesh, you know.
- Not me.

227
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,736
- Gin and it.
- Champagne cocktail.

228
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,198
Don't look now. David Fairfax Jr.

229
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,247
He's even more smashing
than in the movies.

230
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,913
Here he comes. Wet your lips.

231
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,383
I'll take care of that, barman.
Thank you.

232
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,216
Thank you, sir.

233
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,291
Hi, girls.

234
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,496
- Hello.
- Hi.

235
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,362
Exciting?

236
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,573
You'll never guess who that was.

237
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:02,111
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Fictional.

238
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,247
I give up. I never read.

239
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,475
James Bond.

240
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,246
What did he want? Let me guess.

241
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,947
A beautiful blonde
with her legs in the air?

242
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,960
- You think I'm joking, don't you?
- You're always joking.

243
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,394
Between you and me
and these four walls,

244
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,433
that was the voice
of British intelligence. Ml5.

245
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,264
Tie me down.

246
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,006
I think he had a spot of hay fever.

247
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,316
Hay fever. Good of you to come.

248
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,480
Not in the least. I'm always happy
to help if I can do something useful.

249
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,922
Your friend, lvanov, the naval chap.

250
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,233
- Is he a spy?
- No idea.

251
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,427
- What do you think?
- It crossed my mind.

252
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:05,598
You talk, discuss things,
exchange views.

253
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,315
I'm a curious fellow, Mr Woods.
Insatiable, in my way.

254
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,747
Interested in a fellow's point of view.

255
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,980
You know a lot of people.
A lot of young women.

256
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,488
Has he ever asked you a favour?

257
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,823
Took a copy
of Lady Chatterley's Lover.

258
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,492
If he should ask a favour...

259
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,263
...anything at all.

260
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,608
- I'll let you know.
- Do.

261
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,111
I will.

262
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,983
Good.

263
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,871
What a little baby!
What do you think, Eugene?

264
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:53,843
Come on. Come on, let's have it off.

265
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,544
It looks like something
my grandmother would wear.

266
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,053
Go on, let's have it off!

267
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,025
Oh, baby!

268
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,363
- Lovely to have you.
- It's been a cow of a week.

269
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,937
This Kuwait business.
The PM is chewing the carpet.

270
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,131
Terrible place, Kuwait. Stinks of piss.

271
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,469
- What's that?
- What's what?

272
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,579
- I heard a laugh.
- Laugh?

273
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,483
Get it off, girl!

274
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,328
Good girl!

275
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,175
Splendid, girl!

276
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,786
Hello, Bill.

277
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,997
Shameless hussy.

278
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,707
Got you.

279
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,867
Christine, meet John Profumo,
Minister for War.

280
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,398
You'll want this, my dear.

281
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,170
Golly!

282
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,994
Set.

283
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,328
Go.

284
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,441
And this is my favourite painting
of my favourite city.

285
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,449
That could be you and l
in the gondola.

286
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:21,557
The trees have such fine brushwork.
Do you agree?

287
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,920
It's lovely.

288
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,726
You have never made love until
you have made love in a gondola.

289
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,768
I remember a rowing boat once.

290
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,844
But never a gondola.

291
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,375
Hello, you two.

292
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,215
I can't take you home tonight.
I've got a slow puncture.

293
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,795
I've asked Eugene to take you.

294
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,365
You know what I see
when I look at this country?

295
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:09,131
- Doom, decay. A land without honour.
- It's not that bad.

296
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,572
You saw Profumo. He was walking
on the bottom at the shallow end.

297
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,838
- What kind of man is this?
- You're angry 'cause he beat you.

298
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,506
He cheated.
He was walking on the bottom.

299
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,176
He's a Cabinet minister
and he cheats at games.

300
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:35,555
Anyway, I bet you don't have
houses like Cliveden in Russia.

301
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:46,172
Cliveden is a museum. Russian
museums are open to the public.

302
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,749
Looks like rain.

303
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,267
Poor Eugene.

304
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,533
You look so unhappy.

305
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,537
Why don't you come up
and have a cup of tea?

306
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,109
Tea?

307
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,714
In Russia, we drink vodka.

308
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,496
Christine?

309
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,597
- Morning.
- Well?

310
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,773
- Well what?
- What happened?

311
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,807
- When?
- Last night.

312
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,309
- Last night?
- With Eugene.

313
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,642
You know Eugene.
He bellyached all the way back,

314
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:05,015
had a quick cup of tea and went home
to dream of Mother Russia. Coffee?

315
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,023
I know Eugene better than that.
I know you both.

316
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,628
Nothing happened, really.
I promise.

317
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,355
He was talking about his wife.
She's a teacher.

318
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,228
Look at me.

319
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,665
If you must know, it was awful.

320
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,432
Awful?

321
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,841
Why?

322
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,675
- He wept.
- He wept?

323
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,856
Aren't you going to answer the phone?

324
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,059
Hello?

325
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,027
- Wept?
- Practically.

326
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:52,134
Jack. Stephen Ward here.
I'm just about to go out.

327
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:55,669
Would you like to talk to Christine?

328
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,376
Jack Profumo.

329
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,620
Hello, Jack.

330
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,286
That would be lovely.

331
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,804
Hello, Jack!

332
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,610
Bye, Jack!

333
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,023
- Hello?
- Mr Woods?

334
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:57,463
Ward. Stephen Ward. I've just spent
the most enjoyable weekend.

335
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:03,004
i've been in the country
with some very interesting people.

336
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,069
- You've changed your hair.
- I just washed it.

337
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,221
- Eugene says you cheated.
- lvanov?

338
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:25,953
He says you were walking
on the bottom of the pool.

339
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,028
He's a liar.

340
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,630
What?

341
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,640
I've never been in a Rolls-Royce before.
I feel like the Queen.

342
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,809
is that all?

343
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,777
- That's all.
- He didn't touch you?

344
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,783
- He was shy.
- Shy? What's wrong with the man?

345
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,286
He wanted to talk. You know, chat.

346
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,456
I saw him at Cliveden. We all did.
He was all over you like a cheap suit.

347
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,326
Honestly, what did you expect?

348
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,627
Did you think he'd rip my knickers off

349
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:09,033
in the back of the Rolls
outside the Palace?

350
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,437
I expect too much, that's the trouble.

351
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,612
Don't worry. He'll ring again.

352
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,285
Do you think?

353
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,029
No, can't see anyone.

354
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,799
- Ask him.
- You ask him.

355
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:16,035
He'll never sell it to us.
He'll think we're from Scotland Yard.

356
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,209
Come on, Christine, be a sport.

357
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,708
Give her ten bob, old chap.

358
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,619
Good girl.

359
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,569
Y'all right, sister?
Looking for something?

360
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,935
I'm with some people. In the car.
They thought...

361
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,409
Well, they wondered... They thought
there might be some pot about.

362
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,242
Pot?

363
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:05,018
- You know.
- Yeah.

364
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,189
- I think she's got it.
- What's it like?

365
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,385
Pot? No idea.

366
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,029
Stiff Pimms, I suppose.

367
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,303
- This is Lucky.
- Hello, Lucky.

368
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,739
- He wants us to go to a party.
- Right now?

369
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:32,405
Right now. The Sound System.

370
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,709
I could think of nothing better.

371
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,945
The young sound of Jamaica.
I love it!

372
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:28,638
- Getting anywhere?
- Nothing yet.

373
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:55,721
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'd rather have a stiff bourbon.

374
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,672
Do you know what I like about you?

375
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,849
- My arse.
- Correct.

376
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,520
You're always so happy.
I don't know how you do it.

377
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,692
You make me happy, Jack.

378
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,925
I must dash.

379
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,098
You're always in such a rush.

380
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,228
I have an army to run.

381
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:44,396
You do want to be saved from
the approaching Russian hordes?

382
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,509
Paddington 5268.

383
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,683
i been looking for you, sister.

384
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,195
You're wonderful, marvellous.
You make me feel so...

385
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,563
- What are you doing?
- I'm a witch.

386
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,740
I'm keeping this to put a spell on you.

387
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:25,070
I'm going to be all yours, Jack.
Whenever you want me.

388
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,584
- I wonder for how long.
- As long as you want me.

389
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,484
And when I'm gone?

390
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,684
When I'm off being the Minister for War,
where will you be then?

391
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:42,855
I'm going to buy a present
for my mum. It's her birthday.

392
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,835
Here.

393
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,672
Buy her something from me.

394
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,561
It's so funny,

395
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,567
they were practically bumping
into each other on the stairs.

396
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,238
You know Mariella?
She's the best-bred harlot in town.

397
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,310
Her father's the
President of Czechoslovakia.

398
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,814
No, darling, my uncle.
But he's been dead forever.

399
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,919
He's the one with the big nose.

400
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,721
Mariella could teach you a thing or two.
She had a fling with JFK.

401
00:48:55,933 --> 00:49:00,063
Stephen, can I ask you
a rude question?

402
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,737
Please do.

403
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,497
Why don't you take your socks off?

404
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,437
Cold feet.

405
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,523
Drink, madam?

406
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,512
- Bit warm.
- Warm, madam?

407
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,514
Don't you think?
Definitely a bit on the warm side.

408
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,584
If you say so, madam.

409
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,084
I do.

410
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,690
Thank you, madam.

411
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,922
- John Profumo.
- Never heard of him.

412
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,533
He's in the Government.
The Minister for War.

413
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,330
- What's he like?
- You'd like him.

414
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:12,565
- He gave me this lighter.
- Chris, it's terrific.

415
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,177
- It's from Asprey's.
- How do you know?

416
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,680
I've seen it in the catalogue.
I read all the catalogues.

417
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:25,218
- What does Stephen say?
- He thinks it's a scream.

418
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,390
He says it's quite a coup
that I've been out

419
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,049
with a Russian diplomat
and a minister for war.

420
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,230
Peter says he's a pimp.
"That ponce", he calls him.

421
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,956
Stephen's not a pimp.

422
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:42,366
He just loves the intrigue. He thinks
he's James Bond or something.

423
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,870
The sooner you get away from him,
the better.

424
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:50,672
You should talk to this agent I know.
You could do ads on the telly.

425
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,180
He wants me to get a flat. Profumo.

426
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,050
I hope you said yes.

427
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,357
I can't.

428
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,517
I can't leave Stephen.
He'd be lost without me.

429
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,607
I wish you wouldn't
smoke those things in the flat.

430
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,439
- It's only a roach.
- I won't ask you again.

431
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,644
Is he? A spy? Eugene?

432
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:34,687
Bound to be. All Russians are spies.
It's the way they're brought up.

433
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,859
Looks like an invitation.

434
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:43,124
- So, he is then?
- Well, I expect so.

435
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,861
Why not? It sounds like fun,
and there's a lot of money in it.

436
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,768
You'd be hopeless.
You'd be the worst spy in the world.

437
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,967
You can't keep your mouth shut
for five minutes.

438
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,142
Well, thank you.

439
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,753
What is it?

440
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,716
Someone's having a party.

441
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:22,063
- Where's your wife?
- lsle of Wight.

442
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:27,967
Fun, aren't they? Valerie bought them
in Vienna on our honeymoon.

443
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,578
The Queen was here
and made such a fuss of them,

444
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,146
I'll have to send them to the Palace.

445
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,945
- The Queen?
- But they're probably fakes.

446
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,520
Must be fun, chatting to the Queen.

447
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,590
What do you talk about?
Fox-hunting?

448
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,755
- Thanks.
- I'll phone you.

449
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,730
- If you like.
- Wait. Get in.

450
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,968
- What?
- Who is that? By the bins.

451
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:38,808
She lives here.
She owns the shop round the corner.

452
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:43,042
We can't go on like this.
You living here. Ducking and diving.

453
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,118
Let me find you a place of your own.

454
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,517
I told you, I'm happy as I am.

455
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,056
I can't see you
while you're living with Ward.

456
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,697
Don't be silly. He's not
my boyfriend. You know that.

457
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,195
Why don't you like him?

458
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,425
He can't keep his mouth shut.
He's vain and empty-headed.

459
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,035
That's not true.

460
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:05,299
- We must get you out of his clutches.
- He doesn't clutch.

461
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,408
I'm serious.

462
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:12,241
We can't go on seeing each other
while you're living with Ward.

463
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,148
Well, that's it, then.

464
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:23,622
Darling, please.
You must see. People talk.

465
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,728
People listen.
I have to be careful...

466
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:31,890
Be careful, then. Do what you like.
I'm not leaving Stephen for anyone.

467
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,432
I don't care
if you're the Prime Minister.

468
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,266
Come back!

469
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,435
Christine!

470
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,854
- Smart lighter.
- Jack gave it to me.

471
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:56,025
- Comes from...
- Asprey's. I know.

472
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,052
What's the matter? Why so pouty?

473
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,322
Nothing.

474
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,160
- You quarrelled?
- No.

475
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,772
- What about? Not about me?
- No.

476
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,204
He'll be back.

477
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,382
I don't care.
I don't like him, anyway.

478
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:24,486
- He'll phone.
- He better not.

479
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,715
It'd be a shame to lose him.
He could be Prime Minister one day.

480
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,392
You can't be serious.

481
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,460
He looks the part.
Youngest MP of his generation,

482
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,429
decorated in North Africa.
He's got a spotless reputation.

483
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,432
He wants me to get a flat of my own.

484
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:46,601
- I hope you said yes.
- That's what Mandy said.

485
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,205
What did you say?

486
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,385
Obviously, I made a mistake.

487
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,893
Never mind. It's all right.

488
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:08,326
He doesn't want to come here
any more. He doesn't trust you.

489
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,590
He thinks he's being followed.

490
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,064
- Followed?
- Watched.

491
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,794
- Watched?
- I don't know.

492
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,064
- You must ask him.
- You ask him!

493
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,640
You're the one
who's so bloody struck with him.

494
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:24,610
Ask him about the Queen.
You'd find that riveting.

495
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,839
I've had enough.

496
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,043
Stephen, I'm 1 8.
I want to go out dancing.

497
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:34,052
I don't want to be... I feel like...

498
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:39,558
I want to have some fun, for a change!

499
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,942
Christine.

500
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,858
Just give me my money.
Don't do that to me.

501
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,962
- Johnnie.
- What's the matter?

502
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,969
Take me home.

503
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:01,143
- Later.
- Not later. Now!

504
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,379
Keep it.

505
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,519
Don't fuck with me.

506
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,033
Come to me, now.

507
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:46,785
Lucky!

508
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,622
Why do you do this to me?

509
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:54,126
Come out of our house, man!

510
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,554
Fuck!

511
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,588
Christine!

512
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,239
Coffee?

513
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:57,216
It's all right, baby. You're at home, now.
It's all right, now.

514
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,887
Tell me about Johnnie. Was he huge?

515
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,734
You can tell me everything.

516
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,670
A chap in the Sudan had one
one and a half foot long.

517
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:21,139
I have a photo somewhere.
One and a half foot!

518
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,313
It was knocking against his kneecaps.

519
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:35,584
- You don't care.
- Yes, I do.

520
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:39,862
More than I can say.

521
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,397
Stephen.

522
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,844
Stephen! Stephen!

523
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,616
Mandy? Mandy!

524
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,685
- Guess what? I got it!
- Got what?

525
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,956
The Camay ad!
They said yes on the spot!

526
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,861
You don't use Camay, I do.

527
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,866
Don't be spoilt.
Let's go to the hairdresser's.

528
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,301
- I've got a headache.
- Take a pill.

529
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,442
You'll end up in a flat
full of black men smoking hash.

530
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,167
I'll have to walk home alone.

531
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:32,211
No, I promise.
I've finished with that.

532
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,509
- You're full of promises.
- I mean it.

533
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,710
Your agent lined me up
with another ad for next week.

534
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,357
£90 an hour. You don't even
have to take your clothes off.

535
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,492
You stand there and wet your lips.

536
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,457
Christine!

537
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,762
It's him.

538
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,800
- Who?
- Johnnie.

539
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,635
Christine!

540
01:02:56,839 --> 01:03:00,570
- Go and look.
- You go and look.

541
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,736
Tell him I've gone
to the hairdresser's. Go on.

542
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,312
- What do you want?
- Where is she?

543
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,250
She's not here. She's gone.

544
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,721
I'm just gonna talk to her.
Just a few minutes.

545
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:20,657
- She's gone to the hairdresser's.
- Christine!

546
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:24,526
- He doesn't believe me.
- Christine!

547
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,797
- Johnnie.
- Open the door for me, now.

548
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,803
You must go away.
You'll get into trouble.

549
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:34,169
Open this door.
I've got a taxi waiting!

550
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,208
Johnnie, please!

551
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:40,178
Lucky Gordon's gonna kill me.
I got nowhere to go.

552
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,147
- I can't.
- Christine, please!

553
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,843
- I can't.
- Please!

554
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:50,685
Here. Take this and go away!

555
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,591
Bitch.

556
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,159
- You bitch, you see this?
- He's got a gun!

557
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,894
- Smashing.
- Ring the police!

558
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,835
Christine, you bitch, come now!

559
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,909
Johnnie? Listen to me.

560
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,014
Put the gun away.

561
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,448
Get me the police.
There's a man with a gun...

562
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,528
I'll kill you!

563
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:37,361
Dr Ward.
I just thought you should know.

564
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,940
There's a black man
shooting at your front door.

565
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,737
It's very kind of you to call.

566
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,536
He's gone.

567
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,044
Why are you laughing?

568
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,485
You think it's funny.

569
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:35,964
- Sorry. I can't help it.
- I can't stand it!

570
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,908
- There is a limit.
- I'm sorry.

571
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,557
There comes a point when I say,
"No, that's enough. No more."

572
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,123
I've said I'm sorry.

573
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:08,696
The Express was there.
The Mail. The Mirror.

574
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,799
They were all there
before the police were there.

575
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,265
I'm a doctor.
I can't have it, Christine.

576
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,200
I've got patients,
I've got a certain position,

577
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,897
I've got a reputation.

578
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:24,045
I can't have lovesick jungle bunnies

579
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:28,080
running amok on the front door
taking pot shots at the windows.

580
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,047
It's monstrous!

581
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,285
You took me down there.

582
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:37,482
You wanted to snoop round Westbourne
Grove at one in the morning.

583
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:40,526
I never wanted to go. You made me.

584
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,198
I'd never have met Lucky
if it wasn't for you.

585
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:46,562
I'd never have met Johnnie
or any of those people.

586
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,829
- It was all your idea.
- You go too far.

587
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,440
"Be a devil," you said.
"Never say no to a dare."

588
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,577
You took me to parties
and introduced me to everybody.

589
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:04,380
I'm yours, Stephen. You pull the strings.

590
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,350
I'm what you made me.

591
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,891
- I'll drop you.
- Where?

592
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,968
Wherever you want to go. Vicky's.

593
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,902
- I can't go there.
- Well, you say.

594
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,740
Let's go for a drive.

595
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:36,474
Please, Stephen. Take me home.

596
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,892
It's over, little baby.

597
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,096
It's over.

598
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,179
Good evening, Miss.

599
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:19,125
Miss Keeler? My name's Kevin,
from Sunday Pictorial.

600
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:23,162
Could we have a word?
Sit down. Cup of tea.

601
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:28,166
I know a place
not very far from here. Cup of tea?

602
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:40,981
It's all Stephen's fault. It was all his idea.

603
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,152
- Did he give you money?
- Who?

604
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,956
- Profumo. Did he pay you?
- I'm not a prostitute!

605
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,060
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

606
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:57,562
What I meant was a little gift,
a token of his affection.

607
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:03,301
He gave me this.

608
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,969
Did he ever write you any letters?

609
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,839
Maybe a couple of notes.

610
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,877
Notes? You kept them?

611
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:17,109
I put them away somewhere.
It was months ago.

612
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,119
Yeah, well, you should look for them.

613
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,951
It's all Stephen's fault.

614
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,695
- You got your gumboots on?
- Why?

615
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:33,062
This shit's deep. Run your little
West End shoot-'em-up tomorrow.

616
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:37,535
Say "West indian Held in West End
Shooting". Use a big picture.

617
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,265
But listen, that's not the half of it.

618
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:45,812
If what this tart has told me is true,
we are sitting on dynamite.

619
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,312
Here's the headline.

620
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:52,613
"The War Minister,
the Model and the Russian Spy. "

621
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:56,382
- Yeah? Great.
- I thought you'd like that.

622
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:00,323
Get her to sign something.
She must sign something.

623
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,759
Offer her money. Just get her signed.

624
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,731
All right, will do. i'll be there later.

625
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,801
Ted!

626
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,483
Thank you.

627
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:34,726
Isn't that the girl we saw
at Cliveden? The one by the pool.

628
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,295
Is it?

629
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:39,126
- You must remember.
- Yes.

630
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:43,100
Christine something. I'm sure it's her.

631
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,809
Keeler.

632
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,517
- Times, please.
- Times?

633
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,964
Well, well, well...

634
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:23,608
- lsn't that...?
- Yes, it is.

635
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,780
Well, that's torn it.

636
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:29,348
She must be stopped.
She's talking to everybody.

637
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,519
Yes. If it's a matter of money...

638
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,280
What Christine needs is a holiday.

639
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:38,449
Bit of sun on her back.
Somewhere quiet. Spain, Portugal.

640
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,754
- Just the job.
- lt'll do her good.

641
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:45,423
You don't think
she might...kick up a fuss?

642
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:50,628
Leave Christine to me. I dreamt
her up. I can make her vanish.

643
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,471
Who's that?

644
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:04,680
It's a cousin of mine.
I won't be a moment. Excuse me.

645
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,655
There was a letter. A note.

646
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,793
- I know.
- Silly of me.

647
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,027
Yes, it was rather. I'll see
if I can get it back, if you like.

648
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:26,264
There was nothing in it.
I've nothing to hide.

649
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,871
Come off it.
We all have something to hide.

650
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,345
What a rum life it would be
if we didn't.

651
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:37,185
I never touched her.

652
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:42,623
You know that.
Never laid a finger on her.

653
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,519
Goes without saying.

654
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,226
- Thanks, Ward.
- Not a bit.

655
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,168
What are friends for?

656
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,238
Stephen, all right?

657
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,839
Where's my cigarettes?

658
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,068
You want to wake up to yourself.

659
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:07,476
The papers have been ringing.
You could buy your mum a new house.

660
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:08,980
I feel sick.

661
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:12,312
You worked for it.
You deserve every penny you can get.

662
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,486
- There'll be trouble.
- What's to lose?

663
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,023
Look at me with Peter.
What have I got?

664
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,354
- Earrings.
- Earrings.

665
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,996
You want to wake up to yourself.

666
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,531
What are you waiting for?
What did Profumo do for you?

667
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,465
He won't look after you
in your old age.

668
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,901
You and he might call it
a bit of fun.

669
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,803
I'll tell you what I call it. Theft.

670
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,173
- Stephen'll kill me.
- Stephen's a rat.

671
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,076
All he cares about is his own neck.

672
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:44,081
- That's not fair.
- He threw me out.

673
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:47,016
I paid a month's rent
and he threw me out.

674
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,123
You should hear
what he says about you.

675
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:54,591
"That Christine," he says.
He reckons you've ruined his life.

676
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,288
It's not true. He wouldn't say that.

677
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:00,024
Ask him. Ring him up.

678
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,567
- I'll ring him up, if you like.
- No.

679
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:06,172
He's no friend of yours.
You want to wake up to yourself.

680
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,822
It's lovely. Lovely stuff.

681
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:31,159
£1,000. There's a lot you can do
with a thousand smackers.

682
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,837
I need a break.

683
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:44,536
They're calling me back to Moscow.
Things will only get worse.

684
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:48,011
Today, it's my neck.
Tomorrow, it may be yours.

685
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:52,654
Don't worry about me.
No salt mines here.

686
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,722
They will be looking
for someone to take the blame.

687
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:58,392
In Russia, we say a "goose".

688
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,897
You mean a "goat". A scapegoat.

689
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:12,333
It'll all blow over, you'll see.
These things always do.

690
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:16,500
Next week, they'll all be talking
about something else.

691
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,599
Mr Profumo!

692
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,875
Do you know where Miss Keeler is?

693
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:13,834
Can't you do something?
Make them go away.

694
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:17,005
- What can I do?
- Do something.

695
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,854
Order.

696
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:45,523
The Right Honourable John Profumo,
personal statement.

697
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:51,572
With permission, Mr Speaker,
I wish to make a personal statement.

698
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,640
I understand that my name
has been connected

699
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:02,442
with the rumours about
the disappearance of Miss Keeler.

700
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:07,145
I last saw Miss Keeler
in December 1 961,

701
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,018
and I have not seen her since.

702
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:14,093
I have no idea where she is now.

703
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:17,231
Any suggestion that I was
in any way connected with

704
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:23,371
or responsible for her absence
is wholly and completely untrue.

705
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,366
My wife and I first met Miss Keeler

706
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:33,640
at a house party in July 1 961
at Cliveden.

707
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:38,684
I met Miss Keeler on half a dozen
occasions at Dr Ward's flat

708
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:43,324
when I called to see him
and his friends.

709
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:48,019
Miss Keeler and l
were on friendly terms.

710
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:51,722
There was no impropriety whatsoever

711
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:55,664
in my acquaintanceship
with Miss Keeler.

712
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,245
Hear, hear.

713
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:11,615
Order. The Estate Agent's Bill.
Second reading.

714
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,881
I beg to move that the bill
be now read a second time.

715
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:20,858
This bill concerns the profession
and others serving the public.

716
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,511
Get me Scotland Yard, please.
Thank you.

717
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,734
Mariella Novotny? Scotland Yard.

718
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:41,405
Lady Astor?
It is Lady Astor, isn't it?

719
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:50,543
i did the right thing.
i kept my mouth shut.

720
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:53,220
I'm in an appalling position.

721
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,447
I'm under investigation myself.
It's monstrous.

722
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:59,252
They've talked to all my friends.

723
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,828
You're hard to ignore.
You have so many friends.

724
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,328
It's monstrous.

725
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,058
You know such a wide variety
of people.

726
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,405
I'm on trial by hearsay.

727
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,770
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

728
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,241
Call off the dogs.

729
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:22,177
If the police persist in ruining
my reputation and livelihood,

730
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:26,081
badgering my friends and digging up
women I haven't seen for years,

731
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:29,689
then I have no choice
but to defend myself.

732
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,689
Firstly, I needn't remind you
that the police

733
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:36,125
are not under the jurisdiction
of the Conservative Party.

734
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,856
They do their business
as they see fit.

735
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,160
I am in no position to call them off.

736
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:42,836
You leave me no alternative.

737
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:45,471
Secondly, it would appear

738
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:49,371
that you are proposing
to blackmail the Government.

739
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,775
I must tell you
that would be most unwise.

740
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,677
I've always been a good friend
to Jack Profumo.

741
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,182
I like to think
that I am loyal to my friends

742
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,877
and that my friends are loyal to me.

743
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:02,953
I hope they are, Doctor.

744
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,184
You're going to need
all the friends you can get.

745
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:07,691
Christine!

746
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,153
Mum.

747
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:47,165
- Are you all right?
- Chris, look at you.

748
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:50,099
What have you gone and done now?

749
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,741
It's not me. It's everyone else.

750
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,803
Christine!

751
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:06,986
Hello? Just one moment, please.

752
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,746
A Dr Ward.

753
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:15,620
I'm sorry. There's nobody here
by that name. Quite sure.

754
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:32,875
- Paddington 5628.
- Stephen...

755
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,379
- Hello, Bill!
- Yes.

756
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:43,087
- I'm sick about this, Stephen.
- Cheer up. We'll all pull through.

757
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,555
- We all are.
- So long as we stick together.

758
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,786
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

759
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,897
How was New York?

760
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:56,902
Bronwen likes it.
The shops.

761
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:04,442
I'm glad we could meet and talk.

762
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,114
I've been thinking about the cottage.

763
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,318
- The cottage?
- Yes.

764
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:19,522
I've had a talk
to one or two of our legal chaps.

765
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:24,392
They seem to think
I should have it back off you,

766
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:25,998
with things as they are.

767
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:28,567
- Have it back?
- The cottage.

768
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,439
I'll fix you up for the improvements.

769
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:36,974
Bill, you're throwing me out.

770
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,511
You see what a spot I'm in.

771
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,811
I think it would be better all round.

772
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:51,016
I thought about £200
for the improvements.

773
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,896
You could pop the keys in the post.

774
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,502
Yes, of course.

775
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,105
You've been under a lot of strain.

776
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,403
I know that. I can tell.

777
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:15,276
You're worried sick. You're frightened.

778
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:18,111
You're frightened
you might go to prison.

779
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,083
I haven't done anything.
It was Johnnie Edge...

780
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:24,725
Piss on Johnnie Edgecombe!
You see my point?

781
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:31,431
Johnnie Edgecombe, Lucky Gordon,
they're bunnies.

782
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,363
The jungle's full
of bunnies like them.

783
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:38,005
Ward is a different class of animal.
Your ponce.

784
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:42,006
- He's not a ponce.
- I've known a lot of whores.

785
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,270
A lot of prostitutes.
I used to be at Mayfair North End.

786
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,540
I can smell them. Can't l, John?

787
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,082
- I can smell the pink Camay.
- I'm not a whore.

788
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,583
These clients of yours,

789
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:57,690
these gentlemen friends
that Ward introduced you to,

790
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:04,263
how much did you charge them?
Twenty quid? Thirty?

791
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:06,764
I'll bet you charged them
thirty quid at least,

792
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,402
a beautiful young girl like you.

793
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,573
- How much did you give to Ward?
- Nothing! I've told you.

794
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,937
I've told him. How many more times
must I say it?

795
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:19,978
I never gave Stephen money.

796
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:25,016
I chipped in for the phone bill.
I may have bought a tin of Nescafe.

797
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,121
We were friends, we shared.
He didn't keep me.

798
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:32,521
Tight, was he? Mean? I should think
you kept him, more like.

799
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,786
Why do you hate him so much?

800
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:40,832
Hate him? I don't hate him.
It's not my job to hate people.

801
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:43,663
My job's to root out the filth.

802
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,169
Cup of tea?

803
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,302
Thanks.

804
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,573
You can't save him. We know it all.

805
01:25:54,782 --> 01:26:01,483
Profumo, lvanov, Rachman,
the man in the mask, the works.

806
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:06,251
Ward's for the drop. There's nothing
anybody can do for him.

807
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:10,124
Profumo's an MP. Astor's a lord.

808
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,494
Ward's just a jumped-up
little ponce from Torquay.

809
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:16,534
He's not even a proper doctor.

810
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,706
You don't understand.

811
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:22,706
I love Stephen.

812
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:26,208
He's the only man I've ever loved.

813
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,958
- Morning.
- Morning.

814
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:44,596
The Secretary of State for War
has written to the Prime Minister,

815
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:50,237
and the Prime Minister has asked
me to read that letter to you.

816
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:54,875
"Dear Prime Minister, you will
recollect that on March 22nd,

817
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:58,044
"following certain allegations
made in Parliament,

818
01:26:58,246 --> 01:27:00,441
"i made a personal statement.

819
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,981
"i said that
there had been no impropriety

820
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,551
"in my relationship
with Christine Keeler.

821
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:10,781
"To my regret, i must admit
that this was not true.

822
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:18,632
"i cannot remain a member
of your administration

823
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:21,334
"nor the House of Commons.

824
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,708
"i cannot tell you
of my deep remorse

825
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,309
"for the embarrassment
i have caused to you,

826
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:33,844
"to my colleagues, my constituents,

827
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:37,848
"and the party i have served
for the past 25 years.

828
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:42,455
"Yours sincerely, Jack Profumo."

829
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,426
Sorry, that is the end
of the statement.

830
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:18,890
Of course it's a security problem.
Don't be so silly!

831
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:23,029
A secretary of state for war
can't have a woman shared with a spy,

832
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:26,461
or if he was a spy,
without a security risk.

833
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,465
The question is not
whether it was a security risk

834
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:31,833
but whether there was
any breach of security.

835
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,736
it's silly to make this
a party issue.

836
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:40,107
A scandal can arise in one party
and it can arise in another.

837
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:44,217
Let's recognise it
for what it is. A scandal.

838
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:47,752
A great party is not to be brought
down because of a squalid affair

839
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:51,755
between a woman of easy virtue
and a proved liar.

840
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:55,292
A party of great principles
and policy,

841
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:59,523
a party which believes things
about the country and the world,

842
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,767
that has great convictions,

843
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:07,065
does not depend upon squalid morals.

844
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:10,142
What we've got to do
is to clear up the facts,

845
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,939
establish the facts,
punish the guilty.

846
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,478
Thank you, Lord Hailsham,

847
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,140
Conservative Leader
of the House of Lords.

848
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:33,426
I've always been afraid of this.
Dreaded it. Nightmares.

849
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:36,928
I've always been afraid
that the day would come

850
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,971
when they'd throw me to the dogs.

851
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:42,972
Ever since I can remember,
since school.

852
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:51,513
There was a boy there who snored,
called Follet.

853
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,851
He slept in the next bed to me.

854
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:59,822
I know he suffered from asthma,
but he kept us all awake.

855
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:04,589
One night, one boy got fed up
and hit him. He didn't hit him hard.

856
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:09,862
He just slapped him across the face,
but it fractured his skull.

857
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,130
He had a weak skull, Follet.

858
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:18,712
He was in a coma for weeks.
You can imagine the hue and cry.

859
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:23,947
I knew who'd hit him, of course.
A few of us did.

860
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,420
But nobody would tell.
You just didn't do that.

861
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:39,292
So, because I was the nearest,
they picked on me.

862
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,436
They knew I hadn't hit him,
but they knew I knew who had.

863
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:46,266
But I didn't sneak.

864
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:49,476
You simply...

865
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:53,814
...simply didn't do that.

866
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,652
The house master dragged me out
in front of the whole school

867
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,481
and gave me a thrashing.

868
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:13,494
A few years later,
I met him at a wedding.

869
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:15,999
God knows why he was there,
and I asked him,

870
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:21,767
"Did you really think that
I was to blame?" Know what he said?

871
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:27,209
He said, "Someone had to have
a thrashing, Ward."

872
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:29,713
"lt just happened to be you."

873
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,456
It just happened to be me.

874
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:51,034
Well, not again. Not this time.

875
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:55,071
This time, I'll split.

876
01:31:57,411 --> 01:32:01,347
This time,
I'll drag them all down with me.

877
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,022
I bet you don't.

878
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,560
Hello, Stephen.

879
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:55,365
Let's go back to the old in-and-out.

880
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:59,301
What about the man in the mask?

881
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:02,305
Did she tell you all about that?
Christine?

882
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,138
She told us the lot.

883
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,541
She missed out the best bit.

884
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:12,947
Yeah? What was that?
You tell us the best bit.

885
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:17,252
It really was rather extraordinary.

886
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:24,464
Mariella had this little glass jar
full of bees.

887
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:28,294
- Bees?
- Bees. Angry bees.

888
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:34,907
Somehow, she managed to screw
this glass jar on to his bollocks.

889
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:38,977
And you can imagine
what that was like.

890
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,746
She'd sprayed Chanel
on to his bollocks.

891
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,578
Apparently, bees can't stand Chanel.

892
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:52,121
Drives them mad.

893
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:09,008
You're for the drop, Ward.
You know that, don't you?

894
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,279
You're finished.

895
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:19,852
They've all dropped you. All your mates.

896
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:25,621
All your lords and ladies,
all your MPs, your royalty.

897
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,660
They're all rushing off to America
on urgent business.

898
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:34,892
Nobody wants to know.
You haven't got a friend in the world.

899
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:38,264
It's no use thinking your Ml5 mates

900
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:41,737
will come up the Thames
in a midget submarine.

901
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:44,672
This isn't your James Bond.

902
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:49,748
- I said, it's not your James Bond.
- No.

903
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:55,047
You stink, Ward.
You're a stinking little ponce.

904
01:34:55,256 --> 01:35:01,252
And I've got 1 47 people
who say the same. 1 47.

905
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:06,292
Know how many witnesses we normally
interview on a charge of poncing?

906
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:10,698
Three or four. Five at the most.

907
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:13,373
And we generally get a result.

908
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:20,536
1 47, Ward.
That's 1 47 different interviews.

909
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:23,978
Me and John have been busy.
We've been at it round the clock.

910
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:27,348
You'd be amazed
at some of the people we've dug up.

911
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,718
Real filth, eh, John?

912
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:34,088
Real pox-ridden harlots.

913
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:40,200
Oh, dear. Look at that.

914
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:12,032
A prostitute is not necessarily
the kind of woman that one pictures

915
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:15,259
when one normally uses that word.

916
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:19,872
It is not necessary for her
to ply her trade on the street corner.

917
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:24,943
Prostitution, as a matter of law
and for the purposes of this case,

918
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:28,912
is where a woman offers
her body for sexual intercourse,

919
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,550
that is, normal sexual intercourse,

920
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:37,452
or for any acts of lewdness,
for money.

921
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:41,622
I swear that the evidence
I shall give shall be the truth,

922
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:45,629
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

923
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,631
How did you pay the rent
at Comeragh Road?

924
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:50,895
I didn't pay the rent
at Comeragh Road.

925
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:53,369
- How was it paid?
- By cheque.

926
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:56,839
- Whose cheque?
- Lord Astor's cheque.

927
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:02,982
- Had you met Lord Astor?
- Yes.

928
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:07,382
- Who introduced you to him?
- Stephen.

929
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:09,954
Did you have intercourse with him?

930
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:12,751
Not when he paid the money.
Two years later.

931
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,691
Were you having intercourse
with any other men at this time?

932
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,331
- Peter Rachman.
- Anyone else?

933
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:22,093
David Fairfax Jr.

934
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:26,670
- Anyone else?
- A boyfriend of mine.

935
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:35,144
In October 1 962, when you were
living with Ward at Wimpole Mews,

936
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:39,308
did you have sexual intercourse
with an lndian doctor?

937
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:41,919
- Yes.
- Did he give you any money?

938
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:46,218
Yes. Sometimes, he gave me £1 5,
sometimes, £25.

939
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:48,520
How much of this money
did you give Ward?

940
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:52,165
- I paid the rent.
- Apart from the rent?

941
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:56,460
Some money for the phone. About £25.

942
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:00,106
I paid for the food as well, you see.

943
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:04,473
This is not a laughing matter.

944
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:10,814
Miss Davies, is it not true
that you have been negotiating

945
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:14,010
with a number of newspapers
to sell your story?

946
01:38:14,255 --> 01:38:15,722
I did, yes.

947
01:38:15,923 --> 01:38:20,553
Does the value of your story not
depend on the conviction of this man?

948
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:22,194
No.

949
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:25,763
Do you realise
that because of the laws of libel,

950
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:29,800
your story will not have
the same value if he is acquitted?

951
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:31,631
I hope he is acquitted.

952
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:34,706
Are you still friendly with him?

953
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:39,744
No. But I know what it's like in jail.

954
01:38:40,848 --> 01:38:42,145
Mr Burge?

955
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:45,011
You know that
before you came on the scene,

956
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:48,211
Lord Astor, an old friend
of the accused,

957
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:51,891
had lent him
substantial sums of money?

958
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:53,582
I did not know that.

959
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:55,727
Are you aware that Lord Astor

960
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:59,957
denies any impropriety
in his acquaintanceship with you?

961
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:02,101
Well, he would, wouldn't he?

962
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,321
Just a moment.

963
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,262
Mandy!

964
01:39:55,956 --> 01:40:01,588
I hate this.
I don't know what to say.

965
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:05,788
Just tell 'em the truth.
It can't go wrong.

966
01:40:06,033 --> 01:40:08,695
Nothing will happen to you
if you tell the truth.

967
01:40:08,902 --> 01:40:13,339
What about Stephen?
What are they going to do to him?

968
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,236
That's his problem, isn't it?

969
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:18,411
Miss Christine Keeler.

970
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:44,133
Take the book in your right hand
and read what is on the card.

971
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:48,104
I swear that the evidence
I shall give shall be the truth,

972
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:51,277
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

973
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:59,818
When did you first meet
the defendant?

974
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:03,012
- When I was at Murray's Club.
- Did he take you out?

975
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:04,724
We used to go for a coffee.

976
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:08,621
- Did you go to the cottage at Cliveden?
- Yes.

977
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:13,459
Is it true that you never had sexual
intercourse with the defendant?

978
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:14,964
Yes.

979
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:18,104
Were you having intercourse
with Peter Rachman?

980
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:19,602
Yes, I was.

981
01:41:19,807 --> 01:41:24,403
Were you paid anything by way
of money or presents by Rachman?

982
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:25,908
He looked after me.

983
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:30,106
Will you answer the question?
Did Rachman give you money?

984
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:32,181
Yes, he gave me money.

985
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:36,755
Did you introduce
Mandy Rice-Davies to Ward?

986
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:39,118
- Yes, I think I did.
- And to Rachman?

987
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:40,623
Yes, I did.

988
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:45,128
At Wimpole Mews, did you have
intercourse with any other men?

989
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:47,493
- Yes.
- How many?

990
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:49,293
Two or three.

991
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:51,403
- Did you meet Mr Profumo?
- Yes.

992
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:58,870
- Did you have intercourse with him?
- Yes, I did.

993
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:00,944
Did he pay you any money?

994
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:04,276
No. Once, he gave me money
for my mother.

995
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:09,149
- He gave you money?
- On one occasion, yes.

996
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:17,228
- Did you meet a man, lvanov?
- Yes.

997
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:20,491
- Did you have intercourse with him?
- Yes.

998
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:23,829
Did you ever
introduce girls to Dr Ward?

999
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:25,402
Yes, I did.

1000
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:29,235
You say you were
highly influenced by him.

1001
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:32,503
- Yes.
- What do you mean by that?

1002
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:37,881
Dr Ward has
a very charming personality.

1003
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:40,519
He had full control over my mind.

1004
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:43,690
- And you left him from time to time?
- Yes.

1005
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:46,519
- How many times, all told?
- Eight or nine.

1006
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:48,058
Why did you do that?

1007
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:50,958
Because I knew
he had control over me.

1008
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,656
- You went back to him?
- Yes.

1009
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:56,597
How did you come to go back?

1010
01:42:57,638 --> 01:43:01,734
He's a very dominating personality.

1011
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:04,544
Mr Burge?

1012
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,779
You know the prosecution
are endeavouring to prove

1013
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:13,077
that Ward has been living
on the earnings of prostitution?

1014
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:14,584
Yes, I do.

1015
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:18,918
I would like to say that I am not
and have never been a prostitute.

1016
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,818
While you were living with Ward
at Wimpole Mews,

1017
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:28,524
is it right to say that you were
frequently hard up for money?

1018
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:30,066
Yes.

1019
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,067
And that Ward
gave you spending money?

1020
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:33,899
Yes.

1021
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:38,944
It is quite obvious
to anyone who has seen you,

1022
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:42,842
if you wished to earn money
by selling your body,

1023
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:47,009
you could have made
very large sums of money.

1024
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:48,721
Yes.

1025
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,446
But while you were living with him,

1026
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:54,650
it was obvious you were not
making large sums of money.

1027
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:56,556
Yes, that's right.

1028
01:43:56,763 --> 01:43:59,698
Was it not the case
that Dr Ward was anxious

1029
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,663
that you should give up
smoking reefers?

1030
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:04,029
No. He smokes them himself.

1031
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:11,807
You have referred
to domination of the mind.

1032
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:17,109
Dr Ward, you said,
had full control over your mind.

1033
01:44:17,317 --> 01:44:21,754
Is this not an expression
that appears in your memoirs?

1034
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:23,252
Yes, it is.

1035
01:44:23,457 --> 01:44:26,688
That were written for you
by a journalist?

1036
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:28,292
Yes.

1037
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:31,828
In fact,
you've done pretty well out of this.

1038
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:35,661
You sold your story,
on the most recent occasion,

1039
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:40,329
to the News of the World for £23,000.

1040
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:44,908
That's only for the local rights.
Not the international rights.

1041
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,239
I had to think of my future.

1042
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:50,211
Is it not the truth of the matter

1043
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:54,547
that you have milked the notoriety
this sorry affair has given you

1044
01:44:54,755 --> 01:44:56,723
for every penny piece you can get

1045
01:44:56,923 --> 01:45:01,587
without a care in the world for
the only man who ever stood by you,

1046
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:04,662
the man who picked you up
every time you fell,

1047
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:10,701
a man whose only crime,
if crime it was, was to be your friend?

1048
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:13,031
This is not fair!

1049
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:17,970
Mr Burge.

1050
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:25,114
I beg your pardon, My Lord.

1051
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,688
But this...

1052
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,792
...this is not fair.

1053
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:29,315
Get back!

1054
01:46:31,084 --> 01:46:32,381
Make way, sir!

1055
01:47:00,213 --> 01:47:02,238
it's really more than i can stand,

1056
01:47:02,482 --> 01:47:05,576
the horror, day after day,
in the court and in the street.

1057
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:09,847
it's not only fear.
it's a wish not to let them get me.

1058
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:11,819
i'd rather get myself.

1059
01:47:12,025 --> 01:47:15,791
i do hope i haven't
let people down too much.

1060
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:17,964
i tried to do my stuff.

1061
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:28,564
But after Marshall's summing-up,
i've given up all hope.

1062
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:43,589
Turn this way.

1063
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,260
Once again. Just like that.

1064
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:50,823
Smashing.

1065
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:04,305
i'm sorry
to disappoint the vultures.

1066
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:08,174
i only hope this has done the job.

1067
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:12,044
The car needs oil in the gearbox,
by the way.

1068
01:48:12,252 --> 01:48:13,651
Be happy in it.

1069
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,632
Seven, eight, nine,

1070
01:48:26,867 --> 01:48:32,635
1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5...
