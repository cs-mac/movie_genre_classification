1
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,459
<i>Heaven or hell?</i>

2
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,263
<i>People don't find out where
they're headed until they die.</i>

3
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:08,434
<i>But I know. I know
where everyone's going.</i>

4
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,769
<i>Because I'm the one
who makes the decision.</i>

5
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,975
<i>This was the moment
my life changed forever.</i>

6
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:19,545
<i>Because God starting
speaking to me.</i>

7
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,429
<i>He gave me a job.</i>

8
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,165
<i>My purpose in life.</i>

9
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,367
<i>The judgements.</i>

10
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,306
<i>He told me as long as
I trusted my instincts</i>

11
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,676
<i>and did my job...</i>

12
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:51,878
<i>everything would be alright.</i>

13
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,117
<i>My name is
Walter Gary Benjamin.</i>

14
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,253
<i>My friends call me Wally.</i>

15
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,088
<i>My enemies call me
"kid" or "dumbass"</i>

16
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,258
<i>or sometimes "stupid fuck."</i>

17
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,160
<i>My mom has always
gone with Walt,</i>

18
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,297
<i>and my dad, whenever I talk
to him, goes with Walter.</i>

19
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,900
<i>He's God, by the way.
My dad.</i>

20
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,603
<i>And no, I'm not Jesus,
that was someone else.</i>

21
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,971
<i>With a beard.</i>

22
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,720
Eggs?

23
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,222
I have to go to work.

24
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,257
It's an important part of life,
you know, eating.

25
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,025
I'm sorry, but being late
is not an option.

26
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,493
You're never late.

27
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,163
Because I always leave
at the same time. Goodbye.

28
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,532
Well, what if you starve
to death on the way to work?

29
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,701
I won't.
You might!

30
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,703
I won't.

31
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,036
Your bus could crash.

32
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,173
Everybody dies on impact,
except you.

33
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,841
But the paramedics
can't get to you,

34
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:03,875
because you're trapped,

35
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,611
under all the twisted metal,

36
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,012
and the other dead passengers,

37
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,047
and then there's gas,
all over the road!

38
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,416
Now it doesn't explode,
which is a good thing.

39
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,018
But while they're
busy making

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
all of their explosion
preparations,

41
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,123
who dies of starvation?

42
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,459
You do!

43
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,196
<i>Being who I am
isn't always easy.</i>

44
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,865
<i>The job of deciding
someone's eternal fate</i>

45
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,167
<i>is a great responsibility.</i>

46
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,724
<i>Him, hell.
Her, heaven.</i>

47
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:26,992
<i>Heaven.</i>

48
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:31,797
<i>Heaven, hell.
Heaven.</i>

49
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,031
<i>Heaven.</i>

50
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,533
<i>When making a judgement,</i>

51
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,575
<i>I'm required to look
past the obvious.</i>

52
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:48,246
<i>Heaven. Heaven. Heaven.</i>

53
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,528
<i>Most of the time, I'm able to
do my job without question.</i>

54
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,931
<i>But it's hard for me on
this particular city bus.</i>

55
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,902
<i>When I was eleven, I took this
same bus to the hospital</i>

56
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,706
<i>with Jim a lot.</i>

57
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,375
<i>He told me if he could
fight fires for a living,</i>

58
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,909
<i>a little disease was
nothing to worry about.</i>

59
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,311
Then everything's
gonna be okay?

60
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,346
Then everything's gonna be okay.

61
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,803
Dad, when I grow up,
I'm gonna be...

62
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,353
Look at this kid,
all eager and shit.

63
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,588
I take the time out of
my day to address

64
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,823
your quirky little dumbass self,

65
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:05,957
and you're just
gonna blow me off?

66
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,259
I'm working, Vince.

67
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,894
No, you're vacuuming.
I'm working.

68
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,329
Constantly. See, I got this call
back on this jack-in-the-box

69
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,764
spot they're shooting
up in Chi-town.

70
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,499
Corey gave each of us a list
of pre-matinee duties

71
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,268
that we're supposed to...
Corey gave up on life

72
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,036
when he gained 40 pounds,
opted against using Rogaine

73
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,005
and decided to manage
a fuckin' movie theatre

74
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,473
was an acceptable
career choice.

75
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,442
He's still our boss.
No, he's your boss.

76
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,210
My boss is Brando.

77
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,546
My boss is
motherfucking Denzel.

78
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,414
My... my boss is that guy
who played Gandhi

79
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,150
in that old-ass<i> Gandhi</i> movie.
Corey ain't shit.

80
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,553
What was that?

81
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,222
Ha! You know, I saw you
creeping up my perphery.

82
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,557
You like what I was doing there?

83
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,460
I was like, you know,
"Corey ain't shit!",

84
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,695
knowing the whole time
you were coming right up on me.

85
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,030
That's funny!

86
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,532
Theatre 3 has puke
in one of the aisles,

87
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,468
just for you, Vince.

88
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,237
Yeah. Yeah, my boy,
he's all over that.

89
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,239
Usually, when someone
identifies you by name,

90
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,874
they're talking to you.

91
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,396
Unless you've changed
your name to Douchebag.

92
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,887
Lobby looks good.

93
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,555
Thank you.

94
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,524
The lobby floor is highest on
my list of pre-matinee duties,

95
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,093
so I always make sure to...
Jesus Christ.

96
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,487
- Undigested Milk Duds.
- Look at 'em.

97
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,455
No thank you.

98
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,023
Just fuckin' look at 'em!

99
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,825
You're seein' general human
condition bullshit

100
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,293
going on right in there, man!

101
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,929
It's just a metaphor for life,
stupid fuck!

102
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,803
<i>That's Kendall.</i>

103
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,639
<i>Definitely heaven.</i>

104
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,707
<i>I've liked her since the moment
she started working here,</i>

105
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,976
<i>but she's Concessions.
I'm Tickets.</i>

106
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,511
Yo, Kendall!

107
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,673
<i>If only I can figure out
how to talk to her.</i>

108
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,519
It's about time, Wally...

109
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,354
<i>She says, cueing the music.</i>

110
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,859
She says something
cool, poetic.

111
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,427
Something cool,

112
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,361
poetic.

113
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,996
<i>I respond with equally profound</i>

114
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,831
<i>yet effortless banter.</i>

115
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,334
Words, words, words.

116
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,081
I love you.

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,449
You're staring.

118
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,383
What?

119
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,819
You're staring, dumbass.

120
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,288
I wasn't staring.

121
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,723
No, whatever you say,
Brokeback Rain Man.

122
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,557
Vince!
What?

123
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,259
Stop.
Hey, it's cool.

124
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,194
I'm... I'm all secure
in my shit.

125
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,129
Like, I don't want you to think
that I'm hatin' on

126
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,664
the goofy bitch, I just...

127
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,900
I'm totally into the ladies,
so I gotta be like,

128
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:05,303
"Yo, you know, keep the homo
party on that side of the...

129
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,305
"the lobby, 'cause
I only bang chicks."

130
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,840
You know what I mean?

131
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,542
Look, it's okay,
don't feel bad about yourself.

132
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,410
I got an appeal.
It's an it-factor.

133
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,612
I wasn't staring.

134
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,013
Does this normally
work for you?

135
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,515
What?
When you talk.

136
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,754
Dramatic tension.

137
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,491
Wow.

138
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,860
I wasn't staring at Vince.

139
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,032
Umm... I'm gonna go
set up before we open.

140
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,034
Well, w... I wasn't staring.

141
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,570
I wasn't.

Oh, Walt, you don't
look good.

161
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,767
Did you catch something?

162
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,235
I'm fine.

163
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,736
I told you to get a flu shot.

164
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,638
You're working at
that movie theatre,

165
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,974
with all those people
with butter

166
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,309
and bathroom doorknob
feces on their hands.

167
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,345
I'll get the thermometer.

168
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,760
<i>Heaven, heaven.</i>

169
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:57,996
Listen, man, I don't
know what's wrong...

170
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,264
<i>Hell.</i>

171
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,706
But I need it today,
not tomorrow.

172
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,574
Heaven. Heaven.

173
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,709
Heav...

174
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,614
Heaven.

175
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,549
Heav...

176
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,718
Hell. Heaven.

177
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,434
Theatre 3 to your left. Heaven.

178
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,809
Theatre 2 to your right.
Polo heaven, tank-top hell.

179
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,911
Anybody say he'd be your
Prince Charming?

180
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,647
Do you think or you just
completely...

181
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,085
Uhh, Theatre 4 right...
uhh, to your right. Hell.

182
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,557
Hello?

183
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,759
Come on, man,
I'll miss my movie.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

184
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,395
Where are you going,
ticket guy?

185
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:07,799
Just make the judgement, kid.

186
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,367
This is not...
Yes or no,

187
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,769
up or down, heaven or hell,
I really don't care,

188
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,771
but I can't be here
any longer.

189
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,174
You're not...
you're not even...

190
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,910
I know who you are.

191
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,445
This isn't...
This isn't...

192
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,180
Do your job.

193
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,781
- I can't get a reading...
- Can I get a new ticket guy?

194
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,116
Mine's broken.

195
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,852
Do... your... job.

196
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,108
Must be nice.

197
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,311
If I had a direct line like you,
I wouldn't have to do this.

198
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,712
Do what? Who are you?

199
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,913
I'm Greg.

200
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,248
Greg?

201
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,885
Yeah. Gregory Douglas Tomlinson,

202
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,087
if that helps with
the paperwork.

203
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,557
How do you...
Hmm? How do I what?

204
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,161
Know who I am. No one knows.

205
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,197
No one living, at least.

206
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,166
Boo.

207
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,968
It's a stupid joke.
It's... I just...

208
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,171
I've been waiting a long time
to try that out, so...

209
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,606
You're dead.

210
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,141
My lack of colour
give me away?

211
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,976
That's why I couldn't
get a read.

212
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,311
So what's the plan?
How did you find me?

213
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm dead, Walter.

214
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,448
I'm dead and I'm talking
to you.

215
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,582
I judge the living.

216
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,584
You judge everyone.

217
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,118
Everyone living!

218
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,491
So I'm...

219
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,692
I'm stuck here like this?

220
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,195
I don't know! I... I don't...

221
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,298
Well, I can't!

222
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,572
Living, dead,

223
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,275
what's the difference?

224
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,743
I told you, I can't
get a read...

225
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,578
A read, a read,
right, whatever.

226
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Uhh, make a guess.

227
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,315
I honestly don't care
where you send me,

228
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,683
just get me outta here.

229
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,685
Flip a goddamn coin!

230
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,960
It doesn't work that way.

231
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:16,761
Why not?

232
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,162
Because I have to know.

233
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,231
Who cares?

234
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,300
He does.

235
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,235
I have to be right,
that's how it works.

236
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,536
And how does that happen

237
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,673
with normal people
who aren't, you know, dead?

238
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,608
I just see them and I know.

239
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,110
You do all this
on a fuckin' hunch?

240
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,945
I wouldn't expect you to
understand how I work.

241
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,746
There's certain... mysteries
that can't be explained.

242
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,415
Mysterious ways, right.

243
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,884
Godspeak for bullshit.

244
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,126
Can't feel anything.

245
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,061
You have any idea
what that's like?

246
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,931
I'm sorry, but I...

247
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,166
I still can't help you.

248
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,968
What's the harm
in trying, Walter?

249
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,369
I have work to do,
and anything that keeps me

250
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,638
from doing that work
is harmful, so please...

251
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,176
Go away.

252
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,187
Okay, I know I promised
not to talk about it...

253
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,157
I'm fine.
You don't look fine.

254
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,925
I told you we're
not talking about it.

255
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,628
Well, you have kind of
a plague-y look.

256
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,762
Plague-y?

257
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,330
Well, a pre-plague-y look,

258
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,132
but that's how it starts.
I don't have the plague.

259
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,302
Ohh, The plague.
As if there's only one.

260
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,970
Goodnight, Mom.

261
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,406
Okay, okay, okay.
This time I promise:

262
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,208
we will not talk about it.

263
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,143
You won't keep that promise.
How do you know?

264
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,078
Because you've broken it five
times since we started eating.

265
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,147
Well, then tell me!
Tell you what?

266
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,448
Whatever it is!

267
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,586
You're gay.

268
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,421
What?

269
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,423
Aren't you?

270
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,424
I'm not gay.

271
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,624
It's okay if you are.

272
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,092
But I'm not.

273
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,196
Well, you're something.

274
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,198
Something not gay!

275
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,701
The book said you'd say that.

276
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,436
And the book about
having a depressed son

277
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,705
said I would deny being
depressed if confronted,

278
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,074
and so did the one about
having an alcoholic son,

279
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,444
and a cutter, and a
crystal meth addict, and...
Hey.

280
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:17,148
I mean, it makes
the most sense.

281
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,086
And I want you to know that
I am totally okay with it.

282
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,889
Goodnight, Mom.

283
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,062
Walt!

284
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,065
I'm not sick, I'm not gay
and I'm not hungry.

285
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,044
Whatever's going on with you,
you have to talk about it.

286
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,047
If not with me,
then with somebody.

287
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,750
There must be good
therapists out there.

288
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,987
We can find one.

289
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,788
Walt?

290
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,790
Walt!

291
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,191
I'm not dead, Mom.

292
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,127
Just checking.

293
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,844
Karen?

294
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,179
Karen Benjamin?

295
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,080
No.

296
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,448
Oh, my Christ, is that you?

297
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,518
I haven't seen you in so...
Honey, hug!

298
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,688
Oh...
Oh, yeah, we're doin' it!

299
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,823
How are you?
I'm great.

300
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,325
I gotta tell you,

301
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,628
that office was never
the same after you left, mmm-mm.

302
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,996
Oh...
Really.

303
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,497
What have you been doing?

304
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,832
How's little Walter?

305
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,200
Oh, I guess he's not
so little anymore.

306
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,868
Gotta be in college
by now, right?

307
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,705
Yeah, college and...
girlfriend.

308
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,139
I mean, he's great.

309
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,841
We're... we're... we're great.

310
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,242
Oh, that's great!

311
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,479
Umm...

312
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,114
Wow!

313
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,676
Oh, well, you know,
we ran out of eggs.

314
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,545
Hey, Walter.

315
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,480
You want some popcorn?

316
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,048
I made it just for you.

317
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,818
Special.
With extra butter...

318
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,920
and bathroom doorknob feces.

319
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:49,160
Let me know how many eggs
you want for breakfast, Walt.

320
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,663
Wally?

321
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,566
Walter!

322
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,967
Walter.

323
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,473
Walter...

324
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,444
Don't be like that, Walter.

325
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,645
Go away!

326
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,847
That's all I'm trying
to do, buddy, go away.

327
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:10,849
Forever.

328
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,850
Leave me alone!

329
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:12,983
Not a chance.

330
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,385
Wanna snuggle?

331
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,688
Stop!

332
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,626
Stop! You have to stop!
You have...

333
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,567
Are you gone?

334
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,805
Is this destructive
ghost silence,

335
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,740
or "gone forever because you've
realized I can't help you"

336
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:37,875
silence?

337
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,613
Walt?

338
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,183
I'm... I'm fine!
Every... everything's fine.

339
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,785
I can hear you
yelling in there.

340
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,620
You can go away now,
'cause everything's okay,

341
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,182
and I just need to start
getting ready now, so I...

342
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,362
Umm... I have
your clothes ready.

343
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,897
Thank you.

344
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,699
I'll just...

345
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,170
Everything's fine?

346
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,707
Oh, I forgot the battery.
What?

347
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,643
You asked me to get one
with a battery for a backup.

348
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:16,313
Right. Batteries.

349
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,781
It's important to be on time.

350
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,854
Well, everything's fine.

351
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,825
I need to get ready now.
I have a lot to do today, so...

352
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:30,327
Okay.

353
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,064
Does it help?

354
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,201
What?

355
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,470
If something's wrong with you,

356
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,572
if something isn't
making sense...

357
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,776
does it help to talk
to someone about it?

358
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,249
Yes.

359
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,656
I really need to start
getting ready now.

360
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,959
As soon as I'm done
hugging you.

361
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,863
Walter Benjamin.

362
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,632
That's my name, yes.

363
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:48,172
That is your name.
Walter Gary Benjamin.

364
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:52,142
Ohh. You hiding bodies,
Walter Gary Benjamin?

365
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,645
Bodies?

366
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,447
You got a sort of serial killer
kind of name.

367
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,715
Anyone ever tell you that?

368
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:58,949
No.

369
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,884
Of course not, that's
a terrible thing to say!

370
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,153
So, what kind of crazy
are you?

371
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,422
- I'm not crazy.
- Sure.

372
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,257
But since you're here,
might as well pretend

373
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,792
you're not completely
sane and normal

374
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,894
so that I can pretend
to make you less crazy.

375
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,763
You ever been in therapy before?

376
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,699
No.

377
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,404
Your mom said that
after your dad died,

378
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,374
she took you to at least
ten different therapists.

379
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,476
He wasn't my dad.

380
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,644
Who?

381
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,612
I didn't come here
to talk about him.

382
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,347
Well, who'd you come
to talk about?

383
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,816
Greg.
Greg.

384
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,886
He's a ghost.

385
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,821
Greg's a ghost.

386
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,123
Yes.

387
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,124
And that's who you came
to talk about?

388
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,191
Greg, the ghost?

389
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,093
Yeah.

390
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,895
I'm not supposed to see ghosts.

391
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,296
That was never...

392
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,933
There's a plan.

393
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,135
Of course there is.

394
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,836
But I can't really
get into that.

395
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,204
Greg needs to go.

396
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,974
Okay? He's not supposed
to be here, so...

397
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:00,177
there must be something
wrong with me, in my brain?

398
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,979
If you know how to fix this,
I need you to do it

399
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,081
as quickly as possible,
because it's starting to have

400
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,316
a very negative effect
on my work.

401
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,791
Could we go back
to Jim for a second?

402
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,459
I'd rather not.

403
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,328
Well, of course you wouldn't,
but I'm a doctor,

404
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,897
this is my office,
and I'm bigger than you,

405
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,465
so let's do it
my way for a second.

406
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:25,402
Is Jim a ghost too?

407
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,840
If I tell you, you have to
promise not to get angry.

408
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,575
Why would I get angry?

409
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,845
Because you're going to hell.

410
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,719
Tell me something I don't know.

411
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,722
You have the most beautiful
eyes, you should show those.

412
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,657
You should really show those,
they're really nice.

413
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,126
Thank you.

414
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,328
Damn, they'd look really
good for cameras...

415
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,999
That picks it up, and then
when you down the iris scope...

416
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,521
She's beautiful.

417
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,025
Yes, she is.

418
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,261
Gonna talk to her?

419
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:58,695
You don't exist
and I have work to do,

420
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,164
so I'd rather not have
this conversation.

421
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,632
Just say the word,
and I'm gone.

422
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:02,866
Go!

423
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,469
That's not the word
I'm lookin' for.

424
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,838
Mine starts with an "H",
preferably two syllables,

425
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,873
but I'll take what I can get.

426
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,375
Go away!

427
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,943
Talk to her, and I will.

428
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,078
Really?

429
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,780
Not forever, O Chosen One.

430
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,549
You're not getting rid of me
'til you do your job.

431
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,284
But I'll give you
the afternoon off.

432
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,985
And all I have to do
is just... go... just...

433
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,921
Talk to her like
a person would, yeah.

434
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,089
But I don't think
you have the balls.

435
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,958
I've got plenty of...

436
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,359
balls.

437
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,795
Prove it.

438
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,781
Hi. What's going on?

439
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,050
Uhh, maybe if there's
some free time after

440
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,952
all the matinees start, I could
buy you some Junior Mints

441
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,854
or something. But you wouldn't
have to eat them with me,

442
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,923
they... they'd be a gift for you
to enjoy at your own leisure.

443
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,696
Umm, actually... all of us back
here kinda just...

444
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,398
borrow the candy that we want,
for free,

445
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,868
so we don't have
to pay for it. Shh.

446
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,469
I'm right here.

447
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,471
It's fine, he doesn't care.

448
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,672
See ya later.

449
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,774
"Maybe after the
matinees start,

450
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,943
"I could buy you some
Junior Mints or something?"

451
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,379
That was fucking beautiful, bro.
Really, I mean it.

452
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,681
I'm actually... I'm... I'm a
little hard right now,

453
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,650
having just experienced
the joy of watching you do

454
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,385
your thing, man!
That was great!

455
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,287
My mom says that you're supposed
to treat women with respect,

456
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,989
and talk to them about things
that they're interested in.

457
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:32,956
And Kendall sells
Junior Mints...
Oh, God, hey,

458
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,158
I know you're all in love with
her and shit, it's cool.

459
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,695
I get it. But, I should
let you know that, umm,

460
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,565
as your co-worker, and I like
to think as your friend, that...

461
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,668
I'm probably gonna
nail that at some point.

462
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,037
Like, really hard!
Oh yeah, she got a crazy side.

463
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,805
Has some sort of breakdown
or something

464
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,140
at that fancy-ass college

465
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,409
she was going to.
Yeah, plus, I heard

466
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,644
she ain't talked to her dad

467
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,012
since she tried
to go pro as a cutter.

468
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:59,016
You know what I mean?
Yeah. I kinda like that.

469
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,984
Unstable bitches
are the shit, bro.

470
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,987
You know, I don't want
to ruin, you know,

471
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,856
what you and I have,
'cause I like to think that

472
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,458
you and I have like
a<i> Of Mice and Men</i> thing.

473
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,727
You know, I'm George.

474
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,896
Or Lennie. Whichever one
isn't the fuckin' retard,

475
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,798
and I don't wanna
ruin that, you know?

476
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,968
So, for... for your sake,
and for our sake, really,

477
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,771
just try not to picture her
riding my dick.

478
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,940
Even though it's
totally gonna happen.

479
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,141
Yo, Kendall!

480
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,514
You pictured it. Ah, it's cool,
man. You're welcome.

481
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,183
I didn't picture it!

482
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,891
I didn't picture it.

483
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,926
I do.

484
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,332
<i>Most people seem really worried
about being alone.</i>

485
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,801
<i>I guess I can understand
how someone can see life</i>

486
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,203
<i>as random and meaningless.</i>

487
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,938
<i>Even cruel, at times.</i>

488
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,841
<i>So it makes sense
they'd spend most,</i>

489
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,509
<i>if not all of their time,</i>

490
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,378
<i>doing their best to ensure
they don't have to go</i>

491
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,980
<i>through it by themselves.</i>

492
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,753
<i>Safety in numbers, I suppose.</i>

493
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,766
Not sure I understand the rules
of this particular game,

494
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:58,735
but I'm pretty sure
we're both losing.

495
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,670
So, how'd it go
with the girl?

496
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,305
Fine.
You sure about that?

497
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,707
Go away!
Make me.

498
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,108
You know I can't do anything...

499
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,543
We've got a big day
ahead of us, Walter.

500
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,011
Figure we should
get going soon,

501
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,147
so I can get you back
in time for work.

502
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,314
Back?

503
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,583
You do have, like,
adults' clothes, right?

504
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,385
Back from where?
Huh? Field trip.

505
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,787
What?

506
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,056
A Son of God, I would think
a clothing allowance

507
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,524
would be in order.

508
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,526
Why are we... I'm not going
on a field trip with you.

509
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:23,593
You're not even real!

510
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,262
I have a therapist now.

511
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:28,331
Ohh.
Yeah, you know, he's...
gonna fix this, so...

512
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,333
I'm not going anywhere with you,
and even if I did,

513
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,202
I'm not capable of sending you
to Heaven or Hell,

514
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,703
so you're just gonna have
to get help with your problem

515
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,971
from someone else.

516
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,106
Okay?

517
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,874
Huh? Sorry, didn't catch
most of that,

518
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,911
I was too busy suffering from
the weight of ten years

519
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,614
of unrealized post-death
eternity to hear you.

520
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,216
Care to run all
that by me again?

521
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,785
That's the best you got?

522
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,754
I can't wear that.

523
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,093
A church?

524
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:59,096
Stop messin' with your suit,
you look fine.

525
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,197
I do?

526
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,731
No, but we're late.

527
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,535
You never told me how.

528
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,703
How what?

529
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,605
You were able to find me.

530
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,742
Mysterious ways, I guess.

531
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,478
I still don't know
what we're doing here,

532
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,279
and I haven't been inside a
church since Jim's funeral,

533
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,547
and I just... I don't...

534
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,782
the suit's really
uncomfortable!

535
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:19,916
It's making my thighs
all sweaty,

536
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,318
and I don't understand what...

537
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,322
And then we'll go
through your vows.

538
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,424
You've both written them
by now, yes?

539
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,960
We'll have them done
by tomorrow, I promise.

540
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,895
This is weird,
we shouldn't be here.
Not yet.

541
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,931
"Wind Beneath My Wings",
a capella.

542
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,400
Look, we should leave.

543
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,902
Okay, alright,

544
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,203
and then we'll have the
presentation of the rings.

545
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,805
That's your cue.

546
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,440
And, uhh...

547
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,075
Mason.

548
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:46,776
...don't chew gum throughout
the ceremony...

549
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,412
Who's Mason?

550
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,947
My son.

551
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:58,722
Baby girl. Goddamn
beautiful baby girl.

552
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,324
You have a family?

553
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,894
Had. Had, yeah.

554
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,262
Now, to her credit,

555
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:08,064
it took her almost
a decade to re-marry.

556
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,866
All this time,
you've just been...

557
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,468
I don't stalk 'em
or anything.

558
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,937
Anymore. I just keep tabs.

559
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,739
Make sure everyone's okay.

560
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,141
I mean, the new guy's
a little stiff.

561
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,943
Pretty sure he's breathin'.

562
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,946
So...

563
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,748
So what?

564
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,717
Where are they headed?

565
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,252
You... you mean...

566
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,521
I'm assuming that you
judge 'em one by one.

567
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,325
You don't have, like,
an afterlife family plan

568
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,459
or anything, right?

569
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:37,794
Look, this isn't, really...

570
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,329
So, they're gonna be okay?

571
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,291
I...
I mean...

572
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,367
She's not perfect.

573
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,139
But for whatever it's worth,
she doesn't deserve Hell.

574
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,607
And if you even think about
fucking over

575
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,741
either one of my kids...

576
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,377
I can't talk about it.
What?

577
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,746
Other people's judgements
is not for anyone else to know.

578
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,114
Come on.
I can't.

579
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,383
That's my fuckin' family.
Not anymore!

580
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,753
And you're off to start your
life as husband and wife,

581
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,456
happily ever after.
Sound like a game plan?

582
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,657
Thank you!

583
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,226
I'm sorry.
No, that's good.

584
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,994
That's good. It's... you know
you got your rules.

585
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,996
Certainly convenient.

586
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,054
Where are you going?

587
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,656
I'm late for work!

588
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,382
Nothing to worry about, kiddo.

589
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,183
Just some more tests.

590
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,619
Tests for what?

591
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,488
Well... come here.

592
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,823
They wanna know if
I'm really from Mars,

593
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,393
or if I'm just weird.

594
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,994
You should get tested too.

595
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:21,898
You're weird. Are you weird
or just a Martian, Walter?

596
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,302
<i>Jim Benjamin.</i>

597
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,870
<i>Jim Benjamin.</i>

598
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,505
Wish me luck.

599
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,581
Okay, uhh, do you know
the number?

600
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:42,118
Yeah.
I just need you to sign
for that, it's the top form.

601
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,888
And then, uhh,
I'll be back in a bit.

602
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,090
Alright. Sorry!

603
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,192
Thank you.

604
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,258
Oh, man, you're making this shit
too easy on me, Rain Man.

605
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,127
Hey, by the way,
you're late, motherfucker.

606
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,229
What?

607
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,231
Wally!

608
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,965
Wally.

609
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,266
Hello, Kendall.

610
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:34,671
How's your day going...
so far... today?

611
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,406
Umm, it's... it's good.

612
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:39,008
Yes, it's, uhh,
it's good so far.

613
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,477
Good.

614
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:43,446
Hey, tell me to just
shut up if I'm prying,

615
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,515
or anything, but the
past couple days,

616
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,784
you've seemed a little off,
or something.

617
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,387
I'm fine, thank you.

618
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,458
Cool suit you got there.

619
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,593
It's too small.

620
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:59,729
And very uncomfortable
in a variety of places,

621
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,165
and it's making my thighs
continue to sweat even though

622
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,001
I'm now in a very well
air-conditioned building.

623
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,472
I feel weird now.

624
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,408
No, Wally...
Goodbye.

625
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,713
Well, well, well,
you are exactly...

626
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,249
You're late.

627
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:22,352
Which means you have to do
Vince's shit-work.

628
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,053
But I'm the ticket-taker/
ticket-tearer.

629
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:27,323
Sorry, Miho,
I don't make up the...

630
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,526
What is... what are
you wearing?

631
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:30,693
A suit.

632
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,328
I didn't even know
you had other clothes.

633
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,331
It's too small.
Yeah, a little bit.

634
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,125
At least pretend to be
a little rattled.

635
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,527
I'm a ghost, man!
You owe me that much.

636
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,597
I'm working.
Yeah, apparently.

637
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,965
You made me late.
So?

638
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,999
I'm never late.

639
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,402
Hey, I'm sorry, but...

640
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:15,438
What's the Son of God doing
working at a movie theatre?

641
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,807
Shouldn't you be, like,
curing lepers or something?

642
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,943
Miracles were phased out
over a thousand years ago.

643
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:22,078
I'm pretty sure lepers don't
go to the movies very often.

644
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,347
Never answered my question.

645
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,749
The lobby offers constant access
to new people for judgment.

646
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:27,750
Just makes sense to work here.

647
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,152
Bullshit!

648
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,120
There'd be like three times
as many people

649
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,290
at McDonalds or the
fuckin' DMV. Why here?

650
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,792
He used to take me here a lot.

651
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,160
Who?
Jim.

652
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,828
Who's Jim?
Even after he got sick.

653
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,897
"A nice escape from reality,"
he called it.

654
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,432
Walter...
So now I work here.

655
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,501
But instead of doing
my cineplex duties,

656
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:45,969
I'm the trash collector/
trash emptier,

657
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,237
which is the punishment
for being late,

658
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,439
which I only am
because of you,

659
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,839
which... which I don't
even think

660
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,281
you've properly acknowledged.
You miss him?

661
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,180
- They don't miss me.
- I mean, you know.

662
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,948
I have to go back to work.

663
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,783
You know her, don't ya?

664
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:03,019
Who?
Allie.

665
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,754
The way you looked at her,
at the church.

666
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,222
I need to get back inside...
How do you know her?

667
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,957
Just please leave me alone.

668
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,493
I'm not gonna watch her walk
down that aisle, Walter.

669
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,329
It has to be now!
Do your job!

670
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,218
No!

671
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Church? Really?

672
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,688
I know we talked about this.

673
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,624
You let Greg the ghost take you
to a house of worship?!

674
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:42,792
You did that!

675
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,027
Can I just explain...

676
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,362
Hold on, I've gotta
get another lap in

677
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:48,331
before I listen to this.

678
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,800
Oh, my...

679
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:52,402
Alright.

680
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,942
Go.
I just thought that...

681
00:42:58,944 --> 00:42:59,976
It's crazy.

682
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:01,377
What?

683
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,478
It doesn't matter
what you're about to say

684
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,047
if what you're about to say is

685
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,548
you went to church
with a dead guy.

686
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,483
Who we both had agreed
was not an actual dead guy,

687
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:10,520
but the kind of dead guy
only crazy people see!

688
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:11,988
But, you don't...
Crazy!

689
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,923
And I will be completely
honest with you.

690
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,626
You're lookin' a bit off
at the moment.
Off?

691
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:19,729
Not that you were ever
a picture of "on." No...

692
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,031
Should I leave?
Yes.

693
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,666
Really?

694
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:26,903
You didn't have an appointment.
You said I could come in!

695
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,137
Why did you come here?

696
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,672
Because I think that this
is an emergency.

697
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,175
No, no, I mean, why did you
come here initially?

698
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:34,911
I... came here to...

699
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,012
To?

700
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,180
Stop seeing the...

701
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:38,314
To stop seeing
Greg the ghost,

702
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,882
that's why you came here.

703
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:42,585
You knew enough to know that
seeing dead people was crazy.

704
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:43,419
So why,

705
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:46,122
Walter Gary Benjamin,

706
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,024
are you now going on
dates with him?!

707
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,425
He's very persistant!

708
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,396
Leave.
What?

709
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:54,998
Seriously, you gotta go.

710
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,666
But... but... I'm trying...
Crazy.

711
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,701
He... you don't understand.
He seems real.

712
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,970
Crazy.
He's got a family,
and I know they're real.

713
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,605
Straight-up batshit.

714
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:05,308
I'm sorry, Walter, but that's
my professional opinion;

715
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,677
you're beyond fixing. Goodbye.

716
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,153
You know Greg
ain't the problem, right?

717
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,524
I just came here because
I just... I just need...

718
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,092
I know why you think
you came here,

719
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,560
but that doesn't help me,

720
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:26,129
and I doubt it's doing
much for you either.

721
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:28,064
Aren't you supposed to ask me
questions about stuff?

722
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,932
Isn't that how this works?

723
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,734
It's a pretty popular
approach, yeah.

724
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:34,203
What do you think you should
be asking me about?

725
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,339
I got these pages and pages
of notes here,

726
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,709
mostly stuff about Greg.
And try as I might,

727
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,911
with my undeniable
talent and insight,

728
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,448
I can't seem to come up with a
single worthwhile question

729
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,417
out of any of this.

730
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,622
But...

731
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:55,625
There is one question
we touched on briefly

732
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:58,628
that I'm thinking might
merit a second look.

733
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,770
Who's Jim?

734
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,112
I love the movies, Dad...

735
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,617
Come on, Walter.

736
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,334
<i>No one is coming.</i>

737
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:42,271
<i>And we're all gonna starve
to death if we stay up here.</i>

738
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,107
<i>What are you saying?</i>

739
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,911
<i>I'm saying that those things
are still in the house,</i>

740
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,580
<i>and if we stay up here</i>

741
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:54,217
<i>with no food or no water,
we're all gonna die.</i>

742
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,818
<i>First David.</i>

743
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,792
<i>Then Mersp, Centreller.</i>

744
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:04,727
<i>And then Teller.</i>

745
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:07,497
<i>There is no search
and rescue.</i>

746
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,869
<i>We're gonna have to leave.</i>

747
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,872
<i>First, someone's gonna have
to go get it,</i>

748
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:17,106
<i>and bring it around
the other side of...</i>

749
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,208
Hey, Wally.

750
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:25,081
Uhh... how'd you know
it was me?

751
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,415
<i>What about me?</i>

752
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,552
You're always sort of here,
aren't you?

753
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:30,753
<i>Hopefully they'll stay</i>

754
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:32,622
<i>where I can see really well.</i>

755
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:36,325
I guess I love movies.

756
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:40,897
I know. I'm sure
you do, but...

757
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:44,167
it's different
for you, isn't it?

758
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:47,203
<i>I don't know, Taylor,
what if they...</i>

759
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,071
Everything sort of is.

760
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:52,975
<i>You know what happens</i>
<i>if we stay up here.</i>
I'm sorry.

761
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,977
I'm sorry, I'm just...

762
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,383
The crazy thing is,
I really like this movie.

763
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,824
Well, then why are
you crying?

764
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,525
<i>These guys are gonna
be chasing you,</i>

765
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,928
<i>so you'll have
to punch the car...</i>

766
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,963
I don't know.

767
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:21,003
We're all broken, Wally.

768
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,543
But maybe that's okay.

769
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:28,678
<i>You got it?</i>

770
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,279
<i>I got it.</i>

771
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:32,615
<i>Okay, I'm going.</i>

772
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,120
Please go away.

773
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,960
Whatcha prayin' for?

774
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,595
The girl?
It's the girl, right?

775
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,464
Askin' Daddy to pull
a few strings? I like it.

776
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:58,067
I mean, if the Son of God can't
get the girl of his dreams,

777
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:01,737
really, what chance does
true love have in this world?

778
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,540
Why are you doing this?

779
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:09,545
Allie will be someone else's
wife in less than an hour.

780
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,514
Please.
I can't help you.

781
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,115
What if I told you everything?

782
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,951
What?

783
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,688
Like everything.

784
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,657
The stuff that you normally
see when you...

785
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,526
look into someone's
soul or whatever.

786
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,962
I'll just lay it out there.

787
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,797
It doesn't work that way,
and even if it did,

788
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,065
how would I know you were
telling me the truth?

789
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,566
You don't even
have the instincts

790
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,001
to tell if a man's
lying or not?

791
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,235
Ask me anything!

792
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,570
You think I'm bullshitting you
in any way,

793
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,339
I will leave you
alone forever.

794
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,341
I can't really get
into the logistics...
She was gonna leave me.

795
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,710
Why are you telling me this?

796
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:46,549
You might understand this...
unrequited pining thing

797
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:51,053
or whatever you're doing
with Popcorn Girl, but, uhh...

798
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:55,558
to actually have the girl,
to have her love you...

799
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,362
like, start a family together...

800
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,864
to know someone in such a
perfect way, like completely,

801
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:04,700
that's the best, man.

802
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:07,169
That's the best. I had that.

803
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,474
So you think I'm
afraid of Hell?

804
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:14,577
That's Hell. Worse than Hell.
Having that, losing it.

805
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:18,748
Don't need you or God
or anyone else

806
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,983
to explain that to me.

807
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:25,921
So what do you say, Walter?

808
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:28,190
Walter?

809
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,659
Deal with me, you chicken-shit
little bitch...

810
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,828
How'd you die?

811
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,534
What am I supposed...
How did you die?

812
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,615
I mean...

813
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,550
she was my life.

814
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,232
I answer your question,
and you run off.

815
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,567
Poor form, Son of God.

816
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,636
Poor form. What are you doing?

817
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,237
We have to go.

818
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,338
Go where?

819
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,540
Another field trip.

820
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,090
No.

821
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,291
You think it started
already?

822
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,525
What does it matter?

823
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,594
It's not like you're
invited.

824
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,795
Whoa, hey, Walter!

825
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,263
I need to talk to her!
Whoa!

826
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,865
Don't do this, man!

827
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,668
You can't just show up
at her wedding.

828
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,370
Hey, hey, what's the plan here?

829
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,543
Excuse me.
...honourable estate.

830
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,212
Excuse me!
Made by God in Paradise,

831
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,680
into its holy...

832
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:58,682
Excuse me!

833
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,250
Uhh... sorry, sorry.

834
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:02,451
I'm sorry to interrupt.

835
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,620
Son, I'm sorry, this is
a private ceremony.

836
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,455
I need to talk to the...
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave right now.

837
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,824
My name is Walter Gary Benjamin,
I need to talk to the bride!

838
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,392
Really?

839
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:11,827
Wait!

840
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:15,865
It's okay, I know him.

841
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,555
Uhh, Allie...

842
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:44,160
Can you give us a minute?
Please?

843
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:47,463
Just trust me, I...

844
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:48,764
You yell if you need me.

845
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,166
I will.

846
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:58,340
I gotta say, your timing
could use some work.

847
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,076
Do you know why I'm here?

848
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,381
Do you?

849
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,154
You were at the rehearsal too,
weren't you?

850
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:16,959
I couldn't quite place
you then, but...

851
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,698
You look just like him.

852
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:34,810
Are you okay?

853
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,646
No.

854
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:43,252
No, I'm not.

855
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:44,334
Walter.

856
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,863
Walter?

857
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,129
Oh, this smells so good.

858
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,764
Well, you probably won't be able
to keep much down

859
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,399
once you start chemo.

860
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:33,168
I figured you should have a shot
at some real food beforehand.

861
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,373
Last meal, so to speak.

862
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,874
Don't say that.

863
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:47,916
Is it bad... that I love you?

864
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:58,160
I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
No, no, no, no.

865
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,898
It's okay.

866
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:15,077
<i>Doctor Forrest, dial 118,
please.</i>

867
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,080
<i>Doctor Forrest,
please dial 1-1-8.</i>

868
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,790
Mom?

869
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,125
Mom? Mom! Mom!

870
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:39,835
Stop it, stop it.
Stop it! Stop!

871
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,438
Stop!

872
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,573
No, stop, stop!
Walter?

873
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:47,042
Wal... hey, Walter, honey,
take a deep breath.

874
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,845
Are you okay?
I'm calling 911.
No, Darren, he's...

875
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,146
This is crazy!

876
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:52,214
Walter, it's okay, honey.
No, no, no...

877
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:53,515
Okay, look, take a deep breath

878
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,050
and come sit down
for a moment, okay?

879
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,318
She is a nurse, listen to her!
Okay, Darren...

880
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
I should go.

881
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,788
I loved him!

882
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,190
If that matters.

883
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,694
So did I.

884
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,663
And it doesn't.

885
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,109
Hey!

886
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,852
Told you it was a bad idea.

887
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,453
Why didn't you say anything?

888
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:35,057
Look, man, I had my own shit
to figure out here.

889
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,492
How was I supposed
to know about...

890
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,427
Wait, you knew about Jim
and Allie this whole time?

891
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:42,831
Look, I think maybe we should,
uhh, calm down a bit, before...

892
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,200
Answer the question.

893
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,169
Of course I fuckin' knew.

894
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,971
You gonna try
and tell me you didn't?

895
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:51,974
What?

896
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:54,443
I mean, really.

897
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,178
How long do we
keep doing this?

898
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,446
I didn't even know
that she existed

899
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:58,547
until you brought me
over here yourself.

900
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:01,350
We both know nothing happened
that you didn't already know.

901
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:03,952
No, no, no. Everything made
sense until you showed up.

902
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:05,287
Everything made sense

903
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,922
until you started
thinkin' about shit.

904
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:07,924
No, no-no, no-no.

905
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,558
Don't, don't.

906
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,895
Don't!

907
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,496
Hey, man,
why am I still here?

908
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:15,564
Leave me alone!

909
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,099
If you wanted me
to leave you alone,

910
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,102
you would have done your job!
But maybe,

911
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,584
it's not really
your job, after all.

912
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,074
How do you know?

913
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:32,748
Come on.

914
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,150
Really? We're doing that?

915
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,718
Alright.
Leave me alone!

916
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,020
Okay.

917
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:41,023
You know, I did a
little cross-country

918
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,091
in high school.

919
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,460
Plus I'm dead!

920
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:47,496
So I don't have to,
you know, breathe!

921
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,932
You might wanna re-think the
"outrunning me" plan!

922
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,875
Leave me alone!

923
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,267
That worked out well for ya.

924
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,203
Get outta here.

925
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,615
You know, I forgave her.
Allie.

926
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:14,850
A long time ago, actually.

927
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,785
That's the funny thing
about bein' dead:

928
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:20,455
you don't really dwell on the
things that you'd expect to.

929
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:24,626
See, the only thing that
really sticks with you,

930
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:27,729
haunts you even,

931
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,399
is the overwhelming feeling
that you were alive,

932
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:34,469
you fucking existed,
and you wasted it.

933
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:40,609
Ten years is
a long time to waste.

934
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,782
You ready?

935
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,753
You tell me.

936
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:58,073
Walt?

937
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,075
Mom.

938
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:01,343
I heard...

939
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,649
I sent Jim to Hell.

940
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,020
What?

941
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:15,056
I sent Jim to Hell
right after he died,

942
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:17,726
and there's nothing
I can do about it now.

943
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,862
Are you feeling okay?

944
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:22,330
Would you like me
to make you some eggs?

945
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:23,865
I'm not hungry.

946
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,770
Maybe I should make up a batch,

947
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:31,206
just in case your body is so
calorie-deprived you're...

948
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,208
starting to feed
on your organs.

949
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,876
I'm not hungry, Mom.

950
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,244
Now see, that's the thing
about the more advanced

951
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,246
stages of starvation...

952
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:39,848
I'm not fucking hungry!

953
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,357
I sent him to Hell.
Don't you want to know why?

954
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,128
You're not making any sense.

955
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,430
We never talk about it,
but you knew, didn't you?

956
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:01,670
I think you need
some sleep...

957
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:04,673
He broke your heart.
That's what you need.

958
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:07,943
Walt...
He broke your heart,
and I sent him to Hell for it.

959
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:12,113
Walt...
You used to be different.
You used to be happy.

960
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:14,382
You weren't always like...

961
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:16,618
Like what?
Like this!

962
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,789
Your father was a good man!

963
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:23,058
And her husband...
that woman had a husband,

964
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,559
in case you didn't know that,

965
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,928
her husband found out,
and he killed himself,
Walt...

966
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,797
because Jim and Allie cared
more about themselves

967
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,765
than they ever did
about anybody else!

968
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:33,301
Your father made a mistake!

969
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,170
Now, you can't
blame him for that!

970
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:37,572
Jim wasn't my father.

971
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:42,344
Will you stop it?
You stop it, right now!

972
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,479
He wasn't perfect!

973
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:47,449
But he loved us, and you.

974
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:49,784
He loved you more
than anything!

975
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:51,586
More than Allie?

976
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,121
That's enough!

977
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:01,296
Do you wanna know what
broke my heart, Walt?

978
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:02,931
Really?

979
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:05,901
Because it wasn't just him
messing around with some nurse,

980
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:08,737
right after he found out
he was dying.

981
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:12,607
Yeah, that hurt.
And I let him know.

982
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:17,178
But it couldn't erase
a lifetime with him.

983
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,214
Not even close!

984
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,615
And it wasn't even him dying.

985
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:24,219
I had the strength to get us
through losing him.

986
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,722
And you're right,
I was different then.

987
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:30,025
I was strong, Walt!

988
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:32,494
I was strong enough
to watch him die!

989
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:35,697
But it wasn't losing him
that broke me!

990
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,767
It was losing you
that killed me.

991
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:47,242
Now there's eggs on the wall,
and on the floor,

992
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,843
if you're hungry.

993
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,896
Hell, hell.

994
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,898
Hell.

995
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,301
Hell.

996
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:50,472
Hell, hell, hell. Hell.

997
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,555
Theatre 6 down the hall
to your right. Hell.

998
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,593
Theatre 1, down the hall
to your left.

999
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:12,994
Hell.

1000
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,133
Theatre 6, hell.

1001
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:20,068
Hell. Hell.

1002
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:22,871
You're all going to hell!

1003
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,507
- What?
- All of you.

1004
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,945
Okay.

1005
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:00,875
You look like shit.

1006
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:03,645
Forgive me for stating the
obvious, but it's so obvious

1007
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,780
I felt personally and
professionally obligated

1008
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,482
to say something about it.

1009
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:09,517
When's the last time
you slept?

1010
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:10,985
I don't know.

1011
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:13,721
Ate?

1012
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:17,125
Eggs.
I think I had eggs.

1013
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,159
When?

1014
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:20,462
I don't... I don't remember.

1015
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,867
Well, I won't ask
about bathing,

1016
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:28,736
'cause I think I know
the answer to that one.

1017
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,172
How's Greg?

1018
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,211
You know, your ghost friend.

1019
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:38,580
I thought you didn't
wanna talk about Greg.

1020
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:39,781
I don't, but you do, right?

1021
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:42,083
Not anymore.

1022
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:44,519
Well, that's why
we're here, right?

1023
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:45,920
Your ghost problem?

1024
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,723
I'm not crazy.

1025
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,725
Are you sure?

1026
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,362
I don't...

1027
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:59,134
I don't know. I... I...

1028
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,537
You're just supposed to...

1029
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:03,671
What am I supposed to do?

1030
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:05,640
Just stop. Just stop.

1031
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,175
What am I doing, Walter?
You know!

1032
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:10,712
You know! You...
you always know what you...

1033
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:13,148
God, you know exactly what...

1034
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:19,954
I can't... I can't.
I don't know. I don't know.

1035
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:21,356
I don't know. I don't know.

1036
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,760
I had control.

1037
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:33,434
You can sit there,
and you can... and you can

1038
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:35,303
tell me what's real,
and what's crazy,

1039
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:37,305
and what's total bullshit
and you can say that

1040
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:39,140
I'm just some kid who doesn't
know how to function properly

1041
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:43,478
in the world, you can say all
that. Okay? Fine. Fine.

1042
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,848
But I had control.

1043
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,883
I woke up every day
and I went outside,

1044
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,152
and I did something.

1045
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:54,189
I did something. I never...
I never took a personal day,

1046
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:57,458
I never called in sick,
I never made excuses

1047
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,860
for why life is unfair, I...

1048
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:01,796
I... figured out my place.

1049
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:06,834
I see so many people
that are just...

1050
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:10,338
they're just wasting
so much time,

1051
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,774
doing nothing.

1052
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:15,376
And that's crazy.
That's crazy.

1053
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:22,917
They're...

1054
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:26,087
Things can happen. Things can
happen. They can be bad.

1055
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,655
They can be worse than bad.
They... they...

1056
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,158
they can destroy you
if you let them.

1057
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,661
If you even acknowledge them,
they can destroy you,

1058
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:36,064
so I took control
and I made rules,

1059
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,799
and I followed them
without question,

1060
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,867
and I... and I...

1061
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:45,173
I thought... I just thought...
I thought that if I did that,

1062
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:48,076
then nothing...
could tear me apart,

1063
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:50,778
the way... the way that
cancer did with Jim,

1064
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,214
that life did with my mom.

1065
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,899
Sounds crazy?
Does this sound crazy?

1066
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,506
I know this... I know.

1067
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:25,013
I know it sounds crazy,
I know it sounds crazy, I...

1068
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,954
I probably am crazy.

1069
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,492
I just...

1070
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:41,195
I just need you to help me.
I just need you to help me.

1071
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:44,732
That's what I...
I just need...

1072
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,801
I just need you to help me.

1073
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,337
I need help.

1074
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,178
I'm sorry.

1075
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,585
You know how something
really funny

1076
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,221
just pops into your head
at like the worst times?

1077
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:09,424
And the more you try
not to laugh,

1078
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:11,759
the funnier... here I was,
sitting here,

1079
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:13,861
hoping for something
really good,

1080
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:16,664
some legit case-study
crazy shit.

1081
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:21,202
And instead...

1082
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:22,603
...and this is the funny part,

1083
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:26,174
the joke I can't help
but laughing at...

1084
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,376
you're not crazy.

1085
01:12:28,378 --> 01:12:30,011
What do you mean?

1086
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,714
You're fine.
This is okay.

1087
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:34,449
You're not crazy.

1088
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:37,251
You are not crazy.

1089
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:40,054
You just forgot to grieve.

1090
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,999
Time's up.

1091
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:05,046
Hey, Walter...

1092
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,881
I don't mean to put you
on the spot or anything,

1093
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,983
but am I still going to hell?

1094
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,422
I don't know.

1095
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,960
I'll see you next week.

1096
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:37,284
Mom?

1097
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:40,321
Mom?

1098
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,593
How'd you sleep?

1099
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:21,262
Okay.

1100
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:23,164
I hate not making you anything,

1101
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:26,734
but, um, I didn't
want to be late.

1102
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:28,936
Late?

1103
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:32,707
I, um, have an interview...

1104
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,809
for a job.

1105
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:36,844
That's great, Mom.

1106
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,279
Yeah.

1107
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:41,582
Yeah, it is.

1108
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:45,845
Have a nice day
at work, Walt.

1109
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,328
Thank you.

1110
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,058
<i>- My name is

1111

1114

1117
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:22,716
Oh, late again, stupid fuck.
Hey, you keep this up,

1118
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:24,885
you're going to be the permanent
trash bitch around here.

1119
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:25,887
Vince?
