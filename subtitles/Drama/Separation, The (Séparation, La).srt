1
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,939
The things you are saying is not a
sufficient reason for divorce

2
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,602
If you have another reason, tell me
- What other reason?

3
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,626
If he is an addict, beats you, or
doesn't pay the bills

4
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:45,070
No, he's not an addict, he's sane, and
he's a good man

5
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,014
So why do you want a divorce?

6
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:48,953
He doesn't want to come with me...

7
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:53,132
if he tells me he will come then I will
withdraw my request for divorce

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,133
Are you willing to come?
- No, I'm not willing to come.

9
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:58,965
Why aren't you ready?
- You know why

10
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,557
No, I don't know, explain it again

11
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:04,185
Tell her to give me a reason why this
is the time to go overseas

12
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:06,711
Give me a good reason to stay.
- I'll give you a thousand.

13
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:10,161
Just give me one - My father. I can't
abandon him. Do you need more?

14
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,800
But you can abandon your wife?

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,990
When did I abandon my wife? You
dragged me to court

16
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,063
You filed for divorce and dragged me
here and ruined my life

17
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:20,714
When you tell your wife and kid to go,
isn't that abandoning? Your Honor,
isn't that what he said?

18
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,599
Yes, and I'll say it again, when you
say you don't want to live with me

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,393
I'm not going to force you to stay
- Calm down

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,463
You wanted to live with me and now
you don't

21
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:33,316
When you prefer to go overseas
- "Prefer"? We started this together

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,931
Your Honor, after 18 months of work and
money...

23
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,320
... we finally received our visa ...

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,404
6 months have passed and it expires
in 40 days...

25
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,240
why should we lose this opportunity?

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,720
OK, you don't want to lose this
opportunity, give a suggestion

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,910
you know the situation, but you've
dragged me here

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,645
give a suggestion

29
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:53,833
This father that is being used as an
excuse has Alzheimer's

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not making excuses, you told me to
give you a reason

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,511
He has Alzheimer's, he doesn't even
recognize him as his son

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,592
Why are you saying this? What
difference does it make?

33
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:06,478
Does he know that you are his son?

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,144
I know that he is my father!

35
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:11,181
Your daughter's future doesn't matter
to you?

36
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:15,360
Is this argument about our daughter?
Why do you think only you care for her?

37
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,631
- Is it the case that all the children in
this country have no future?

38
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:22,120
I prefer my child not to be raised in
this situation and I have that right

39
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,071
- What situation?

40
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:30,190
- Is it better for her to have a mom and
dad here or no dad overseas?

41
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,675
This is why I am asking him to come
with us

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,949
I can't come, how many times do I need
to repeat myself?

43
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,509
So he can't come, what happens to me?

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,790
- Nothing, just return to living your life

45
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,111
If we could do that I wouldn't file
for divorce

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,871
- He also has to give permission for a
divorce

47
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:53,360
He's willing, he just said he is
- Are you willing?

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,029
If she prefers overseas to her family
then I have no objection, she can go

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,397
Ok, so he has given permission, so
what happens to my daughter?

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,876
- I need information, how old is your
daughter?

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,106
In two weeks she will be 11

52
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,000
- She can't go without her father's
permission

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,997
Her father won't give permission

54
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,894
- That's between you and him

55
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,618
- Please, sir, come and sign this

56
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,886
Your Honor, I have come for you to
solve my problem

57
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:20,156
- Please, ma'am, come and sign this

58
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,993
Where should I sign?
- Sign here

59
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,866
He can take everything, just give me
my daughter

60
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:29,658
I'm entitled to our daughter, she
doesn't want to come with you anyways

61
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:32,550
She doesn't understand
- Why doesn't she understand? She's 11,

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,432
why doesn't she understand?

63
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:37,686
- Please sign here and don't waste the
court's time

64
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,650
No one knows anything but you
- No, you're the one who knows everything

65
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,189
- Don't waste the court's time

66
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:44,770
What's going to happen to me? I only
have 40 days left

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,508
- Ma'am, every small issue doesn't come
to court - What do you mean small issue?

68
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,520
Small issue?

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,017
... my problem isn't small ...

70
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:55,828
... it's about my daughter
- He has rights to your daughter too ...

71
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:58,798
... I'm the judge and I'm telling you
that your issue is small ...

72
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,673
... please sign this and leave

73
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:12,630
THE SEPARATION OF
NADAR AND SIMIN

74
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:44,879
You said second floor
- This is the second floor, sir

75
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,832
So, what's that bottom floor?

76
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:50,028
That's the ground floor, that's the
first floor, and this is the second

77
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:52,691
The price we gave was for two floors

78
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,192
You're going to get your money
- Yeah, but only for two floors

79
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:58,876
I don't understand what you're
talking about

80
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:02,994
This isn't going to work, this is three
floors

81
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,638
Ok, I'll pay for the extra floor, move
so I can get by

82
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,870
Excuse me, ma'am?

83
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,360
Go tell your dad that they're late

84
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,199
Why don't you tell him?

85
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,838
What did I say wrong?
- What was our deal?

86
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,836
But I'm in the middle of studying

87
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:03,205
Dad

88
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,438
Hello.
- Hello.

89
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,154
Do you know the situation here?

90
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,351
we're asking you to look after my
father

91
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:28,520
but there is also some housework

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,280
but the primary responsibility is to
get him his medicine on time

93
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,579
keep the door closed so he doesn't
wander out, keep the window closed

94
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:45,350
I need to leave at 7:30, so you need to
be here at that time

95
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,318
7:30 is too early.

96
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,597
if I want to be on time I will have to
leave at 5:00 or 5:30

97
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,008
I don't know about 8:00

98
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,187
If you can come by 8:00 that is fine

99
00:07:57,307 --> 00:08:01,600
Ring the doorbell and we'll open the
door for you

100
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,468
and I'll put the key here, is that ok?
- Okay

101
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:07,748
How much per month?

102
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,143
$300 per month

103
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:12,114
But that is so little

104
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:14,277
- This is the going price, ask around

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,997
- I live far away, I have to take several
buses

106
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:22,893
This is all I can offer, you decide
what you want to do

107
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:26,064
Give them the books

108
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:27,680
Here's your change

109
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,916
- Tell me by tomorrow because I have
another candidate,

110
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,875
so if you say no I don't lose the other
candidate  - Okay

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,313
Termeh! Your clothes

112
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,758
You're not coming?

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,751
Why are you taking your books?
- I want them.

114
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,874
- All of this for only two weeks?

115
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,351
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

116
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,512
Which setting does she normally use?
- Should I go ask her?

117
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,474
She's not even gone yet and...

118
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,672
Simin, where are you going?
- I'll be back soon

119
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,116
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the corner, I'll be back

120
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,432
I'll come back, Dad

121
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:49,954
I have an appointment.

122
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:52,789
Four.
- Why four?

123
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,151
I think that is it.

124
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:59,275
It's obvious that Mom uses that setting
because the color is worn out

125
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,990
Okay, we'll put it on four then

126
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:06,878
from today we'll put all the settings
to four

127
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,477
She's really going?

128
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,337
She'll be back.
- Termeh!

129
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,915
- Yes?
- Come to your grandfather

130
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,162
Dad

131
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:25,819
Dad

132
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:27,322
Dad

133
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,477
Termeh, honey, go to your room.

134
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,270
Dad, get up, let go of her hand

135
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:39,158
Let go of her hand, get up so I can
take you to the bathroom

136
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:43,332
Get up Dad, come on, get up

137
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:46,030
Where are you taking me?

138
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,237
- To the bathroom then I'll buy you a
newspaper

139
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:52,996
honey, I told you to go to your room,
go on

140
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,990
Where are you taking me?
- Come here

141
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,996
Don't put your hand there.

142
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,110
I'm taking this CD with me

143
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:34,994
Take whatever you want to take
- I'll just take this one

144
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:53,967
good bye

145
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,438
I thought that you also lived there

146
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,876
No, I am staying with my mother for
awhile

147
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,428
It's a bit difficult, it's difficult
this way

148
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,494
Look, I have complete faith in him,

149
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:40,791
don't worry about these things,

150
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:43,470
anyways, he's not even home

151
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,080
when you come in the morning he will be
at work,

152
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,873
and in the afternoon when he comes
back you'll go home

153
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,449
and your daughter will be with you

154
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:56,198
and this way my daughter is not alone,
they will play with each other

155
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:03,453
Give your answer to your sister-in-law

156
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,030
Where are you going?

157
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:26,612
- What is this?

158
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,040
Oxygen.

159
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,752
What is oxygen?

160
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,836
- Move away, you'll wake him up

161
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,117
- I don't hear it

162
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,072
what is it doing?

163
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,049
- Hello.

164
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,720
do you want to go somewhere?

165
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,990
- To buy a newspaper.
- What?

166
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:35,949
- To buy a newspaper

167
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,670
- The newspaper is in your room, come
with me

168
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:41,476
come let me take you to your room

169
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:49,548
I want to take you to your room and
give you something to eat

170
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:59,476
- Mommy ...

171
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,668
he peed his pants

172
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,425
- Sit on the bed

173
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,752
What is this?

174
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,426
Where are you going? Go back inside

175
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:26,157
go inside, close the door and wear
your slippers, everything here is wet

176
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:30,957
He would tell when he had to use the
bathroom

177
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,790
take him to the bathroom

178
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,347
I can't come now, I have a lesson
until 12:00

179
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,056
call my husband, did you call my husband?
Do you have his number?

180
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,949
okay, write it down

181
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,315
the pen is right next to the phone

182
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,876
If I bring you your pants can you put
them on yourself?

183
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:11,878
if I bring your clothes can you change
them yourself?

184
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,108
Simin?
- Are you able to wash yourself?

185
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,888
Can you?
- Simin?

186
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,355
I'm putting your clothes here

187
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:32,653
okay, bathe yourself and put on these
clothes

188
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,349
I'm putting your towel here

189
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,438
do you understand?
- Yes.

190
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,390
Bathe yourself so you're
comfortable

191
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,990
put your pants in that hamper

192
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,836
are you able to?

193
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:04,233
your pants

194
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,842
take your pants off and put on the
ones that I have left you,

195
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,514
the pants, okay?

196
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,591
Simin ...

197
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,337
- Hello, I have a question,

198
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:55,312
I've come to this house to watch over
an old man,

199
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:57,088
I wanted to ask ...

200
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,620
he soiled himself

201
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,221
if I change him is that a sin?

202
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,873
No one is here

203
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,475
he's a 70 or 80 year old man and he
isn't entirely with it

204
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:21,510
The urgency? He's been like this for
half an hour

205
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:23,249
I can?

206
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,973
I won't tell Dad

207
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,671
My sweetheart

208
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,415
- Stand up

209
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:43,029
get up

210
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,647
okay, open your legs, open your legs
a little

211
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:49,318
okay, now you take off your own pants

212
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,515
Card! Card!

213
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,715
Everybody's looking
- Who cares? Let them look

214
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,694
How much?
- $37.50

215
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:25,838
Did you get change?
- He didn't give me any

216
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,276
Did you ask for it?
- Well it's his tip

217
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,627
A tip... Wait a second, sir

218
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:34,311
A tip is when he pumps the gas for you,
go get the change from him

219
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,830
Dad!
- Quick!

220
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,433
Wait, sir, wait

221
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,695
Here you go

222
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,623
Keep it

223
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:04,896
Really?

224
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:22,836
Hello.
- Hello, Termeh.

225
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,029
Hello, ma'am

226
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,999
Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

227
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:31,115
Hurry, honey
- I'll go get my books

228
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,840
bring your test scores too

229
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,176
Are you good, ma'am?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

230
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:36,948
Fine, thank you.

231
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,624
We're sorry we're late

232
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,278
It's all right. How's your wife?

233
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:43,566
Thanks to God, she's well
- I'm here if you need anything

234
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:46,396
Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma'am, how are you?

235
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,279
How are you, Dad?

236
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:51,229
Hello, cutey pie.
- Hello.

237
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:53,238
Here's the newspaper

238
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:59,381
Do you read him the newspaper or does
he read it for you?

239
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,073
My son ...

240
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,484
Ali got married.

241
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,592
Who is Ali?
- Ali.

242
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,450
Yes, Ali is married. Termeh, hurry up

243
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,732
Ma'am, you didn't close the oxygen tight
enough

244
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,796
I did. He must have opened it

245
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,993
- Please close it tighter tomorrow so
that he can't open it

246
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:18,628
I'm sorry, I ...

247
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,596
... I don't think I can come tomorrow

248
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,798
But you said

249
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:26,197
- I did say I would, but it's too far,
I can't

250
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:29,115
- Ma'am, because you accepted I let go of
another candidate

251
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:33,005
It's 4pm, how will I find someone
for tomorrow? -It's too hard

252
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:37,877
It's too hard, it's too hard, I really
can't do it, it's too much to handle

253
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,916
Please come to the other room

254
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:46,388
- Somayeh, where's your bag?
- It's here.

255
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,990
- Maybe you're tired because it is your
first day

256
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:51,306
No.

257
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,633
You were here, you saw how it was

258
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,958
Somayeh, come get your book bag

259
00:22:58,882 --> 00:23:01,235
Could you give me that number

260
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,158
They also do ultrasounds

261
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,967
He was moving around a lot today
- That means it's a boy

262
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,835
He kept kicking my mom's belly

263
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,259
Because he wants to born sooner

264
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:18,159
To play with me.

265
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:25,573
Can you please write it here

266
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,545
Tell him that I sent you

267
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:31,070
His secretary knows me

268
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,791
Is it a man or a woman?
- A woman

269
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,986
but call beforehand

270
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:39,396
You should have told me yesterday.

271
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,240
how am I going to leave this old man
home alone tomorrow?

272
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,239
Termeh, where does your mother put
the tea?  - I do not know.

273
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:49,345
You should have told me that I would
have to clean him

274
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:51,033
Clean what?

275
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,671
In the morning he soiled himself

276
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:00,435
It's not right for me to clean him

277
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,153
If you could just pay me for today and
I will go

278
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:21,994
He always used to ask to go pee

279
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,835
if you call an agency they will send
you a male worker

280
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,943
Ma'am, I can't just trust anyone

281
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:35,219
Here you go, count it

282
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,517
I'm sorry, it's a religious matter

283
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:38,717
It's alright.

284
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,760
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

285
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,155
Good bye
- May God protect you

286
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:52,969
Yes?

287
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:56,551
I wanted to ask if I could give your
phone number to my husband?

288
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,513
and tell him that I got it from the
newspaper

289
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,577
maybe he could come and do this work
for you

290
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:05,606
Describe to him the nature of the work
and if he wants to then he can ...

291
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,997
I don't want to tell him that I know
you ...

292
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,213
I didn't tell him I was coming here
to work

293
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,161
Tell him to call me... just tell him to
come here tonight

294
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,352
It's too late for tonight

295
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:18,511
I'll come tomorrow.

296
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,326
just don't get a replacement

297
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,230
and for the money, whatever you think
is appropriate

298
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,552
That won't be a problem, tell him
to call me and we'll make arrangements

299
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,090
Thank you.
- You're welcome, bye.

300
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,538
And thank you.

301
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,279
Mr Lavasani?

302
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:44,999
Over there, please

303
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,953
Hi, I'm Hodjat...

304
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,854
I called about the job
- How are you?

305
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:09,588
Sorry I'm late
- It's okay

306
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,669
Where did you say you worked previously?

307
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,153
A shoe store

308
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,440
You're not going to have a problem
with cleaning him?  - What?

309
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,317
With cleaning him, he soiled himself
yesterday

310
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:22,031
No, that's okay, it's like my own
father

311
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:25,775
Because you're home together with no one
else there you will have to be vigilant

312
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:27,167
Your wife won't be there?

313
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,198
No, I'm alone for the time being

314
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:35,309
For this job isn't $300 a bit low?

315
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,013
How much did you have in mind?

316
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:40,790
Perhaps $400?
- $400 I definitely can't do

317
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,571
I'll test it out, if you're satisfied
give me a little more

318
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,636
Okay, I'll write down the address

319
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,480
I can even come this afternoon

320
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,520
No, someone is there today, come
tomorrow, and bring an ID.

321
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,315
Like what?
- A picture ID is sufficient.

322
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,950


323
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:03,995


324
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,125


325
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:08,755


326
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:13,120
Door bell?
- Mrs. Raziah - No

327
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,278
Her husband
- Yes.

328
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:21,953
Next, now in Farsi

329
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,558


330
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,927


331
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,855


332
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,072
That's Arabic, not Farsi

333
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,872
My teacher says it is

334
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,057
Don't ever say that to me again

335
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:39,711
What's wrong is wrong, no matter who
says or writes otherwise

336
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:44,949
For "warranty" write...
- If I write anything else she'll deduct points

337
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,932
It's all right, let her deduct points

338
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,391
Write "poshtvaneh"

339
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:51,278
"Poshtvaneh".

340
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,352
Hello.
- Hello

341
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:07,770
Hello.
- Hello.

342
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,039
What happened? Your husband was
supposed to come today.

343
00:28:11,362 --> 00:28:13,117
Sorry, he couldn't make it.

344
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,958
But what about tomorrow?

345
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:17,554
I don't know, if not then I'll come

346
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,990
Is he going to be reliable to come
every day?

347
00:28:20,722 --> 00:28:22,630
No, the poor guy wanted to come

348
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,626
Yesterday some people he owed money came
with the police and took him away

349
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:30,980
Well if he has difficulties and can't
come I need to know in advance

350
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,032
He'll definitely come

351
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,169
I am going to go see those men and beg
them to let him go tonight

352
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:43,289
Please lock the door behind me.
- Okay  - God protect you

353
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:22,729
Hi.

354
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:32,500
Don't step on it, it's dirty

355
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:37,027
Go take the garbage out

356
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:41,278
Are you able to?

357
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,303
- Yes, I can

358
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,195
Now, where am I supposed to get you a clean
shirt?

359
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:07,804
Take off your top!

360
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:10,399
Take it off!

361
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:15,599
Mommy ...

362
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,267
... he's not in his room.

363
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:19,954
What?
- He's not in his room.

364
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,722
Go check the toilet

365
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:44,200
Put your hand here

366
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,319
Stop the ball, okay?

367
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,281
Hit it, hit it!

368
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:50,615
Hit it!

369
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:54,357
Somayeh, cutey pie

370
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,325
- Don't use your hands!
- It's okay

371
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:00,765
Fast, fast!

372
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,163
Good job!

373
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:10,638
Grandpa, whose side are you on?
- He's the referee

374
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:20,522
Did you see that, grandpa?

375
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,116
What's the score?

376
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,269
What happened?

377
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:46,271
What happened?
- Mommy

378
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:57,614
Are you all right?

379
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,513
Where have you been?

380
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,797
This poor old man has been waiting for
half an hour

381
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:21,523
My journey is far

382
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,512
Hello
- Hello

383
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,754
and can you please take the garbage
downstairs

384
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:30,245
They'll leak onto the stairs

385
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:33,552
Yesterday I got dizzy and the bag broke

386
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:35,523
today I'll clean the stairs.
- Okay

387
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:37,678
Enter, come on.

388
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:39,678
Move your hands

389
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,992
Let me close the door

390
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:17,436
Ma'am?
- Is she not there?

391
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,668
What's her daughter's name?
- Somayeh.

392
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,237
Somah... Don't sit there it's wet

393
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,279
Somayeh!

394
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,478
Somayeh!

395
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,951
Ms. Khalani!

396
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,754
Knock on the door

397
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,905
Somayeh! Grandpa!

398
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,554
Ms. Khalani!

399
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:54,134
Yes, hello

400
00:34:54,254 --> 00:34:56,000
Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

401
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,033
Did you see the woman that works at
our house?  - Yes, cleaning the stairs.

402
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:02,435
When?
- A little while ago

403
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:05,438
- Is she not there?
- No, thanks for your help

404
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:08,473
You wait here, I'll get the house key
from the car

405
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,993
What happened?

406
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:24,981
Dad?

407
00:35:25,843 --> 00:35:26,532
Dad?

408
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,123
Dad?

409
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,069
Father

410
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:38,873
Father

411
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:48,746
Grab his feet

412
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:52,238
Dad

413
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:57,634
Dad, get up, look at Termeh.

414
00:35:58,163 --> 00:35:58,872
Dad!

415
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,958
Breathe... Don't be scared, he's
breathing

416
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,590
Does your arm hurt? Help..

417
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,444
Move your arms...

418
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,758
does it hurt?

419
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,704
Okay walk, Dad, come on.

420
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:46,195
Walk Dad, come on we'll go buy the
newspaper, come on

421
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:47,959
Pick up your feet

422
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:54,433
Does your leg hurt? Let me
see what happened to your leg

423
00:36:54,827 --> 00:36:57,475
Who did this to you?

424
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:01,487
I want to see that nothing happened
to your leg

425
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:05,937
If you permit, I want to see...
Honey, you go out

426
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,238
Did something happen to him?
- No, he's okay, you just go

427
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:12,184
She's gone, let me take it off...

428
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:15,194
I want to make sure nothing has
happened to your leg

429
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:19,278
Take them off

430
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,084
How could she?

431
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,492
Honey, did you take money out of the
drawer?  - No

432
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:46,673
Go to the kitchen, sweetie, go

433
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,198
Honey, I told you to go to the kitchen

434
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:55,750
You saw that nothing has happened, go on

435
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:59,314
Go on, sweetie, and close the door.

436
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,319
Hello.

437
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:34,393
Come here.

438
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:37,192
Mom, I'm thirsty

439
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,012
Look over him

440
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,714
Hello

441
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:52,077
Where were you?

442
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:56,719
Something came up, and I had to go
take care of it

443
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,996
- You had no right to go

444
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:02,158
He was sleeping
- So what? That means you just leave?

445
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:06,063
I was gone a short time

446
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:08,720
Short time? You're lying.

447
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,066
When I arrived he was dying

448
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,408
Usually during this time he sleeps

449
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:18,353
So this is what you do every day?
You see he is sleeping and just leave?

450
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:20,261
No, I swear today I was forced to

451
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:22,990
Why did you tie his hands?
- Go outside and wait

452
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,519
This was our arrangement?

453
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:31,274
I had to go, something came up,
I went to take care of it and came back

454
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:32,726
Thanks very much!

455
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,736
Our arrangement was for you to tie up
this old man and take care of your life?

456
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:40,081
What happened? Did something happen?
- Thank you so much

457
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,230
Go, sweetie, go over there...
Look after your grandpa

458
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,437
What were you doing in the back room?

459
00:39:49,863 --> 00:39:51,564
Which room?
- What room?

460
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,477
The same room you took money from

461
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:56,836
Are you saying I went to your room and
took money?

462
00:39:56,956 --> 00:40:00,123
I'm saying... - You say I went to your
room and took money? - You didn't?

463
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:03,973
I swear to Imam Hussain that I didn't
take your money  - Go on, leave

464
00:40:04,093 --> 00:40:07,700
Sir, I'm swearing on Imam Hussain
- Go on, go...

465
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,348
You're saying... I took money, here's
my purse, look in my purse...

466
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:16,287
if I took money it would be in my purse,
take a look

467
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:17,499
Here, take this

468
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,118
Give me my purse, sir.

469
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:26,212
I'm swearing, here is my purse
- Ma'am, what are you doing?

470
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:31,379
I'm swearing, I didn't step one foot
beyond that door way

471
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:34,990
Ma'am, get out
- You're telling me that I... what did I do?

472
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,991
Don't you touch me!

473
00:40:37,111 --> 00:40:39,291
Okay, I won't touch you, you
let yourself out

474
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:42,971
Get out  - I won't leave until you
admit that I am right

475
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,993
Tell me what I've done wrong
- You deserve to be kicked out

476
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,592
What have I done?  - It's because
she is here that I'm not doing anything

477
00:40:49,712 --> 00:40:54,790
Leave! I'm being merciful by kicking you out
- Tell me how he is doing

478
00:40:55,226 --> 00:41:00,411
This is my home and I'm telling you
to leave  - God is disappointed

479
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:03,767
Please leave  - God is disappointed
- Please

480
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:05,674
It's over

481
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,119
Father

482
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,677
Dad, open the door, it's me, I want to
come in

483
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,075
This is you looking after him?

484
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:31,598
Open the door.

485
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,912
Dad, what's blocking the door?
Take a look

486
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:38,773
Open the door!

487
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:41,640
Why are you yelling? He can't understand

488
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,228
When I tell you to watch over him it's
because of this

489
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:47,073
Maybe his leg hurts so he can't get up

490
00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:49,954
Grandpa, grandpa ...

491
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:54,714
Father, open the door.

492
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,958
Open the door, please.

493
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,665
Dad, I'm going to push the door and
come in

494
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,909
The door will hit you, move over

495
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,501
Dad, I'm going to push the door and
come in... Move!

496
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,350
Why do you do this to yourself?

497
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,388
Who told you that you could come in?

498
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:31,280
What happened to him?
- Give me the keys. Get out!

499
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,585
I didn't steal anything from you.
- You're really pissing me off!

500
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:38,829
I did not steal, if I did I wouldn't
be here  - I don't want excuses, leave!

501
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:40,080
Get out!

502
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,647
Give me today's pay

503
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,633
You already took the money in the drawer,
didn't you?

504
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,836
From 5:30 in the morning, with my
daughter... Somayeh

505
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,440
Sir, stop!

506
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,791
Out!
- I swear I didn't steal.

507
00:42:55,712 --> 00:42:56,512
Out!

508
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,072
What happened?

509
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,314
What happened?

510
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:18,268
Sit down.

511
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,999
What happened?

512
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,550
Mom, be careful

513
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,471
Tell them to help with your math

514
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,297
Goodbye, Grandpa and Dad

515
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,910
Daddy, Termeh said good bye

516
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,839
Be careful.

517
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,251
OK.

518
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:03,598
What happened?
- Mom says come in

519
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,064
Tell her Grandpa is in the car and I
can't come

520
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:08,157
She says that it is important

521
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,198
You haven't even divorced and you're
already hard headed

522
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,390
I'm busy

523
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,480
People divorce their wives to be less
busy

524
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,353
Ma'am, the reception is bad

525
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:24,154
Set it to whatever channel it picks up

526
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,470
Come, sit down.
- Thank you, where is Simin?

527
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,870
Hello.
- Hello.

528
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:37,079
Where is Termeh?

529
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:40,880
My dad is in the car and she is with
him  - Bring him in too

530
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,833
No, he's tired, it's time for his nap

531
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,759
What happened?

532
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:49,349
Did you fight with a woman today?

533
00:45:49,854 --> 00:45:52,599
Did she come to you?
- Her sister-in-law called

534
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,439
Shameless!

535
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,701
What did she do?

536
00:45:55,929 --> 00:45:57,885
She tied an old man to the bed

537
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:00,793
She locked the door and left to do her
own thing

538
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:03,724
If I had gotten there 10 minutes later
it would be over

539
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,453
Well, he's alright?
- He had fallen off the bed

540
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:09,200
and I don't know how long he was there

541
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,834
Where did she go?
- I don't know where she went

542
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:14,958
She said you hit her
- That I hit her?

543
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:17,709
Nonsense.
- So why did they take her to the hospital?

544
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,452
Why did they take her to hospital?
- You're asking me?

545
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:28,198
I just pushed her out of the house
- Well her sister-in-law told me everything
she said

546
00:46:28,461 --> 00:46:32,273
What did she say? - If it dies,
the blood is on your hands

547
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:35,758
Those kind of things

548
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:41,556
She didn't say what happened?
- I hung up when she started to curse

549
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,286
That's what happens when you pick random
people off the street to come to your home

550
00:46:47,406 --> 00:46:51,429
Don't blame me, I told you I knew her
sister-in-law but I didn't know her

551
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:53,836
Did she say what hospital?

552
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:00,391
Hello.
- Yes?

553
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:02,194
Please wait.

554
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:05,795
A woman by the name of Razieh was
brought her tonight

555
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:09,077
What's her surname?
- We don't know, but they brought in earlier

556
00:47:09,444 --> 00:47:10,713
Why was she brought in?

557
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,560
They just told us...
- She didn't feel well, so they brought her

558
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,381
I'll call you. Goodbye.

559
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,150
I think her husband's last name is
Samadi

560
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:27,315
Razieh Asnaqi?
- She's about 30 years old, right?

561
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:31,758
They've done surgery and she is in the
recovery room

562
00:47:31,878 --> 00:47:33,716
What type of surgery?

563
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:36,232
She had a miscarriage

564
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,161
How is her health?
- Hello? Wait. Yes, she's okay

565
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:45,353
Does she have any family here?

566
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:47,597
If she does, they'll be down there

567
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:57,510
What did you do to her?

568
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,516
What did I do to her?

569
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,056
Hello.

570
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,344
Hello  - Hello
- Are you well?

571
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:25,935
Thank you

572
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:27,514
Hello ma'am.

573
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,029
How is she?
- Who?

574
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,039
Your wife.

575
00:48:33,187 --> 00:48:35,118
They took her to recovery

576
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:37,587
Do you know her?

577
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,951
I know her

578
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:42,789
Hello
- Hello.

579
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,157
Can we go see her?

580
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:51,904
How do you know her?

581
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:56,516
Your sister introduced her to us to
work in our home

582
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:58,360
Thanks so much for that

583
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:04,040
She was coming to your home to work?
- For a few days

584
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,122
You weren't able to come so she came
in your place for a few days

585
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:09,192
Sit down and eat something

586
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:12,153
Are you saying she was coming to take
care of your dad?

587
00:49:12,273 --> 00:49:13,953
Only a few days...

588
00:49:14,414 --> 00:49:15,794
two or three days.

589
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:19,077
Why didn't you tell me when I saw you
at the bank the other day?

590
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:22,600
I thought she already told you

591
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,639
Why did you come to the hospital?

592
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,595
To see if we could help with anything

593
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,307
Like what?
- To help.

594
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:32,873
We're worried
- She fell?

595
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:35,995
Please come with me and I'll explain

596
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,918
Please let me explain to you

597
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:41,800
I understand your situation.

598
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,644
You killed the child, are you here to
bring it back to life?

599
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:48,237
I'm really sorry. - Being sorry
doesn't bring back her child

600
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,840
Just tell me one thing.

601
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,275
- I said I could come..

602
00:49:59,395 --> 00:50:02,196
why didn't you tell me that day?

603
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,430
It's my wife and child ...

604
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,880
... do you live in that house alone?

605
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,400
Let him go.
- Calm down.

606
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,303
Stop! This is a hospital!
Come on!

607
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:13,839
Stop!

608
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:21,590
Do you have a mental illness? Why did
you come here?

609
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:26,398
Let me see.

610
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,920
You're my sister
- I shouldn't have!

611
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,536
I shouldn't have
- Move your hand, let me see.

612
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:37,124
Come outside

613
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:41,117
Come outside, I want to talk to you

614
00:50:42,516 --> 00:50:45,486
Please, I beg you

615
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:55,234
Do you want me to recline the seat?
- No.

616
00:50:56,861 --> 00:50:59,554
I'll drop you off at home and go get
the others

617
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,361
No.

618
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:05,753
What do you mean, no?

619
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:09,115
You want to go to your parent's house
in this shape?

620
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:13,629
It's done, you're returning home tonight

621
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,993
I don't want to

622
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:29,118
Where are you going?

623
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,870
Leave it here

624
00:52:45,946 --> 00:52:48,276
Have you heard his complaint?
Do you accept it?

625
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,256
The 13th?

626
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:51,248
I feel sad...

627
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:54,524
when I heard I got upset and went to
the hospital

628
00:52:54,644 --> 00:52:56,530
Do you agree you've done this?

629
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:58,700
Is this the medical report?

630
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:04,558
Yes, after we took her to the hospital

631
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,470
Four and a half month old male.
You, explain...

632
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,794
I admit that I lost my temper

633
00:53:10,914 --> 00:53:12,496
What do you mean? Did you push her?

634
00:53:12,616 --> 00:53:16,504
No, I didn't push her, I tried to make
her leave my house

635
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:19,752
Explain properly, the charge is murder

636
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:23,341
It was a four and a half month old baby,
which makes it a person

637
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:26,762
I didn't go towards her

638
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,120
I wanted her to leave so I could close
the door

639
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,920
You didn't push me?
- Ma'am, one second

640
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,550
If I had known she was pregnant I
wouldn't have even made her leave the house

641
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,870
I just wanted to close the door.

642
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,111
Do you accept his description, ma'am?

643
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,108
He didn't push me, he grabbed me and
threw me down the stairs

644
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:47,515
No, I did not throw you

645
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:49,947
I just wanted her to leave the house

646
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:53,272
You throw a pregnant woman out of your
home?   - I didn't know she was pregnant

647
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,874
- Why are you lying?
- I found out at the hospital

648
00:53:57,004 --> 00:54:03,000
Dear Judge, answer like a brother...
can't you tell when a woman is pregnant?

649
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,835
A woman, 4 or 5 months pregnant
- I hardly even saw you

650
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:09,003
When you would arrive I was either at
work or about to leave

651
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:14,309
and when I'd come back, she looked like
this, she had her chador on

652
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:15,987
in this garb, how can you tell?

653
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:18,484
Can you prove that he knew?

654
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:23,580
It would be against what I believe to
hire a pregnant woman for this job

655
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:31,776
Judge, I talked about my pregnancy in
front of him, his daughter, and the tutor

656
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:34,220
they all heard it
- When? I don't remember.

657
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,092
No, of course, you don't remember
- Sir, is this really about whether I knew?

658
00:54:39,212 --> 00:54:41,840
Of course it is, if it is proven that
you knew...

659
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,838
... the court could imprison you from
1 to 3 years

660
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:50,236
Okay?
- What?

661
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:55,240
No, I did not know.
- Get the tutor to come in and testify

662
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,637
Can she come tomorrow?

663
00:54:56,757 --> 00:55:01,825
I don't want to get the school
involved, it will be bad for my daughter

664
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:05,545
You asshole, you killed my son, and
you're saying this is bad for your child?

665
00:55:05,665 --> 00:55:09,059
You think only your child is important?

666
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:10,057
Don't be insulting

667
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:13,393
I'm being insulting? What about him?
He hurt my wife and child...

668
00:55:13,513 --> 00:55:15,760
Be quiet, respect the court

669
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,019
Please, he has a bit of a temper

670
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:19,557
Ma'am, did I force you to...

671
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:22,520
Temper? I should complain about her ...

672
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,472
... that you've gone to work without
telling me

673
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:29,032
- I wanted to help with the bills, he
hasn't worked for months

674
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:35,910
The teacher should come as a witness.
Tell her to come tomorrow.

675
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,381
Dear Judge, I am here today,
I came for one thing.

676
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,432
I've lost my child, but being called
a thief hurt more

677
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,788
- We're thieves?

678
00:55:48,908 --> 00:55:53,318
If we're thieves, would we come and
clean your dad's ass?

679
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:57,783
- Do you have proof that she stole?
- I did not say stole...

680
00:55:57,903 --> 00:56:02,560
... there was money missing from the
drawer

681
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,040
This is why you fought?
- He accused her of theft

682
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,120
Judge, my father is suffering from
Alzheimer's...

683
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,699
This woman, she tied him to the bed and
left...

684
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:14,996
I didn't go to work that day, I came
home early...

685
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,247
I saw his hands tied to the bed.
I thought he was dead.

686
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:22,840
She returned, in the state of mind I
was in...

687
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,456
...I was angry, I told her to leave and
she wouldn't

688
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:31,236
Where should I have gone? He accused
me of theft

689
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,107
If I left without asking for the money
he owed me he would think I stole it

690
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,930
- Sit down... your father is injured?

691
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,320
Yes, he is hurt
- How is he hurt?

692
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,600
Where is the complaint that he was
injured?

693
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,360
Yes, he is hurt.

694
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,951
Where are you going?
- To take care of my child.

695
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:52,756
Come back soon...
close the door.

696
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,320
What took so long?

697
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,335
I don't feel good, you go, I'll
come later.

698
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:42,128
He says you tied up his father and left
the house

699
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,679
What should I say?

700
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:48,357
What do you mean? If he makes a
complaint you could be in trouble

701
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:52,219
Where is Somayeh?
- Over there.

702
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:54,511
You go, I'll bring her

703
00:57:54,631 --> 00:57:55,949
Let's go upstairs

704
00:58:12,386 --> 00:58:13,077
Yes

705
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,368
He was asleep, I locked the door so he
couldn't leave

706
00:58:18,488 --> 00:58:22,799
he himself would lock the door on his
father and leave the key for me

707
00:58:23,162 --> 00:58:25,934
... I saw he did it so...
- They say you tied him to the bed

708
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:32,868
I was afraid he may wake up, get out of
bed, and hurt himself

709
00:58:32,988 --> 00:58:38,372
... I swear to God... I did it...
- But, you neglected your duties

710
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:40,556
- You struck her!
- Quiet!

711
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:42,520
What right did you have to touch my
wife?

712
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,720
Sir, get out.

713
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,947
It's not important to him, but it's
important to me

714
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:49,758
Don't be aggressive.
- Please leave the room.

715
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:53,761
- I want to file a complaint against this woman.

716
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,797
- Write it here...

717
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,736
... take your father to the appointed
doctor and get an injury report.

718
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:02,192
What happened to our complaint?
- Sign this and leave

719
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,346
- You'll need to post bail.

720
00:59:04,466 --> 00:59:06,113
For what?

721
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:10,256
You've been accused of murder, I can't
just let you leave

722
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:13,395
... $40 million

723
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,556
How can I afford that bail money?

724
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:19,764
I live at my father's house, and he
has Alzheimer's.

725
00:59:19,884 --> 00:59:21,479
If you can't then you'll go to jail

726
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:26,390
My father can't bring it here, he
is ill... Don't write it, please...

727
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,080
... please don't do this, I can't go to
jail.

728
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,045
I've left my dad at home in his
condition... I can't go to jail

729
00:59:34,506 --> 00:59:36,392
I can 't go to jail, and I don't
have the money

730
00:59:36,512 --> 00:59:38,314
It's out of my hands, it's the law

731
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:42,039
Wait a minute, your honor, what will I
do about my father?

732
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,840
I've left my dad in his condition at
home behind a locked door...

733
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,713
... and now my daughter... Your Honor,
please wait, stop writing...

734
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,320
- You're wasting your time... Please,
go call...

735
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,953
I can't go to jail, I can't go..

736
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:56,905
.. I'm not going, go on and write..
- Go and fetch a policeman.

737
00:59:57,025 --> 01:00:01,193
For what? Please don't, I beg you,
I beg you...

738
01:00:01,313 --> 01:00:06,312
... please don't do this, my life is
ruined, please stop writing

739
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:08,674
- Don't waste time, please go call

740
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:15,472
Hello Termeh, I've run into some problems,
they're going to keep me here tonight...

741
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:19,480
... don't worry about anything, but
you'll be home alone tonight...

742
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,280
... keep an eye on everything, and take
Grandfather to the bathroom...

743
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,398
... take care of yourself.
I will call tomorrow.

744
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:26,361
Hello.

745
01:00:27,325 --> 01:00:34,977
<radio dialogue>

746
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:44,322
<radio dialogue>

747
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,280
If you hadn't left, Dad wouldn't
be in jail right now

748
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,868
Your father's not in jail because
of me.

749
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:07,203
He struck a pregnant woman.
- It is only because you left...

750
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:10,476
... that she was here
- And how sad he was that I left

751
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:13,154
He knew that you would never leave

752
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:17,995
Did you tell him that?
- No, he knew it.

753
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:21,028
Tell me the truth, did you tell him?

754
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,914
Get your stuff, let's go to Mom's

755
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:33,389
What about Grandpa?
- We'll take him.

756
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,910
I have homework... I'm not going.

757
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,149
I'll leave you alone and you'll be
scared...  - OK.

758
01:01:40,138 --> 01:01:43,332
If you call for me to come back then
I will have a problem

759
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,518
He didn't even say "don't go, don't
do it...

760
01:01:56,771 --> 01:01:59,270
... I won't divorce you"...

761
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:03,070
... as though it was nothing that I
lived with him for 14 years

762
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,633
Father!

763
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,397
What are you doing here?

764
01:02:49,538 --> 01:02:51,239
Why did you come?

765
01:02:52,106 --> 01:02:55,915
Didn't you have an exam today?
- No, tomorrow.

766
01:02:56,951 --> 01:02:58,911
Who are you here with?

767
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,527
Hello.

768
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:09,118
Why didn't you call and tell us you had
gotten into trouble?

769
01:03:09,238 --> 01:03:10,918
I didn't want to impose

770
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,080
Silly man.

771
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,329
Sit down.
- No, we have to take him to a hearing

772
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:21,511
Where is your grandfather?
- In safe hands... don't worry

773
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,669
... they keep saying "my baby,
my baby"...

774
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:29,628
.. as if their 18-year-old son
was stabbed to death.

775
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:31,480
Did you talk to her?

776
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,948
You can't ever to talk the husband, to
her I said, sweetheart, you are young...

777
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:40,195
... next year you can have another child

778
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:43,399
What happened?

779
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,159
I have to get the home valued
- Okay, go.

780
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:47,679
Hello.
- Hello.

781
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:49,875
You stay here, I'll be back
- Okay, go

782
01:03:55,191 --> 01:03:56,759
Thank you.

783
01:03:58,864 --> 01:04:01,624
Hello, Mrs. Lavasani.
- Hi, how are you?

784
01:04:01,744 --> 01:04:03,660
I'm fine, you?
- Sorry to trouble you

785
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,797
No, it's no trouble, I'm glad I ran
into you...

786
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,504
... is what they are saying true?

787
01:04:09,624 --> 01:04:12,557
Unfortunately, he pushed her, she fell
and she lost her child

788
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:14,718
So, what am I supposed to say?

789
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:17,190
I don't know what they will ask you

790
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:20,393
What if they ask me something against
your husband?

791
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,870
I think you should tell the truth

792
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:26,999
Please do not stop there.
- Where was he?

793
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,237
Mr. Lavasani was in the kitchen

794
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:34,017
Did he say anything or react at all?
- If he did, I didn't notice

795
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:38,558
- How did you know she was pregnant?
- I think she told me

796
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,954
You asked, ma'am, why would I
have said anything?

797
01:04:42,891 --> 01:04:46,275
Her daughter was drawing a picture
of a man and a woman

798
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:48,556
"This is my mother and father", she
said.

799
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,552
I said, "honey, your mom isn't that fat"
and she said she had a child in her belly

800
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:54,396
You didn't know she was pregnant from
her appearance?  - No.

801
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:57,508
Why do you lie? You are a woman...

802
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,720
.. you can't tell from someone's looks
that they are pregnant?

803
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,311
Okay, even if I could tell, it does
make a difference for Mr. Lavasani

804
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,787
This woman is his daughter's teacher.
They have colluded to tell the same story

805
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,992
- Why are you being rude to her?
- No one is speaking to you

806
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,598
When could we match our stories?

807
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:18,248
I was here last night.

808
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:20,836
One thing is clear. Right now as we
speak...

809
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,800
... that man could hear what we were
discussing, am I right?

810
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,711
Ma'am, I didn't hear you... my mind was
preoccupied with my own problems

811
01:05:31,656 --> 01:05:34,432
Why would I listen to your conversation?

812
01:05:34,824 --> 01:05:37,860
... should I swear by Allah?
- As if you believe in God!

813
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,240
No, God is just for guys like you.

814
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,396
Let's take a break for a moment

815
01:05:43,971 --> 01:05:45,843
He is a decent man...

816
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:48,879
... I've been tutoring his daughter
for one year...

817
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,960
... he's truly not like that.

818
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,109
Why wouldn't she tell me she was
pregnant? Why did she hide it?

819
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:57,331
If I knew she was pregnant, I wouldn't
hire her

820
01:05:57,451 --> 01:06:01,106
Why did you hire when you knew she
didn't have her husband's permission?

821
01:06:01,226 --> 01:06:03,716
Thank you. You can go, thank you.

822
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,949
Thank you.

823
01:06:08,523 --> 01:06:13,138
"During the age of Sasarian the people
were divided into two classes ...

824
01:06:13,258 --> 01:06:20,310
...the privileged upper class and the
class of the normal people"

825
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,398
"Normal class."

826
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:28,616
- What did they ask?

827
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:32,072
If your father knew that she was
pregnant.

828
01:06:32,554 --> 01:06:35,242
I'm sorry the trouble you had to go
through

829
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:37,580
It's okay, it's no trouble

830
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,637
Honey, what happened to cause your
mom to lose her baby?

831
01:06:41,757 --> 01:06:43,497
Her stomach hurt

832
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:46,449
Why did her stomach hurt?

833
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:49,670
Did your dad fight with her at home?

834
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,628
Why would they have fought?

835
01:06:52,903 --> 01:06:56,715
Maybe he was mad that she was working
in someone's home without telling him

836
01:06:56,835 --> 01:07:00,112
Did he hit your mom?
- My parents don't fight at all.

837
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,049
So, why were your mom and dad fighting
in that picture you drew?

838
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:08,313
You showed me.
- They don't fight anymore.

839
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:12,350
They don't fight any more? Are you sure?

840
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:19,195
Yesterday he said he didn't know
that she was pregnant

841
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:21,731
... now he is saying he didn't even push
her

842
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:24,434
... and you just stand there staring at
me without saying anything

843
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:27,368
Honestly, by God, you didn't push me?
Just tell the truth

844
01:07:27,488 --> 01:07:28,892
Didn't I say...
- Listen, Sir ...

845
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:32,040
... let go of this "I kicked her out of
the house, but didn't push her" line

846
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,067
... how far is it from the door to
the stairs? 2-3 meters?  - Yes

847
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:37,947
So in this distance, what else could
happen?

848
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:39,508
From our house to the hallway...

849
01:07:39,628 --> 01:07:41,160
Look, your Honor ...
- I am talking!

850
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,640
You shouldn't be talking, only answering
- Be quiet!  - Did I interrupt you?

851
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,600
You came here to give...  - Okay, fine
- I have questions you need to answer

852
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,870
I have one question I want answered...

853
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:53,435
... I want to ask him ...
- Ask, ask me

854
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,330
If you've done nothing wrong,
what happened to her?

855
01:07:57,558 --> 01:08:00,753
... why did you come to the hospital?
- As a courtesy

856
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:02,398
So you pushed her out of kindness?

857
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,155
During the fight was anyone else
there?

858
01:08:04,275 --> 01:08:07,836
Yes, their neighbor were there.
- Okay, I'll subpoena her

859
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,840
Your Honor, the neighbor will collude
just like the teacher

860
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,757
From the beginning he has been...

861
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:14,400
Am I lying?

862
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,007
- I decide who is and isn't lying

863
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,207
... be quiet.

864
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:22,399
Sir, his wife, who wants a divorce,
brought him his bail money

865
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,599
My God!

866
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:25,920
Do you have a guarantor?
- What do you mean?

867
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,880
They will need to be a civil servant
or business owner

868
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,480
I have no one, my husband is unemployed
- Why does she need a guarantor?

869
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,354
She's been charged...
- What is she charged with?

870
01:08:34,474 --> 01:08:36,670
According to his complaint ...

871
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,200
He had no right to make a complaint!

872
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,760
She admitted that she tied him up,
locked the door, and left

873
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,110
I explained that..
- Sir, her baby is dead!

874
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,593
Keep your voice down.

875
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,596
Are you not ashamed?
You call yourself a man?

876
01:08:50,716 --> 01:08:52,159
- I said be quiet.

877
01:08:55,115 --> 01:08:58,230
For God's sake listen to us.

878
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:05,880
He distorts everything, he hit my wife
and my son died... What more do you want?

879
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,036
... listen to us poor ones also

880
01:09:08,156 --> 01:09:11,869
I told you if you didn't respect this
court I'd put you in jail for 3 days

881
01:09:12,262 --> 01:09:15,040
I lost everything I have.
Do you think I'm afraid of jail?

882
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,752
... Be afraid of God...

883
01:09:17,727 --> 01:09:19,831
Mr. Azadi, call a deputy to arrest
him

884
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,837
Sir, on the Koran, please don't call

885
01:09:23,314 --> 01:09:25,949
Let them take me.
- Okay, leave, don't make any noise

886
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:29,026
Why should I make noise? I don't talk
and they take away my rights

887
01:09:29,146 --> 01:09:30,520
Get out!

888
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,359
I'm going, Sir

889
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:36,315
Please, let me take my helmet.

890
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,600
Go out
- He'll go, he'll go himself

891
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,234
For 10 years I worked my ass off at
a shoe repairer

892
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,920
... they kicked me out like a dog, I said
the law will give you what you deserve..

893
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:51,195
... I made a complaint that lasted a
year, after that they said you lost, go home

894
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:54,399
This time I won't let that happen

895
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:57,473
Not this time, this time it's different

896
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:59,955
I have nothing to lose, my problem is...

897
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,310
... I can't speak like this man

898
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,232
I lose my temper and I can't speak

899
01:10:04,629 --> 01:10:05,958
- Don't! Go outside!

900
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,272
Hodjat?
- I do not feel good.

901
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,895
Go sit down... Let's go.

902
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,554
What do you want with him?
- We need to take to him.

903
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,153
I want to talk to him

904
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,350
Don't go anywhere

905
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,276
On the Koran, your Honor

906
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,072
Let me talk.

907
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:43,720
Your Honor, his nerves are shot, I swear
to God it's his nerves

908
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,831
We've listened to him for days, but
he won't listen to us

909
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,622
On the Koran, every over day this month
he has been in jail

910
01:10:48,742 --> 01:10:52,922
All his creditors have been after him,
and I've begged them to leave him alone

911
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:56,790
Sir, look, I beg you, your Honor, please
look

912
01:10:57,862 --> 01:11:00,920
Look at this, please look

913
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,418
Sir, can I ask as a favor that you let
him go this one time?

914
01:11:04,538 --> 01:11:08,628
Sir, I swear to God, I'm not lying

915
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,435
Since he's lost his job he has developed
depression, he can't help it

916
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,498
God is my witness

917
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:19,950
Your Honor, please forgive him

918
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,073
Go tell him to find you a guarantor,
quickly

919
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,758
God bless.

920
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:29,247
Do not leave the building.

921
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:32,115
Okay, I will wait until he returns

922
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,958
Will you ask her?

923
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,197
She'll think I'm asking her back because
she brought me bail

924
01:11:41,317 --> 01:11:43,238
Let her think that

925
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,074
Dad ... please, for God's sake...

926
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,199
OK.

927
01:11:50,903 --> 01:11:52,513
Do you promise?

928
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,237
Well, what is your promise going to be?

929
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,959
Dad ...

930
01:12:04,957 --> 01:12:05,677
Yes?

931
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,955
You didn't know Razieh was pregnant?

932
01:12:12,257 --> 01:12:12,892
No.

933
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:18,713
Why?
- Nothing.

934
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,153
So, why did you ask?

935
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:24,443
Last night mom said you knew

936
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:27,474
How would you mother know whether or
not I knew that?

937
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,284
She said that night at the hospital
when you learned Razieh's baby died...

938
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,408
... you didn't say anything

939
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:37,759
You didn't ask, "she had a child?",
you weren't surprised

940
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:42,189
In a case like that wouldn't you ask
if she was pregnant?

941
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:44,872
... but you knew...

942
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,193
Your mother just wants to say bad things
about me

943
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:08,591
Will you tell her?

944
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,875
Sweetie, I can't...

945
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:09,878
Didn't you promise?

946
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:13,673
I'm sorry.

947
01:14:23,037 --> 01:14:26,994
Which step was it?
- This one

948
01:14:27,114 --> 01:14:28,641
This one?
- This step

949
01:14:38,952 --> 01:14:41,720
Dad, go in for a minute, I'll be
right in

950
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:17,188
Are you mad at me?
- No.

951
01:15:20,848 --> 01:15:22,912
Did you go upstairs?

952
01:15:23,164 --> 01:15:25,316
Yes, I went to see Mrs. Kalaniyi.

953
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,615
What did you want with her?

954
01:15:27,735 --> 01:15:31,316
I told her they were coming to question
her tomorrow and to be careful

955
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,591
What does she need to be careful of?

956
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:40,476
Be careful, just to be careful, that
they would question her, that's all

957
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,512
Is there a problem?

958
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,357
As long as she tells the truth why does
she need to be careful?

959
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:56,317
Termeh ...
- Yes?

960
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,686
Come here

961
01:15:57,806 --> 01:16:00,389
I have my homework
- Leave it, come here one minute

962
01:16:01,438 --> 01:16:03,909
Okay, pretend I'm the woman

963
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,680
Is that right? When someone gets pushed
they go straight

964
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:19,434
They don't hit here, then here, then turn
around and hit here and fall there

965
01:16:19,554 --> 01:16:20,693
Right?

966
01:16:20,813 --> 01:16:23,426
If I had pushed her...

967
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:26,961
... she would have either fallen on
these stairs...

968
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:29,607
... or she would fall straight back and
hit here...

969
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:31,730
I mean she couldn't fall here...

970
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:34,236
Pretend you've been pushed, take the
path as if you had

971
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,062
So, how did she fall then?
- I don't know.

972
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:39,662
I'm just saying she didn't get thrown
onto these stairs

973
01:16:39,782 --> 01:16:41,912
Okay, now you come and stand here

974
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:45,172
Why don't you tell them all this?
- Forget them

975
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:47,869
I want you to know. Go on...

976
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,434
Is this the direction he pushed you?
- No, he pushed me downwards

977
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:10,186
Look, this door doesn't permit that...
it's not even possible

978
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:11,582
You can't
- Where did you fall?

979
01:17:11,702 --> 01:17:14,634
On these stairs
- Which step?  - Excuse me

980
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:16,111
I think this one

981
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,158
You think, or you are sure?

982
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:19,898
I'm not sure.

983
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:22,033
Ma'am, is this where you found her?

984
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:26,503
I didn't see her get pushed, but when I
arrived she was at the bottom stair

985
01:17:26,623 --> 01:17:29,918
Why aren't you saying anything? Go show
them how he pushed you

986
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,503
I was ill, I swear to God, I didn't know
what was going on

987
01:17:32,623 --> 01:17:35,080
Look, I'll stand in the place of your
wife at the doorway

988
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,040
... now, please stand here and with all
your strength...

989
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,833
... push me, I'm saying it's not
even possible

990
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:45,208
Of course you won't fall, but she's
a pregnant woman, if just one hand...

991
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,950
Then you come, come here and elect
whoever you want to push you

992
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:50,960
I'm saying it's not possible, excuse
me...

993
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,480
I'm saying if you push from here she
won't fall that way

994
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,478
What step? She says she fell on the
top step

995
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,267
Everyone here says they found her on
that step

996
01:17:59,387 --> 01:18:01,486
Ma'am, did you see where she was pushed
from upstairs?

997
01:18:01,606 --> 01:18:06,152
Yes, I can't see the door from up here,
but I can see the stairwell where she fell

998
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,500
Can you show me from where you saw it?

999
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,772
Perhaps she was dizzy and fell.

1000
01:18:10,892 --> 01:18:14,672
How many times did you go up and down
these stairs? And she was never dizzy

1001
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:18,629
Excuse me, that morning when I saw you
at the top of the stairs

1002
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,110
I asked her why the garbage had spilled
on the stairs...

1003
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:26,304
she said she had gotten dizzy and
dropped the bag, isn't that right?

1004
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:30,515
My daughter took it out
- But, you said that you were dizzy

1005
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,795
Ms. Kalani, weren't the stairs cleaned
that day?

1006
01:18:33,915 --> 01:18:36,600
Maybe the stairs were wet and she
slipped and fell

1007
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,278
You asshole! You pushed her!

1008
01:18:38,398 --> 01:18:39,276
Be respectful!

1009
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,066
I'm not talking back because your
family is here

1010
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:43,600
Eat shit, asshole!
- Don't swear! Take him out

1011
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,306
Go on
- Don't curse

1012
01:18:45,968 --> 01:18:49,317
They may need him tomorrow, they won't
say anything against him

1013
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,240
If you're saying they are lying then
make a complaint

1014
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,880
Are you telling the truth?

1015
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,200
Fuck me, I spent the whole morning here,
and one says she fell here and the other
says she fell there

1016
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,551
Excuse me, please give my daughter her
backpack

1017
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,751
There you go.

1018
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,755
Here you go, you don't want your
drawings?

1019
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:33,074
Honey, don't let this fight with your
parents upset you

1020
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:35,590
Come here, let me put it in your bag

1021
01:19:42,804 --> 01:19:47,193
My mother did not take your money.
- I know.

1022
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,829
That's not the reason I was fighting
with her

1023
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,567
Well then what for?

1024
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:58,559
I was upset because she abandoned my
father and left

1025
01:20:01,325 --> 01:20:03,874
Well, she had gone to the doctor

1026
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,159
Go ahead.

1027
01:20:12,049 --> 01:20:13,236
Be careful of the stairs

1028
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:17,000
As per the order, we will examine him
and write down whatever we see

1029
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,351
Doctor, well you see, he doesn't
speak

1030
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:22,611
- Didn't you say he has Alzheimer's?

1031
01:20:22,731 --> 01:20:26,089
Yes, he has it, but before this he
spoke, he'd say things

1032
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:28,914
- This is a doctor's office, not a court,
prove it there

1033
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:33,719
- He got a bruise?
- Yes, a little one

1034
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:10,199
- What happened?

1035
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:14,277
I'm not sure if his bruising is a result
of falling out of the bed

1036
01:21:30,259 --> 01:21:31,878
Don't run, slow down

1037
01:21:32,575 --> 01:21:35,030
Put down the window, Mom, there
is a fight

1038
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:37,048
- You see this is a girl's school

1039
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:39,560
Hello

1040
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,634
- You are not allowed to stand here

1041
01:21:42,754 --> 01:21:44,982
I have something to say

1042
01:21:45,102 --> 01:21:47,188
If you have a problem, talk to the
police

1043
01:21:47,308 --> 01:21:49,002
I just want to talk to this woman

1044
01:21:49,122 --> 01:21:52,640
I have nothing to say, I don't know
you or that woman's husband

1045
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,406
- So, why did you lie in court?
- What lies?

1046
01:21:55,526 --> 01:21:58,400
- She knows the lie she told.
- Ms. Safaei, call the police.

1047
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,433
<mumbles> - You have a problem with someone else,
what does this woman have to do with it?

1048
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,188
If she has nothing to do with it why
was she talking to my daughter?

1049
01:22:05,308 --> 01:22:06,833
What do I have to do with your
daughter?

1050
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,117
You are a teacher of this country,
are you not ashamed?

1051
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,238
Why did you tell her that her dad hit
her mom and she had a miscarriage?

1052
01:22:13,358 --> 01:22:14,320
When did I say that?

1053
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,094
Aren't you ashamed of looking at the
picture by a 4 year old and telling ...

1054
01:22:18,214 --> 01:22:20,031
... her that her dad hit her mom and
caused the miscarriage?

1055
01:22:20,151 --> 01:22:21,235
That's not what I said

1056
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,636
Why are you saying that I hit my wife
and kids like some kind of animal?

1057
01:22:25,138 --> 01:22:27,676
I swear on this Koran that I am a human
just like you

1058
01:22:32,771 --> 01:22:34,196
- Get up, please

1059
01:22:35,635 --> 01:22:37,870
Ma'am, I have nothing in my life to lose

1060
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,551
Tell your husband not to do anything
that will make me lose my mind

1061
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:43,650
Ma'am, I will
- Go on, sir

1062
01:22:44,466 --> 01:22:46,914
Come on, just go

1063
01:22:47,034 --> 01:22:50,869
I'm unemployed, I will stand at the door
to this school day and night

1064
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,600
Either go to court and tell them you
lied or I will dig deep to uncover your
relationship with her husband

1065
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,880
Shame on you, sir, I've kept my mouth
shut and you...

1066
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,880
- So, why are you protecting him?
- The court asked questions and I told
the truth.

1067
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,353
- You told the truth?
- Yes!

1068
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,120
Put your hand on this Koran and
swear to it.

1069
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,480
Why do you need an oath? Who do you
think you are?

1070
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,511
I'm not afraid, what do you
want me to say?

1071
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,920
You told the court her husband didn't
know my wife was pregnant

1072
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,189
- Yes.
- Swear to that

1073
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,675
I swear on the Koran that on the day I
was at their house...

1074
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:23,516
... her husband did not hear our
conversation because he was in the kitchen

1075
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,754
Is this good, or do you want me to say
something else?

1076
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,548
He's insane

1077
01:23:35,788 --> 01:23:38,553
- Where are you going? Call your
husband, don't go alone

1078
01:23:38,673 --> 01:23:40,660
No, I don't want him to know.

1079
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:43,310
Why are you standing there?

1080
01:23:44,493 --> 01:23:45,755
Hello?

1081
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:52,568
Hello, Mrs. Qahraei.
I left you a message.

1082
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,541
Could you please pick up the phone?

1083
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,558
The woman who was coming to our house
for my father...

1084
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:07,094
... she got the number of a gynecologist
from you?

1085
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:10,376
I wanted to ask you to please give
me that number

1086
01:24:10,853 --> 01:24:14,239
... so I can call him to see if she went
to his office that week ...

1087
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:19,350
... and if she did what the problem was.
I would appreciate it if you could call
me back.

1088
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,358
What do you want to do?

1089
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,671
What?

1090
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,995
You want this fight to continue every
day?

1091
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,474
Why? What happened?

1092
01:24:44,594 --> 01:24:48,235
Today he went to school and embarrassed
our child in front of everyone

1093
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:52,388
What did he say?

1094
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:56,999
He yelled in front of everyone that my
father killed his child

1095
01:24:59,155 --> 01:25:01,111
- How can she go to school any more?

1096
01:25:02,116 --> 01:25:03,992
Do you realize what you are doing?

1097
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,031
What I am doing?

1098
01:25:10,077 --> 01:25:12,834
He is causing problems.
- He has no right.

1099
01:25:14,682 --> 01:25:16,517
Termeh, go to your room.

1100
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,069
If tomorrow he goes to school and kills
you daughter, then what?

1101
01:25:26,139 --> 01:25:29,057
What do you want me to do?
Pack up and move abroad?

1102
01:25:29,177 --> 01:25:32,636
Forget abroad, I'm here trying to talk
to you about...

1103
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,429
... Termeh and this situation you have
created for her.

1104
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:40,919
I created this situation? You have some
nerve to say that to me.

1105
01:25:41,354 --> 01:25:44,412
Who left their spouse and child?
Who asked for a divorce?

1106
01:25:44,532 --> 01:25:47,558
You are the one that said to go
- Yeah, then why are you back?

1107
01:25:47,678 --> 01:25:49,877
I'm not back, I'm here to sort out
my daughter's situation.

1108
01:25:49,997 --> 01:25:50,992
It's sorted

1109
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:54,200
You have two options ...
- Do not threaten me.

1110
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,799
What threat?

1111
01:25:56,392 --> 01:25:58,520
You need to solve your problem with this
guy...

1112
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,920
No, I know how to deal with him
- Didn't you hit her?

1113
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,176
Didn't you throw her down the stairs?
Didn't her child die?

1114
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:05,320
Yes! I killed her child!

1115
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,216
Why are you being so stubborn? Put an
end to all of this

1116
01:26:08,336 --> 01:26:10,560
I am not paying money by force.
- How is it forced?

1117
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,774
Put yourself in their place.

1118
01:26:11,894 --> 01:26:14,919
I'm not responsible for their troubles
- Their child is dead

1119
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:19,756
Yeah, and my dad is handicapped, come
and see. He doesn't speak a word to me

1120
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,798
It's not like he talked a lot before
this

1121
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,880
He spoke few words, but those few words
made me happy

1122
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,680
This doesn't compare to her situation

1123
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,836
And how do you know that I hit her?

1124
01:26:30,287 --> 01:26:32,378
So how did the child die?
- I don't know

1125
01:26:32,942 --> 01:26:36,158
I don't know. For one moment consider...

1126
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,795
... that when she left, her husband did
something to her and she blamed me.

1127
01:26:39,915 --> 01:26:42,680
Her daughter said they went to the
doctor that day

1128
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,983
What was so wrong that she couldn't
wait 2 hours and go in the afternoon?

1129
01:26:46,103 --> 01:26:48,640
Why did she tie this old man to the bed
and leave?

1130
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,228
The doctor said the child's death was
the result of a blow

1131
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,153
A blow? Why does it have to be a blow
from me?

1132
01:26:54,384 --> 01:26:56,995
Not until it is proven to be, will I
let it go

1133
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,096
Okay, I'll take Termeh

1134
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:05,676
Shame on you. All this is going on
and you're using it to pressure me

1135
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,119
I'm worried for Termeh

1136
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:09,807
Termeh wants to live here and she needs
to learn at school

1137
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:12,110
Learn what? How to fight and
antagonize?

1138
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,710
No, learn how not to be a coward
like you.

1139
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:17,292
So that any time someone yells at her
she'll back down

1140
01:27:17,412 --> 01:27:20,101
And he knows who to antagonize and not
to antagonize

1141
01:27:20,353 --> 01:27:22,040
Yes, I am coward.

1142
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:28,115
You know what your problem is? Any time
you're faced with any difficulty...

1143
01:27:28,235 --> 01:27:34,276
... rather than deal with it, you run
away or raise your hands and surrender

1144
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,299
Give me one reason you want to leave
this country.

1145
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,614
You're afraid to stay.

1146
01:27:37,734 --> 01:27:40,926
Sorry, I wasn't here for a week and you
couldn't run the household

1147
01:27:41,046 --> 01:27:43,509
I couldn't, and I'm responsible.

1148
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,112
Let me take Termeh, and you do whatever
you want to do

1149
01:27:50,172 --> 01:27:52,396
Termeh, honey, don't make any decision
on my account

1150
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,751
Go wherever you are comfortable.

1151
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,352
You still don't want to come?

1152
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,836
It's sold for $20,000 rial

1153
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:18,188
If every you use 270kg of flour...

1154
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:24,310
... what is the profit each day?

1155
01:28:24,948 --> 01:28:26,599
How would you solve this?

1156
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:28,958
Did you lie?

1157
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,708
What?

1158
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,632
Are you lying?

1159
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,079
About what?

1160
01:28:38,523 --> 01:28:41,718
That you didn't know the woman was
pregnant?

1161
01:28:43,101 --> 01:28:44,514
Why?

1162
01:28:45,782 --> 01:28:50,397
You said when Ms. Qahraei and Razieh
were talking you didn't hear anything

1163
01:28:50,878 --> 01:28:52,114
Yes.

1164
01:28:52,234 --> 01:28:56,758
So when did you hear Ms. Qahraei gave
Razieh the gynecologist's number?

1165
01:28:57,759 --> 01:29:00,111
Wasn't she told it during the same
conversation?

1166
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:09,755
Okay

1167
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:13,913
So, if you want to calculate...

1168
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:21,676
Yes, I knew.

1169
01:29:22,986 --> 01:29:24,951
Your mother is telling the truth.

1170
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:31,917
When she was talking to you teacher in
the hall I heard it all from the kitchen

1171
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,391
So why did you say you did not know?

1172
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:42,093
Do you know what would have happened if
I said that I knew?

1173
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,438
1 to 3 years in prison.

1174
01:29:48,084 --> 01:29:51,477
And I thought of what would happen
to you...

1175
01:29:52,524 --> 01:29:53,949
... who would you stay with?

1176
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,951
I said I did not know.

1177
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,556
If you knew, why did you push her?

1178
01:30:01,676 --> 01:30:05,190
I knew she was pregnant but at that
moment I didn't know

1179
01:30:05,457 --> 01:30:08,632
I had forgotten. I wasn't paying
attention.

1180
01:30:14,153 --> 01:30:15,896
So, tell them that.

1181
01:30:19,733 --> 01:30:21,520
The law doesn't get it

1182
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:24,757
They'll say either you knew or you
didn't

1183
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,399
Look at me.

1184
01:30:34,093 --> 01:30:36,635
If you want me to, I'll tell them

1185
01:31:27,767 --> 01:31:29,638
Hello.
- Hello.

1186
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:37,343
Didn't I say not to come to the front
of the school?

1187
01:31:56,753 --> 01:31:58,194
Ms. Qahraei!

1188
01:32:08,983 --> 01:32:10,519
What do you want with her?

1189
01:32:10,843 --> 01:32:13,548
Ms. Qahraei, wait ...

1190
01:32:13,668 --> 01:32:17,430
If you can wait one second, I want to
explain something, that's all.

1191
01:32:18,013 --> 01:32:20,398
Please allow me... see... why...

1192
01:32:20,857 --> 01:32:22,474
Father!

1193
01:32:25,278 --> 01:32:27,303
Who is responsible for the safety of my
child?

1194
01:32:27,423 --> 01:32:29,160
I can't take action if there is no
witness

1195
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,955
If I have no witness I just wait until
he kills my child?

1196
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,834
- How do I know you're telling the truth?
- What reason do I have to lie?

1197
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,480
Your Honor, I bring my wife and daughter
here to lie to you?

1198
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,432
Your daughter is here now?
- Yes, outside, call her in, ask her.

1199
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,389
I am afraid to take her to school.
I'm afraid to leave my father at home.

1200
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,155
Is the plaintiff here?  - I can't leave
my dad at home.  - Are you done writing?

1201
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,915
Almost done

1202
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,477
You didn't know his wife was pregnant?

1203
01:32:58,597 --> 01:32:59,835
No, I didn't know.

1204
01:32:59,955 --> 01:33:03,310
When she was talking to the teacher
about the pregnancy you didn't overhear?

1205
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,706
No, I did not hear

1206
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,200
You didn't hear, huh?

1207
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,737
I'm saying I didn't hear them...

1208
01:33:09,966 --> 01:33:12,642
The teacher came and withdrew her
statement.

1209
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,148
- She says you knew

1210
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,141
- She came and said that I knew?
- Yes, she came in yesterday

1211
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:19,112
He went to the school and threatened her

1212
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,840
No, answer my question, did you hear
them talking?

1213
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,729
No I didn't.  - How did you know she
gave her the doctor's number?

1214
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,076
My daughter told me
- What did she say?

1215
01:33:27,196 --> 01:33:30,637
That she got the number from the teacher

1216
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,637
Tell your daughter to come in

1217
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,273
Now?

1218
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,599
You wait outside

1219
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,914
What question?

1220
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,918
What does he want to ask?

1221
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,797
I do not know. Here, give it to me.

1222
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,632
- What is your statement?

1223
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,792
You haven't asked anything.

1224
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,749
Did your father tell you what I would
ask while outside?

1225
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,520
No.
- Which grade are you?

1226
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,834
Sixth

1227
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,559
On the day your teacher was at your
house and was talking to the care giver...

1228
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,235
... about being pregnant, were you there?

1229
01:34:17,749 --> 01:34:21,276
At that time? No, I had gone to get my
books.

1230
01:34:21,652 --> 01:34:25,395
So, how did you know your teacher gave
the number to that woman?

1231
01:34:27,212 --> 01:34:30,680
She gave her the number after, when the
care giver was leaving

1232
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,439
In front of you?
- Yes.

1233
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,280
Why didn't you tell your father earlier?

1234
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,212
What?

1235
01:34:36,332 --> 01:34:39,637
That the woman got the doctor's number
from your teacher

1236
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,590
I didn't think it would be important to
my dad.

1237
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,152
So did you tell your dad, or did he hear
it himself?

1238
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,513
About the doctor's number? I told him.

1239
01:34:53,097 --> 01:34:55,071
You told him?
- Yes.

1240
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,839
Okay, go

1241
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,996
What crime have I committed?
- Nothing. You're right.

1242
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,440
Your husband does not accept
responsibility.

1243
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,812
I accept he is responsible, but to what
end?

1244
01:35:55,932 --> 01:35:58,120
To spend one year, two years in court...

1245
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,200
... so that you get 100,000 toman a
month?

1246
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,300
This is what saddens me, why do you
think I'm going to court for money?

1247
01:36:04,568 --> 01:36:05,815
When did I say that?

1248
01:36:05,935 --> 01:36:08,276
You think I'm a bum and my child has
died...

1249
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:12,027
... and we don't understand anything.
- No, I didn't say that

1250
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:14,133
- Wait, let's see what she has to say

1251
01:36:14,253 --> 01:36:18,115
This is not the way to go... All of this
won't bring back your child...

1252
01:36:18,235 --> 01:36:20,039
... and my husband won't be killed

1253
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,240
Her husband didn't' do it intentionally.

1254
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,193
- They are good people, they are trying
to find a solution

1255
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,711
Take the money and put it to good use

1256
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,750
Let's come to an agreement right now.
Leave convincing my husband to me.

1257
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:40,031
He needs convincing? Leave us alone...

1258
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,240
They're trying to make peace...

1259
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,318
... take a look at yourself.
- Sir, please don't let him go

1260
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,194
Wait a minute, I want to talk to you.

1261
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,110
Hello.
- Hello.

1262
01:37:41,652 --> 01:37:43,153
Will you stay?

1263
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,531
Mom...

1264
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,237
Let us have our talk

1265
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,390
Come, sit down, I want to talk to you.

1266
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,319
I'm listening

1267
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,237
Today I went to talk with her husband.

1268
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,274
Sit down.

1269
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,221
I talked to him and after negotiating, I
got him to agree to $15 million rather
than $40 million

1270
01:38:30,341 --> 01:38:32,851
Three checks of $5 million

1271
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,995
How dare you promise him the money?

1272
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,508
I can't constantly stress about my child's
safety.  - You don't understand what I'm
saying

1273
01:38:39,628 --> 01:38:42,152
Even now because you were late I was
dying of worry

1274
01:38:42,272 --> 01:38:45,040
I'm saying why are you butting in?

1275
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:47,836
I didn't come here to fight

1276
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:50,000
God, why can't she understand?

1277
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:53,432
Aren't you saying I'm at fault? Aren't
you saying that I introduced you to her?

1278
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,711
Aren't you saying none of this would
happen if I had not left?

1279
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,160
So let me fix it

1280
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:01,920
But if I tell him I'll pay, I'm
admitting responsibility

1281
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,518
He agreed to it.
- He's not going to leave us alone.

1282
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:07,560
You think he'll leave us alone if you
don't pay? - Why should I pay him?

1283
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,999
Pretend it's my dowry.

1284
01:39:09,448 --> 01:39:14,720
If I need to beg for it, or borrow it,
you'll get your dowry back

1285
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,631
But as for the money for him, I neither
have it, nor will I give it

1286
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:20,997
Our child is in puberty, she's already
suffering because of that

1287
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:26,673
So you understand the sensitivity of our
daughter during puberty?

1288
01:39:27,814 --> 01:39:29,599
If she was suffering she wouldn't stay

1289
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:32,236
Why do you think she is staying
with you?

1290
01:39:32,585 --> 01:39:34,552
She chose you?

1291
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,990
She stayed with you so we don't divorce

1292
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:42,195
She knows I won't go anywhere without
her.

1293
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,759
She is suffering, but she is hiding it.

1294
01:39:51,022 --> 01:39:55,863
You'll call him now and tell him your
husband won't pay until fault is proven.

1295
01:39:56,443 --> 01:39:58,119
I'll sell my car.

1296
01:39:58,884 --> 01:40:02,277
I don't want you to sell your car for me
- It's not for you

1297
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,760
If your child is not valuable enough...

1298
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,633
What bullshit are you talking? This
isn't about money.

1299
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,036
Until the safety of my child is secured,
I can't let this go.

1300
01:40:11,156 --> 01:40:13,469
You no longer have a right to do
anything

1301
01:40:13,717 --> 01:40:15,069
Do you understand?

1302
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,233
If I had done nothing, you'd be in jail
right now.

1303
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,971
Make an appointment with the court and
request the bail money back.

1304
01:40:25,091 --> 01:40:28,455
I don't want to be out of prison because
of your bail money

1305
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,198
Get up, Termeh.
Get up, let's go.

1306
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,912
Get up, I tell you.

1307
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,792
Mother, please.

1308
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,793
I don't want to stay here any more.
- No, Mom, I won't let you.

1309
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,679
$15 million is worth more to you, you
put your child in the middle of this

1310
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,478
I will not let you do it.

1311
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,149
When you don't value your child
enough to...

1312
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,316
Mom, what are you doing?
- When you see your child's life...

1313
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,754
You said you would stay.

1314
01:41:08,874 --> 01:41:11,519
I was stupid to say that.
- Mom, please!

1315
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:14,534
- For the love of God, please
- I'm waiting for you in the car.

1316
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:28,955
It's okay, go for a few days until the
end of exams.

1317
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:31,836
Your grandma and grandpa are there too

1318
01:41:32,112 --> 01:41:35,676
You'll be more comfortable
- Didn't you say it wasn't serious?

1319
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:38,233
It became serious

1320
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,113
Termeh ...

1321
01:41:41,691 --> 01:41:43,392
Honey ...

1322
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:46,720
If you cry, honey, I'll cry.

1323
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,527
Why won't you pay him the money so that
Mom will come back?

1324
01:41:49,647 --> 01:41:51,948
Mom coming back has nothing to do with
this money, honey.

1325
01:41:52,068 --> 01:41:56,685
Yes, she was going to stay, I saw the
luggage in the car.

1326
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:38,628
If you think I'm guilty, go get your
mom and tell her to come in

1327
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:41,553
We'll call them and arrange to go and
give them the money

1328
01:43:55,165 --> 01:43:56,457
I have doubts.

1329
01:43:56,724 --> 01:43:58,678
Didn't he throw you?

1330
01:43:58,972 --> 01:43:59,715
Yes.

1331
01:44:00,967 --> 01:44:03,469
When you went home, did something
happen?

1332
01:44:04,398 --> 01:44:06,875
No, even before my child was not moving.

1333
01:44:07,828 --> 01:44:09,633
Before he threw you?

1334
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,429
You mean the child died before?

1335
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,073
I do not know. Maybe.
- Had something happened before?

1336
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,887
I'm not sure, but I had pain the
previous night.

1337
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,875
Have you ever had a miscarriage before?
- No.

1338
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,637
I was hit by a car.

1339
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:47,717
Your father-in-law went into the street.
I put on my chador and went after him.

1340
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,720
He was trying to cross the street and I
ran to get him...

1341
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,832
... so a car wouldn't hit him, but a
car hit me.

1342
01:44:56,438 --> 01:44:58,193
That night the pain began.

1343
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,116
Does your husband know about this?

1344
01:45:04,864 --> 01:45:07,549
Why didn't you say this in court?

1345
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,954
My husband would kill himself if he
found out I came here and told you this.

1346
01:45:14,457 --> 01:45:19,588
He's been crying since he pledged the
money to his creditors yesterday

1347
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,670
What fault does my husband have? Do you
know how much this damaged our lives?

1348
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,393
That's my fault.

1349
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,722
Yesterday when he told me that you
promised him the money...

1350
01:45:34,842 --> 01:45:38,232
... I got very scared and I called a few
places and asked...

1351
01:45:38,895 --> 01:45:42,437
They said if you have any doubts it is a
sin to accept the money.

1352
01:45:43,038 --> 01:45:46,082
If we don't pay this money then we will
have to prove my husband is innocent.

1353
01:45:46,202 --> 01:45:49,477
You promised not to repeat what I just
told you

1354
01:45:49,597 --> 01:45:52,120
But your husband will not leave us
alone...

1355
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,542
I fear for my child.

1356
01:45:53,662 --> 01:45:57,754
I'm afraid if sinful money comes into my
house that something will happen to her

1357
01:45:58,175 --> 01:46:00,118
What do you want from me?

1358
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,072
Don't pay the money.

1359
01:46:04,309 --> 01:46:05,749
Don't pay.

1360
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,751
Will your husband leave us alone,
though?

1361
01:46:46,731 --> 01:46:49,553
Give that to me, bring some small
plates.

1362
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,796
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

1363
01:47:12,797 --> 01:47:18,633
When you withdraw your complaint from
the court we will give you the 3 checks.

1364
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:20,326
God bless.

1365
01:47:20,594 --> 01:47:24,793
Get a pen and paper, let's write all of
this down and sign it

1366
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:27,630
I have one thing to say before...

1367
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,563
Let's just finish this

1368
01:47:29,683 --> 01:47:37,850
I just want his wife and my daughter to
come in, I have something to say...

1369
01:47:40,448 --> 01:47:42,153
Why won't she come?

1370
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,234
Thank you.

1371
01:47:46,215 --> 01:47:48,510
Please, call my daughter also.

1372
01:47:51,906 --> 01:47:53,957
Termeh, your father is calling for you.

1373
01:47:59,108 --> 01:47:59,880
Hello

1374
01:48:05,242 --> 01:48:08,026
Termeh, come and sit here.

1375
01:48:14,276 --> 01:48:15,756
Excuse me

1376
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,705
Look ...

1377
01:48:19,054 --> 01:48:22,636
I wrote checks and will give them to
you, no issues.

1378
01:48:22,954 --> 01:48:24,269
It's done

1379
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:26,592
I have one favor to ask, if I may.

1380
01:48:27,202 --> 01:48:29,476
Ma'am, you're a religious woman

1381
01:48:30,698 --> 01:48:34,396
Bring a Koran and swear that I caused
your miscarriage.

1382
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,311
Bring a Koran

1383
01:48:44,765 --> 01:48:46,274
Can you go grab it?

1384
01:49:02,754 --> 01:49:05,155
Come back soon, or they will start to
doubt...

1385
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:11,151
Creditors are here for the money.
Don't ruin his reputation.

1386
01:49:13,175 --> 01:49:14,631
I will not swear

1387
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:19,557
Didn't you say you went after his father
and were hit by a car?

1388
01:49:21,596 --> 01:49:25,632
Why won't you come?
- I'm afraid to swear to it.

1389
01:49:27,035 --> 01:49:31,092
Why?
- I have doubts

1390
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,317
God ...

1391
01:49:40,276 --> 01:49:42,512
Azam, go and sit down with them.

1392
01:49:45,303 --> 01:49:48,892
Why are you telling me this now?

1393
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:51,991
I swear I told Azam

1394
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:55,549
Tell me exactly what happened

1395
01:49:58,969 --> 01:50:02,072
The day before the miscarriage I was
hit by a car...

1396
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,874
... and that night I had a lot of pain.

1397
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,080
- Let's go, it's already settled.
- No.

1398
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,840
It is a sin. I asked.

1399
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,000
He's agreed to pay it, let's go.

1400
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,880
I'm scared, God will curse us.

1401
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,276
What have you done? Look at me...

1402
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:32,120
... think of my situation, show some
mercy

1403
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:35,688
I'm afraid something will happen to our
child if we go through with this.

1404
01:50:36,118 --> 01:50:37,711
- Let's go.
- I can't.

1405
01:50:37,939 --> 01:50:40,535
- Let's go.
- I can't.

1406
01:50:40,891 --> 01:50:44,875
I can't, oh God, I can't

1407
01:50:46,698 --> 01:50:49,861
Don't hit me, don't hit me

1408
01:51:08,695 --> 01:51:12,811
Ma'am, why did you come here tonight?
Didn't I tell you not to?

1409
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:15,310
Didn't I say the money is sinful and we
didn't want it?

1410
01:51:15,537 --> 01:51:17,995
How am I supposed to live here now?

1411
01:51:18,979 --> 01:51:21,510
Why have you done this to me?

1412
01:52:45,169 --> 01:52:46,635
Come on.

1413
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,158
Come on, let's go.

1414
01:53:06,938 --> 01:53:09,760
Hello.
- Hello. Come in..

1415
01:53:19,123 --> 01:53:21,351
Yes, so what is the decision?

1416
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:26,592
Okay, your mom and dad have left it up
to you to decide where to live after
the divorce

1417
01:53:26,712 --> 01:53:29,837
Do you want to be with your dad or your
mom?

1418
01:53:30,585 --> 01:53:32,836
- Have you made your decision?
- Yes.

1419
01:53:33,716 --> 01:53:35,272
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1420
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:48,399
- Have you made up your mind, or not?
- Yes.

1421
01:53:50,879 --> 01:53:52,598
- So what is it, my dear?

1422
01:53:54,099 --> 01:53:56,191
Do I have to say it now?

1423
01:53:57,121 --> 01:53:59,675
- If you still haven't...
- No, I have thought about it...

1424
01:54:04,231 --> 01:54:06,471
- If you haven't decided
- No, I have

1425
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:07,398
And?

1426
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:12,010
Do you want them to wait outside if
it's too hard?

1427
01:54:12,952 --> 01:54:14,713
Is that okay?

1428
01:54:15,277 --> 01:54:17,118
Sir, wait outside for a minute.

1429
01:54:19,503 --> 01:54:21,669
You too, ma'am.
