00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,437
Uncle!

17
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,482
You took long enough!

18
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,526
There were bandits...

19
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,862
How come they didn't kill you?

20
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,577
How much money is there?

21
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,036
Count it yourself.

22
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,126
Hey, boy!

23
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,047
Tianqing, you're back!

24
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,430
Don't bother to come back
tomorrow.

25
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:49,479
With only that boy for help,
I turned down many orders.

26
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,985
The horse looks much thinner.

27
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,622
Go, now. We start work early
in the morning.

28
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,793
What took you so long?

29
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,546
I was doing all your work.

30
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,050
I did my best,
but those bandits...

31
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,638
Look at my hands...
They're as black as coal.

32
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,475
For all that work your uncle
paid me only two dollars.

33
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,684
The miser!

34
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,943
Your uncle bought himself
another wife. Did you see her?

35
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,237
I just saw the
wedding decorations.

36
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,782
Her name is Ju Dou.

37
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,663
A good-looker...and expensive.

38
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,499
Your uncle is cheap.

39
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,712
Did you know he tortured your
first two aunts to death?

40
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,715
They didn't give him
any children.

41
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,426
It served him right.

42
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,727
Listen how your new aunt...
screams at night.

43
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,537
I'll kill you!

44
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,497
Let me rest a while.

45
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,043
Let you rest?

46
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:42,217
You'll never make an heir
for the Yang family!

47
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,262
You're not good for nothing!

48
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,795
Go, call your aunt.

49
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,988
Aunt...

50
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,034
My uncle wants you
to come downstairs.

51
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,081
You realize what time it is,
dear lady?

52
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,293
You're very late.

53
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,506
I didn't buy a freeloader!

54
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,930
Hey...Master Yang!

55
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,431
Master Yang!

56
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,393
Master Liu wants these
in a hurry.

57
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,730
He wants two in bright red,
and...

58
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,608
...five in golden yellow.

59
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,026
Sure.

60
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,571
26 pounds, 7 ounces.

61
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,367
Master Yang...

62
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,245
...with so much work...

63
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,163
...why not hire someone?

64
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,416
That would add to my expenses.

65
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,418
Tianqing is enough.

66
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,420
Tianqing is in his forties.

67
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,297
He ought to get married.

68
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,553
That would be one more
mouth to feed.

69
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,805
It might help you.

70
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,560
We'll wait and see.

71
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,603
She wouldn't cost much.

72
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,024
Tianqing is almost
like a son.

73
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,985
A son? Bullshit!

74
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,696
He doesn't have my blood.

75
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,367
That orphan wouldn't have
survived if I hadn't adopted him...

76
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,494
...after his parents died.

77
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,997
My son wouldn't be
as dumb as he is.

78
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,546
Careful, huh!

79
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,383
If you ruin that,
you'd better watch out!

80
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:15,801
Tianqing...

81
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,097
Don't waste any pigment
while you measure it.

82
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:50,794
I bought you, now obey me.

83
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,884
When I buy an animal,
I treat it as I wish.

84
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,137
And you're no better
than an animal.

85
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,943
You love that, eh?

86
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,804
Obey me. Give me a son,
and I'll be your slave.

87
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,557
Otherwise, watch out!

88
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,452
Tianqing!

89
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,623
What are you doing?

90
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,166
Hurry up!

91
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,751
I'm coming.

92
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,256
It's already very late.

93
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,007
I'm coming!

94
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:01,842
Hurry!

95
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,338
All you're learned
is how to be lazy.

96
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,842
You could at least answer.

97
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:39,481
These are delicate dye jobs.
Ask for higher prices.

98
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,986
Learn how to bargain.

99
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,405
Don't sell at a loss.

100
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,949
Choose inexpensive inns.

101
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,660
Don't spend more
than you earn.

102
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,662
I'll go to the stable.

103
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,709
Jinshan, you bought lanterns?

104
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,503
Go, make children...

105
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,922
It brings good luck.

106
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,224
You've come back?

107
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,065
Aunt... what happened
to your face?

108
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,070
I was careless
and fell down.

109
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,452
Your uncle is killing the pig.

110
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,790
It's an offering for
the Moon Festival.

111
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,966
Aunt...

112
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,509
You've hurt your arm?

113
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:38,058
Yes, when I fell down.
I'm so clumsy.

114
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,772
Let's go home.

115
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,817
You're so skinny.

116
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,361
Tonight we'll eat pork.

117
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:59,162
Listen to the pig
screaming for its life!

118
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,327
Are you satisfied?

119
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,454
I can't stand it any more!

120
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,209
Who's there?

121
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,419
Who?

122
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,006
It's me.

123
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,799
It's you, Tianqing?

124
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,593
Yes.

125
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,553
Did you feed the horse?

126
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,180
Yes.

127
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,434
Is my aunt sick?

128
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:03,769
It's nothing.

129
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,440
It's a little indigestion...
something she ate.

130
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,193
Is it serious?

131
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,112
I'll go get Li, the healer.

132
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,447
It's not necessary.

133
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,492
She's already feeling better.

134
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,495
I'll go to bed.

135
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,414
What was that noise?

136
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,500
It scared me.

137
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,129
It was too dark.

138
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,924
Who knows?

139
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,874
Aunt...

140
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,210
What's wrong?

141
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,756
Tianqing, I want to tell you...

142
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:11,094
Your uncle will kill me sooner
or later. I can't go on.

143
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:18,519
Let him kill me. Don't stop him.
I don't want to live any more.

144
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,856
He does have a bad temper.

145
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,401
He's not human.
He's not a man.

146
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,785
Tianqing, I'll tell you
the truth.

147
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:40,040
The old man's sick. He can't do it!
All he does is torture me.

148
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,460
I really can't go on.

149
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,006
I can't take it any more.

150
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,735
Did you feed him
during the trip?

151
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,322
Three times a day,
and once at night.

152
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,248
He may have colic.

153
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,254
Zhang wants his light blue...

154
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:30,924
...and Tsui wants his pink. Here's
the cloth. Don't waste any fuel.

155
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:31,925
I know.

156
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:32,968
Go back.

157
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,322
Rest easy, Tianqing.

158
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,784
His horse is sick.

159
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,704
That old jerk
won't be back tonight.

160
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:02,831
Aunt...

161
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,793
Wake me up tomorrow.
I'll start working early.

162
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,213
I sleep like a log.

163
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,478
Really? Since when?

164
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:29,066
He's not here.
What are you afraid of?

165
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,076
You're really a log!

166
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,861
Tianqing... are you afraid?

167
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:41,031
Me? Afraid?

168
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,952
Then why did you
latch your door?

169
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,042
You're a grown man...

170
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,973
Am I a wolf?

171
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,897
You think I'll eat you?

172
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,023
My uncle...

173
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:18,193
He can go to hell!

174
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,738
If someone comes by...

175
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,409
That didn't stop you from
looking through the hole...

176
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,249
Why didn't you plug it up?

177
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,590
Tianqing...

178
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,845
...I've kept my body
for you.

179
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,278
My prescription worked well.

180
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:45,614
She's pregnant.

181
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,782
Really?

182
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:49,993
Is it a boy or a girl?

183
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,912
With some luck, a boy.

184
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:56,667
Ancestors...

185
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,837
...grant me a son!

186
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:03,841
Let the Yang family line
continue forever, Ancestors.

187
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:09,805
I'll be forever grateful to you.

188
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,684
I'll shower you with gifts
if it's a boy.

189
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,269
Ju Dou.

190
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,437
Tianqing!

191
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,107
Are you pregnant?

192
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:22,776
Yes.

193
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,990
And that old bastard
thinks it's his.

194
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:32,953
Tianqing, I counted the days:
the child is yours.

195
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:38,333
Ju Dou...

196
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:44,131
Eat well, sleep well, and
make us a fat boy!

197
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,052
I'll leave now.
The old man mustn't see me.

198
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:03,817
Jinshan!

199
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,152
Jinshan!!

200
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:11,575
It's a really fat baby with a
watering spout between his legs.

201
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,829
Ju Dou really did well for you.

202
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:18,874
My son!

203
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,733
For his generation...

204
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,820
...there are very few
good first names left.

205
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,198
Just make one up.

206
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,699
Idiot!

207
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,537
The ancestors knew best.
You can outwit them!

208
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,206
He is the only Yang heir.

209
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:03,794
One bad first name
could mean the end...

210
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,296
...of the family line.

211
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:28,068
Yang Tianbai...

212
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,072
Yang Tianqing...

213
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:36,493
Qing and Bai! That means purity!

214
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,247
Those are the two best names
beginning with Tian.

215
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:53,260
Nice toy.
Soon Tianbai will play with it.

216
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:02,936
Hang the cloths quietly.
Your aunt and Tianbai are asleep.

217
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,573
You're all mine!

218
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:06,083
I thought I was dying
and I'd never see you again.

219
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:10,546
Be quiet... be quiet!

220
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,433
Doesn't he look like you?

221
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,727
Like me?

222
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,105
Look at him.

223
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:35,320
He's your son.

224
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,334
My breasts are swollen.

225
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,511
Too much milk?

226
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,014
Yes.

227
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:09,479
You're getting silly.
You want some?

228
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,274
Does it hurt?

229
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,110
Suck it.

230
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,290
Now, go.

231
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,794
The old man might come back...

232
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:36,673
No, he won't come back now.

233
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,135
Aren't you afraid
he'll kill you with an axe?

234
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,472
It's hard to say
who will kill whom.

235
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:48,018
You talk big behind his back,
you big devil!

236
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:09,122
One day he'll find out the truth.

237
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,876
It won't be easy
to kill us all.

238
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:21,927
Uncle!

239
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:39,987
Uncle!... Uncle!

240
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,823
What happened to you?

241
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:44,533
Uncle!

242
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,339
Uncle!

243
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,123
He is paralyzed.

244
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,210
He's not going to die.

245
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,796
But he can no longer function...

246
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,050
...from the waist down.

247
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:25,903
Slut!

248
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:28,113
I'll kill you, bitch!

249
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,085
Filthy beast!
You still want to hurt me?

250
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,130
What's inside your pants?
Nothing but shit!

251
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:55,098
What's done is done.
I want you to know...

252
00:41:56,141 --> 00:42:00,437
You can do nothing about it.
God gave me Tianqing.

253
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:03,732
Now, listen!

254
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:08,570
Tianqing is Tianbai's father.
It serves you right!

255
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:27,840
Tianqing, why doesn't Tianbai
ever laugh?

256
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,758
Don't worry, he'll soon laugh.

257
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,018
"Hear the bell, ding dong."

258
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:42,855
"Here we are..."

259
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,982
"...at Village Wang."

260
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:46,650
"So many dogs..."

261
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,070
"...here they come."

262
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:54,491
"They attack us
but we can't run!"

263
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:59,496
"We can't run, so we go home."

264
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:05,169
"Play the horn just for fun."

265
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,350
Kill him!
Kill that old bastard!

266
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:10,400
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

267
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:31,880
You touch my son again
and see what happens!

268
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:37,177
Ju Dou, sleep with our son
without worry.

269
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,892
If you want to die, say so.
I'll help you.

270
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,016
You wanted to burn up my family?

271
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,853
You old bastard!
You won't succeed.

272
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:20,609
It isn't that easy!

273
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:25,239
We'll keep you alive a long time.

274
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:28,951
Keep on breathing,
you devil!

275
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:35,332
Tianqing and I
will take good care of you...

276
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:38,836
...so you can watch us
as we live happily.

277
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:41,296
You understand?

278
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:14,955
Where are you going?

279
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,624
It's a beautiful day.

280
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:29,887
Jinshan...

281
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:32,306
...you're so lucky.

282
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:36,560
Tianqing takes care of you
like a son would.

283
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:01,770
Ancestors...

284
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,231
...look...

285
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:09,653
...open your eyes wide...

286
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:11,697
Look at those two filthy beasts!

287
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,589
Oh, my poor ancestors!

288
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,901
I'm worried.

289
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:52,863
Tianqing is big,
but he still doesn't talk.

290
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,199
Is he mute?

291
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:56,491
That's nonsense.

292
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:02,414
He's slow to talk,
but he'll talk sooner or later.

293
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:04,499
Tianbai!

294
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,877
Tianbai, call me daddy.

295
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:11,048
If he does,
would you dare reply?

296
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,562
Anyway, he is your son.

297
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,816
We'll tell him
when he's older.

298
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,085
Let's go.

299
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,880
Wait, Tianbai is here.

300
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,885
It's been a long time...
I'd like to..

301
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:03,642
What are you afraid of?
He's our son. Let's go!

302
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:58,864
Tianqing, my period is late.

303
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:04,745
If I'm pregnant,
it would be a big problem.

304
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,634
Tianbai!

305
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:16,775
Daddy!

306
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:18,944
Daddy!!

307
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,029
You can say, "Daddy"?

308
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,950
Who's your daddy?

309
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,744
Daddy!... Daddy!

310
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,667
Daddy!... Daddy!

311
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:46,638
Tianbai!... My son!

312
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:51,393
Of course, I'm your father!
My son!

313
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:59,443
I'm your father! I'm your father!

314
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,322
Tianbai! Call me!

315
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:04,781
Louder.

316
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:05,449
Daddy!

317
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:07,576
Again!

318
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:20,255
Tianbai, that's your Mama.

319
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:21,089
Mama...

320
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:22,925
That's your brother.

321
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:23,759
Brother...

322
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:26,428
And I'm your father.

323
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:27,346
Daddy...

324
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:35,395
My son, you're a good boy.
Remember to call us that way.

325
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:47,074
Don't take it so hard.

326
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:52,162
He's too young to understand.

327
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:58,919
When he's older
we'll tell him everything.

328
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:13,225
I don't know why
my period was so late...

329
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:15,894
I was scared.

330
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:20,065
We'll have to do something.

331
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:23,068
Take this.

332
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:28,115
Apply it beforehand.
You'll be safe.

333
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:41,795
Does it work?

334
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:45,966
The old nun said it'll work
after I use it 10 times.

335
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:56,185
Ju Dou!

336
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:01,190
Wash yourself.

337
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:56,495
It's time to extend good wishes.

338
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:06,213
Today Tianbai is three years old.
I wish him great happiness.

339
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:11,051
I only have one thing to say:
Live a long life...

340
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,054
...and continue
the Yang family line.

341
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,850
Let's have a toast!

342
00:59:21,603 --> 00:59:22,479
Jinshan...

343
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,982
...has a good son.

344
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,860
Tianqing has a good brother.

345
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:30,612
Good luck!
Let's drink a toast!

346
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:37,077
It's Tianqing's turn
to extend his wishes to Tianbai.

347
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,707
Aunt, pour your nephew a drink!

348
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:47,254
Your aunt's wine is good!

349
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,886
Drink up, Tianqing!

350
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:58,765
Offer some wishes to your brother.

351
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:03,228
Tianbai...

352
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:07,733
...my...

353
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:13,906
...my good brother...

354
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,491
Tianqing is drunk!

355
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,003
Tianqing would like
a son of his own.

356
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:33,800
Be patient... your uncle
will spend some money...

357
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:38,514
...and buy you an even prettier
wife. Would you like that?

358
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,132
It's chili powder!

359
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,193
Use vinegar.

360
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:35,320
Vinegar?

361
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:38,323
Does that work?

362
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:40,409
Yes, it works.

363
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:44,079
Old people use vinegar
as a cure.

364
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,466
I can't take any more!

365
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:00,929
I really can't take any more.

366
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,309
Let's find a way.

367
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:14,735
Let's take Tianbai and leave.

368
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:26,330
Or let's live together and
never mind what people might say.

369
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:32,961
What they'd say doesn't worry me.
If they knew, they'd kill us!

370
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,716
You worry and worry...
Just find us a solution!

371
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:08,747
What's that?

372
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:09,915
Arsenic.

373
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:11,708
From where?

374
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,001
What for?

375
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,221
Stop and think, will you?

376
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:25,597
I have!

377
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,140
Give it to me.

378
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:32,396
Listen to me:
It's either him or me!

379
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:33,480
Him? Who?

380
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,692
Don't you know?

381
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:48,787
How dare you?

382
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:51,540
After all, he is my uncle.

383
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,840
He's your uncle...

384
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:03,468
And I, what am I?

385
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,600
What am I to you?

386
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,519
Answer me, go on, say it!

387
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:05,072
"Hear the bell, ding, dong!"

388
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:10,160
"Here we are at Village Wang!"

389
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:14,957
"So many dogs... here they come!"

390
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:19,169
"They bite us all...
but we can't run!"

391
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:23,507
"We can't run so we go home!"

392
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:28,846
"Play the horn just for fun!"

393
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,706
What's wrong?

394
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:00,377
Your aunt's lower parts
are in bad shape.

395
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:04,590
Is your paralyzed uncle strong
enough to have done that?

396
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:11,054
Give her this medicine.

397
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:13,557
But, frankly speaking...

398
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:15,601
...she can never...

399
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:18,687
...become pregnant again.

400
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:22,649
At least it's one less thing
to worry about.

401
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:37,831
You go first.

402
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:42,252
I'll come home after dark.

403
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:02,189
Ju Dou, don't do anything silly.

404
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,743
Tianbai, my son...

405
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:18,789
...do you want to dye the straw?

406
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:28,966
I'll help you.
We'll dye it bright red.

407
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:22,412
You did it?

408
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:24,498
Did what?

409
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:27,668
You know very well!

410
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:32,214
Stop talking nonsense!

411
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:35,509
When I came home,
he was already floating.

412
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:37,261
Don't lie to me!

413
01:09:39,137 --> 01:09:41,890
You should have let me do it.

414
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:46,603
Killing one's husband
cries out for punishment.

415
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:51,316
You're accusing me wrongly!
I'm lost in any case.

416
01:09:54,152 --> 01:09:57,281
Where is the little bottle?

417
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,452
You threw it out?
Where?

418
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:06,623
Where??

419
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,376
Here.

420
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:13,088
You still have it?

421
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:14,715
Keep it.

422
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:17,050
I'm involved, too.

423
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:21,263
What are you trying to prove?

424
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:23,432
Look at yourself!

425
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:27,102
Is that a son's loyalty?

426
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:29,563
Didn't he deserve to die?

427
01:10:30,856 --> 01:10:33,025
Are you sorry he's dead?

428
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,278
You'd rather keep on being
Tianbai's brother!

429
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:40,157
What a good, respectful nephew!

430
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:51,835
Tianqing!

431
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:55,380
You, too, are beating me?

432
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,384
Sure, continue doing it!

433
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:05,182
Revive the old man, and you can
both beat me!

434
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:07,559
I don't want to live any more.

435
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:31,875
According to tradition...

436
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:38,215
...Tianbai is the only Yang heir
in the Tian generation.

437
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,510
Tianqing isn't really
part of the family.

438
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,556
According to ancient custom...

439
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,351
...the funeral will
take place tomorrow.

440
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:54,648
Out of loyalty, Ju Dou and Tianqing
will block the coffin's path.

441
01:11:56,233 --> 01:12:00,487
There is gossip about them
in the village.

442
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:05,492
Tomorrow the entire Yang family
will see with its own eyes...

443
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:08,287
...whether they are
truly loyal.

444
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:11,748
According to ancestral tradition...

445
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:17,421
...Ju Dou will not remarry.

446
01:12:18,297 --> 01:12:19,965
The widow will remain faithful.

447
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:24,052
After the ceremony...

448
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:29,933
...Tianqing will move out
of the dye mill.

449
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,144
He will sleep at Wang's house.

450
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:40,027
A man living in a house with a
widow, even though she's his aunt...

451
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,866
...would cause gossip
about the Yang family...

452
01:12:46,325 --> 01:12:48,785
...whose reputation
is unblemished.

453
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:12,100
Are they blocking the path?

454
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:13,852
They're waiting up ahead.

455
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:18,232
According to custom, they must
block the path 49 times.

456
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:20,400
There must be no mistake.

457
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:33,997
Block the path!

458
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,586
Uncle, don't leave!

459
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:41,255
Don't leave!

460
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:05,612
That's once!

461
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:35,392
That's twice!

462
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,069
Tianbai!

463
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:58,368
Aunt!

464
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,434
What is it?

465
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:29,650
I bought this at the market
a few days ago.

466
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,660
That's for Tianbai.

467
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:42,246
Give it to him.

468
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:45,040
No, you do it.
He won't talk to me.

469
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:49,253
Look.

470
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:03,642
Isn't it too bright?

471
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:04,685
No.

472
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:07,771
You're still very beautiful.

473
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,122
Your brother bought this for you.

474
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:34,006
Aunt...

475
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:35,841
...I'm leaving now.

476
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,843
Lock the door.

477
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:27,935
Tianbai, I'm going to Shi village.

478
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,479
Your sixth uncle asked for me.

479
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:52,167
Let's stop coming here.
Someone might see us.

480
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:56,880
It will be getting cold.
Where could we go?

481
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:01,635
You should get home.

482
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,806
People gossip about widows.

483
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:19,486
Since the old man's death,
we live in fear of gossip.

484
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:23,615
You moved away
seven or eight years ago.

485
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:26,326
We're always hiding.

486
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,543
Let's take Tianbai
and leave this place.

487
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:36,753
Don't say that.

488
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:41,800
The worst part is behind us.

489
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:45,679
Later on Tianbai will
take over the dye mill.

490
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,433
Then I'll tell him
the whole truth.

491
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:51,059
You're crazy!

492
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,564
You'll tell him?!
Do you want to lose him?

493
01:20:55,856 --> 01:21:00,152
If we don't tell him
he'll keep on hating us...

494
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,865
...and acting as if
he wanted us dead.

495
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:10,495
It looked like two deer
or two foxes.

496
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:13,540
Then I saw it was two people.

497
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:16,376
I couldn't see
who was underneath...

498
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:18,003
...but on top was...

499
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:19,129
Who?

500
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:22,132
Tianbai's mother.

501
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,134
She was on top?

502
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:28,722
She was moving like
when they scrub laundry.

503
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:32,976
Where was that?

504
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:33,936
It was...

505
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:45,155
Murderer!... Murderer!

506
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:28,574
What's wrong?

507
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:32,703
Let's see your hand.

508
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:34,246
You're bleeding!

509
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:38,709
Let me suck out the wound.

510
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:41,879
Let me...

511
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:12,326
You evil brat!

512
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:17,122
Tianbai, now listen carefully!

513
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,501
You have hit your father!

514
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,629
I'm telling you this today:

515
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:28,008
You are the son of Yang Tianqing.
He is your father!

516
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,426
Aunt!

517
01:25:00,893 --> 01:25:03,520
Here's your lunch.
Go on, eat.

518
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,526
Where's Tianbai?

519
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:10,861
He went out.

520
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:50,734
Life will be even harder for us.

521
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,657
I'm getting older... but...

522
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:03,080
...I'd like to sleep with you.

523
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:11,046
If you wish...
let's find a place.

524
01:26:57,926 --> 01:26:59,178
It's stifling, isn't it?

525
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,305
I'm out of breath.

526
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:06,268
There's not much air
in this cave.

527
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,520
There's no air at all.

528
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:13,317
If we stay here,
we'll suffocate.

529
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,071
Should we leave?

530
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,115
Let's stay this way.

531
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:22,868
Let's keep lying here...

532
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:26,705
...for the rest of our lives.

533
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:33,504
We're old.

534
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:42,554
Do you remember how it all began
for us?

535
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:47,184
Yes.

536
01:27:51,647 --> 01:27:53,106
Tell me, go on.

537
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:55,067
Tell me.

538
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:01,323
No, you tell me.

539
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:04,576
It makes me blush.

540
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:11,708
Remember, I watched you
through a hole in the wall.

541
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:13,710
Yes.

542
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:15,879
I remember.

543
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:23,512
And now we've gone into
this large hole.
