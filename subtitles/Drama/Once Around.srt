1
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,198
Joe?

2
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,224
Are you in there?

3
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,821
Dammit!

4
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,548
- Hi.
- Hi!

5
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,591
- Oh, they're so pretty...
- Thank you!

6
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:58,256
Hi!

7
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,482
Hi!

8
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:03,162
Rob, have you seen Joe?
- Joe? No!

9
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,467
No, no...

10
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:14,942
God!

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,122
You look all right!

12
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,997
You are beautiful!

13
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,177
You're glowing.

14
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:23,849
You're the one
that's glowing!

15
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,161
Just look at you!

16
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,403
I'm just so dressed up.
You walk like...

17
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,669
You're wearing your soul
like something inside out today!

18
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:32,717
- Yeah!
- Fuck you and don't fuck you!

19
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:35,870
- Oh Tony!
- Hi, Mom!

20
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:38,042
Is dad here?
Did you see him at all?

21
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:40,385
No, no. I have no idea
where daddy might be.

22
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:42,870
Hi!

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,354
Hi!

24
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,385
Joe?

25
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:49,838
Joe?

26
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,590
The baby is crying.

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,221
Joe!

28
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,682
What are you doing?

29
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,284
I'm down in my car, Marilyn!

30
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,432
Come on in here!
It's nothing.

31
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:13,974
Hello, Joe.

32
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,414
Your booby prize!
You're not goin' to wear it?

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,596
No, you are!

34
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,750
Something borrowed, something blue,
something new...

35
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:22,477
Hey!

36
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,641
Something small, something cheap,
something plastic...

37
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,584
Stop that!
You know you guys are next.

38
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,081
Oh, who gives a shit!

39
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,191
I'm having an affair...

40
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:45,821
You are not!

41
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:48,214
Oh yeah!

42
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:50,902
I don't believe you.

43
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,236
Oh God!

44
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,183
I'm not listening to this!

45
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,292
With a mutual friend!

46
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:01,324
Maaa!

47
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,191
- Shut up, will you!
- Maaa!

48
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,753
Wait, you're getting
married in one second!

49
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,767
Please! I'm not goin'
to see him anymore...

50
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,870
- Maaa!
- After I'm married. Besides...

51
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:12,679
If you were having an affair,
if you'd know it's great!

52
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,807
- It's Jim, is't it?
- Okay honey, are you ready?

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,768
Shit!

54
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:21,088
Mom!

55
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,918
It is not time yet,
there's not...

56
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:24,685
I mean, it's really on...
it's really...

57
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,479
Really, really, going to be...

58
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:29,730
Honey, if you don't want to do this,
you don't have to!

59
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,573
And you haven't to be
embarrassed or anything...

60
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,199
I'll just go down there
and tell them!

61
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:34,909
- Ma!
- Ma!

62
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,706
Okay.
I just wanted to make sure.

63
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,650
Let's go, then!

64
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,134
- Good going.
- I will.

65
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,424
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,198
I love you, daddy.
I love you, sweetheart.

67
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,471
Peter, will you...

68
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:11,533
Tony...

69
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,643
What odd kind of shoes
are those?

70
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,063
Now, by the powers
vested in me...

71
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:22,891
By the state of Massachusetts...

72
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,671
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

73
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:27,938
And you may kiss your bride!

74
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,146
Thank you!

75
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:42,334
- Peter!
- I did it!

76
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,715
Okay, here we go!

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,920
That counts!  That counts!

78
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,639
It's the real thing!

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,014
You want to be smart?

80
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:07,068
Get that boyfriend
of yours over here...

81
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,521
Pour champagne, and set
the date right now!

82
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:10,693
Shall I...?

83
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,162
Crazy ritual, uh?

84
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,285
Renata!

85
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:23,676
Renata!

86
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,098
You are lovely!

87
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:30,465
You must really be getting it today
being the only unmarried Bella.

88
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:32,723
But let me tell you...

89
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:34,098
There's still time!

90
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,543
- That's great, aunt!
- Sis!

91
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:36,763
Joe!

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,915
I'm sorry about this.

93
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,905
It's not a problem,
no problem.

94
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,926
Why don't you look at me?

95
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,067
Look at you?
I'm looking!

96
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,454
At you,
right at you!

97
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:52,160
- Can I get something to drink?
- Of course!

98
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:56,659
Hoy Rob!

99
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,741
Take a little advice
from me, will you?

100
00:06:58,772 --> 00:06:59,447
You...

101
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:00,676
You would thrive
in marriage.

102
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:01,793
Am I right, Joe?

103
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:03,925
- That's right!
- All right...

104
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:12,653
Pressured, uh?

105
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,614
As if I'm not being pressured?

106
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:17,285
What?

107
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,598
Everybody is not stupid,
you know?

108
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:25,238
You gave me that sapphire necklace
as an engagement ring...

109
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,648
- You said it yourself!
- Yeah!

110
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:28,403
And I noticed
Jan is wearing it now.

111
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,462
It really makes me feel much closer
to her, now I know...

112
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:31,610
She's wearing it.

113
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,688
I don't care one way or another,
if we get married or not.

114
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:38,798
But you should know
you look like a worm.

115
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:44,891
A spineless worm!

116
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,891
A worm? Hey!

117
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,118
- I am being as sociable here as...
- Hello! Excuse me everyone!

118
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:53,056
Could I get your attention,
for a second please?

119
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,462
I 'm not going to take
too much time up here.

120
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,181
I just wanted to say, uh...

121
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:03,898
Before I say anything else,
I just wanted to say...

122
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:07,016
If my mother
were alive today...

123
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,657
She'd be happy...

124
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,282
Very proud.

125
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:21,953
I miss Ma!

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,954
What the hell...

127
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:35,868
Hey, Rob.

128
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,563
How is it going, buddy?

129
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,462
I am a worm.

130
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,242
I am a spineless worm.

131
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,280
So am I

132
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,173
Jan, baby...

133
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,727
I'm going to sing
a song just for you.

134
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,485
Whenever you're down...

135
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,362
And there's going to be times
when  you're down...

136
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,412
I want you to remember
your our old man...

137
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,181
And this song.

138
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:10,014
You've got to give a little...

139
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,467
Take a little...

140
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:16,921
And let your poor heart
break a little...

141
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:20,241
That's the story of...

142
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:23,655
That's the glory of love...

143
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,881
You've got to laugh a little...

144
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,263
Cry a little...

145
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:37,595
Before the clouds
roll by a little...

146
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,259
That's the story of...

147
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:44,056
That's the glory of love...

148
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:52,118
As long as there's
the two of us...

149
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:56,908
We've got the world
and all of it's charms...

150
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:02,657
And when this world
is through with us...

151
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,884
We've got each other's arms...

152
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:11,165
You've got to win a little...

153
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,970
Lose a little...

154
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:19,220
And always have
the blues a little...

155
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:22,822
That's the story of...

156
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,729
That's the glory of...

157
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:27,415
That's the story of...

158
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,978
That's the glory of...

159
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,087
Love...

160
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:45,457
I...

161
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,738
Saw a good job
in the newspaper.

162
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,488
I'm starving!

163
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,204
You go to St. Maarten...

164
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,732
And get trained to sell
condos to people in Boston.

165
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,285
You could make a of money
with that, Rob!

166
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:00,884
Do you want anything?

167
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,082
Huh?

168
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:05,840
Ren?

169
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:13,442
Ren?

170
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:15,715
What's the matter?

171
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,824
Stop crying!

172
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,848
Stop crying!

173
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:34,954
I just want a house...

174
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:37,860
And a big, important job.

175
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,896
And I want you to...

176
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,770
Fall on your knees
and beg me to marry you.

177
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:46,074
I want you to say:

178
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,980
"You're the woman
who will change my life."

179
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,192
I could, you know?

180
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,832
I think my life is pretty good!

181
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,480
Is that sapphire...

182
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:02,199
An engagement promise?

183
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:04,793
That's what you said it was...

184
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,845
There is no question about it.

185
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,158
Are you ever...

186
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:13,728
Happy about...

187
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,548
No, listen to me.
Listen to me.

188
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,635
Do you intend
to ever marry me?

189
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:21,345
Tell me.

190
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,479
Tell me!

191
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
- Oh, baby!
- Oh, baby.

192
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,028
Tell me, tell me!

193
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,291
Sweetheart!

194
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:38,620
I want to hear the exact words
you choose.

195
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,509
I do not ever intend
to marry you, Ren.

196
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,295
I love to dance with you, Joe.

197
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,780
You're my favorite
dance partner.

198
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,851
So you see, Renata...

199
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:26,296
It's bigger than
all of us honey.

200
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,187
You can't guess it!

201
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:30,913
I was crazy about a girl.

202
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,795
Before I met your mother,
of course.

203
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,063
But crazy!

204
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:35,845
You know...

205
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,877
I do not remember
her name!

206
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:42,029
Do you believe the same
will happen to you?

207
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,592
Do you?

208
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:47,303
Attagirl!

209
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,857
The son of a bitch  had
the best years of her life.

210
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:53,600
The thing is, he really
never even knew you.

211
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:54,678
That's right!

212
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,135
He had no idea
that you're exceptional.

213
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,730
An exceptional person,
you always were!

214
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,811
- Isn't that right, Jan?
- Absolutely mom, he...

215
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,475
He says I am not intellectual.

216
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:04,975
Who gives a shit?

217
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,695
You're lucky!

218
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:07,867
He is a pig!

219
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,451
I wish I could
take you with me.

220
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,389
Don't get nervous, all right?

221
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,154
- Adios!
- Okay! Bye!

222
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,599
You're gonna love the flight, honey!
Don't get nervous!

223
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,443
Goodbye!

224
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,693
I'll go up and see
if I can see them.

225
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:32,969
Dad!

226
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,072
Oh, you just missed them!

227
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:38,746
It's honeymoon your sister
goes on, and you miss it!

228
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,138
Oh, come on, you guys,
cut it up!

229
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,102
- Where is your wife?
- Oh, it's a madhouse!

230
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:43,263
Yes yes,
forget about it!

231
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,321
Sorry to point this, but you missed her
going on her honeymoon!

232
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:49,032
Get rid of the beard.
You look like a goddamn terrorist.

233
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:50,602
Honey!

234
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,735
Let's get going!
We're going to be late for work!

235
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,977
It's their plane!

236
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,782
D'you know what
surprises me, Tony?

237
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,373
Why, how you got through security,
that's what surprises me...

238
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,579
Right over there...

239
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,234
Ma? Dad?

240
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:12,892
Honey!

241
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,110
It's anything the matter?

242
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,524
Can I sleep
with you and daddy?

243
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,399
- Sure!
- What's going on?

244
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,124
Nothing, nothing, Joe.

245
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,055
It's just Renata wants
to sleep with us.

246
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,305
Why don't you get your pillow
honey, and come back.

247
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,867
Joe, don't cram me in
will you?

248
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,969
Could you spare me
a little room to breathe?

249
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,126
I feel sick.

250
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,985
You're going to be
just fine, honey.

251
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:02,384
Just fine.

252
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:04,845
Goodnight sweethearts.

253
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,245
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, daddy.

254
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,337
Good night, Ma.

255
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,040
Good night, sugar.

256
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,798
I found a job.

257
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:18,821
Selling condominiums in St. Maarten
to people in Boston.

258
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:23,892
Now you talk.
Let's talk... talk of it.

259
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:26,431
That's terrific.
You got to take it.

260
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:27,563
Really?

261
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:28,874
Just sleep...

262
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,493
You've been
a waitress long enough!

263
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,224
Just sleep.

264
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,049
Just don't think
about anything.

265
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:35,323
Sleep now.

266
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,071
Hi!

267
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,533
I'm Brigitte Larson.

268
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,512
I'd like to welcome all you
cold weather Bostonians...

269
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:51,859
In paradise!

270
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,660
Right now we are heading
towards the fabulous...

271
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:58,017
Pelican Resort and Casino
timeshare complex.

272
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,462
You'll find 300 timeshare units...

273
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:05,282
152 with extraordinary
ocean views.

274
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,069
All of the luggage
with red tag...

275
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:11,134
Will be staying in
the Terrace Room, ocean side...

276
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:13,899
Blue tag, in the new building,
right behind us.

277
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,719
There are two things
you need to make a deal...

278
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:27,181
One is money...

279
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,930
The other is attitude.

280
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:31,399
Their money...

281
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:33,268
Your attitude.

282
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,797
If you don't have a
positive attitude...

283
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,181
Get out now!

284
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,618
So now tell me...

285
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,399
How do you feel?

286
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:43,057
Great!

287
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,673
- How do you feel?
- Great!

288
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,251
That's what I want to hear!

289
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:49,727
You'll fill that board
if you have that attitude!

290
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:52,102
You'll sell every condo we have...

291
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,875
I don't care whether it outlooks
onto the parking lot...

292
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:55,956
You'll sell it!

293
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:54,465
Hello, everybody!
Welcome, all you beautiful people!

294
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:56,760
Boy, I got a treat for you!

295
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,285
I'd like to introduce you to
our very top salesman...

296
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,481
My idol...

297
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,809
Mister Sam Sharpe!

298
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,614
Thank you very much!

299
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,302
Thank you.
Thank you very much!

300
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,067
Thank you!  Thank you!

301
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,713
Thank you.
Thank you very much!

302
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:20,950
Is that a banana in your pocket,
or you're just happy to see me?

303
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,426
What did the man say,
who had five penises?

304
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:27,346
What?

305
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:28,825
My pants fit me like a glove!

306
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,028
That's sick!

307
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,395
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome...

308
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,309
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
all you guys and gals...

309
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,059
To the Pelican Condo family...

310
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,395
You're a great looking bunch
of trainees, as a matter of fact...

311
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,286
There are some
of you here today...

312
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,536
Who are simply stunning.

313
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,739
I want to hear you
give yourself...

314
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:49,067
A big round of applause!

315
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:51,098
Ready?
One, two, three, go!

316
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,301
That's it!
Let me hear it!

317
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:02,435
Now...

318
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:03,937
For those of you...

319
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,467
Who don't know me,
my name is Sam Sharpe.

320
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,295
And I guess you could say that
I've sold a few of these babies...

321
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,340
Myself.

322
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,489
Sam Sharpe...

323
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,528
Has sold...

324
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:20,762
2.575 shares....

325
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,044
Now you're acting
like a salesperson...

326
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,112
Thanks a lot!

327
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:29,268
And last year,
in commission alone...

328
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,160
I made...

329
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Earned a lot of money.

330
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:36,917
A lot of money!

331
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:40,344
Now you must be asking
yourselves, by now...

332
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,933
Who is this guy?

333
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:43,964
You know, who is this...

334
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,440
Hugely successful salesperson...

335
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,675
Who is this...

336
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,680
Incredibly well-dressed...

337
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:51,680
Yeah!

338
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:53,598
Incredibly well hung guy, well...

339
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,190
I, uh...

340
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,464
I am descended...

341
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,753
From a long line...

342
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,690
Of Lithuanian generals...

343
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,808
My family, God bless
each and everyone of them...

344
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:06,667
Came over here to this...

345
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:08,316
Fabulously wonderful country...

346
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,336
When I was...

347
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,277
Just a little fellow in shorts.

348
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,828
And now...

349
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,809
Take a look
at what I'm wearing.

350
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:15,753
That's America!

351
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,649
Everyone of you can do just as well,
you know what I'm talking about...

352
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,357
This place sells itself.

353
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,294
Thank you very much,
"bon appétit".

354
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:28,630
A cheer for Sam Sharpe!

355
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:37,690
That was nice!
Thank you!

356
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:39,191
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

357
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,897
- It's time for the Pierrot, Pepe.
- I love that wine!

358
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,345
Not many people
know that wine.

359
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:47,279
I used to work
in the food industry.

360
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,202
Really?
So did I!

361
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,304
- Hi everybody, I'm Joyce.
- Hello!

362
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,078
Hi, Joyce.

363
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,202
Well, cheers!

364
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:00,619
- May I?
- Oh! Thank you!

365
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,038
Red is a beautiful color!

366
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,060
It's my favorite color!

367
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:14,168
- Your suit is gorgeous!
- Do you really like it?

368
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:15,950
Oh yes, I love it!
It's wonderful!

369
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,186
Thank you!

370
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,903
- I got it in Japan.
- No!

371
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:20,309
- Yes!
- Wow!

372
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:21,442
Tokyo.

373
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:23,892
Tokyo...
is a wild ploy.

374
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,186
Ohoh, yeah!

375
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:28,585
I can imagine...

376
00:22:28,742 --> 00:22:30,968
You can't believe the dresses
they can make in Tokyo.

377
00:22:30,994 --> 00:22:33,249
I would like to buy you
a dress from Tokyo...

378
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:34,548
Wow!

379
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:49,901
My dad uses to sing that song
for my mother.

380
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:52,168
"Fly me to the moon"!

381
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,763
I, of course, was born
in the forties.

382
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,395
When they wrote
incredible songs.

383
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,091
Thats why I have such
intense passions.

384
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:03,278
I believe that
a hundred percent!

385
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,053
I mean...

386
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,067
I know all those songs
because of my dad.

387
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,154
Hell...

388
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,466
Men of my own generation
have never understood me at all!

389
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,958
I mean, if you know...

390
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:18,591
"Fly me to the moon...

391
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:21,856
"And let me play
among the stars...

392
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,606
"Let me see
what spring is like...

393
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:27,341
"On Jupiter and Mars...

394
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:30,497
"In otherwords...

395
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:33,247
"Hold my hand...

396
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:35,341
"In otherwords...

397
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:36,897
- Baby...
- Darling...

398
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:39,388
"Kiss me"

399
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,497
- What's your name?
- Renata.

400
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:48,151
- Renata.
- Yes.

401
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:49,388
It's a lovely...

402
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,786
Lovely name.

403
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:11,040
You are the second most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

404
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:18,466
- Your mother.
- You got it!

405
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,005
I don't believe you!

406
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:25,942
You know...

407
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,138
There's an old
Caribbean custom...

408
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:31,911
That says when a man
kisses a woman on a roof...

409
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:34,505
On the very first night,
that they meet...

410
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:37,364
That she has to
believe everything...

411
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,723
He ever tells her.

412
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:40,731
And that...

413
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,311
Is a fact.

414
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,302
- I shouldn't have done that.
- Why not?

415
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,411
You're wearing
a wedding ring.

416
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:57,606
I'm... I'm divorced.

417
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:00,020
No!
In business...

418
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:01,944
In business it's
better to be married!

419
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,393
Renata, my divorce
was final September 2nd.

420
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,197
- No!
- Yes!

421
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:14,090
Christ!
That's my birthday!

422
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,966
- No!
- Yes!

423
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:19,052
Renata, you have to come
to New York with me...

424
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:21,086
Just for a weekend, please!

425
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:26,013
I'm immeasurably flattered,
I mean...

426
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,862
A weekend is just two days, but...
but I can't...

427
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:34,481
- I have my family to go back to...
- "Fly you to the moon..."

428
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:38,184
"And let us play
among the stars..."

429
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:42,989
"Let us see
what spring is like..."

430
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,841
"On Jupiter and Mars..."

431
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,598
"In other words..."

432
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:54,114
"Old my hand..."

433
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,622
"In other words..."

434
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:00,661
"Darling kiss me... "

435
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:30,497
Sam...

436
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,481
When you brought me back
to my room last night...

437
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:35,136
And you wouldn't
let me in you tease...

438
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,630
I wanted to tell
you something...

439
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:37,846
You drive me wild...

440
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,282
I was afraid to excite you...

441
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,823
- Any more then I did already.
- You old-fashioned...

442
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,457
Baddy, daddy's sex goddess...

443
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:43,692
Sam!

444
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:45,685
What?
Tell me, what?

445
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:47,293
You know Sam...

446
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,388
When I saw you for the
very first time...

447
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:51,591
You were standing and you
looked down at the ocean...

448
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:52,338
Yeah!

449
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,311
And the moment I saw you...

450
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,357
A voice inside me, said...

451
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:59,558
"I'm going to kiss this guy
in front of an altar...

452
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,496
With God as a witness."

453
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:02,576
Yes.

454
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,059
That voice inside me...

455
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:06,519
- Yeah?
- I've never heard it, ever...

456
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,364
Untill I saw you.

457
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:21,778
I can't believe this.

458
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,877
I can't believe
you're driving me here.

459
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,485
Why, is only logical!

460
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,848
You wouldn't let me feed you
baby shrimp in New York.

461
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,126
Renata!

462
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:41,576
Daddy!

463
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:43,926
Oh God,
I'm so happy!

464
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:45,121
Daddy, um...

465
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:48,114
Let me shake the hand
of the first man...

466
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,169
That my little
rosebud ever loved.

467
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,325
A word, a word, it's not
going to be a second!

468
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,537
- Come on, it will be interesting to you!
- My hands are dirty, I...

469
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:02,053
- I don't want to go in...
- Get in! Get in!

470
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,702
Get in!
Get in!

471
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:05,850
I got mud on my boots!

472
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:08,440
Okay, Sonny, let's go!

473
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,452
You can go
around the rotary...

474
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,358
At high speed without
ever hitting your brakes.

475
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,717
I think I have the record
in Massachusetts.

476
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:22,609
What suspension!
This is an automobile!

477
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:24,891
Hey, what's it, Sonny?
Sonny!

478
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,288
You can crank her up
ten more miles per hour!

479
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:29,709
What ten, thirty miles
an hour, come on!

480
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:30,592
Okay!

481
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:32,709
This baby really
hugs the road!

482
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,163
There's even champagne
in that refrigerator.

483
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:37,652
No, no!
No thanks!

484
00:28:37,678 --> 00:28:39,014
No thanks,
I get headache!

485
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,319
Have one daddy!

486
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,558
- Marilyn!
- Hi honey, what...

487
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:50,554
What're you doing up there?
Get down!

488
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:52,225
Renata!

489
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,257
- Mom!
- Do you want to kill yourself?

490
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:55,668
How many times do I
have to tell you all...

491
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,014
Aaah! Help!

492
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:01,452
- Are you gonna shame us...
- Mommy, mommy, how are you!

493
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:05,897
- I am so happy to see you!
- I din't think you'd be back so early!

494
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,334
Sam, this is my mother.

495
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:11,084
Mom, this is Sam.

496
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:13,084
- Hello!
- Hello, how are you?

497
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,396
Isn't she beautiful?

498
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,413
How do you explain a rose...

499
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,511
To someone, who has never
seen a rose before.

500
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,794
Welcome!

501
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:23,998
So, uh...

502
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,647
He detoured Renata
to New York City...

503
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,475
Just so he could drive her
back to Boston.

504
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:29,506
How nice!

505
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:31,881
If I had my way, I would've driven
her all the way to California.

506
00:29:37,928 --> 00:29:39,436
Well!
How did you like the job?

507
00:29:39,462 --> 00:29:40,577
Did you love it?

508
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,644
I learned I wouldn't be good
at selling condos...

509
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,045
She'd be sensational!

510
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,655
It just wasn't the right place for her.

511
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:46,795
Really!

512
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:48,038
So uh...

513
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:50,529
You're back to where
you started?

514
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:52,639
Well...

515
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:54,069
Not really, dad.

516
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:55,030
Not really, dad!

517
00:29:55,056 --> 00:29:57,014
What's that supposed
to mean?

518
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:00,576
- Hi, Tony
- Tony!

519
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,444
Come on, come here!

520
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:06,085
Hi, Tony!

521
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:07,602
Hey, Renata!

522
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:09,334
You're home early!

523
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:12,381
How's the condo biz?

524
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,514
This is Sam.
This is my brother Tony.

525
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,324
Tony!

526
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,597
Sam, nice to meet you!

527
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:18,313
Nice limo!

528
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,685
Why don't you come up and have
something to eat with Renata and, um...

529
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,022
- Sam.
- Sam!

530
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:24,147
No, I have to go to work.

531
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,038
Well, this came in
real handy, thanks.

532
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:27,246
But it's Saturday!

533
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:28,927
Got to go!
I got a work, see?

534
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,327
You could take a day off
once in a while.

535
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:31,676
Listen, I got a plumber here...

536
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:33,961
He robs me blind as soon as I
turn around for a minute!

537
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,381
- Bye Tony.
- Bye, donna.

538
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:36,373
Tony!

539
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:39,327
You're going to get plenty of chances
if you get to know me.

540
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:43,047
Joe, come on and have
something to eat with the kids!

541
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,819
Hey, Sonny!
Bring the champagne!

542
00:30:45,618 --> 00:30:47,140
No, no, no, no, no!
No thank you!

543
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,528
Just leave it in the car.

544
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,883
Tony, don't forget it's
dad's birthday tomorrow.

545
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:54,203
Marilyn, Marilyn, please!

546
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,570
Please honey,
no celebration....

547
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:57,679
No cake....

548
00:30:58,243 --> 00:30:59,111
Nothing!

549
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,711
Sure, sure, sure!

550
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,041
Come here! Come here!

551
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:14,080
Come here!
Now I've got you!

552
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,685
Was that just regular vodka
we were drinking?

553
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,591
It's two clock in the morning,
for chrissakes!

554
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,419
I mean, we don't even know
this guy, really!

555
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,787
I think she should go
to her own goddamned room...

556
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:37,912
I mean, it's close to 2:30!

557
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,826
You know Joe...

558
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:41,596
I think if this works out...

559
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:43,725
It could be the best thing
that could ever happen.

560
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:46,216
I think he's crazy about her.

561
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:50,091
That's it!

562
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:51,951
- Where are you going?
- That's it!

563
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:53,872
Don't go down there!

564
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:04,201
Oh, darling! Oh, darling!

565
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,193
Kiss me!

566
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:08,576
Oh, Joe!

567
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,357
Joe, she's so funny!

568
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:14,005
She was just telling me how
her horse Horny used to...

569
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,373
- Shoni.
- Shoni!

570
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,649
Shoni used to walk in the rain
through the rain.

571
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,505
- With all the water falling...
- We woke you?

572
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:23,466
What the hell is the matter
with you Renata?

573
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:25,395
Your mother can't sleep.

574
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,435
Oh, yes?

575
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,104
For chrissakes,
it's three in the morning!

576
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:32,231
Okay, fine, I'm going to bed!

577
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:35,309
What's with that attitude?

578
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,231
All of a sudden
I'm the bad guy?

579
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:39,817
Because it's 3:30
in the morning...

580
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:41,761
And I want you to go
to bed for chrissakes...

581
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:42,811
Allright!

582
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:47,643
Your mother wants
her goddamned sleep.

583
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,502
Renata...

584
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:03,941
Don't let him
go away angry.

585
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:06,462
Come on.
Sweeten him up!

586
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,041
Buttercup...

587
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,369
Dad!

588
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,799
Don't worry, sweetheart.

589
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:22,135
You're forgiven!

590
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,385
Let's go to sleep now.

591
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:26,252
Wait a minute.

592
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,451
What's the matter?
What's going on?

593
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:30,323
Are you okay?

594
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,557
Am I okay?

595
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:40,102
If I told you how wrong everything
has been since Rob, I...

596
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:41,678
If, if, if...

597
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,765
If I told you the truth, you...
you'd problably call the cops on me!

598
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:48,599
Or... a priest, or Jan,
or a medical doctor...

599
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,820
I'm coaching for dear life
in here, okay?

600
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:55,990
How?

601
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,287
I have been...

602
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:58,662
Spit down the middle!

603
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:00,444
Spit down the
fucking middle!

604
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:01,487
I've been...

605
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:02,625
Flung into this wasteland...

606
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:05,261
Trying to figure out how can
two plus two make five.

607
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,602
And at the same, I feel like
I'm getting in...

608
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:11,831
A tall white flame,
that suddenly goes "pfft"...

609
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,361
Disintegrate!

610
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:15,752
And you ask me,
if I'm okay?

611
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,594
That's not the point!
That's just not the point!

612
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,779
The point is, I don't want
to be told when to go to bed.

613
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:29,674
Alright, stay up late.

614
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,243
No problem.

615
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,690
You bet that I'm staying
up late if I want.

616
00:34:33,924 --> 00:34:35,135
Okay, Mom?

617
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:38,276
Okay! Sure, you stay up
as late as you want.

618
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,979
And then again I just
might go right to bed.

619
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,745
- That's okay too!
- Sure, absolutely!

620
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:52,768
What was that?

621
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,219
Do you hear that?

622
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:25,734
I don't hear anything.

623
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,813
Brrr, shut the window,
I'm freezing my ass off.

624
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,200
"Fly me to the moon...

625
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:44,351
"Let me play
among the stars...

626
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:48,758
"Let me see
what spring is like...

627
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:52,305
"On Jupiter and Mars...

628
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:54,931
"In other words...

629
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:59,225
"Hold my hand...

630
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,913
"In other words...

631
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,217
"Baby... Kiss me...

632
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:12,475
"Fill my heart with song...

633
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:16,655
"And let me sing
for ever more...

634
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,178
Let me me see it again!

635
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:22,715
Look at those shoes and dress...

636
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:25,231
Look at this neckline!

637
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:28,910
No, no, no, no!
Leave your coat open!

638
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:30,587
You stare at me.

639
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:33,425
Oh God, I'm busted up inside...

640
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,878
I swear the adrenaline
inside me is like....

641
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,035
- I'm  kicking ass.
- Why?

642
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,411
Do I look okay?

643
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:43,575
Because I'm going crazy!

644
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:46,113
Oh my... God!

645
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:48,220
Let go!

646
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:51,715
You awakened Sam Sharpe!

647
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:53,237
Don't move!

648
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:56,641
Not if you care at all for
this minutes, this car, for me at all!

649
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:59,305
- Dont move your hand!
- I don't think I can!

650
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:00,563
I can't do this!

651
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,578
I want you to live
with me in New York.

652
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,674
No!

653
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,687
- That's impossible!
- Nothing is impossible!

654
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:11,961
- Come on, say yes to me!
- I live here!

655
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,489
Come on!

656
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,494
Leaving my family is like...
Is like...

657
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:19,574
Renouncing my citizenship, or...

658
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,360
Or moving to Russia!

659
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:24,180
Or becoming Protestant!
No!

660
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,731
Sonny stop the car!

661
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:27,586
Stop the car!

662
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,992
Sam, what are you doing?

663
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:37,367
Get out of the car!

664
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:38,399
- Please!
- Come on!  Come on!

665
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,383
- We are on a bridge!
- Come on!

666
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,367
- Where are we going?
- Trust me.

667
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,531
- It's cold out here!
- Renata...

668
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,974
When I was eight years old...

669
00:37:49,563 --> 00:37:52,344
I used to stare at the photo
of my grandfather.

670
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,586
Who was a General
in Lithuania.

671
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,425
What do you talk...?
We were talking about me...

672
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:58,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

673
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:00,420
I used to say to myself:
Sam...

674
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:02,605
The blood of this
powerful, viril man...

675
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,748
Is coursing through
your veins.

676
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,754
And I was just so...
I would... I would get...

677
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:09,193
I would ran out
of the room...

678
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,888
Dieing to do
something decisive...

679
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,224
I would say:
"Mommy, mommy..."

680
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,746
"Did I really suck on your tits,
when I was a little boy?"

681
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,349
Sam!
What are you talking about?

682
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,470
- What am I talking about...
- Oh, I'm freezing!

683
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:23,116
- Let's go back to the car.
- What am I talking about?

684
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:25,845
I'm trying to tell you that
from the first minute I ever saw you...

685
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,243
Renata!

686
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:29,329
Look at you...

687
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:31,551
Look at you!

688
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,657
Everything you do...

689
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:38,531
The way you eat
your food...

690
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,262
The way...

691
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:42,680
The way you put on
your shoes...

692
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,585
The way your eyes are looking
at my mouth when I'm talking...

693
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:50,514
Renata, you name
anything you do...

694
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:53,530
The way you hug
your mother....

695
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,475
The way you talk
to your family...

696
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,377
You move me.

697
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,180
Give me the phone!

698
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:17,577
Sonny?

699
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:19,817
Give me the phone!

700
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,217
What are you doing?

701
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,725
I'm dialling
my accountant's number.

702
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:30,100
I'm going to look at the Charles River
every day for the rest of my life.

703
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,444
When he asks me why
am I moving...

704
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,491
My business from New
York to Boston...

705
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,624
I'll be able to say to him...

706
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,710
This man...

707
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,967
I am in love!

708
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,348
Marilyn, give me those
needle nose again!

709
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,903
Yes, coming up!

710
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,700
He lives in New York City.

711
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,160
I'm glad too.

712
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,833
I'll get it!

713
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:58,317
Imagine that guy
on a day to day basis...

714
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:01,700
Oh, my word!

715
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:03,684
Oh, my goodness,
look at this!

716
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,418
Look at what Sam sent me!

717
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,739
Look at that!
Is he a darling?

718
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,801
Oh, my...

719
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:11,020
I've never saw so many
flowers in my life!

720
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:15,192
I don't know why I'm
putting in this fixture.

721
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,926
I am 140 years old today...

722
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:18,121
You'd think my...

723
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:21,369
Goddamned son, your
husband would help out.

724
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:22,892
Oh, he had to go
watch that plumber!

725
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:24,551
- I don't look that old, do I?
- No, you look great, dear!

726
00:40:24,598 --> 00:40:26,025
- Thanks, honey!
- Wait a minute...

727
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:28,035
Renata really likes this guy?

728
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:29,168
Likes him?

729
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:31,613
She's almost as absurd
as your mother in law!

730
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:33,707
Ta-ta!

731
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:35,950
I told you Marilyn...

732
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:38,075
Don't do anything fancy
for my birthday.

733
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,308
Oh, I suppose you think this
cake is for you, uh?

734
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:42,771
It's not for you.

735
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:45,371
Can't you just one time
accept something...

736
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:47,121
Without spoiling it
with your censorship?

737
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:50,910
There was never a day I could
or would court you like that.

738
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:53,176
All I ever wanted to do was...

739
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,699
Sit in the stoop
and hold your hand.

740
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:57,004
Yeah, me too!

741
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:00,970
Isn't that funny how
on the one lousy day...

742
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:02,558
You want to put a gun
in your mouth...

743
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,447
Everybody wants to come
over to celebrate.

744
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:06,277
Yes, that's because
we love you.

745
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,027
D'you want some coffee, baby?

746
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,254
Renata...

747
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:12,441
I want you to try the greatest
coffee cake you've ever eaten.

748
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:15,387
Sam, don't believe anything
that daddy says.

749
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:18,269
- Can I give you some coffee?
- Thank you very much!

750
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,299
- Where's the bananas?
- Bananas, you got it!

751
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:22,588
Oh, God!

752
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:24,705
Tony and Gail!
Stop!

753
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:27,182
Don't have to eat it yet!

754
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:29,291
- Don't, don't...
- Okay, okay, okay!

755
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,375
I can get it myself...
Sit down.

756
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,234
Marilyn, where's the cream...
The cream!

757
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,853
You ruined it, you ruined it!
She ate it!

758
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:37,524
She ate it!

759
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,143
She ate it!

760
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,580
Okay, Sam...

761
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:41,682
I got it!

762
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,314
Uh, Joe...

763
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,588
- Why don't you answer the doorbell?
- Mum!

764
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,533
Why?

765
00:41:46,955 --> 00:41:48,846
I think it's right that
you answer your doorbel!

766
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:53,666
What's going on?

767
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:54,986
Justr do it, dad!

768
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,783
Answer the door!

769
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:05,704
- Excuse me.
- What's up?

770
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:12,275
Hello!

771
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,361
You're Mr. Joe Bella?

772
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,400
That's me!

773
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,394
Come on, keep up!
Come on!

774
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:14,230
Thanks a lot!

775
00:43:20,905 --> 00:43:23,304
Do you hear that?
It sounds Byzantine!

776
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:28,007
Hear!

777
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,225
Let me put it inside you
right now, you have guessed

778
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:31,101
Peter...

779
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,413
- Cut it down!
- Come on!

780
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:35,718
- Come on!
- Let's go in that bush!

781
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,203
- Please!
- Peter!

782
00:43:37,229 --> 00:43:38,726
Come on, just feel it.

783
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:40,523
Come on,
just give it a touch!

784
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:42,171
Peter, please!

785
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:44,374
This is a front
lawn in America.

786
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:48,168
They're dancing!

787
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:50,093
They can't be dancing!

788
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:04,546
Jan!

789
00:44:06,974 --> 00:44:08,502
I was dying for you
to come home!

790
00:44:08,528 --> 00:44:10,710
I'll tell you,
you look gorgeous!

791
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:13,054
- Jan! Peter!
- Come on!

792
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:16,109
Peter! Peter!

793
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,287
- Welcome home.
- Who's the naked lady?

794
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,327
Hey Sam!
Sam, Sam, come on!

795
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:25,515
I want you to meet my kid!

796
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:27,789
Who is the guy?

797
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,840
My new boyfriend!

798
00:44:32,621 --> 00:44:34,501
No, no, come on,
who is he really?

799
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,804
I'm with him.

800
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:40,859
My God, who could imagine,
not even sun tanned, uh?

801
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,523
She's probably seeing
museums all day..

802
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:44,836
Sam, come here!

803
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:52,992
Sam, this is my sister Jan
and this is her husband Peter.

804
00:44:53,018 --> 00:44:54,498
- How are you?
- Sam Sharpe!

805
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,078
I hope you both have a lifetime
of great sex and joy.

806
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,211
That's what it's all about,
ain't it?

807
00:45:06,107 --> 00:45:07,445
Hey, Miss?

808
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,203
Why don't we have
something to eat?

809
00:45:09,229 --> 00:45:10,469
I'm starving!

810
00:45:10,602 --> 00:45:13,220
Let's all go in the kitchen and sing
Happy Birthday to daddy!

811
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,617
For Christ's sake, I offer the birthday.
No more eating!

812
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:21,435
Glad you all are here.

813
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:27,251
Wait for us, okay?

814
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:44,391
Oh, thank you, I will.
That's sweet!

815
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:45,492
Bye bye!

816
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,422
Why didn't you ask your friend
to join us for cake?

817
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,516
Oh, no, no, she wouldn't want to stay here
with a bunch of strangers...

818
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:53,955
She'd rather go home,
you know?

819
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,774
With her tits full of cash!

820
00:45:57,343 --> 00:45:59,469
She's married.
She's dieing to get out of here!

821
00:45:59,585 --> 00:46:00,904
- Joe!
- Yeah!

822
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:03,189
She said Happy Birthday
in Lithuanian!

823
00:46:03,953 --> 00:46:05,774
So, we'll be in there!

824
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:08,953
Yes.

825
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:00,561
Oh, my God!

826
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:14,774
I saw you came home last night.

827
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:16,579
Jim!

828
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:18,803
I was... behind the big tree.

829
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,078
Jim...

830
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:21,584
Would you...

831
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,690
You should...
You should...

832
00:47:22,816 --> 00:47:24,045
I need you!

833
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,248
- God, I need you!
- Jim!

834
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:30,174
Remember how you...

835
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,280
You needed me
at your wedding, and...

836
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:33,595
You could explain it?

837
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,373
Yeah!

838
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:41,986
Yopu really missed me,
didn't you?

839
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,373
I met a woman.

840
00:47:46,517 --> 00:47:47,997
She's phenomenal!

841
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,491
She asked me
to marry her.

842
00:47:52,592 --> 00:47:53,717
I want you there.

843
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:56,329
Next Thursday.

844
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,678
You have to be there!

845
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,522
How could you meet a
woman, I've been only...

846
00:48:02,548 --> 00:48:03,506
A bar.

847
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,799
- A bar?
- Yes.

848
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:09,638
And you're going to marry
someone you met in a bar?

849
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,324
For Christ's sake,
look at me, Jim!

850
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,985
Please come to my wedding.

851
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:15,811
Please!

852
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,600
That was pretty good!
Go, go!

853
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,084
I wish you could have
met my father.

854
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,944
He wasn't a very good skater
but he loved the ice.

855
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,905
I wish I could have met
your father.

856
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:32,725
Wait till you see what this Olympics
manage to do!

857
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:34,467
Sam, you shouldn't
have done all this...

858
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:35,757
Oh, I...

859
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,201
Hey, come on!

860
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:41,881
I'm all alone out here!

861
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:45,233
Sonny!

862
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:47,030
Sonny,
turn up the volume!

863
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:53,975
It's wonderful out here!
It's wond... come on, Joe!

864
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,772
- Come on, baby, it's you and me!
- What, what, what?

865
00:48:56,798 --> 00:48:58,943
Renata! Come on!

866
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,881
Hey, what is this?

867
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,716
You told me you'd been
a hockey star in high school!

868
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:06,474
- Field hockey!
- Ohh!

869
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,139
Look at this!

870
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,623
Where did Sam
get all his money?

871
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:16,084
Sam is an incredible salesman,
haven't you heard?

872
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,967
He's selling real estate
on the moon now!

873
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:20,011
Hey, Joe!

874
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:22,505
Are you ready to whizz
the ladies around?

875
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:23,444
Come on!

876
00:49:23,478 --> 00:49:25,084
Here we come!
Come on!

877
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:26,303
Jan!

878
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:28,280
Are you ready
for a little whipping?

879
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:29,959
Sam?

880
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,826
God, you can say
anything to anyone!

881
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:38,280
Oh, come on!
She's your sister!

882
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,764
Come on, Joe!

883
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,436
I'll do it myself now!

884
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,873
Good style, old Joe!

885
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:47,958
Good style!

886
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,176
This is my imitation of Joe!

887
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,410
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch out!

888
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,024
Come here,
come here you guys!

889
00:49:56,058 --> 00:49:57,442
Marilyn, Marilyn!

890
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,716
Come on,
take it, take it!

891
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,817
That's very good.
Now...

892
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,299
You're going to go
round slow...

893
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:02,137
Come on!

894
00:50:02,388 --> 00:50:04,653
Now you'll learn,
I'm going to see you really do it.

895
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:07,466
- Hey, come on, go!
- Go, go!

896
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:11,216
- Easy!
- Come on!

897
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,830
Jan, come over here!

898
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:13,755
Yes!

899
00:50:14,146 --> 00:50:15,317
Why do you call me in?

900
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,356
Do you want a drink?

901
00:50:17,523 --> 00:50:19,122
Neat show!
Neat show!

902
00:50:19,177 --> 00:50:20,232
That's good!

903
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,216
Marilyn down!
Marilyn!

904
00:50:26,176 --> 00:50:27,466
First Aid!

905
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:29,138
First Aid!

906
00:50:29,282 --> 00:50:30,825
Are you alright?
Are you sure?

907
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,739
- Are you alright?
- Yes!

908
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:34,309
What do you think?

909
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:35,489
About what?

910
00:50:35,872 --> 00:50:37,435
You haven't told me
what you think.

911
00:50:43,398 --> 00:50:46,207
Well, you used to tack
about having a job, but...

912
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:49,762
I'm asking how you feel
about Sam, what you think?

913
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,965
I think you should take it slow.

914
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:54,942
I mean...

915
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,113
I thought you were supposed
to be selling condos by now.

916
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:03,868
So what are you doing
that's so goddamn important?

917
00:51:05,304 --> 00:51:07,681
At least I'm worried about my future,
not of avoiding it.

918
00:51:07,707 --> 00:51:09,142
Oh, give me a break!

919
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,267
- You're stuck here!
- Me?

920
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,671
Your feet are nailed
to the fucking kitchen floor...

921
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,876
You don't do anything
without daddy's permission.

922
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,033
Or is it Sam's now?

923
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,072
I mean, at least I...

924
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:22,459
What? Have Peter?

925
00:51:27,745 --> 00:51:29,017
Or is it Jim?

926
00:51:32,442 --> 00:51:34,111
I saw you this morning.

927
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:37,838
I'm just asking you
give me and Sam...

928
00:51:37,864 --> 00:51:40,025
The same kind of consideration
you give a neighbor.

929
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:42,582
Come on Renata!
I mean, you hardly know the guy!

930
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,720
I mean, for chrissakes, he ​​puts
money in women's breasts.

931
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:52,782
Okay!
It's fine!

932
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,497
You can just screw off, okay?
Screw off!

933
00:51:57,027 --> 00:51:58,974
Oh! Yeah!
Right!

934
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,869
You're just pissed off,
I went on my honeymoon...

935
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,714
Instead of staying and taking care
of your stupid broken heart.

936
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:05,944
You get real creepy, Renata,
This people...

937
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,508
- You're creepy!
- That's right!

938
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,509
He makes her happy....

939
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:15,472
Can't you see that?

940
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:24,096
Mum! Come!

941
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:25,791
Watch me!

942
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:27,353
We watch you!

943
00:52:27,596 --> 00:52:28,807
Yeh, you're great!

944
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,173
Watch this!

945
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:47,072
Mum? Dad?

946
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,744
Hey, what's going on?

947
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,609
What's the matter?

948
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,681
I'm sorry to wake you, but...

949
00:52:59,036 --> 00:53:01,423
I can not sleep unless
I say the following....

950
00:53:03,157 --> 00:53:04,637
Then say it, then.

951
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,353
Does anyone care?

952
00:53:09,678 --> 00:53:13,110
That... Renata is spending day and night
with some moron?

953
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:17,541
Renata doesn't think
he's a moron.

954
00:53:17,635 --> 00:53:18,526
Mum...

955
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:21,282
We don't know a thing
about this guy, do we?

956
00:53:22,174 --> 00:53:23,220
Dot you, Dad?

957
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,134
No...

958
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:28,978
No, not really.

959
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:32,213
He could be a criminal!

960
00:53:33,352 --> 00:53:34,291
No!

961
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:36,775
I should know
more about him.

962
00:53:37,403 --> 00:53:39,142
We should.
We all should.

963
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:42,930
And why is he living with us?

964
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,655
He's not living with us!

965
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,226
What do you mean,
he's not living with us...

966
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:48,624
If he's here, he's here.

967
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,812
- Do I see him in bed or not?
- He's visiting!

968
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:52,710
Okay, technically he's
not living with us...

969
00:53:52,736 --> 00:53:54,374
But he's here,
he's staying here!

970
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:55,691
That's what she's asking us...

971
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:57,007
Is that what you're asking?

972
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:58,129
Exactly!

973
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:00,522
He is living with us
for some weird reason!

974
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:02,647
I think we should
just stay out of it!

975
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:04,968
Oh no!
No, no, no, no, no.

976
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:06,819
Marilyn...

977
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:09,774
I mean, goddamned, he's been
with us long enough!

978
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,998
Enough is enough!

979
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:14,098
I'm sick and
goddamn tired of...

980
00:54:14,124 --> 00:54:16,913
Of smelling smoke
and drinking vodka!

981
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:19,397
I'm sick of it!

982
00:54:19,577 --> 00:54:21,015
Sick! Sick!

983
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:22,507
I'm sick of it!

984
00:54:24,153 --> 00:54:25,461
That's what I am!

985
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,609
Janny, she is awfully happy!

986
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:45,950
Aw, whiplash!
Aw, whiplash!

987
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,919
Come on! Pull over!
Let me see your license!

988
00:54:47,945 --> 00:54:48,932
Come on!
Come on, out!

989
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,159
He's more excited about
this wedding than anyone.

990
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:57,409
Crazy wedding!
Crazy wedding!

991
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:01,964
All my instincts tell me
take this kid aside and say:

992
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,261
"What's your rush?"

993
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:06,143
Sometimes people know,
they just know like that!

994
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,488
He has to be in love!

995
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:09,339
I'm glad you're so
open minded, Jan.

996
00:55:09,365 --> 00:55:10,870
Peter!
Come on!

997
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:12,800
Listen, Renata!

998
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,675
Let's forget about
the other day, okay?

999
00:55:16,765 --> 00:55:18,768
I overreacted.
I'm sorry!

1000
00:55:19,656 --> 00:55:22,425
I was a real bitch!
I just want you to be happy!

1001
00:55:22,983 --> 00:55:24,698
It's none of my business
how you go about to end there.

1002
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:26,565
No. You cared...

1003
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,370
And you're right!

1004
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:30,823
No, I understand
your concerns, I do.

1005
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:35,362
I'm going to cool
my jets with Sam.

1006
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:43,504
We have gathered here...

1007
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,206
To unite in holy wedlock...

1008
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,198
Jim Redstone...

1009
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:50,104
And Honey Beach.

1010
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,995
Do you, Jim Redstone...

1011
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:54,518
Take Honey Beach...

1012
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,261
For your lawful wedded wife?

1013
00:55:56,776 --> 00:55:57,862
To love...

1014
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:01,563
To honor and to cherish
all the days of your life?

1015
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:04,399
I do!

1016
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:06,571
And do you...

1017
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:07,906
Honey Beach...

1018
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,039
- Take Jim Redstone...
- I, Sam Sharpe...

1019
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,578
- As your lawful...
- Take Renata Bella...

1020
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,804
To be my lawful
wedded wife....

1021
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,946
To love, honor and look on her...

1022
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:19,774
- Ush, ush!
- All the days of my life...

1023
00:56:19,815 --> 00:56:21,609
- That's not funny!
- Say that out!

1024
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:25,953
- Say it, Renata!
- Leave me alone!

1025
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:28,281
I, Jim Redstone...

1026
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:30,336
I, Jim Redstone...

1027
00:56:30,406 --> 00:56:31,883
Take thee, Honey Beach...

1028
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:33,805
Take thee, Honey Beach...

1029
00:56:33,831 --> 00:56:36,164
To be my lawful
wedded bride...

1030
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,445
I...

1031
00:56:38,011 --> 00:56:39,219
Renata Bella...

1032
00:56:40,103 --> 00:56:42,070
- Take Sam Sharpe...
- Sam!

1033
00:56:44,773 --> 00:56:47,773
This is not a fun game!

1034
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:52,406
And... Now you Honey....

1035
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,375
Repeat after me...

1036
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:56,563
I, Honey Beach...

1037
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,352
I, Honey Beach...

1038
00:56:58,843 --> 00:57:00,514
- Take Jim Redstone...
- I...

1039
00:57:00,953 --> 00:57:02,312
Take Jim Redstone...

1040
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,656
- Renata Bella...
- As my lawful wedded husband...

1041
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,203
- As my lawful wedded husband...
- Take Sam Sharpe...

1042
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,633
- To be my lawful wedded husband...
- Lawful wedded husband...

1043
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,789
To love, honor and cherish...

1044
00:57:12,815 --> 00:57:14,477
All the days of my life!

1045
00:57:16,742 --> 00:57:18,360
And may God bless you both!

1046
00:57:18,737 --> 00:57:20,265
And I now pronounce you...

1047
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:22,945
Man and wife.

1048
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,804
I would like to propose a toast!

1049
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:28,756
A toast!

1050
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,130
Those of you who, uh...

1051
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:33,351
Know me even
a little bit by now...

1052
00:57:33,402 --> 00:57:36,359
Aren't going to be surprised to hear
that I 'd like to make a toast...

1053
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:37,317
To the...

1054
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:40,492
Consummate happiness
of Jim and Honey,

1055
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:41,709
Jim and Honey!

1056
00:57:41,735 --> 00:57:43,755
Jim is
a heck of a guy.

1057
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:45,757
I don't know him
well myself...

1058
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:47,898
But I can tell by the way
Jan is sweet on him that...

1059
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,564
He must be one...

1060
00:57:49,656 --> 00:57:51,390
One heck of a swell guy.

1061
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:53,538
And Honey...

1062
00:57:54,617 --> 00:57:55,567
Well...

1063
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,960
I don't need to say
a lot about honey, uh....

1064
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,796
We did get a chance to get
acquainted a little bit...

1065
00:57:59,822 --> 00:58:01,452
In the men's room a
few minutes ago...

1066
00:58:04,104 --> 00:58:06,116
Just kidding!
Just kidding!

1067
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,473
All right!
All kidding aside...

1068
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:09,796
To Jim and Honey!

1069
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:11,452
- Cheers!
- Jim!

1070
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,156
Now, don't finish,
don't finish!

1071
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:18,093
Just leave a little bit.

1072
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:27,406
Inspired by the great happiness
and joy that I see around us...

1073
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,616
By the shining example of Mr. Joe Bella
and his lovely wife Marilyn...

1074
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,546
But darling Jan,
their daughter, and...

1075
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:38,445
Her lovely husband Peter...

1076
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:42,312
I would like to
take this this opportunity...

1077
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:46,023
To announce the engagement
of Miss Renata Bella...

1078
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:48,843
And Mr. Sam Sharpe IV.

1079
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:50,296
Ohoh, yeah!

1080
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:56,062
There is an old
Lithuanian proverb.

1081
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:57,445
It goes...

1082
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,874
Roughly translated, that means...

1083
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:13,195
"Dogs can't make their dreams
come through..."

1084
00:59:13,737 --> 00:59:15,421
"So people have to."

1085
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,015
And I just did.

1086
00:59:18,669 --> 00:59:20,038
Wow!

1087
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,442
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

1088
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,833
Thank you!

1089
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,614
Come on!
Once around!

1090
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,153
For the bride!

1091
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:08,091
It's a fertility rite.

1092
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,533
Eggs, bread...

1093
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,778
They are dancing
with genitals.

1094
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:15,631
Oh, come on, Joe,
they are not!

1095
01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:48,296
Look at that car!

1096
01:00:49,615 --> 01:00:51,194
You can't believe all this.

1097
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,241
I mean, look at it...

1098
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,796
It's like he's purchasing her.

1099
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,687
- How can she do that?
- Dad!

1100
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:00,709
Look, I'm old-fashioned...

1101
01:01:00,843 --> 01:01:02,922
And I'm as sexist
as the next guy.

1102
01:01:03,515 --> 01:01:06,264
But Christ, I've always
treated your mother as an equal.

1103
01:01:06,303 --> 01:01:10,309
Dad, we all got to let Renata
live her own life now, alright?

1104
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,708
A lovely ceremony.

1105
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:23,814
- It was beautiful.
- Thanks.

1106
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,723
I've been waiting for this dance
for over a quarter of a century.

1107
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,305
Oh, oh!

1108
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,129
Hello, hello! Hi!
Come on in!

1109
01:01:47,518 --> 01:01:48,582
Everybody!

1110
01:01:48,696 --> 01:01:49,746
Come on in!

1111
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:53,949
Yeah, come on down at
the front, you little guys...

1112
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:57,543
Got a rocket in your pocket
or are you just happy to see me?

1113
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,762
Um... I...

1114
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:10,504
I am overwhelmed.

1115
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,551
I... I'm standing here...

1116
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,887
In front of this microphone,
 and I'm...

1117
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:21,309
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed
by my beautiful bride.

1118
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:29,535
And I am overwhelmed by my
beautiful new mother in law...

1119
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:30,910
Marilyn Bella!

1120
01:02:34,728 --> 01:02:37,048
And I'm... I'm overwhelmed
by everybody, really....

1121
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:39,692
Every single person in this room is...
I... I...

1122
01:02:41,182 --> 01:02:42,622
You are love!

1123
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,723
Your are...

1124
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:46,348
Your are love!

1125
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:49,192
Embodied in
great looking outfits.

1126
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,934
Give yourselves a big
round of applause...

1127
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,970
Come on, really!

1128
01:02:53,004 --> 01:02:54,887
Come on!
Everybody!

1129
01:02:57,957 --> 01:02:59,153
Yeah!

1130
01:02:59,602 --> 01:03:01,082
Oh, ohohoh...

1131
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,220
There is one person here...

1132
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:06,965
Who's  Mr. Love...

1133
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:09,317
I'm not talking about
dollars and cents...

1134
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:11,473
When I say that he is
the richest man...

1135
01:03:11,648 --> 01:03:12,723
In this room.

1136
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:16,469
He is the richest man
in this room...

1137
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:18,599
Because of what
is in his heart.

1138
01:03:19,176 --> 01:03:20,980
You know whom
I'm talking about...

1139
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:22,731
Let's have a big
round of applause...

1140
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,141
For the big guy...

1141
01:03:24,444 --> 01:03:25,553
Mister...

1142
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:26,564
Joe...

1143
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:27,910
Head of the family...

1144
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,192
Bella!

1145
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:32,825
Joe!

1146
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,200
Come on up!

1147
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:35,341
Come on!

1148
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:36,752
Joe! Joe! Joe!

1149
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:37,996
Joe, come on!

1150
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:42,762
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
Go, go, go, go, go, go...

1151
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:54,014
Come on, Daddy!

1152
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:56,728
All right, all right...

1153
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:00,689
I'd just like to say that...

1154
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:04,509
Excuse me.

1155
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:11,018
Sorry...

1156
01:04:13,043 --> 01:04:14,767
I'd like to
sing this song...

1157
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:16,424
To Renata.

1158
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:21,181
But Sam, you should
listen carefully to it...

1159
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:23,391
Because for some
reason Renata...

1160
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,205
After meeting Sam...

1161
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:27,557
You're always humming this song.

1162
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,019
I mean, for some reason.

1163
01:04:30,471 --> 01:04:32,556
It's been in the air,
since you two met.

1164
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:38,204
"Fly me to the moon...

1165
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:43,150
And let me play
among the stars...

1166
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:47,220
Let me see
what spring is like...

1167
01:04:47,246 --> 01:04:50,610
On Jupiter and Mars.

1168
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:53,603
In other words...

1169
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,086
Hold my hand...

1170
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,501
In other words...

1171
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:05,696
Baby kiss me...

1172
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:10,548
Fill my heart with song...

1173
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:14,729
And let me sing
forever more...

1174
01:05:15,965 --> 01:05:18,972
You are all I long for...

1175
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,529
All I worship
and adore...

1176
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:25,636
In other words...

1177
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,440
Please be true...

1178
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,573
In other words...

1179
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:36,479
I love you.

1180
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,955
Oh, Renata, Renata please,
could you call it off...

1181
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,214
Easy Joe, no peeking!

1182
01:06:06,636 --> 01:06:07,589
Here we go!

1183
01:06:07,615 --> 01:06:09,241
And a drum roll please!

1184
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,367
Do you like it?

1185
01:06:13,393 --> 01:06:14,760
It's a potter's wheel!

1186
01:06:14,786 --> 01:06:16,142
Look at that!

1187
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:17,659
Isn't it great?

1188
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,165
Very few on the market!

1189
01:06:22,393 --> 01:06:24,924
Hey, hey, you 're getting
to be an expert!

1190
01:06:25,011 --> 01:06:26,005
My leg hurt.

1191
01:06:26,031 --> 01:06:27,346
Is it a flower?

1192
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:30,378
No it's... it's...
quite off center...

1193
01:06:30,964 --> 01:06:32,519
It's kind of an abstract.

1194
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:48,197
- Hey, Dad!
- Yes!

1195
01:06:48,753 --> 01:06:50,023
This is for Marilyn.

1196
01:06:50,714 --> 01:06:52,510
-  Thank you!
- And now to myself...

1197
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,111
- Do you like this?
- Oh, bravo!

1198
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,951
-Yeah?
- You look at this!

1199
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:57,831
Oh, you kids got to be bonkers!

1200
01:06:57,857 --> 01:06:59,596
Why, we really are, mom!

1201
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,876
We gave that crazy mirror...

1202
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,089
I'm not sure I want to be
a location salesman...

1203
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,467
A lot of money!

1204
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:19,396
More money than you
ever dreamed of earning!

1205
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:24,157
This is a very
generous offer!

1206
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:30,491
Awful!

1207
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:31,642
If you don't even
know what it is...

1208
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:34,064
How can you evaluate
it seriously for one?

1209
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,160
Daddy!
What do you think?

1210
01:07:38,873 --> 01:07:40,681
Come on!
Why don't you give it at least a try?

1211
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:42,384
Just try it out!

1212
01:07:42,908 --> 01:07:44,092
I can quit, right?

1213
01:07:44,118 --> 01:07:46,454
Anytime! This is America,
what do you think?

1214
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,332
Joe!

1215
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:03,997
Look at this!

1216
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:05,372
People used to have...

1217
01:08:05,997 --> 01:08:07,286
- Hi!
- Hi.

1218
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:10,754
- Where, Jan?
- Upstairs, I think.

1219
01:08:13,747 --> 01:08:15,020
Excuse me!

1220
01:08:16,895 --> 01:08:17,919
Excuse me.

1221
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:19,239
The refrigerator.

1222
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,120
It's a lot...

1223
01:08:27,567 --> 01:08:28,926
Of cashola!

1224
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:31,926
VCRs...

1225
01:08:32,497 --> 01:08:34,916
CD's, Digital TV...

1226
01:08:35,372 --> 01:08:37,301
Porsches... Shih-tzus...

1227
01:08:38,888 --> 01:08:39,879
Guess, how much?

1228
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:41,340
Wrong! Whatever
you just thought...

1229
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:42,717
It's twice what
you just thought!

1230
01:08:43,124 --> 01:08:44,567
He threw me a bonus!

1231
01:08:45,103 --> 01:08:46,536
How much of a bonus?

1232
01:08:50,212 --> 01:08:52,106
Come on!
Get it with your mouth!

1233
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,449
You know you want to!
What!

1234
01:08:54,622 --> 01:08:56,595
God, it's getting
hard to separate...

1235
01:08:56,621 --> 01:08:58,708
Your boon and
your professional role.

1236
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,154
Shit, what the hell was that?

1237
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:05,035
What a threat!

1238
01:09:05,328 --> 01:09:07,004
Mom, are you alright?

1239
01:09:08,089 --> 01:09:10,130
I want to put a bomb under
your father's chair...

1240
01:09:10,156 --> 01:09:11,356
And I'm going to light it.

1241
01:09:11,536 --> 01:09:13,520
He just sits there
in that robe.

1242
01:09:13,786 --> 01:09:15,215
All day.

1243
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,783
- All night!
- Ma, he's resting!

1244
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,291
Resting?
Hey!

1245
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,681
You want to talk about...
Wha... take a look at this place!

1246
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,509
I mean it's making beds,
hanging up clothes...

1247
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:27,765
Dusting, mopping, cooking,
doing windows, and...

1248
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:30,447
What is this supposed to be,
the thrill of my lifetime?

1249
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,093
- Shit!
- Ma, calm yourself!

1250
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:35,088
No, no, I'm sick of it!
I'm...

1251
01:09:35,127 --> 01:09:36,049
We were going to travel...

1252
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:38,058
We were going to go
deep sea fishing!

1253
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:39,515
I was going to learn Italian!

1254
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:41,799
Well. I've decided what
I really want to do.

1255
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,299
I want to build a
boat, paint it...

1256
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:46,617
Put it to sea.
and die on it!

1257
01:09:46,734 --> 01:09:49,051
Oh!
Go chase a flying...

1258
01:09:49,588 --> 01:09:51,916
What are you doing, sleeping
at twelve o'clock in the afternoon?

1259
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:53,227
Will you tell me that?

1260
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:55,322
I'm trying to daydream...

1261
01:09:55,853 --> 01:09:56,892
Marilyn.

1262
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:58,534
Now, why don't you
leave me alone, uh?

1263
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,384
Ever since I retired,
you can't take it, can you?

1264
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,651
Well...

1265
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:06,620
I'll be at my
pregnant daughter's...

1266
01:10:06,646 --> 01:10:07,704
If anyone cares.

1267
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,689
Dad!

1268
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,150
Nice view, uh?

1269
01:10:18,453 --> 01:10:19,392
Oh, yes!

1270
01:10:20,112 --> 01:10:21,081
Yeah.

1271
01:10:23,578 --> 01:10:24,822
You know, your mother...

1272
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:26,768
She doesn't understand...

1273
01:10:27,392 --> 01:10:29,205
I just want
to slow it down.

1274
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,853
Do nothing.

1275
01:10:32,664 --> 01:10:34,275
Sam could never stop working.

1276
01:10:34,411 --> 01:10:35,180
Never!

1277
01:10:35,393 --> 01:10:36,619
It worries me.

1278
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:45,231
I... I wish Sam
was more like you.

1279
01:10:46,249 --> 01:10:47,997
I wish he could
just relax

1280
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,614
You stopped working,
because you wanted to.

1281
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:05,067
Now, when you
were Sam's age...

1282
01:11:05,252 --> 01:11:07,067
You worked all hours too.

1283
01:11:07,574 --> 01:11:09,544
Of course I worked all hours.

1284
01:11:10,228 --> 01:11:12,067
I had you, I had Tony...

1285
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:13,122
My date!

1286
01:11:13,453 --> 01:11:14,833
Is my date home?

1287
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:17,114
Throw the turkey in the oven
and spread them!

1288
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:19,516
Hi, Sam.

1289
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:21,262
Oh, youyouyouyou...

1290
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:24,755
Dad!

1291
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:25,879
Hey!

1292
01:11:26,129 --> 01:11:27,440
I was just thinking of you.

1293
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,637
Got to go.

1294
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,588
Oh, don't go!

1295
01:11:30,614 --> 01:11:32,083
Hey, Joe,
don't go home yet!

1296
01:11:32,223 --> 01:11:33,692
Please, I need your
help on something.

1297
01:11:34,005 --> 01:11:35,288
I need your advice, okay?

1298
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:36,651
It takes just a minute.

1299
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,151
Come over here,
take a look at this.

1300
01:11:44,728 --> 01:11:45,712
Now...

1301
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:47,588
Which do you like better?

1302
01:11:49,155 --> 01:11:50,299
The blue or red?

1303
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:01,229
I like the blue.

1304
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:02,721
I do too!

1305
01:12:02,747 --> 01:12:04,822
Yeah, this one
is way too provocative.

1306
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:06,479
Now, first off...

1307
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:09,316
You start the thing off
 with a goddamn question.

1308
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:11,643
If I was sent a brochure...

1309
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,687
Of which I got a shitload
at work every day...

1310
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:16,151
And it started
with a question...

1311
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:17,963
I'd say they're assholes.

1312
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,401
They're being provocative
where I want...

1313
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:22,887
Safe.

1314
01:12:23,652 --> 01:12:25,682
They're asking questions,
where I want answers.

1315
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,932
- Really.
- Fuck them, I'd put it in the basket.

1316
01:12:29,139 --> 01:12:31,346
Renata, your father is one
smart cookie.

1317
01:12:33,389 --> 01:12:35,257
Well, no one has
to tell me that!

1318
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:36,822
One smart cookie.

1319
01:12:37,383 --> 01:12:39,526
What was that word
you just used?

1320
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,158
- Provocative?
- Provocative, right.

1321
01:12:43,787 --> 01:12:45,267
Mister bull's eye.

1322
01:12:46,435 --> 01:12:48,361
- You take the blue, right Joe?
- Yes.

1323
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,416
The blue.
Okay, okay.

1324
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:51,947
Im going with the red.

1325
01:12:52,216 --> 01:12:54,018
See, I'm going
for the new breed...

1326
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:56,174
I'm going for the people
who want provocative.

1327
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,096
Thank you Joe, I really
appreciate very much...

1328
01:12:58,122 --> 01:12:59,197
It was very helpful!

1329
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,815
Well, if you need
an old fart...

1330
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:03,768
Give me a call.

1331
01:13:04,832 --> 01:13:06,104
See you later, Joe.

1332
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:08,299
Old fart!

1333
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,760
Daddy, can I...
can I talk to you?

1334
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,208
Don't be late for
your grandmother's death memorial.

1335
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,654
- Okay.
- Bye, sweetheart.

1336
01:13:22,588 --> 01:13:23,698
Why?

1337
01:13:24,141 --> 01:13:25,721
What was it you just said?

1338
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:26,924
What?

1339
01:13:27,846 --> 01:13:28,988
You trapped him.

1340
01:13:30,237 --> 01:13:31,292
I did not!

1341
01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:33,207
Why did you talk to him
like that, why did...

1342
01:13:33,393 --> 01:13:35,268
Why did you trick him
like that?

1343
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:39,346
I asked his opinion,
because I...

1344
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,385
- I value him.
- Oh, Sam!

1345
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:44,008
Can't you be sensitive
to another person?

1346
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:46,096
Don't you notice what
he's going through?

1347
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:48,447
I think you are
underestimating your father.

1348
01:13:48,473 --> 01:13:51,471
Jesus, back off a little.
I'm worried on this.

1349
01:14:09,754 --> 01:14:10,807
Honey!

1350
01:14:11,018 --> 01:14:12,766
I think you'd better
get dressed.

1351
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:14,313
It's getting late.

1352
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:23,907
"Forse...

1353
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:27,930
"Non s'usano più...

1354
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:31,188
"Oh, mamma....

1355
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:37,438
"Ma la canzone mia
più bella sei tu...

1356
01:14:38,923 --> 01:14:42,048
"E per la vita non ti lascio...

1357
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:44,009
"Mai più.

1358
01:14:45,594 --> 01:14:47,258
Oh, mamma...

1359
01:14:49,938 --> 01:14:51,274
"Mamma...

1360
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,009
"Mai...

1361
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:58,578
"Più...

1362
01:15:06,781 --> 01:15:07,938
Wow!

1363
01:15:09,954 --> 01:15:11,118
Allright...

1364
01:15:11,468 --> 01:15:13,320
Let us enjoy ourselves.

1365
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:15,914
God!

1366
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:18,813
I really like your father.

1367
01:15:21,185 --> 01:15:22,422
It was nice, Dad.

1368
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:24,102
Thank you, Peter.

1369
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:26,388
It was great, Dad.

1370
01:15:26,414 --> 01:15:28,142
You know, there's a
song in Lithuanian...

1371
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:30,461
That's like that.
That honours the mother.

1372
01:15:30,596 --> 01:15:32,766
Joe, that was magnificent,
that was really...

1373
01:15:33,048 --> 01:15:35,336
- Magnificent.
- I don't want to hear that...

1374
01:15:35,754 --> 01:15:37,234
But thanks, Sam.

1375
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,328
I'm not kidding you,
it was...  it was magnificent.

1376
01:15:39,597 --> 01:15:40,430
Sam...

1377
01:15:40,864 --> 01:15:41,758
Cut it off!

1378
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:54,305
What the hell is he going to do?
Make a speech now...?

1379
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:56,140
Not appropriate here, Renata.

1380
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:57,156
Hello!

1381
01:15:58,124 --> 01:15:58,875
Hello!

1382
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:02,344
Reading...

1383
01:16:02,735 --> 01:16:03,922
Can you hear me?

1384
01:16:05,668 --> 01:16:06,797
Can you hear...?

1385
01:16:07,539 --> 01:16:08,531
Sam...

1386
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:09,829
What are you doing?

1387
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:13,696
I'm going to sing a Lithuanian song
I know about motherhood.

1388
01:16:13,843 --> 01:16:15,323
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

1389
01:16:15,509 --> 01:16:17,040
Uhm... You know...

1390
01:16:18,368 --> 01:16:19,238
The thing is...

1391
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:21,765
The Bellas are
a funny group, and...

1392
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,180
Well, they are very funny about
the memory of their mothers.

1393
01:16:25,274 --> 01:16:26,242
Don't sing, please Sam!

1394
01:16:26,268 --> 01:16:27,735
This is a song about a woman...

1395
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:30,361
Who's completely
devoted to her son.

1396
01:16:30,643 --> 01:16:32,923
Everything she does,
every action, you know...

1397
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:34,611
All the cooking and cleaning, everything!

1398
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:38,539
Is done for her son,
who is going on a journey...

1399
01:16:38,565 --> 01:16:39,252
It's really...

1400
01:16:39,278 --> 01:16:41,338
Yes, it sounds like
a wonderful song, but...

1401
01:16:41,628 --> 01:16:44,435
We got to hear it sometimes,
just not today. okay?

1402
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:47,696
You listen and you tell me after
if you think I was wrong, okay?

1403
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,617
Sam... uh...

1404
01:16:56,944 --> 01:17:00,844
I have the microphone in my hand,
because I can't seem to reach you.

1405
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:03,865
And I know it's my fault,
because I probably sound...

1406
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,992
As if I'm asking you
not to sing.

1407
01:17:06,216 --> 01:17:08,375
But I'm actually doing it, Sam.

1408
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:10,875
As I'm telling you, you can't!

1409
01:17:10,915 --> 01:17:12,321
You cannot do it!

1410
01:17:12,347 --> 01:17:13,633
Marilyn, I think you saw...

1411
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:16,565
Let me see what's going on daddy,
I want a taxi home.

1412
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,055
Give me the microphone
and go to your seat...

1413
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:21,063
And sit next to Renata
were you belong!

1414
01:17:21,089 --> 01:17:23,172
Marilyn, I want to sing a song
about mothers!

1415
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:25,248
Over my dead body, okay?
Now, go sit down!

1416
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:27,664
- I know how you feel, I really do...
- Give this to me right now!

1417
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,108
Listen, I want to sing
this song...

1418
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:32,053
And I know with my heart
this is the right place!

1419
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:36,311
It is absolutely the wrong place, and you're
the wrong person to sing today!

1420
01:17:36,762 --> 01:17:39,527
You have had a free rein over us,
but I'm telling you...

1421
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:41,209
As of this moment, it's over!

1422
01:17:41,443 --> 01:17:45,022
I will kill you before I let you sing that song
and upset my husband and his family!

1423
01:17:45,048 --> 01:17:46,780
Oh, go ahead, I'll kill you!

1424
01:17:47,857 --> 01:17:49,660
- Is that right?
- That's damn right!

1425
01:17:49,686 --> 01:17:51,139
Marilyn, I don't believe
that you really mean that!

1426
01:17:51,165 --> 01:17:52,389
Oh, I certainly do!

1427
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,904
- Wait, wait...
- Stop it!

1428
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,350
Wait, I just wanted... I...

1429
01:17:55,488 --> 01:17:57,504
- Look...
- Daddy, I want this thing...

1430
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,749
Don't worry, I have it, I have it!
Take it easy...

1431
01:18:00,233 --> 01:18:01,499
My God!

1432
01:18:02,014 --> 01:18:03,047
Damned...

1433
01:18:05,074 --> 01:18:05,984
Sam!

1434
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,193
You're tearing us all apart.

1435
01:18:16,497 --> 01:18:17,779
God.

1436
01:18:45,785 --> 01:18:47,098
Renata!

1437
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,785
Please forgive me.

1438
01:19:04,812 --> 01:19:06,902
I know you want me
to leave you alone.

1439
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,066
I know that.

1440
01:19:15,726 --> 01:19:18,194
I know you want to watch this,
but I have this....

1441
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,366
I have this really bad...

1442
01:19:21,978 --> 01:19:23,553
Feeling that...

1443
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:29,965
You know, if I walk out of the room,
you're going to decide not to forgive me.

1444
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:35,275
I keep thinking
that if I just...

1445
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:36,853
You know, don't move and...

1446
01:19:38,308 --> 01:19:39,908
Stay where I am, I'll...

1447
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,155
Think of something.

1448
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:50,726
You know, I'll...
I'll just...

1449
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:52,968
I'll get another chance with you,
I don't know.

1450
01:19:57,227 --> 01:19:58,827
I don't know a shit.

1451
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,755
Okay. Okay.

1452
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:30,468
There.

1453
01:20:31,604 --> 01:20:32,796
Now you can...

1454
01:20:33,798 --> 01:20:36,366
Now you can watch and you
don't have to look up if you don't want.

1455
01:20:41,898 --> 01:20:43,378
Is that you?

1456
01:20:56,116 --> 01:20:57,596
That's me.

1457
01:20:58,816 --> 01:21:00,296
That's me.

1458
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:22,132
My son is going
to have your spirit.

1459
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:24,960
There's Jan.

1460
01:21:26,106 --> 01:21:27,586
And Jan's fire.

1461
01:21:32,953 --> 01:21:34,553
Playing with daddy...

1462
01:21:36,538 --> 01:21:39,239
Renata, no one
can tear your family apart.

1463
01:21:45,506 --> 01:21:48,025
I hope he'll have
my father's goodness.

1464
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,135
And my mother's wisdom.

1465
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,346
He will.

1466
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:58,696
He will.

1467
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,299
We're going to have
a beautiful baby.

1468
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:11,361
Aren't we?

1469
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:30,307
It's a girl!

1470
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,287
I can't believe it!
Is she okay?

1471
01:22:33,313 --> 01:22:34,487
I didn't think
I could make it!

1472
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:35,443
Is she okay?

1473
01:22:35,469 --> 01:22:36,420
Yeah...

1474
01:22:36,969 --> 01:22:37,982
She's great!

1475
01:22:38,592 --> 01:22:40,080
Hi, mom....!

1476
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:42,396
Are you okay?

1477
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:44,203
I'm pretty tired!

1478
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,990
I'm so happy to see your mom!

1479
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,982
- She's got your eyes!
- Now, really, dad!

1480
01:22:53,586 --> 01:22:55,106
Look at her fingers....

1481
01:22:57,978 --> 01:22:59,310
Marilyn...

1482
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,810
About what happened
at the memorial yesterday...

1483
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,826
Oh, no, no, that was my fault!
You were just being enthusiastic.

1484
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:05,857
Sam!

1485
01:23:05,983 --> 01:23:07,624
Let's put all that behind us...

1486
01:23:07,704 --> 01:23:09,756
We got a good reason
to look ahead.

1487
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:21,490
I hired the band
for just ten minutes...

1488
01:23:21,991 --> 01:23:23,615
I thought, what the hell,
you know...

1489
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,840
I want to form a ring of love
around the baby.

1490
01:23:31,522 --> 01:23:32,655
Ok, Joe? Here!

1491
01:23:33,154 --> 01:23:35,178
You put your left
hand on Renata...

1492
01:23:35,204 --> 01:23:37,060
That's right, there we go.

1493
01:23:37,086 --> 01:23:39,404
Peter, take that hand,
and Jan...

1494
01:23:40,879 --> 01:23:42,263
Sorry, that's okay!

1495
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:43,943
Jan, take Peter's hand...

1496
01:23:43,969 --> 01:23:45,920
Marilyn, you can take
Tony's hand...

1497
01:23:45,946 --> 01:23:47,100
That's it!
That's it!

1498
01:23:47,126 --> 01:23:48,318
Gail...

1499
01:23:48,443 --> 01:23:50,678
There you go... That's it, honey...
Thank you very much!

1500
01:23:50,704 --> 01:23:51,896
And now Marilyn...

1501
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:53,481
Perfect!

1502
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,396
This is the song I wanted
to sing yesterday.

1503
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:54,537
I know, and she was
the same way...

1504
01:24:55,029 --> 01:24:56,131
No, no, no, you...

1505
01:24:56,379 --> 01:24:58,674
We believe one child
yields me have one option.

1506
01:24:59,123 --> 01:25:00,818
- You have enough...
- No, no...

1507
01:25:01,771 --> 01:25:04,053
Listen... Listen!
All we have to get...

1508
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:06,661
Excuse me!
All we have to get...

1509
01:25:06,865 --> 01:25:09,921
All we have to get
is the baptism's date.

1510
01:25:09,947 --> 01:25:12,553
Now, we shold be
capable of doing that!

1511
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,194
Okay! Okay! Okay!

1512
01:25:14,337 --> 01:25:16,349
I want Jan to be godmother...

1513
01:25:16,404 --> 01:25:18,409
And I would think
it would be an honor...

1514
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:20,618
I mean, I want Tony
to be godfather.

1515
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:24,498
And I'd like to add,
Sam here is being pretty terrific.

1516
01:25:24,524 --> 01:25:26,999
Though he has
friends of his own, okay...

1517
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:30,201
So he's quite happy that
Tony be godfather.

1518
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:32,830
Why do you have to
have the baptism on...

1519
01:25:32,856 --> 01:25:37,013
The first day that we are going away
on our very first vacation in 12 years...

1520
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:40,381
You know, my parents
are really not going to understand...

1521
01:25:40,412 --> 01:25:42,022
How their granddaughter...

1522
01:25:42,069 --> 01:25:45,217
Is born and is not baptized  on a
preordained date.

1523
01:25:45,243 --> 01:25:45,792
Sam...

1524
01:25:45,818 --> 01:25:48,060
That has been followed
in Lithuanian tradition...

1525
01:25:48,086 --> 01:25:49,553
- Sam...
- For all of their lives!

1526
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:51,800
I mean, they're really not
going to be able to understand...

1527
01:25:51,826 --> 01:25:52,700
- Sam!
- Why...

1528
01:25:52,726 --> 01:25:54,123
Sam, uh, ah...

1529
01:25:55,146 --> 01:25:57,170
I don't want to be rude,
but your parents...

1530
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,998
- Are dead!
- Exactly!

1531
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:00,152
- That's exactly the point!
- The bottom line is...

1532
01:26:00,178 --> 01:26:02,131
That Tony will not give up shit
to be there.

1533
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,472
The bottom line is...

1534
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:06,054
That you'd rather follow some
absolutely bullshit...

1535
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,537
Uh, uh, tradition...

1536
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:10,314
Rather than thinking about
my happiness, Gail's or Mikey's.

1537
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,448
- Okay!
- That's the bottom line...

1538
01:26:11,474 --> 01:26:12,671
Fuck you, Tony!

1539
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:14,279
Don't... ever...

1540
01:26:14,619 --> 01:26:16,896
- Say that to me again.
- Joe, do something!

1541
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:19,584
There is a baptism
and there's a date...

1542
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:21,599
You're the godmother
and you're the godfather...

1543
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:23,506
I hope you can
fucking attend.

1544
01:26:23,855 --> 01:26:24,873
Jan?

1545
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,826
You don't certainly have
to leave town, do you?

1546
01:26:26,852 --> 01:26:28,592
You're such a selfish bitch...

1547
01:26:28,974 --> 01:26:31,646
I can't believe, what a selfish...
I got it!

1548
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:32,865
Hey! Hey!

1549
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:34,109
That's it!

1550
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:35,381
That's it!

1551
01:26:37,537 --> 01:26:39,775
Now, the end, done,
It's finished.

1552
01:26:41,642 --> 01:26:42,896
I want everyone out.

1553
01:26:43,367 --> 01:26:44,591
Everyone!

1554
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:46,185
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1555
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:47,412
So Tony...

1556
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:49,513
And Gail...

1557
01:26:49,924 --> 01:26:51,623
Just go to your
and go home.

1558
01:26:52,369 --> 01:26:53,865
You did nothing wrong.

1559
01:26:58,595 --> 01:27:00,357
And Jan, Peter...

1560
01:27:00,712 --> 01:27:02,295
Go to your room, please.

1561
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,784
Joe...

1562
01:27:12,341 --> 01:27:14,638
- Maybe this isn't the right time.
- Marilyn, please.

1563
01:27:14,666 --> 01:27:15,964
Don't you start...

1564
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,451
I know what I'm doing.

1565
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,967
Joe, you know, if it's...

1566
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:22,740
A question of financial loss...

1567
01:27:22,774 --> 01:27:24,834
I'd be happy to make up
anything that Tony....

1568
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,076
Sam!

1569
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,373
I don't want
to discuss it further.

1570
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,248
Renata, I want you to ask Sam
because he is your husband...

1571
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:36,068
Ask him to wait
in the car for you.

1572
01:27:36,094 --> 01:27:37,678
Why are you acting
like this, daddy...

1573
01:27:37,704 --> 01:27:39,060
Renata, please!

1574
01:27:41,404 --> 01:27:44,232
Okay. Sam, would you please
go wait in the car for me.

1575
01:28:01,029 --> 01:28:02,681
What is this, ma...?

1576
01:28:05,172 --> 01:28:06,459
Renata...

1577
01:28:08,748 --> 01:28:11,388
I'm going to say something
for the first time in my life...

1578
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:13,771
Without consulting your mother...

1579
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:17,756
But I think she's going
to very much agree me.

1580
01:28:19,589 --> 01:28:21,537
Renata, Sam is
a wonderful man.

1581
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,529
He is a generous
and kind man.

1582
01:28:26,416 --> 01:28:27,998
But he is killing us.

1583
01:28:30,005 --> 01:28:31,405
He is killing us.

1584
01:28:33,069 --> 01:28:34,549
Is it true, Marilyn?

1585
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,760
He means so well.

1586
01:28:38,027 --> 01:28:39,507
Marilyn, is it true?

1587
01:28:43,576 --> 01:28:44,560
Yeah.

1588
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:46,428
How can you...

1589
01:28:47,766 --> 01:28:49,951
How can you
say that about Sam?

1590
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:52,349
He has done nothing!

1591
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:53,467
But...

1592
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:54,646
Great, great...

1593
01:28:54,672 --> 01:28:56,068
- Renata...
- Things for this family.

1594
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:59,467
Renata look,
I hate to say this...

1595
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:03,536
But I'm more afraid of what
will happen if I don't.

1596
01:29:05,265 --> 01:29:06,785
Now, you and the baby...

1597
01:29:10,702 --> 01:29:11,935
You're always...

1598
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:13,631
Forever welcome here.

1599
01:29:14,295 --> 01:29:17,224
But I do not want
Sam in this house again.

1600
01:29:18,115 --> 01:29:20,365
At least, you know,
not untill we all...

1601
01:29:20,817 --> 01:29:22,755
Get control of ourselves.

1602
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,482
I simply don't know
what else to do.

1603
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:30,412
I'm sorry!

1604
01:29:33,033 --> 01:29:36,060
Well. why don't you just get a gun
and blow my head off!

1605
01:29:36,858 --> 01:29:40,209
Because if Sam is not welcome here,
I am not welcome here.

1606
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,896
In fact...

1607
01:29:45,196 --> 01:29:48,482
Why don't you just douse the place
in kerosene and blow it up?

1608
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,560
Oh... and do me a favor...

1609
01:29:52,848 --> 01:29:54,334
Do not come to baptism.

1610
01:29:54,961 --> 01:29:56,568
You are not welcome.

1611
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:09,146
Renata, wait!

1612
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:10,616
No!

1613
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:11,881
You wait!

1614
01:30:12,831 --> 01:30:14,224
That man...

1615
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:16,021
I know he's different...

1616
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,654
I love that he's different...

1617
01:30:19,036 --> 01:30:20,373
I love that he flatters me...

1618
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:23,295
And he flatters mom, and Gail
and Tony and Jan and you.

1619
01:30:23,682 --> 01:30:25,256
Hell, Peter copies him!

1620
01:30:25,891 --> 01:30:27,467
You are impressed by him.

1621
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:31,106
So what if he gives gifts?

1622
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:33,144
If he is arrogant,
why shouldn't he be?

1623
01:30:33,243 --> 01:30:34,904
He is remarkable!

1624
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:40,153
This is my adventure, dad,
my goddamn adventure...

1625
01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:42,193
If you don't get it,
well, I'm sorry!

1626
01:30:47,783 --> 01:30:49,060
I take it back.

1627
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:51,513
I'm not sorry.
No way!

1628
01:31:27,501 --> 01:31:30,821
Once I thought, no,
once I wished...

1629
01:31:31,304 --> 01:31:35,298
That my parents would drive
off the road in their car and die.

1630
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:41,516
Because then I 'd be different.

1631
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:46,876
Those are your parents, Renata.

1632
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:51,352
Your irreplaceable parents.
Don't ever talk like that.

1633
01:31:56,856 --> 01:31:58,336
Okay, Sam.

1634
01:32:20,217 --> 01:32:21,391
- Here, Renata.
- I'm sorry.

1635
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:22,418
Ok, that's all right.

1636
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,622
- That's right.
- I'm sorry...

1637
01:32:29,814 --> 01:32:31,032
I've got it.

1638
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,962
Renata!

1639
01:32:55,628 --> 01:32:56,680
We are here!

1640
01:33:08,185 --> 01:33:09,298
Renata!

1641
01:33:10,748 --> 01:33:12,117
Get the baby!

1642
01:33:15,338 --> 01:33:16,494
Come on!

1643
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,768
We should be godparents!

1644
01:33:30,453 --> 01:33:31,885
Godmother, or what?

1645
01:33:43,546 --> 01:33:44,546
Sam...

1646
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:47,561
Well, isn't that my family....

1647
01:34:03,488 --> 01:34:04,888
Jan, Tony!

1648
01:34:04,935 --> 01:34:06,685
Tony, Tony!

1649
01:34:07,551 --> 01:34:08,731
Tony, Jan...

1650
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:11,366
- I didn't do that!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1651
01:34:11,505 --> 01:34:13,116
Button up your coat!
Button up!

1652
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:19,616
I am pleased to be here.

1653
01:34:27,226 --> 01:34:28,640
Remove the cap.

1654
01:34:28,673 --> 01:34:30,289
- Yes.
- He'll pour some water on her.

1655
01:34:31,571 --> 01:34:32,555
Thank you.

1656
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:40,628
Sam!

1657
01:35:41,644 --> 01:35:42,810
My God!

1658
01:35:44,483 --> 01:35:45,780
Oh, my God!

1659
01:35:46,342 --> 01:35:47,217
Oh, God!

1660
01:35:47,396 --> 01:35:49,248
- Peter, get an ambulance!
- Sam...

1661
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,733
Sam?

1662
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:03,530
So mom, butter's got
35 milligrams of cholesterol...

1663
01:36:04,067 --> 01:36:05,534
What's that, per ounce?

1664
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:07,394
No, that's one tablespoon.

1665
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:09,267
So...

1666
01:36:09,293 --> 01:36:11,251
With cholesterol deposits
in the arteries...

1667
01:36:11,277 --> 01:36:13,004
That's a no butter for Sam.

1668
01:36:13,038 --> 01:36:15,051
Yes, but turkey
is great, isn't it?

1669
01:36:15,498 --> 01:36:18,738
Yeah, but dark meat is saturated
with double fat proteins.

1670
01:36:18,848 --> 01:36:20,736
Ok, we'll just give Sam
all the white meat.

1671
01:36:20,762 --> 01:36:21,718
Right.

1672
01:36:21,744 --> 01:36:24,019
You know, maybe we
shouldn't even serve wine

1673
01:36:25,574 --> 01:36:27,629
I'm shocked for every
person in this house.

1674
01:36:28,879 --> 01:36:29,790
Mom...

1675
01:36:29,816 --> 01:36:31,769
It would be better clear a path
 to the back.

1676
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:33,290
You know, it would
be longer that way...

1677
01:36:33,316 --> 01:36:34,587
And those extreme
slings in temperature...

1678
01:36:34,613 --> 01:36:36,332
They can cause a
real shock to the...

1679
01:36:36,358 --> 01:36:38,359
The circulatory system of
heart patients...

1680
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,441
So, it's safer than to stay
with the front path.

1681
01:36:40,467 --> 01:36:41,540
Yeah, I think so.

1682
01:36:41,566 --> 01:36:45,115
Wait, you've all gone nuts, I mean,
Sam comes up the front door.

1683
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,926
And if he wants to
go out and make...

1684
01:36:46,952 --> 01:36:49,013
A fucking snowman, he'll do it!

1685
01:36:49,129 --> 01:36:50,785
And if he wants to smoke
a pack of cigarettes...

1686
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:52,873
He'll smoke a pack
of cigarettes!

1687
01:36:53,034 --> 01:36:55,409
Dad, he dies if he smokes,
he dies!

1688
01:36:55,535 --> 01:36:57,410
- Think of Renata, Joe!
- Yeah!

1689
01:36:57,942 --> 01:36:58,923
Under the tree!

1690
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:00,204
Really, dad...

1691
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:02,814
I mean, normally, a guy wants to jump
out of the window, okay...

1692
01:37:02,847 --> 01:37:04,300
But this is different, dad.

1693
01:37:04,394 --> 01:37:06,449
It's kinder to let the man
be a free man.

1694
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,558
Now, just think about that.

1695
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,910
Answer the door.

1696
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,769
- Hey, doll!
- Hi! He is here!

1697
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:19,097
He's doing fine!
Hi, ma!

1698
01:37:19,123 --> 01:37:19,876
Hi darling!

1699
01:37:19,902 --> 01:37:22,798
Although his bronchial tube
suddenly restricted...

1700
01:37:22,831 --> 01:37:25,257
But his inhaler regulated
him immediately.

1701
01:37:25,283 --> 01:37:26,239
My, God!

1702
01:37:26,449 --> 01:37:27,636
Merry Christmas!

1703
01:37:27,816 --> 01:37:29,567
- Hi Sam!
- Merry, merry!

1704
01:37:36,574 --> 01:37:38,480
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1705
01:37:38,514 --> 01:37:40,820
Oh, are we glad
to see you!

1706
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:42,394
You look well.

1707
01:37:44,113 --> 01:37:45,481
We sure are glad to see you!

1708
01:37:45,507 --> 01:37:47,831
- Sam, how are you?
- I'm great, how are you?

1709
01:37:51,433 --> 01:37:52,449
Yes, she's right, come on!

1710
01:37:52,482 --> 01:37:53,652
Why do you all go
into the house?

1711
01:37:53,678 --> 01:37:55,222
Let's go have some dinner,
come on!

1712
01:37:56,352 --> 01:37:57,807
Be careful. Tony!

1713
01:37:57,889 --> 01:37:59,183
Help your sister.

1714
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:08,558
You're okay, buddy?

1715
01:38:09,731 --> 01:38:11,519
In the family paradise.

1716
01:38:27,351 --> 01:38:28,289
Okay!

1717
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:56,853
Jan...

1718
01:38:57,127 --> 01:38:58,030
Pass that!

1719
01:38:58,056 --> 01:38:59,828
Ate that since
she was four years old!

1720
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:02,202
Not Nicole Whitman...

1721
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:03,260
But roasted!

1722
01:39:03,408 --> 01:39:04,150
Peter!

1723
01:39:04,971 --> 01:39:05,970
Thank you!

1724
01:39:07,502 --> 01:39:09,221
Sam, Sam...

1725
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,321
- There's really good meat up for you.
- No, no, it's okay...

1726
01:39:11,347 --> 01:39:13,145
I tried the white, I think I
want a little bit of the dark .

1727
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:15,384
This is fabulous!

1728
01:39:16,938 --> 01:39:18,102
Sam...

1729
01:39:18,595 --> 01:39:20,970
They are all on the attack
because you're eating dark meat.

1730
01:39:21,923 --> 01:39:23,141
But I say, live your life.

1731
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:24,831
And that doesn't mean
let me live it for you.

1732
01:39:24,915 --> 01:39:26,548
Thank you very much,
I just want to...

1733
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:29,173
Try a little bit of Marilyn's
fabulous turkey...

1734
01:39:29,423 --> 01:39:31,079
But I'm not going to make
a life habit of it.

1735
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:34,318
Recognize anything?

1736
01:39:34,352 --> 01:39:35,452
That's the bowl!

1737
01:39:36,019 --> 01:39:37,042
That's the bowl!

1738
01:39:37,757 --> 01:39:38,959
You made it!

1739
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:41,991
The thing!
You made it!

1740
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:43,877
You did it! I can't believe it!

1741
01:39:43,903 --> 01:39:44,686
I'm so proud...

1742
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:46,695
Well, you know, it's
slightly offset...

1743
01:39:46,721 --> 01:39:48,746
I think it's fantastic,
look at that!

1744
01:39:48,802 --> 01:39:51,576
Realy, it's got...
lines and everything...

1745
01:39:51,602 --> 01:39:53,975
It's built like a brick shithouse!

1746
01:39:54,825 --> 01:39:56,827
It took me about eight and
a half days to make!

1747
01:39:58,561 --> 01:39:59,964
I love it!
It's like...

1748
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:02,624
It has got fruit in there.
It has got utilitarian uses...

1749
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,452
And Marilyn, you
did everything like...

1750
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:09,717
Using with fruit, you could
use it with anything, right?

1751
01:40:22,553 --> 01:40:23,653
Excuse me.

1752
01:40:25,026 --> 01:40:26,060
Ren!

1753
01:40:27,991 --> 01:40:29,908
- Renata?
- Oh God!

1754
01:40:33,512 --> 01:40:34,635
Renata.

1755
01:40:35,547 --> 01:40:36,987
I'm sorry!

1756
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:47,860
I'm afraid
to make love with you!

1757
01:40:47,886 --> 01:40:49,947
I'm afraid
you'll die in my arms!

1758
01:40:50,153 --> 01:40:51,657
- And you are smoking!
- Renata.

1759
01:40:51,683 --> 01:40:53,931
No, no, I mean it!
No!

1760
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:57,361
What are you trying to do?
Die?

1761
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:03,072
You appear into my life like a
beautiful flash of light...

1762
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:04,743
And then just as suddenly go pfft!

1763
01:41:05,345 --> 01:41:05,796
Sam...

1764
01:41:05,822 --> 01:41:08,798
I am not going to die on you, Renata!

1765
01:41:09,074 --> 01:41:12,525
I'm living for the first time in my life,
I could kick death in the teeth!

1766
01:41:12,818 --> 01:41:15,376
I'd spit in it's
face, Renata, if...

1767
01:41:15,424 --> 01:41:17,689
Death had hands,
I'd chop them off!

1768
01:41:18,063 --> 01:41:21,478
If death had eyes, I'd burn
them out of their sockets for you.

1769
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:25,618
If death had a liver,
I'd bite it out wit my teeth!

1770
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,057
And stamp on it!

1771
01:41:27,113 --> 01:41:29,513
- You would, uh?
- I would! I would!

1772
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,290
And you know what else?

1773
01:41:34,546 --> 01:41:35,759
What else?

1774
01:41:43,919 --> 01:41:45,126
Come over here!

1775
01:41:47,636 --> 01:41:49,478
Come over here
and sit on my lap.

1776
01:41:52,077 --> 01:41:53,009
No!

1777
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,439
You come to me.

1778
01:42:10,974 --> 01:42:12,267
Okay!

1779
01:42:22,401 --> 01:42:23,837
And if death...

1780
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:26,892
Had a cock...

1781
01:42:31,144 --> 01:42:32,923
If death had a cock...

1782
01:42:39,006 --> 01:42:40,915
You'd kick him in the balls.

1783
01:42:42,676 --> 01:42:44,813
And send him off
squealing away...

1784
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:11,666
Here we go!

1785
01:43:11,924 --> 01:43:13,775
- I can do it! I can do it!
- Okay.

1786
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,340
The baby bleats.

1787
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:23,777
Hey... hey!

1788
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:26,948
Hey, you know we are going to skate
out here together one day?

1789
01:43:27,136 --> 01:43:28,085
Yes we are!

1790
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,636
Yes we are!

1791
01:43:30,448 --> 01:43:33,277
I'm going to skate faster
than anyone has ever skated...

1792
01:43:33,513 --> 01:43:34,753
In the history...

1793
01:43:34,878 --> 01:43:35,872
Of heart patients.

1794
01:43:35,926 --> 01:43:37,112
Here!
Here! Here! Here!

1795
01:43:37,138 --> 01:43:37,875
Well!

1796
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:39,605
Let's not break any records yet.

1797
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,323
- Here we go!
- Here we go.

1798
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:43,534
So what do you want to see?

1799
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,011
My figure eights?

1800
01:43:45,373 --> 01:43:46,839
My spin? One leg?

1801
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,495
Or one legged spin, what?

1802
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,112
You see that hole out
there in the ice?

1803
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:54,558
It's like...
like a fishing hole...

1804
01:43:54,678 --> 01:43:56,998
- It's like a pile of ice and...
- Ye, ye, ye, I see it!

1805
01:43:57,292 --> 01:43:59,315
Go straight out there...
and then...

1806
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,784
- Come right back.
- Yeah, sure!

1807
01:44:27,882 --> 01:44:29,047
Not bad.

1808
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,609
Not bad!

1809
01:44:31,872 --> 01:44:32,968
Sam!

1810
01:44:37,436 --> 01:44:38,811
Are you crazy?

1811
01:44:42,012 --> 01:44:43,312
Let's go back.
I have had enough.

1812
01:44:43,346 --> 01:44:44,406
No, no, no!

1813
01:44:44,509 --> 01:44:45,555
One more!

1814
01:44:46,178 --> 01:44:47,328
The ice bar.

1815
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:52,578
Okay.
You got it!

1816
01:45:21,677 --> 01:45:22,849
Hey, you?

1817
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:38,185
Watch me go backwards!

1818
01:45:39,259 --> 01:45:40,509
Backwards!

1819
01:45:53,084 --> 01:45:54,266
Sam?

1820
01:45:58,754 --> 01:45:59,938
Sam!

1821
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:02,680
Sam?

1822
01:46:05,167 --> 01:46:06,266
Sam?

1823
01:46:08,751 --> 01:46:09,771
Sam!

1824
01:46:10,944 --> 01:46:11,998
Sam!

1825
01:46:12,337 --> 01:46:13,404
Sam!

1826
01:46:14,984 --> 01:46:16,121
Sam!

1827
01:46:22,004 --> 01:46:23,113
Sam!

1828
01:46:24,058 --> 01:46:25,167
Sam!

1829
01:46:25,577 --> 01:46:26,824
No!

1830
01:46:27,175 --> 01:46:28,574
Oh, no!

1831
01:46:29,109 --> 01:46:30,753
God, no!

1832
01:46:31,244 --> 01:46:32,188
No!

1833
01:46:32,821 --> 01:46:34,024
No!

1834
01:46:35,641 --> 01:46:37,180
No!

1835
01:46:39,592 --> 01:46:41,072
No!

1836
01:47:38,735 --> 01:47:39,735
Jan!

1837
01:47:41,633 --> 01:47:43,734
I had the greatest
time of my life.

1838
01:47:45,857 --> 01:47:47,602
The greatest time ever.

1839
01:48:12,970 --> 01:48:14,578
Time to sleep, little thing.

1840
01:48:16,016 --> 01:48:17,609
Are you sleepy, honey?

1841
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:33,648
I used to love watching you sleep
when you were that age.

1842
01:48:47,468 --> 01:48:50,483
Why don't you come and lie down
with daddy and me a few minutes?

1843
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,281
You're going to need
your strength today.

1844
01:49:09,591 --> 01:49:10,734
Hi, doll.

1845
01:49:11,117 --> 01:49:12,640
Are you going to lie down?

1846
01:49:18,477 --> 01:49:19,786
Come on, baby!

1847
01:49:33,106 --> 01:49:34,586
I love you guys.

1848
01:50:44,225 --> 01:50:45,875
One for the big guy.

1849
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:52,314
"Fly me to the moon...

1850
01:50:52,613 --> 01:50:56,508
"Let me play among the stars...

1851
01:50:57,567 --> 01:51:02,016
"Let me see
what spring is like on...

1852
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:04,859
"Jupiter and Mars...

1853
01:51:05,597 --> 01:51:07,237
"In other words...

1854
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:11,571
"Hold my hand...

1855
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,641
"In other words...

1856
01:51:16,844 --> 01:51:19,102
"Baby kiss me...

1857
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,555
"Fill my heart with song...

1858
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:28,930
"And let me sing
forever more...

1859
01:51:30,113 --> 01:51:33,259
"You are all I long for...

1860
01:51:33,285 --> 01:51:36,938
"All I worship and adore...

1861
01:51:38,173 --> 01:51:39,875
"In other words...

1862
01:51:40,813 --> 01:51:43,813
"Please be true...

1863
01:51:46,337 --> 01:51:48,578
"In other words...

1864
01:51:48,819 --> 01:51:51,414
"I love you"
