<i>Episode 7</i>

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,978
Lift your face.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,716
What's wrong?

6
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:35,049
She said something to you?

7
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:37,150
Was she giving you a hard time?

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,495
It's not that.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,700
No.

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,263
No.

11
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,090
No, Mom.

12
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,569
No, Mom.

13
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,311
Don't come near me.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,510
Was that her mom?

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,013
What?

16
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,715
Oh, nothing.

17
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:09,227
Here.

18
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:26,188
<i>For twelve years,
I lived getting beat up.</i>

19
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:27,745
<i>You think I would be scared of this?</i>

20
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:29,602
<i>Dying?</i>

21
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:31,117
<i>I'm not scared at all.</i>

22
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:35,810
I don't care if you harass me,
just don't harass my daughter!

23
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,377
Oh Yu Mi, I never abandoned you.

24
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:45,075
Seven years ago, you were
the one who left me.

25
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:52,573
From now on, I'll protect you.

26
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:59,466
I'll never let go
of these hands ever again.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,449
My daughter...

28
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,990
I'll protect you.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,139
<i>Ms. Oh, please go to the VIP room.</i>

30
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:35,887
Please go to the Soo Yeon Cosmetics
headquarters in Sinsa Dong.

31
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,372
A little more on the inner lips.

32
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:57,474
I love it.
Nice, right?

33
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,572
I see why you were
so adamant about this.

34
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,675
It's a great idea.

35
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:08,609
I told you, my Ha Nui did it again.

36
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,627
"My Ha Nui"?

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,479
Okay.

38
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,026
- Ms. Oh, are you finished?
- Yes.

39
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,467
Everyone is going
to talk about how pretty

40
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:17,906
the female employees at
Soo Yeon Cosmetics are.

41
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,979
Everybody looks so good.

42
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:23,717
How about if you include
average people as models?

43
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,457
They can be of all different ages.

44
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,846
That's a good idea.

45
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,878
I think that would be nice.

46
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,074
This one will be a big hit too.

47
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:34,117
You know she doesn't
just complement anyone.

48
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,437
Oh, yeah.

49
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:39,211
<i>Way to go, we rock, yay, yay...</i>

50
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:43,400
On that note, I'll treat
everyone to lunch today!

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,412
Let's go.

52
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:48,451
Of course, you don't say
you'll treat me to lunch.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,706
- Come with us, Director.
- No thanks.

54
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,214
I have lunch plans.

55
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,829
Sexy Q came out nice.

56
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,526
And you've got a good
marketing concept.

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,358
Your mom must be so proud.

58
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,920
I wish I had a daughter like you.

59
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,733
Hold on.

60
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,000
Yu Mi!

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,783
Let's go eat lunch together.
You didn't even eat breakfast.

62
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,415
I'm not that hungry.

63
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,122
You go eat.

64
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:28,629
Yu Mi!

65
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:39,620
You haven't been smiling, sleeping,
or eating well for these past few days.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,047
If I were you, and you were me,
what would you say?

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,728
I'm so disappointed in myself that
I can't be of any help to you.

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,437
Give me a hint.

69
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:55,322
How can I help you?

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,800
I just don't have much appetite.

71
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:04,725
Did you hear from your mother?

72
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:12,529
Why do you ask that so suddenly?

73
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:18,300
That customer that walked
out of your makeup room...

74
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,769
Is she her?

75
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,166
No...

76
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,538
She's my regular customer.

77
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,822
- What do you want to eat?
- Something expensive.

78
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,514
Ha Nui, don't worry about me.
Go eat something good.

79
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,519
I'll eat if I get hungry.
I just don't have much appetite.

80
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,783
You worked hard,
you should come with us.

81
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:39,994
Let's just say that I ate.

82
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:44,017
Yu Mi...

83
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:49,853
What does it feel like
to have no appetite?

84
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,285
How is it possible
to have no appetite?

85
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:56,050
It drives me nuts that
I have so much appetite.

86
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:03,870
- What diet?
- You can eat.

87
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,266
- No, I need to diet.
- What are you talking about?

88
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,992
I feel like there's a wall.
It's so upsetting.

89
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,603
But I'm still so worried about her.

90
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:18,367
"Let's not care.
She probably wants to be alone."

91
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,242
"Let's wait until
she feels like talking."

92
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:21,411
I know all this

93
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:24,927
- but I still get worried.
- That's who you are.

94
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:29,906
Does she have something
that she can't share with me?

95
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,062
She didn't say anything
to your mother, right?

96
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:39,218
She isn't eating at all.
I'm afraid she'll faint.

97
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:44,490
Do you have any idea
how I can help her?

98
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:54,338
What is it?

99
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,653
What is it now?

100
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:10,000
Healing food for the one you love?

101
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,625
Healing food.

102
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,622
I'll be right there.

103
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,067
I just need a few minutes.

104
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:27,319
Where are you going?

105
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,725
- Going out for lunch?
- Yes.

106
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,555
I'll be back.

107
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,954
- Shes a bit strange these days, no?
- She must be worried about something.

108
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:43,663
- But she's not the type to talk.
- I feel bad for her mother-in-law.

109
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,596
She's a talented girl,
but she has a bad personality.

110
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:50,170
Ha Nui's the one with
great personality.

111
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,505
She's got a lot of heartache,
but she can't show it.

112
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,803
She has no choice
but to keep it all in.

113
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,822
Yu Mi reminds me of the old you.

114
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,201
I don't like gloomy people.
They're so frustrating.

115
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,965
Don't even think about hiding
me in a corner somewhere.

116
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,886
- Sit down.
- There are so many people here.

117
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:28,274
- Come on, let's get out.
- When you were twenty-two

118
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,855
and you tried to kill yourself on
that bridge after getting dumped

119
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,250
there were people there
when I dragged you down.

120
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,472
When you blew all your
money on horse racing

121
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,094
and I brought you home when
you were sleeping on the streets

122
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:41,120
I didn't try to hide you.

123
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,730
Why are you bringing that up now?

124
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,043
Jo Dal Yeon might come to see you.

125
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,336
Why?

126
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,037
Did something happen?

127
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,046
I just met with her.

128
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,932
- We fought a little.
- What?

129
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:59,596
Why would you provoke that crazy woman?

130
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:02,148
When I think about that night,
I pee in my sleep.

131
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,698
You fought when you should
be crawling before her?

132
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,993
Why would you poke around the beehive?

133
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,379
She harassed Yu Mi.

134
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,006
How can I do nothing?

135
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:14,505
I put her in her place.

136
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,889
- Where?
- In front of Yu Mi.

137
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,769
What?

138
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,601
I apologize in her place.

139
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,731
My mom made a mistake.

140
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:31,152
How touching.

141
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:32,953
What's with you two?

142
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,918
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you always so sorry?

143
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:38,206
I'm so sick and tired of
hearing that from you.

144
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,456
Are you scared that
I'll do something to your mom?

145
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:45,155
Or have you still not been able
to get rid of your nice girl complex?

146
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:48,724
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:52,250
No matter how much you beg,
I won't forgive your mom.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,042
I can't say that I have
nothing to be ashamed of.

149
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,001
But at least I never ran away
with someone else's money.

150
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:03,687
If people like your mom live well,
how is that fair?

151
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,248
Yu Mi.

152
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,691
I'm really curious.

153
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:12,456
Are you doing this because
you really care about your mom?

154
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:18,365
My grandmother raised me

155
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,916
after my mother ran away.

156
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,217
After my grandmother passed away,
I went through so much hardship.

157
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:28,384
If I ever meet my mother again,
I would never forgive her.

158
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,831
What's your true feeling?

159
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,582
Yu Mi must have been so shocked.
She's such a fragile girl.

160
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:41,907
Is that why she called me "Madame
after not seeing me for seven years?

161
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,788
- What do you mean?
- She's my own daughter, I know her well.

162
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,178
She's a strong girl.

163
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,875
I really don't know.

164
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,001
So Yu Mi's okay.

165
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:56,714
You irked that crazy lady, what
if she treats you even worse?

166
00:10:56,714 --> 00:11:00,100
Get 300 million in Nam Gyu's name
and send it to me quick.

167
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,831
You think 300 million is a joke?

168
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,886
Do you know what kind
of trouble he'll be in

169
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:07,830
if they find out he spent company money?

170
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,022
After everything he's done
for the company

171
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:12,635
he can't even touch that money?

172
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,065
What a good life...

173
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:44,273
Soo Yeon Cosmetics was nothing
but a small start-up company.

174
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,596
Who do they think made
the company grow this much?

175
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:49,433
Using a few hundred million won
is embezzlement?

176
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,269
Get me the money by today.

177
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:00,404
Nam Gyu's working hard trying
to expand into the Chinese market.

178
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:04,168
I should be helping him, not thinking
about ways to steal company money!

179
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,739
My conscience won't allow me.

180
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:10,303
Oh my God...

181
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,365
No way.

182
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,919
You should go in, first.
I'll be right there.

183
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,722
Let's go.

184
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,860
Hello.

185
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:26,427
What are you doing here?

186
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:31,089
I was just passing by, and I saw a cafe.
You work here?

187
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,835
Yes, I wasn't sure if
it was really you.

188
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,782
You look so elegant.

189
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,275
Have a cup of coffee, my treat.

190
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,885
No.

191
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,485
It's good to see you here.

192
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,884
And I want to thank you
for putting ointment on Min Ji.

193
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,203
What the heck?

194
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,854
Why are they so close?

195
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,600
They are smiling.

196
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,693
They know each other?

197
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,006
What the heck is going on?

198
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:10,291
Seeing you out like this,
you seem so different.

199
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,860
You are so glamorous.

200
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,320
I'll take it as a compliment.

201
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:25,674
Our department just
launched a new lipstick.

202
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:29,475
Maybe that's why, but I've
been noticing everyone's lips.

203
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,975
It must be a job-related illness.

204
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,480
I don't think so.

205
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,573
What?

206
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:38,596
An artist getting cervical disc
or intervertebral disc...

207
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:42,571
Someone who gets varicose veins
from working while standing all day...

208
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,754
Those are what you call
job-related illnesses.

209
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:49,631
People who do hard labor
will laugh at you.

210
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,703
Yeah?

211
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:54,692
I guess so.

212
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:56,865
Oh.

213
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,019
I work for the product development team.

214
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:08,533
We want to use employees and other
regular people to model our new lipstick.

215
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,706
I would like you to be part of it.

216
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,597
As a model?

217
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,726
I'm taken aback.

218
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,408
And a little flattered.

219
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:20,620
When do I have to let you know by?

220
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,283
Tonight?

221
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:25,173
I have a cooking class
in the afternoon.

222
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:27,236
You can call me tomorrow morning.

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,371
You take cooking lessons?

224
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:30,759
Getting ready for marriage?

225
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,866
I don't know what happened to my sister.

226
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,912
She can't sleep or eat well these days

227
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:38,869
so I want to make her yummy food.

228
00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:43,804
And my dad's birthday is coming up,
so I want to cook for him myself.

229
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:47,195
You are very considerate,
unlike young people these days.

230
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,996
I'll think about it, and call you.

231
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:51,982
Okay, I'll be waiting.

232
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:53,500
Then.

233
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:02,421
You want to cook for
your father's birthday?

234
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,876
Too bad, by then, he'll
be over at our house.

235
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,581
Keep dreaming.

236
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:16,571
He should have received
the gift by now.

237
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:19,000
Just like the green forest

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,543
that grows despite
the heavy rainstorms and strong sunrays

239
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:27,409
using nature's wisdom

240
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:31,067
Soo Yeon Cosmetics will bring you
clean and clear complexion.

241
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,764
We will bring you...

242
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:37,206
Who is there?

243
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,660
Mr. Oh?

244
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,446
This package arrived from Korea.

245
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,990
From Korea?

246
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,017
Yes.

247
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,184
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

248
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,904
Yu Mi.

249
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,946
Wow, I wonder what she sent.

250
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:13,903
"Package was delivered"?

251
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,407
What's this?

252
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,629
Mom!

253
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,259
Mom!

254
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,268
Your mom's not here, yet.

255
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:32,735
Should I call her?

256
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,125
- What?
- Your daughter came by.

257
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,367
She came to apologize for you.

258
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,333
<i>She works in your place.</i>

259
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,859
And she apologizes in your place.

260
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,257
What kind of a mother are you?

261
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,170
<i>I told her that I won't
accept her apology.</i>

262
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,308
Mi Ja.

263
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,941
I'm very angry today.

264
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:01,991
I'm sure you're ready to pay
for irritating me, right?

265
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,385
You better be prepared.

266
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,011
Do you understand, Chun Mi Ja?

267
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,420
She's not picking up?

268
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:16,305
Let's get back in the car.

269
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:18,390
We can drop off your friends,
and come back later.

270
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,782
You're that cute girl.

271
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:29,079
You must be the princess
that moved in next door.

272
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,756
You live in unit 302, right?

273
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:33,986
- Yes.
- Why is she going back on the bus?

274
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,806
I can't get in touch with her mom.

275
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,016
Do you want me to take you home?

276
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,929
<i>Yeah, Mi Ja.</i>

277
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,115
Chun Soo Chang.

278
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,773
You better take care of it
by tonight, got it?

279
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:52,189
<i>Mi Ja, Mi Ja!</i>

280
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,953
Yes.

281
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,628
I'm on my way there now.

282
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,307
Our neighbor?

283
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:03,817
Will you do that for me?

284
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:07,016
Yes, please tell her that
I'll go pick her up later.

285
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,693
Okay.

286
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:16,372
Finally, I'll get to go to
Nam Gyu's house today.

287
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,271
My brother, Attorney Sung Soo!

288
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:39,410
Prosecutor Park!

289
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,388
What brings you here?

290
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,468
I came to see you.

291
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,720
- You don't believe that, do you?
- Of course, not.

292
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,082
Investigative files from
Macheon murder case.

293
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:54,146
I have to take on this case.

294
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:58,733
You know Dad is worried that you are
taking on all these scary cases, right?

295
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,862
What case do we have
that's not scary?

296
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,526
Did you hear that
Professor Lee Joong Myung

297
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:10,102
will take office as
the director of the law school?

298
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,208
His students are getting together.
Let's go.

299
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,446
- Today?
- Yeah.

300
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,807
Nobody will be home anyway.

301
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:19,665
Mom went out to transform
herself from head to toe.

302
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:23,310
It looked like she was going
out for a date with Dad.

303
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:26,597
I need to go to Min Suk's place today.

304
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,459
Oh, that chef?

305
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,732
Why?

306
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,169
- You're going to take cooking lessons?
- Yeah.

307
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:34,246
What?
Are you serious?

308
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:38,018
I can't just keep on making
abalone porridge.

309
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,892
Park Sung Soo,
you're the best.

310
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:43,258
You put into action what
other people only dream about.

311
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:45,300
- You're the best.
- The best.

312
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,058
I need to get going.

313
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:52,253
We stayed in the same tummy for
ten months, eating the same food.

314
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,143
How can we be so different?

315
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,733
We drank the same breast milk
and the same formula.

316
00:19:56,733 --> 00:20:00,378
Where does your filial piety come from?

317
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:03,167
You talk so much
when I need to get going.

318
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,744
You better control
your drinking today.

319
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:09,250
You better not call me all drunk.

320
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,450
I'm going.

321
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,432
Mom would have been so disappointed
if she only gave birth to me.

322
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,855
Thank you for being born with me!

323
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,777
Madame, are you sure it was
okay to leave the hospital?

324
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:38,968
I had no idea what to do
when you collapsed in front of me.

325
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,053
I'm okay now.

326
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,662
It's not just once or twice.
This is crazy.

327
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:51,548
You should have just given up
on the twins then.

328
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,836
Don't say that.

329
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,467
Why is my illness the kids' fault?

330
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,229
I'm not making anything up.

331
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:59,013
You wouldn't be sick if you
had take your medicine then.

332
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:01,407
There's a right time
to receive treatment.

333
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,734
You didn't put
a single pill to your mouth

334
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:06,060
saying it's bad for the baby.

335
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,064
You didn't even drink a drop
of tonic medicine, either.

336
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:12,682
It's a miracle that you spent
ten months like that.

337
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,602
You're the one who loved the babies
the most when they were born.

338
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:20,296
I did love them.

339
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:24,050
But who knew you would suffer
all your life like this?

340
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,493
Now, they are all grown up,
and they think they grew up on their own.

341
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:33,223
I get so upset.

342
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:36,968
It's because of them that
you suffer like this.

343
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:40,291
They don't even know that
you risked your life to have them.

344
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,740
That's not true.

345
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,363
You better not say any
of that in front of the kids.

346
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:50,596
I kept my mouth zipped
for twenty-five years.

347
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:52,673
Why would I say anything now?

348
00:21:54,616 --> 00:22:01,807
I'm just venting right now to
you because I'm so upset.

349
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,474
Mom.

350
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:18,598
It seems like you're
in a good mood today.

351
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:21,417
I got energized after
eating your abalone porridge.

352
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:24,318
I'm on my way to see Dad.

353
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:25,705
Good.

354
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:29,724
Go enjoy your time together.

355
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,085
- And enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

356
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,376
See you later.

357
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,781
Let's make a toast.

358
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,489
- Nice to see you.
- It's been a long time.

359
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:56,608
I hear you have something up your sleeve
for the National Assembly Inspection.

360
00:22:57,527 --> 00:23:01,057
I'm not doing anything different
from others, nothing special.

361
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,625
There's a rumor that you're
living at your office these days.

362
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,492
What big item do you have on your hands?

363
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:21,846
You might get kicked out of
the house by your wife.

364
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:24,101
What's he talking about?

365
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:31,346
At our age, it's harder to please
our wives than the citizens.

366
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:34,584
- Don't you agree?
- That's true.

367
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:38,561
<i>You have a guest coming in.</i>

368
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,596
We're expecting someone else?

369
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,298
No, everyone's here.

370
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,340
Honey...

371
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,027
What's going on?
I thought she was too sick to come out.

372
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,182
What's wrong with you?

373
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:02,845
Worrying is an illness, too.

374
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:05,441
Why did you do that when
she's completely fine?

375
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:11,307
Since you came all the way here,
please come in.

376
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,981
No.

377
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:15,018
Please go ahead with your conversation.

378
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,214
I'll get going then.

379
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:21,912
- Go get her, what are you doing?
- Please excuse me.

380
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,306
Wait...

381
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:28,094
Look...

382
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:50,484
Hi.

383
00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:52,691
Hey, Park Sung Soo!

384
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,612
- You really came.
- It's been so long.

385
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,951
Have you been well?
How's your mom doing?

386
00:24:58,951 --> 00:25:01,000
Thanks to you,
she's gotten a lot healthier.

387
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,217
- I'm not late, am I?
- Not at all.

388
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:08,530
It's my wish to see you be sorry
for being late once.

389
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:11,270
Please take care of this.

390
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,950
Better if you can put the recipes
on each of the places.

391
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,079
I need to use the bathroom.

392
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,816
Hey, make sure you wash your hands well.

393
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,567
Of course.

394
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:36,202
Hello.

395
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,500
Can I help you with anything?

396
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:50,636
Seriously!

397
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:54,691
What the heck!
You're sitting on my hand!

398
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,694
<i>I'm dead, he is the chef?</i>

399
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,682
<i>Why does he have to be the teacher?</i>

400
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,194
Nice to meet you.

401
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,497
You're not going to cook
like that, are you?

402
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,491
- Pardon?
- Go wash your hands.

403
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,471
And remove your nail polish.

404
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:13,348
Nail polish too?

405
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:16,051
Okay.

406
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:21,931
She seems very familiar...

407
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,739
Why did you put your hands on my butt?

408
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,833
- Are you a pervert?
- Perv...

409
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:35,503
You were sitting on it
on purpose to trouble me?

410
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,060
Trouble you?

411
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,232
But why is she so nice today?

412
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:49,104
Out of all the chefs,
why did it have to be him?

413
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:55,634
I can totally see how
much he will nag.

414
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,967
She doesn't look like the type
to be taking cooking classes.

415
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:08,130
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

416
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:12,096
They are all clean now.

417
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,589
Tie your hair.

418
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,644
If I use this, I'll
lose a lot of hair.

419
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,895
Don't leave out any hair,
and tie it tight.

420
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:36,438
Nobody wants hair in their food.

421
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:37,636
Okay.

422
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:38,718
Tight.

423
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,971
Is everybody here?

424
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:58,756
You're not the chef?

425
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,634
No.

426
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:03,488
Then why did you give out the recipe
and boss me around?

427
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,541
I never told you that I'm the chef.

428
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:09,003
If you're not here to chat,
let's listen.

429
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:12,415
It's very nice to meet all of you.

430
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:14,375
Hello.

431
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,826
Let's take a look at
the ingredients.

432
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:19,836
<i>Why did he act like
he's the teacher?</i>

433
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:21,194
<i>What the heck?</i>

434
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:23,256
Do you know what's most
important about cooking?

435
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:26,334
You're not taking notes?
Don't ask me later.

436
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:28,659
- Take notes.
- I will.

437
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:40,737
Why did you hit me with your head?

438
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:44,991
You're the one who stuck
your butt out at my head!

439
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:48,034
What's going on over there?

440
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:52,115
Get up.

441
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:01,679
You shouldn't do this here.

442
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:08,730
You're here to make healing
food for your loved one, right?

443
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,955
Yes.

444
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:14,519
We'll start right now while
thinking about that one we love.

445
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:24,271
<i>I feel a wall between us.
It's so upsetting.</i>

446
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:26,108
<i>But I still get so worried.</i>

447
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:29,219
"Let's not care.
She wants to be alone."

448
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:31,222
"Let's wait until she
wants to talk."

449
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:34,220
I think this,
but I still get worried.

450
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:38,123
Yu Mi.

451
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:40,767
Stop making Ha Nui so worried.

452
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,549
<i>Yu Mi.</i>

453
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,489
<i>I'm really curious.</i>

454
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:59,471
<i>Are you doing this because
you're worried about your mom?</i>

455
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:03,765
<i>If I meet my mother again,
I would never forgive her.</i>

456
00:30:03,765 --> 00:30:06,103
<i>What's your true feeling?</i>

457
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,613
Tae Hyeon.

458
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,637
Don't think about anything.
Close your eyes, and listen.

459
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:00,978
Dad.

460
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:06,604
Dad.

461
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:12,999
Thank you.

462
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:29,530
You may feel burdened,
but please do well.

463
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,047
I have your support,
there's nothing I can't do.

464
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:37,627
I will make our company expand
into the Chinese market.

465
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:40,074
- Just wait.
- I'm counting on you.

466
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:41,358
Yu Mi.

467
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,691
I'll be back.

468
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,202
Honey.

469
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:52,404
<i>Next up, Soo Yeon Cosmetics
will give their presentation.</i>

470
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,307
How the heck am I going to get in there?

471
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,307
No.

472
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,392
Think straight.

473
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:20,358
This is so wrong.

474
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,732
Chang Soo.

475
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:47,178
- Hello, President Hong.
- What brings you here?

476
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,135
Nam Gyu is on a business trip in China.

477
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,002
Yes, I know.

478
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:55,664
I feel so bad when I think about
how he must be working right now.

479
00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:57,063
Yeah.

480
00:32:57,063 --> 00:33:00,296
Even if he said he's okay,
I should have sent someone with him.

481
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:03,105
- I regret not doing that.
- I'm sure he'll do great.

482
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:04,807
Don't worry.

483
00:33:05,414 --> 00:33:07,492
I can help you if you
need a signature.

484
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,028
No.

485
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,976
I was on my way out
and just stopped by.

486
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:14,768
A habit is a hard thing to break.

487
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:17,826
Then get home safely.

488
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,394
I love you, Boss.

489
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:28,451
I wonder how he's doing.

490
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:30,702
He must be feeling the pressure.

491
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:36,853
That's it for our presentation.

492
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:46,172
<i>I like that you don't use preservatives</i>

493
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,103
<i>but wouldn't that mean
a short shelf life?</i>

494
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:52,449
<i>What will you do if products go bad
in the distribution process?</i>

495
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,409
I understand why you are worried.

496
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,438
The first thing people worry about
with natural cosmetics is the shelf life.

497
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:07,695
So we've researched other ingredients
we can use in place of the preservatives.

498
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,431
This product expires September of 2017.

499
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:15,891
There's more than two years left.

500
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:18,851
How is that possible without
using preservatives?

501
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,367
It's possible because
we are Soo Yeon Cosmetics.

502
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,099
Only using natural ingredients

503
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,018
we have the technology to give
this product a long shelf life.

504
00:34:27,018 --> 00:34:29,608
There will be no problem selling this
in the Chinese market.

505
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:34,599
You can't call a makeup natural just
because it has a few natural ingredients.

506
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:42,101
We are endlessly developing our unique
ingredients for aroma and moisture

507
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:44,244
and that's why it's possible.

508
00:34:44,277 --> 00:34:47,074
Please take a look at
the main ingredients

509
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:49,065
in the product in front of you.

510
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:53,400
Do you know what the main
ingredient they used is?

511
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,016
Filtered water.

512
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:57,581
Water.

513
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,000
But Soo Yeon Cosmetics
doesn't use any filtered water.

514
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,829
Instead, we use extracts from
flowers and natural spring water

515
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:13,596
to continually improve
our customers' complexions.

516
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:15,222
<i>Are you that confident?</i>

517
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,117
We want to present China
with our natural products.

518
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:27,628
That is the motto for Soo Yeon Cosmetics.

519
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:31,248
Welcome.

520
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,742
Mom.

521
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:37,010
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

522
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,204
Not at all.

523
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,114
Min Ji's such a lovable girl.

524
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:46,650
- Thanks to her, I had fun.
- Mom, Grandma taught me Korean.

525
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,849
She did?

526
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:13,054
Wait.

527
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,896

Hi, honey.

529
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,583
You finished?

530
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,351
Thank you for working hard.

531
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,963
Yeah.

Hello?

533
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:43,824
What's wrong?

534
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:45,192
Did something happen?

I guess we had a guest.

00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:07,704
I've been wanting to meet you,
and we finally meet.

Hello.
