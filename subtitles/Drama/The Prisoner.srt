1
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,519
Am I allowed to know on what charge
you're arresting me?

2
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,716
Treason against the state.

3
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,233
Try to remember.

4
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,712
Any confession I may be said to have
made in prison will be a lie...

5
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,156
...or the result of human weakness.

6
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,190
We've got to collect your valuables,
you know. Regulations.

7
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,397
Watch, wrist, one.

8
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,830
- Gunmetal.
- Gunmetal.

9
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,592
Cigarette tin.

10
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,430
Beads, rosary, one.

11
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,953
Ring.

12
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,872
Look at it.

13
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,553
One.

14
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,238
Cross.

15
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,596
Jewelled.

16
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,877
One.
That's where the money goes, eh?

17
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,196
You've no need for larceny,
have you?

18
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,749
Petty larceny, that is.

19
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,753
And if you do rob your own
poor boxes, who's to know?

20
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,515
- Do you really believe that?
- Come on.

21
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,072
Right hand.

22
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,913
- You've been in a fire?
- Of a kind.

23
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,117
Won't spoil your fingerprints,
you know.

24
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,038
Thank you.

25
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,796
Here, if you want it.

26
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,993
I'm sorry about the nonsense
we've had to put you through.

27
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,357
I imagine this is more awkward
for you than it is for me.

28
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,478
- Well, hardly that, I suppose.
- I don't know.

29
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,110
In spite of your political creed,
it's you who are the gentleman.

30
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,239
No titles nowadays, of course,
but yours was a noble line.

31
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,312
You are a prince of the church.

32
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,269
- And you to interrogate me.
- Times have changed.

33
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,716
You were a hero to me in the
Resistance, as you were to all of us.

34
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,518
Do you ever miss those days?

35
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,116
At least one was on the same side
as all one's fellow countrymen.

36
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,431
I make no distinction
between my fellow men.

37
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,718
Their service demands everything,
and, I warn you, permits everything.

38
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,233
Is there a particular plot...

39
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,470
...or counterrevolution
you hope to unmask?

40
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,312
Not unless you know of one.

41
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,438
You believe us harmless,
yet require us discredited.

42
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,079
And the point of arresting me?

43
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,878
- A cigarette?
- No, thank you.

44
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,715
If I may smoke my own,
while they last?

45
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,872
Come, now.
Drugged cigarettes already?

46
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,717
You see, you represent a religion...

47
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,112
...which provides an organization
outside the state.

48
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,317
In your pulpit you are more
dangerous than a politician.

49
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,109
With your war record,
you're a national monument.

50
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,753
You are outside the party,
and that monument must be...

51
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,478
Destroyed?

52
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,914
Defaced.

53
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,878
You see? I show you
my hand from the start.

54
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,031
Do you want to see mine?

55
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,916
I am difficult to trap
and impossible to persuade.

56
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,799
I am tenacious, wary and proud.

57
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,757
- Proud?
- Quite sinfully.

58
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,198
Of my record in dealings
with your predecessors, the Gestapo.

59
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,959
I am tolerably inured to physical pain.

60
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,998
Well, they never caught me.

61
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,912
Your masters are in a hurry,
I fancy.

62
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,674
People who plan to make
heaven on earth usually are...

63
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,149
...so hadn't we better
come to the point?

64
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,957
Steven, bring me the completed
confession, will you?

65
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,754
Already?

66
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,593
It'll give us some sort of agenda
to work from.

67
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,831
You wouldn't care to sign it right away
and save us trouble?

68
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,630
- You know, you might just as well.
- I'd love to read it first, if I may.

69
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,713
Steven, I shall want you
to stand by tonight.

70
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,678
Sit down...

71
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,150
...Your Eminence.

72
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,990
Come on, now. No dozing off.
You can't do that, you know.

73
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,278
Very strict, your interrogator.
No dozing off.

74
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,829
Walk up and down a bit,
I should.

75
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,792
No talking to anyone
but me and him.

76
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,831
Psychology, they call that.
It's very modern.

77
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,957
Still, they say he always gets
what he wants in the end...

78
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,588
...in spite of his fancy ways
of going about it.

79
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,876
Does he indeed?

80
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,472
- You're being difficult, are you?
- I hope so.

81
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,232
Not guilty.

82
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,791
"Not me, I'm not like the others,
officer. I'm not guilty."

83
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,190
- You neither, I suppose?
- That's right.

84
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,839
Yeah.

85
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,949
Whatever they're in for, they've always
got something on their conscience.

86
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,589
Political, that's your line.
Not a very interesting one.

87
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,878
But you've got something
on your conscience too.

88
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,590
Confidence trickster.
That's your line.

89
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,309
- Why do you say that?
- You hide yourself up your sleeve.

90
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,755
Yes, that's your line.

91
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,638
And what are you guilty of?

92
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,916
Don't be silly.
I'm in the prison service.

93
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,390
- Not guilty?
- Of course not.

94
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,391
Come on, now.

95
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,876
Shall I switch on the microphone, sir?

96
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,315
Will you want all this
early stuff recorded?

97
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,473
"All this early stuff" he calls my
fascinating psychological approach.

98
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,200
It is fascinating, sir.

99
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,869
I'm learning all the time.

100
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,790
All that easy manner
and apparent friendliness.

101
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,270
Not just apparent,
you have to be friends.

102
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,192
Which I have been.

103
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,036
Which I am.

104
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,033
Hypnotic nonsense.

105
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,680
I only wish that physical exhaustion
wasn't so essential in the early stages.

106
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,034
All right, Steven, that's all.

107
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,355
Your Eminence, come in.

108
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,839
- Have some coffee.
- No, thanks.

109
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,479
Some coffee, Your Eminence?

110
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,598
Thanks.

111
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,794
My health.

112
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,113
Afraid I shall slip you a truth drug?

113
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,999
Surely it's a confession you're after,
not the truth.

114
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,357
I could drug you into stumbling
out some form of words...

115
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,513
...but the foreign correspondence
wouldn't be at all impressed.

116
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,355
And we shan't be needing any drugs.

117
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,999
Older methods?

118
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,628
Racks and thumbscrews?

119
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,398
Old...

120
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,509
...but not so long outdated.

121
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,115
Who do you think you're dealing with?

122
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,352
Some mad, sadistic moron
in the Gestapo...

123
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,830
...with power to play with flesh
and blood for his own lust?

124
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,912
I was a doctor before ever
I was a lawyer.

125
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,991
Your body is sacred to me.

126
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,550
No drugs, no torture.

127
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,193
- What can you hope for?
- Conversion.

128
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,759
It's your mind we want.

129
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,430
For the first time...

130
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,273
...since I've come into your prison...

131
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,711
...l'm afraid.

132
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,194
We can't talk here.

133
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,794
- You didn't answer my letter.
- It's hopeless.

134
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,599
We can't go on
seeing each other like that.

135
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,797
I love you, but you can't
do this to a man!

136
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,269
Why do we always quarrel?

137
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,910
Yes, he got results in the past,
but his methods take too much time.

138
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,514
Yes, and the people
are getting restless.

139
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,193
Churches are full again.

140
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,114
They're falling back on their old ideas
outside the regime.

141
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,397
He's got to be discredited, and soon.

142
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,599
- We shall be late for the meeting.
- I warned the Ministry of Justice.

143
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,590
God, they know he's not guilty
of anything. Well, you know he isn't.

144
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,557
Well, that's not for me to say.

145
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,837
My husband was right. There's no
freedom here even to think.

146
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,390
So he got out, and you heard
the last of him.

147
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,719
You love me, or you wouldn't
have come here.

148
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,839
I shouldn't have come.
I tried not to come.

149
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,150
<i>Surely it's a confession you're after,</i>
<i>not the truth.</i>

150
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,717
<i>Confession.</i>

151
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,477
He's got another eight-hour session
in half an hour, sir.

152
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,636
<i>Surely it's a confession you're after,</i>
<i>not the truth.</i>

153
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,598
You getting anything you can use
from these recordings?

154
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,355
Just a word here and there
at the moment, sir.

155
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,948
<i>Confession, the truth.</i>

156
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,635
Well, that won't take us very far.
The general is asking for results.

157
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,597
It's bound to be a slow process, sir.

158
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,399
He's looking for a weak spot
in his defences.

159
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,516
He'll find it.

160
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,838
If the church isn't deliberately
obstructing the state...

161
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,560
...are you prepared to say
it supports it?

162
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,429
It renders to the state the things
that are the state's...

163
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,388
...and to God, the things
that are God's.

164
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,473
You know you'll tire yourself out
with this eternal being on your guard.

165
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,679
- On my guard?
- Stop thinking of me as the inquisitor.

166
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,354
How do you wish me
to think of you?

167
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,191
As your doctor.

168
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,389
To me, you're on a couch
in my consulting room.

169
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,311
You're an enemy of society...

170
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,393
...like the schizophrenic
or the paranoiac.

171
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,356
You're dangerous because
you mislead the poor...

172
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,318
...the uneducated and the silly.

173
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,998
But only because
you're wrong-headed.

174
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,757
In time, we'll get to the root of
the trouble, and you can be cured.

175
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,672
- You believe it?
- Yes, I do believe it.

176
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,955
God give me cunning...

177
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,910
...against your skill.

178
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,394
God keep my watch.

179
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,475
Medical examination.

180
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,113
- Good morning.
- And no talking to the doctor.

181
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,240
The pulse, fairly regular.

182
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,278
A little flutter, there's nothing
to be alarmed about.

183
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,718
It's caused by the natural
human impulse of fear.

184
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,429
You often find it among cases
under threat of torture...

185
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,989
...physical or mental...

186
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,197
...and, of course, death.

187
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,991
Lungs quite all right.

188
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,269
Nothing to worry about there.

189
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,839
Continuous confinement is not usually
recommended, of course.

190
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,915
The heart's very sound.

191
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,117
Yes, very sound indeed.

192
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,274
I hope.

193
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,836
You're not supposed to talk
to the doctor.

194
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,831
But I know him. He used to work
in the free orthopaedic clinic.

195
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,958
You were doing fine work there,
doctor.

196
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,992
I know.

197
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,390
Things happen to us.

198
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,718
Doctor?

199
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,437
Tell me, have you examined
the interrogator?

200
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,549
Because if I'm in for a long session,
so is he.

201
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,034
Come in.

202
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,475
- Good morning, general.
- Good morning.

203
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,312
- Well?
- Well.

204
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,914
I was in an interrogation
when you sent for me.

205
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,833
- At 9 in the morning?
- It started at 2 a.m.

206
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,514
Resistance is at its lowest
about that time.

207
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,989
Resistance would appear
to be still pretty high.

208
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,072
You've had him for nearly three
months without any result.

209
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,117
I'm not criticizing your methods.

210
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,077
They've been successful
in the past.

211
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,470
But I must know how long
they're going to take.

212
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,108
But I've told you, general,
it's impossible to say.

213
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,713
In this case, we're dealing...

214
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,599
...with a particularly brilliant
and subtle mind.

215
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,753
His spirit was proved indestructible
by the Gestapo in the war.

216
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,797
Your progress reports
tell me nothing.

217
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,954
I'm prepared to report that
I am wasting hours, days, weeks...

218
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,270
...finding out what we can't
use against him.

219
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,275
But I'm probing his mind for the one
weakness that we can use.

220
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,116
To find that out, I've got to become
his doctor, his confessor.

221
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,874
I've had to get to know him better
than I know myself.

222
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,353
One casual phrase, one tiny slip
may give us a clue.

223
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,233
Very well.

224
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,392
But remember this:

225
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,915
We took a very grave risk
in arresting him.

226
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,310
There's unrest throughout
the country over it.

227
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,596
The press keeps asking
why there's no trial.

228
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,832
We cannot afford to fail
with the cardinal.

229
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,111
I shan't fail, general.

230
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,750
You've had a hard life.

231
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,869
A hard life, the aristocrat
to the priest.

232
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,391
Before dawn in the fish market
at the age of 9.

233
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:45,157
But warm in school by 9:00
with the fat fruits of my scholarship.

234
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,757
Did your clothes smell of fish?

235
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,914
Heavens, that it should rile me still.

236
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,435
"Cod guts and mackerel blood, look.

237
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,195
There are squashed fish eyes
sticking to his boots."

238
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,076
Dear little boys.

239
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,552
I used to go to the fish market
with just my overalls on over my skin.

240
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,678
Even when the snow
was up to our ankles.

241
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,516
And I bought every brand of soap
I saw advertised.

242
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,672
I took the skin off my hands
with disinfectant.

243
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,516
And then, "Sir, must I sit next to him?
He stinks of fish."

244
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,716
Happy school days.

245
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,598
- Blast you, you flaming little pest.
- General.

246
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,113
"School days," after weeks wasted.

247
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,350
You've no fixed date for the trial.

248
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,512
- This is a difficult case.
- I can see that.

249
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,477
The time has come
for other methods.

250
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,118
General, that's the stuff
that martyrs are made of.

251
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,999
The only chink we'll find
in that armour is in the mind.

252
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,515
- I shan't give you much longer to try.
- Supposing you could break him...

253
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,750
...would a confession
from a broken body...

254
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,672
...do you much good
in an open court?

255
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,195
We've got to have a confession...

256
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,271
...if it has to be from a corpse.

257
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,591
What is the policy of the Vatican
towards our government?

258
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,032
Thank you.

259
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,910
Very refreshing.

260
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,116
What were we talking about?
Oh, yes.

261
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,157
I meant to ask you...

262
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,949
I see here that you never
took up a scholarship...

263
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,318
...you won to the university at a
fantastically early age. Why was that?

264
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,789
I had a vocation to the priesthood.

265
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,635
And you found that out suddenly
between sitting for the scholarship...

266
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,509
...and winning it?
- No, I had always known it.

267
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,474
I had tried to evade it.

268
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,392
Why?

269
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,791
That's an odd question
for a layman, surely.

270
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,235
I didn't think I was worthy.

271
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,231
So you won the scholarship...

272
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,118
...and then suddenly overnight...

273
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,919
...found you were worthy
of the priesthood after all?

274
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,513
No.

275
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,559
I found that, for me,
I had to be a priest.

276
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,312
That and the next step and the next.

277
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,029
All my life, shirk nothing,
duck nothing...

278
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,038
...overcome everything.

279
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,915
You sound tired...

280
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,197
...and afraid of yourself...

281
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,952
...not of us.

282
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,519
Why?

283
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,954
Why?

284
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,199
Please, I'm asking for the last time.

285
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,634
No.

286
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,349
Your husband got out of the country
with no permit, he can't come back.

287
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,476
You know that you can't
get out of here.

288
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,193
I know I can't.

289
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,238
But that doesn't mean I have
to be unfaithful to him.

290
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,634
- You've not even heard from him.
- That doesn't mean he hasn't written.

291
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,552
Why do you see me at all?

292
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,711
It's always "no" in the end.

293
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,191
Because I'm an ordinary human being.

294
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,959
Look, can't you understand?

295
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,908
I like to go out sometimes
and talk and dance.

296
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,117
Please, we've always been friends.

297
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,396
You've got lots of girlfriends.

298
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,916
No, wait. I'm sorry I said that.

299
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,390
Shut up in that infernal prison all day
watching what goes on...

300
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,994
...you'll get so that you say things.

301
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,798
Come on.

302
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,871
Let's dance.

303
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,832
Let's enjoy ourselves, please.

304
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,839
- You're making progress, you know?
- I'm sorry you should think so.

305
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,992
No, it's just that we're getting
to know one another better.

306
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,040
Tell me about your first curacy.

307
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,350
St. Nicholas, wasn't it?

308
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,349
That was a working-class district
I used to know well.

309
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,320
Rowdy political parties
when I was a student.

310
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,836
Very progressive and matey we felt.
But I could never get the ring...

311
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,468
...of conviction in my voice
on those platforms.

312
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,596
Nor I in that pulpit.

313
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,833
Ashamed of preaching to the hungry,
"Thou shalt not steal."

314
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,835
But, well, presumably that was a text
that you practiced yourself.

315
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,757
Why do you say that?

316
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,031
What makes you say that?

317
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,635
- Well, does it matter?
- No.

318
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,112
When did you steal?

319
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,636
Before I became a priest...

320
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,916
...but not long before.

321
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,994
I was very young in that pulpit.

322
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,468
What did you steal, soap?

323
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,593
Books.

324
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,069
Books for those scholarship exams.

325
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,592
Books and paper and pencils.

326
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,798
I used to look down into
those faces below the pulpit...

327
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,791
...women mostly.

328
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,233
Women who weren't stealing...

329
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,153
...the things their men
and their children needed.

330
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,039
- Yes, but you needed the books.
- Ambition.

331
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,872
Not need.

332
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,074
- Besides, I...
- Besides?

333
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,350
I always took the best.

334
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,830
The thick, shiny paper...

335
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,873
...and the pencils out of
the sixpenny tray.

336
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,959
But surely you confessed
all that off your conscience...

337
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,190
...before you became a priest.
- Oh, yes.

338
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,272
Besides, I found there was no need
to look into their faces.

339
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,318
You could look between.

340
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,116
- Do you never look into their eyes?
- Now?

341
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,318
Always.

342
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,429
One must learn to do these things.

343
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,992
The mall past the capitol.
Secret meetings, slogans.

344
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,355
Propaganda being distributed.

345
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,314
This unrestful development rising.

346
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,109
Send out a general call to all district
headquarters in central command...

347
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,794
...to alert troops to reinforce
the patrol duties.

348
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,996
Orders to fire over their heads?

349
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,196
Orders to disperse them.

350
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,191
Full discretion.

351
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,553
You shouldn't be seen reading that.

352
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,236
Banned this morning.

353
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,511
Oh, there you are.

354
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,839
I was afraid you
weren't coming after all.

355
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,918
We're all on extra duties.
There's some trouble boiling up.

356
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,957
They brought in more guards.

357
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,879
Well.

358
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,712
Well.

359
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,793
I hate your being
in the prison service.

360
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,032
Makes it seem worse somehow.

361
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,919
Not just unfaithful...

362
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,236
...but we're the enemy.

363
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,348
That's treachery.

364
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,274
I can't get out, I've tried.

365
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,793
You don't...

366
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,919
...do things yourself, do you?

367
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,312
Things are done.

368
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,552
Like forcing the cardinal to confess to
treason so that they can have a trial?

369
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,833
I don't know how I can love you,
being even near such work.

370
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,270
He could be right.

371
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,033
You want to believe he
stands for things that are fine.

372
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,918
That you can trust him.

373
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,039
But what can people
like you and me really know?

374
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,153
I do know that he's not a man
you can force to anything.

375
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,555
If they get him to confess...

376
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,277
...you can believe it's true.
- But you can't want it to be true.

377
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,149
If you're in the prison service, you'd
rather think the police were right...

378
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,912
...than that the prisoners were.

379
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,799
You're saying that to justify
yourself working for them.

380
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,589
Well, it won't justify you to me.
He is innocent.

381
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,270
It will only prove this isn't a
country anyone can live in.

382
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,910
If they can twist a man that far
and he confesses...

383
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,196
...then I'd have to join my husband.

384
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,839
Please.

385
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,911
Don't talk about it.

386
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,593
We've got us to talk about.

387
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,593
The journalist on the paper
banned this morning.

388
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,710
General, this is lunacy.

389
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,309
You'll admit now
that there's a certain urgency?

390
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,472
The prisoner is not ready.
It'll destroy weeks of work.

391
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,553
I have my orders, I have faith in them.
You're a brilliant man, but conceited.

392
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,438
- Conceit is dangerous.
- Conceit!

393
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,556
So is sentiment.

394
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,871
He's here, sir.

395
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,190
It has been decided to confront you
with some evidence of your guilt...

396
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,113
...before you are brought to trial
so that you may see...

397
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,670
...that the only course is to appeal
to the mercy of the government...

398
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,717
...by pleading guilty.

399
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,115
A street map of the centre of the
capital, circles, secret arsenals...

400
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,035
...crosses on strong points, such as
the church of St. Nicholas there...

401
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,873
...dominating the central
railway viaduct.

402
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,715
Surely a good revolutionary
would blow up a viaduct...

403
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,758
...not build a strong point
to dominate it.

404
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,993
I must have lost my touch
since I worked for the Resistance.

405
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,991
- This is your handwriting, isn't it?
- It does look like it.

406
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,676
But this word appears
to be spelled in the Italian way.

407
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,354
Possibly from a letter of
mine to the Vatican...

408
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,877
...and thick nibs, thin nibs.

409
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,396
Almost as if someone had cut odd
words out of old papers of mine...

410
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,633
...and stuck them on the margin
of the map and photographed it.

411
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,150
A photograph of the cathedral crypt.

412
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,108
Marked on the map is an arsenal,
if you remember...

413
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,989
...and dated in the corner.

414
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,316
The place was searched
and photographed...

415
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,597
...the day you were arrested.
- The day I was arrested?

416
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,753
The feast of St. Fontanelle,
the one day in the year...

417
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,718
...when the crypt
is open to the public.

418
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,674
Next, Steven, please.

419
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,712
<i>What did you steal?</i>

420
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,000
<i>Money given for the church to start</i>
<i>sabotage and fomenting unrest...</i>

421
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,434
<i>... against the government.</i>

422
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,990
<i>Do you not at least admit that the</i>
<i>whole weight of your authority...</i>

423
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,311
<i>... must logically be directed</i>
<i>against the government?</i>

424
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,118
<i>Of course</i>.

425
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,675
You must admit that a gramophone
record cannot be tampered with.

426
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,589
I imagine not. You simply edit
the tape recording, don't you?

427
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,637
And then re-record on disk.

428
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,314
Sound levels weren't too good,
though, were they?

429
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,156
I've never seen a general,
four ministers and a judge look silly...

430
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,594
...at the same time.

431
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,274
- Is that for the record?
- No.

432
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,757
How odd it is.

433
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,197
They're just shadows.

434
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,398
You're real.

435
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,111
You're beginning to feel that.

436
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,198
I don't know.

437
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,996
I'm tired.

438
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,079
Oh, God.

439
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,198
- How could I forget?
- Go on forgetting, my friend.

440
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,239
This must end in tragedy.
They lack the leadership that...

441
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,675
...we had in the Resistance.

442
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,956
Your world now...

443
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,712
...is here.

444
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,790
Sir, the general's on the telephone.

445
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,633
Oh, what now?

446
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,711
This is the final idiocy, I'll stop this.

447
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,591
Oh, the fools!

448
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,352
Eminence.

449
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,432
Look.

450
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,515
If thou, O Lord, shall be extreme
to remark what is done amiss.

451
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,754
I never learned to pray for her.

452
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,353
Shouldn't you...

453
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,114
...bless her?
- I?

454
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,157
Bless?

455
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,315
She's still quite warm.

456
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,190
You had her killed.

457
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,039
You were the doctor
to whom my body was so sacred!

458
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,792
Pride?

459
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,310
- Well?
- My body and hers are one.

460
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,354
I am admitting it to you here!

461
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,479
Look how I kiss her hand!

462
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,518
She's alive.

463
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,875
Yes, she's only anaesthetised.

464
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,792
Anaesthetised?

465
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,632
Why?

466
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,837
I have the right to know.

467
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,389
I am her son.
She's supposed to be someone I love.

468
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,073
Supposed?

469
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,435
Someone I love.

470
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,638
What do you expect
to get from this?

471
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,360
The confession is ready
for your signature.

472
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,431
And if I refuse to sign?

473
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,348
She will be sent to the...

474
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,155
...research hospital.

475
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,751
Is she ill?

476
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,792
She will be ill.

477
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,590
No signature, no confession.

478
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,399
I could have her left in your cell...

479
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,118
...until she comes around.

480
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,477
She wouldn't
even try to plead with me.

481
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,591
You don't know us...

482
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,593
...my mother and I.

483
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,313
You have an unnatural monster
on your hands.

484
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,833
I do not love my mother.

485
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,515
I never have.

486
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,558
I thought all this...

487
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,917
...would lose me the foothold
I'd gained with you.

488
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,396
I didn't think that it would be I
that would be disgusted.

489
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,071
If she must...

490
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,677
...your mother may die of pain
to save your immortal soul.

491
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,676
I was beginning to dislike my work.

492
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,719
I shan't dislike it now.

493
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,628
You're a hard man, Eminence.

494
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,234
You're a hard man.

495
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,516
We'll leave you alone
with your thoughts for a while...

496
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,989
...Your Eminence.

497
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,672
Consider and hear me, O Lord, my
God. Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep...

498
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,638
Lest I sleep the sleep of death.

499
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,191
Lest mine enemy say,
I have prevailed against him.

500
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,557
Rejoice not against me, O,
mine enemy...

501
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,359
...when I fall I shall rise.

502
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,558
When I sit in darkness...

503
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,239
...the Lord shall be a light unto me.

504
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,308
- What's this?
- To sleep on.

505
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,357
Interrogator's moving in...

506
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,034
...thinks we're running an hotel.

507
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,117
Thank you, warder.

508
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,630
You see, I want to watch every phase
of his solitary confinement.

509
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,394
I suppose you'll be wanting
shaving water and things?

510
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,198
Yeah, that's right.

511
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,829
I don't want to lose touch
with his frame of mind.

512
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,310
I suppose the solitary confinement
can go on as long as we like...

513
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,710
...now that the trouble
outside's calmed down.

514
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,917
It can go on until he wants to talk.

515
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,310
We're up against a good man.

516
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,075
He's got to show us where his
weakness lies before we can use it...

517
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,390
...to destroy him.

518
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,276
Meanwhile...

519
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,990
...we must wait.

520
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,239
Shall I take over from him
for a bit, sir?

521
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,118
Not on your life.

522
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,828
He'll lose, in the end.

523
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,829
I've doctored those recordings
within an inch of their lives, sir.

524
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,956
We shan't need them.

525
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,872
Every living soul
in that sleeping city down there...

526
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,998
...could be broken if they had to be.

527
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,993
The subtler the mind,
the more sensitive the conscience...

528
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,755
...the more surely they
must be broken.

529
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,875
That's the fascination...

530
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,870
...and the pity of it.

531
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,989
Three sevens are 21, four sevens
are 28, five sevens are 35...

532
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,358
...six sevens are 42,
seven sevens are 49, nine...

533
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,591
Sevens.

534
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,314
Six sevens are 42, seven sevens
are 49, eight sevens are 56...

535
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,799
What day is it?

536
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,951
How long is it since you
brought me food?

537
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,759
You're fed according
to the regulations.

538
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,798
12:00 dinner, 8:00 supper.

539
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,871
Not for days.

540
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,474
Three days.

541
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,437
That's why they've
boarded the window.

542
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,239
To frighten me so that I can't tell.

543
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,279
No, it's just you've been allowed
to sleep as much as you like.

544
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,351
It's muddled you up.

545
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,993
I can't get over
what you're doing to that floor.

546
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,833
You're making
a real show place of it.

547
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,158
I'll tell you what.

548
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,312
I'll get you a tin of polish
and a proper cloth.

549
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,795
We had a fellow
in solitary for a long time...

550
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,999
...he used to take a mop to bed
with him at night and stroke its hair.

551
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,115
He got so he ate it up in the end
and they had to put him away.

552
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,631
Have they given up?

553
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,156
Am I to be left here now to rot...

554
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,390
...here, forever?

555
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,440
- Is that it?
- Now, why should it be?

556
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,639
You finished already?

557
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,314
I'm gonna make a clock somehow.

558
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,953
Next time, I'll know how long
you've left me alone.

559
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,193
Something running,
something rolling.

560
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,870
Something round.

561
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,836
- A clock.
- A cuckoo.

562
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,956
You need a cuckoo clock.

563
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,678
My granny had one.

564
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,832
I stuck its little door fast
so it couldn't get out.

565
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,673
You could hear it
whirling about inside.

566
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,558
Flying about.

567
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,518
I thought it was alive.

568
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,113
Kids!

569
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,833
Cuckoo!

570
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,479
Look a bit different after a couple
of months of solitary, don't they?

571
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,556
What time is it
supposed to be now?

572
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,439
You haven't been out of this room
five minutes.

573
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,476
What have you been up to?

574
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,752
Pick it up.

575
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,755
You worked up a pretty good appetite
in five minutes.

576
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,551
Well, I was hungry,
I hadn't eaten for three days.

577
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,837
- Five minutes, you said.
- You're tricking me, trying to fool me!

578
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,991
Now, no violence!

579
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,999
You're not the violent sort.

580
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,795
How are you doing this to me?

581
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,548
Why am I...

582
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,312
...going out of my mind?

583
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,391
Well, it's funny, you know.

584
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:46,031
The more store a man sets by his wits,
the sooner he loses them.

585
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,591
When a man starts
watching his mind at work...

586
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,195
...you can't leave
him alone for 5 minutes...

587
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,113
...without he frightens himself
to death.

588
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,831
Finished with it?

589
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,398
Oh, don't go.

590
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,797
What's the matter?

591
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,759
You should try and get some sleep.

592
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,710
I told you the switch
is working here now, didn't I?

593
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,077
They always complain
about the light at first...

594
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,996
...and when you tell them they can
switch it off, they don't want to.

595
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,830
You get so you don't like the dark,
don't you?

596
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,117
Night-night.

597
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,508
Not like the dark.

598
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,275
My good fellow...

599
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,078
...you really think I'm afraid
of the dark?

600
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,512
The dark.

601
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,911
Quiet.

602
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,351
Quiet.

603
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,591
Quiet!

604
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,397
Keep us, O Lord, while we wake...

605
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,875
...and guard us while we sleep...

606
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,670
...that we may watch with Christ
and sleep in peace.

607
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,474
Get him to send for me again.

608
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,839
Get him to send for me.

609
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,113
No good to them
if out of my mind.

610
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,079
Tell him he's got what he wanted.

611
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,635
The man on the
psychiatrist's couch...

612
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,394
...wants to talk.

613
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,359
No!

614
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,556
What are you trying
to make me say?

615
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,790
You twist what I say!

616
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,713
You make me see myself
as warped and crooked.

617
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,509
You, with your fake friendship!

618
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,079
Your friendship will talk.

619
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,554
And something knows I mustn't.

620
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,156
Talking for 15 hours.

621
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,915
Last kick, poor brute.
I know the signs.

622
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,032
Sedative.

623
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,518
No.

624
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,951
- Nothing in this room.
- Now, look.

625
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,229
The things I have to drink for you.

626
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,312
48 hours.

627
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,957
I'm onto him now.

628
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,872
I've got him.

629
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,476
I can hold him for 48 hours.

630
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,598
They must stage the trial
within that time.

631
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,274
- But I get all that laid on.
- That's their business.

632
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,112
I've hooked him.

633
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,590
His weakness is humility.

634
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,070
And he, poor fool, thinks he's proud.

635
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,994
He'll pour it all out now,
all his imagined vices.

636
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,720
I can play him. And land him.

637
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,599
But they must be ready
when I give the word.

638
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,039
It's a pity it's a sport that has
to be played with living men.

639
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,674
What are you fighting?

640
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,270
Why do you hate yourself?

641
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,596
I know you, I don't hate you.

642
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,359
- You must.
- I'm supposed to, but I can't.

643
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,469
You don't love your
fellow men, do you?

644
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,834
No.

645
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,788
Is that it, or is it something deeper?

646
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,673
You've no delight in your God,
have you, nor never had?

647
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,432
No.

648
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,314
Is that why you hate yourself?

649
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,913
Your heroism in the Resistance...

650
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:52,359
...was that just to convince yourself,
to prove yourself to yourself?

651
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,556
Why should you do that?

652
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,871
What must you keep proving?

653
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,871
The flesh...

654
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,676
...not weak.

655
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,390
What are you ashamed of?

656
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,633
Women?

657
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,832
A priest?

658
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,999
- Even so.
- Thank God, no.

659
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,357
Not in the corners of your mind?

660
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,957
Not alive, pulsing in the dark?

661
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,999
Not veiled, buried, drowned, waiting?

662
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,037
No.

663
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,675
You think all your life was a faade.

664
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,595
What are you hiding?
Why are you ashamed?

665
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,352
Unclean flesh.

666
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,592
Yes, yes.

667
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,112
My body...

668
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,638
...of her flesh and blood.

669
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,391
Your mother?

670
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,713
Behind the fish market?

671
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,110
Oh, she was married.

672
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,955
I was legitimate.

673
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,470
But I knew how it had always been.

674
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,077
Everyone knew.

675
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,911
In my little room, at night...

676
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,709
...listening to the new feet
blundering up the stairs.

677
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,111
The whispering and
the smothered laughter...

678
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,159
...behind the stupid flowered
paper on the wall!

679
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,320
My body of her flesh.

680
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,629
Oh, I put a scholar's gown on it...

681
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,791
...wrapped it in a cassock...

682
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,394
...tried to cover it.

683
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,750
And then, success.

684
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,550
To justify the pride, something...

685
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,154
...always to prove...

686
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,836
...what wasn't there.

687
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,391
Not there?

688
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,278
No heart.

689
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,834
There's no love in some of us.

690
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,000
Don't you think I'd have
found it if there were?

691
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,758
Your mother's sin, your shame
for her and for yourself.

692
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,874
Is that all?

693
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,315
Only the start.

694
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,919
Why did I become a priest?

695
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,796
You think the decision was easy?

696
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,589
Look, the day I heard I'd won
the university scholarship...

697
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,275
...and had to choose between
that and the priesthood...

698
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,512
...I tried to kill myself.
- Why?

699
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,874
Why?

700
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,793
Because I knew the university
was second-best.

701
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,794
I wanted to serve no less than God.

702
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,120
They should have let me die.

703
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,355
I became a priest...

704
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,276
...because I wanted to start again.

705
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,239
I wanted to feel free.

706
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,391
I wanted to feel clean.

707
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,915
So that was it.

708
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,996
I wanted to justify myself to myself.

709
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,832
To me...

710
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,910
...not to God.

711
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,078
And then?

712
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,077
I succeeded.

713
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,711
I can serve men or God
or my country...

714
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,873
...but I can't care.

715
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,069
You fake.

716
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,276
The hero of the Resistance...

717
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,716
...who outwitted the Gestapo
for his own vanity.

718
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,431
The martyr for the church whose only
resistance is for his own pride.

719
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,955
His Eminence, the cardinal...

720
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,032
...who could steal the estimation
of the world to justify...

721
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,715
...a miserable little tyke of a
backstreet drab who smelled of fish!

722
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,154
Forgiveness.

723
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,629
Did you preach forgiveness
up in your pulpit?

724
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,190
- Forgiveness for those who stole?
- Of course.

725
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,594
Didn't they have to give back
what they'd stolen?

726
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,313
How...

727
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,596
...can you give back...

728
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,352
...honour?

729
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,799
Deface the national monument?

730
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,393
Tell them...

731
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,120
...tell the world, as you've told me...

732
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,637
...that your whole life was a fake?

733
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,875
But you couldn't do that.

734
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,151
There'd be nothing left.

735
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,958
Nothing.

736
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,998
Tell them you betrayed
them in the war...

737
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,674
...that they could understand.

738
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,150
- It isn't true.
- Does it matter?

739
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,511
Madness.

740
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,756
It's a mad world.

741
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,678
If you really want to start again,
as low as the gutter you came from...

742
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:32,593
...why not tell them that in
the war, you betrayed them?

743
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,031
I betrayed them?

744
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,516
Oh, God.

745
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,717
Would you have the courage
to say it in open court?

746
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,517
I don't know.

747
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,390
It couldn't be done.

748
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,157
Don't mock me.

749
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,995
Of course, if you threw in enough
politics to leaven the loaf...

750
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,752
...they'd eat it.

751
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,031
- I mustn't confess!
- You mustn't confess?

752
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,079
You mustn't weaken, you, so certain
of yourself when you came here...

753
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:10,633
...with your wit and your sacred hands
and your insufferable conceit.

754
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,950
That's it, isn't it?

755
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,510
Let them see me in
the weakness of the flesh...

756
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,477
...and the meanness of the spirit!

757
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,160
That would be degradation.

758
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,632
That would be shame enough
to burn the past...

759
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,109
...and come through the fire free.

760
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,555
That's hysteria.

761
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,316
No. No, God...

762
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,030
Forgive me a moment.

763
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,995
I can't hypnotize you into saying
anything you think is wrong.

764
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,071
Remember that.

765
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,196
Do you believe that this is
what you must do?

766
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,910
Only this way.

767
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,319
Not drugged nor hypnotized...

768
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,470
...nor hysterical.

769
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,236
Sane and whole.

770
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,673
And with the courage,
with the grace of God.

771
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,991
To make restitution in my own way.

772
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,636
I can't believe he'll
confess to anything.

773
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,233
He won't, you wait.

774
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,790
He would never have staged a trial
if he wasn't ready to confess.

775
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,837
I knew him in the war.

776
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,230
He may have let them think
they've got him...

777
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,188
...but they will find he can put
this bullring to his own use.

778
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,039
It's better than the pulpit, you wait.

779
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,829
Has the prisoner read
the charges against him?

780
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,436
Yes, I have heard the charges,
and I confess.

781
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,914
Well?

782
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,230
He hasn't yet said what
he's confessing to.

783
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,951
First, we will take your
personal life as a priest.

784
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,192
You became a priest, did you not,
for your own glory?

785
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,588
Yes.

786
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,117
And all your service to the church
was to your own ambition?

787
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,032
Yes, my ambition.

788
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,072
How can you make people
understand that?

789
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,358
As a priest, did you misuse
money given to the church?

790
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,272
Yes, I confess to that.

791
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:25,355
The secrets of the confessional,
did you use those to extort blackmail?

792
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,794
Yes.

793
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,032
And did you sell such
information to the police?

794
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,428
Yes.

795
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,878
So all your life as a priest was a fake?

796
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,754
- Yes.
- Now, to make us understand that...

797
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,480
...tell us about your public life.

798
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,151
Tell us about your war record.

799
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,309
I worked for the Resistance.

800
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,314
Oh, yes, you worked for
the Resistance.

801
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,157
And in the end, you betrayed us.

802
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,951
Tell the court, Your Eminence...

803
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,669
...did you betray the Resistance
to the Gestapo?

804
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,438
The links with the Allies,
the chain that led out of the country.

805
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,956
In the end, I betrayed them all.

806
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,149
No one knew what kind of
a man you were, did they?

807
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,076
No one knew that you were
reporting to the Gestapo...

808
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,753
...did they?

809
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,394
You were still able to go on keeping
in touch with the Allies, weren't you?

810
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,834
Yes.

811
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,755
Do you deny that, since the war,
you have still kept secretly in touch...

812
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,388
...with foreign governments?
- No.

813
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,557
Have you received money from them
to foment sabotage and unrest?

814
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,994
Have you?

815
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,038
- Yes, I...
- Look at the people!

816
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,470
Your own people!

817
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:21,153
Before, during and since the war,
have you deserved their faith?

818
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,788
Have you betrayed them?

819
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,193
I have betrayed them.

820
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,358
<i>It isn't true</i>.

821
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,957
<i>It isn't true</i>.

822
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,833
<i>Madness.</i>

823
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,393
<i>Do you want to start again,</i>
<i>as low as the gutter you came from?</i>

824
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,433
<i>Throw in enough politics...</i>

825
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,910
<i>... they'll eat it.</i>

826
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,991
So you have confessed to every
charge of personal corruption...

827
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,276
...and public treason
brought against you?

828
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,556
I have confessed enough.

829
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,952
And that you aimed to set up
a government with yourself at its head.

830
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,031
The worst you can find to say.

831
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,709
Is it not enough?

832
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,909
Counsel for the defence?

833
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,791
After such a confession...

834
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,157
...the prisoner can only throw himself
on the mercy of the court.

835
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,232
Not on the mercy of this court.

836
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,032
Upon the mercy of God.

837
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,678
Oh, God...

838
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,831
...let me go mad.

839
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,073
Let me go mad.

840
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,237
How does he seem?

841
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,358
Interesting.

842
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,240
He was broken by a half-truth...

843
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,631
...a distorted truth.
He was too humble.

844
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,752
He believed it when I told him his
whole world was built on pride.

845
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,675
A proud man would have
been more sceptical.

846
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,748
Have you seen the press, sir?
Congratulations.

847
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,799
Yes...

848
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,435
...l've trained you well.

849
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,516
I suppose, in time, you will
come to drive a brilliant mind...

850
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,478
...to pray for madness.

851
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,239
- It had to be done, sir.
- Oh, yes, it had to be done.

852
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,392
You're just feeling the
reaction after the trial.

853
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,190
Mustn't let a little squeamishness
spoil your triumph.

854
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,317
Been good as gold
these last few days.

855
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,670
Hey, you get back to your
murderer in number eight...

856
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,353
...leave my cardinal alone.

857
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,396
Not that he'll be anybody's
cardinal after 8:00.

858
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,794
Yours goes before mine, doesn't he?

859
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,559
Yes.

860
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,357
Double damask.
Patterned, both sides.

861
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,318
- You like it?
- Very handsome.

862
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,835
That's an expert's opinion.

863
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,470
Like altar linen, eh?

864
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,398
When I was a choirboy...

865
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,076
...if you used so much as a corner to
wipe your nose on, they'd murder you.

866
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,154
Appetite?

867
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,118
- I'll try and do it justice.
- That's the spirit.

868
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,113
Of course, there's a lot of waste
with these breakfasts...

869
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,510
...but we finish it up after.

870
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,078
My mate, he said,
"Let's give him kippers.

871
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,073
We've got to eat it, we might as well
have what we fancy."

872
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:33,711
I said, " No, he's gonna have what he
fancies for his last meal on earth.

873
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,879
Kidneys, that'll be his taste."

874
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,633
- You're a good soul.
- Oh, I don't know, a job's a job.

875
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,678
You've got to go to bed at night
with your mind easy.

876
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,833
What time is the execution?

877
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,911
Oh, no orders yet.

878
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,514
How long, as a rule, after breakfast?

879
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,989
Oh, half an hour maybe.

880
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,833
But there's another to go before you.

881
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,752
Since the war, we've been so busy,
everything's gone to pot.

882
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,710
You swallow all right?

883
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,956
We had a young chap once...

884
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,680
...he'd killed three sailors
with a handspike...

885
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,796
...in a fight on the docks.

886
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,589
He was a nice, quiet kid,
but he couldn't swallow.

887
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,149
Nervous stricture, the doctor said.

888
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,276
Hanging, you see?

889
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,238
I put that right. I said, " Lad...

890
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,356
...they've changed your sentence.

891
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,115
They've brought one of them
electric chairs from America."

892
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,192
He ate like a wolf after that.

893
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,755
Standing up, you know?

894
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,990
You don't want to waste
them good kidneys.

895
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,633
Shall I be allowed a priest
before I die?

896
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,275
Must tell the lads that.

897
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,752
Oh, you're a good sport.

898
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,912
I hate a man who can't
take it with a grin.

899
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,199
"Shall I be allowed a priest?"

900
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:11,315
Oh, I'll miss you when you're gone.

901
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,516
You've never been any trouble.

902
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,910
Well, hardly any.

903
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,828
What's this?

904
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,434
- Look here...
- Your instructions.

905
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,558
He's got to have time for his breakfast,
the man got kidneys.

906
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,679
- That's civilization, it always has been.
- Read them, outside.

907
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,919
Well?

908
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:46,639
I find it hard to forgive my enemies,
and I haven't long.

909
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,077
Have you forgiven yourself?

910
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,798
Oh, no.

911
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,274
But I believe I shall be forgiven.

912
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,034
He who will judge us
is he who made us.

913
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,156
You've found peace of mind.

914
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,919
Perhaps you should thank me.

915
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,878
The doctor who diagnosed
the weakness?

916
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,951
Perhaps I should.

917
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,517
Shall I be allowed
a priest before I die?

918
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,631
There'll be no need.

919
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,428
I beg of you, let me see a priest.

920
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,634
You're not to die.

921
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,073
No.

922
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,793
I am to be hanged.

923
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,872
Your sentence has been commuted.

924
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,828
What are they afraid of, martyrdom?

925
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,958
No one can make the world
see me as a martyr now.

926
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,509
It has been commuted.

927
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,231
I had so eased my mind
with the thought of death...

928
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,868
...I can't see beyond it.

929
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,156
You're free to go.

930
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,834
The gates will be opened,
you have only to walk out.

931
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,514
No, no, they wouldn't risk it.

932
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,832
- What I might say.
- What, that you were talked into it?

933
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,274
That you used my mother?

934
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,193
She was already in the hospital
when you were arrested...

935
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,351
...you haven't kept in very close touch.

936
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,829
Is there news of her,
is the disease fatal?

937
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,070
- They think not.
- Thank God.

938
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,550
Nothing you can say
can harm the government.

939
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,754
Dead, you might be a martyr.

940
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,229
In prison, you'd be an enigma.

941
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,109
But free, sane, walking the world...

942
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,716
Walking the world like Cain, branded.

943
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,519
No. Suicide.

944
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,910
They hope I'll take my life
so they can say...

945
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,913
...I committed the last
cowardice of all.

946
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,475
I shan't do that, you know?

947
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,313
- No, I didn't think you would.
- No.

948
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,558
I might live...

949
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,515
...for 20, 30 years.

950
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,672
Yes, it's one thing I never thought of.

951
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,188
It's more terrible than anything
I could have thought of.

952
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,516
I could pretend to call to
the warder for help as I fire.

953
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,872
Do you want to pray?

954
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,831
- You'd do it?
- Do you want to pray?

955
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,629
I must not ask you...

956
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,951
...to do murder.

957
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,036
You're offering me...

958
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,319
...escape.

959
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,232
And I thought of you...

960
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,312
...as an animal to be
put out of its pain.

961
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,630
Do you want to face the world outside?

962
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,713
No.

963
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,556
But I must.

964
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,030
So the laugh is on me.

965
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,072
You go out from under my hands...

966
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,549
...a stronger man
than when you came to me.

967
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,393
Medical discharge certificate.

968
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,357
Discharge.

969
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,717
- It shook me, I don't mind telling you.
- Give it to me.

970
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,077
All right, doctor,
I'll examine him myself.

971
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,912
Outside.

972
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,556
Remember, that's an
ex-prisoner, that is.

973
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,592
Sir.

974
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,230
Do you realize what I did then?

975
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,110
I hid what I was doing
from the prison staff.

976
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,358
Indulging in secret treachery.

977
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,677
What have you done to me?

978
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,277
- That, from you?
- Oh, I realized the dangers.

979
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:54,638
I had to get so close to you it was like
two sides of the same man...

980
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,756
...talking to each other.

981
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,353
But to let sympathy for the side
that was you take over...

982
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,033
...even for a moment...

983
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,270
...from sheer sentiment...

984
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,319
To risk losing everything
I'd worked for and achieved...

985
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,872
It means...

986
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,076
...you've defeated me.

987
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,396
You're no convert.

988
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:24,270
For you, your cause
will always be right.

989
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:31,156
And what use to my cause is a man
who is too fastidious to trust?

990
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,834
No...

991
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,276
...I shan't wait to
let them find that out.

992
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,957
Your certificate of physical
and mental health.

993
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,431
An appropriate use
for my last official signature.

994
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,717
It doesn't make sense.
You pulled it off, you'll get recognition.

995
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,758
- Thank you, but I still want to resign.
- Why?

996
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,833
All right.

997
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,958
I don't choose to wait until you
put people in my house...

998
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,315
...and on my staff to watch me.

999
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,037
Rustling through my papers,
tapping my telephone.

1000
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,679
Should we?

1001
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,713
Yes.

1002
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,839
Listen...

1003
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,634
...10 minutes ago,
I offered to shoot him...

1004
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,112
...to spare him the agony of the
heavier sentence, release.

1005
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,317
I see.

1006
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,071
Yes, you're right.

1007
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,995
How can either of us tell
what that capacity for pity...

1008
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,310
...may lead me to do in the future.

1009
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,596
Servants of the state
can't pick and choose.

1010
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,637
Well, I can't half serve a cause.

1011
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,995
- The aristocrat?
- No.

1012
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,912
The fanatic.

1013
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,315
I shall have to take this higher up.

1014
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,910
Do you mind waiting in there?

1015
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,675
There's a reception committee
and a half waiting for you out there.

1016
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,678
Hundreds of them...

1017
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,440
...standing there, dead still...

1018
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,230
...all looking this way, waiting.

1019
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,590
Fairly gives you the creeps.

1020
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,113
Ready, sir?

1021
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,356
I'll have them open up for you.

1022
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,188
See if you can get rid of the kidneys.

1023
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,516
He thought I'd like them.

1024
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,473
Try...

1025
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,480
...not to judge the priesthood...

1026
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,031
...by the priest.

1027
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,237
<i>Any confession I may be said to have</i>
<i>made in prison will be a lie</i>...

1028
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,310
<i>... or the result of human weakness.</i>

1029
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,991
