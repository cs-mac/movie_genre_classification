I don't have a boyfriend.

What about last night?

179
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,080
I wouldn't go out
with someone like him.

180
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,560
He looked alright.

How can you tell?

186
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,400
'Cause I look at you
and you don't look too bad.

187
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
Well, I've done bad things.

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
I ran over a dog the other day.

Did you mean to?
No.

Yeah.

You don't have to pay

Yeah, if you want.

I'd be sitting here on my own.

No. That's just for starters.

612

Um...

614
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,880
I touch them.

615
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,440
Yeah? Like how?

616
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,600

(Softly) Oh, fuck's sake.

664
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,280
What?

665
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,760
Do you like duck?

666
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,280
Can we get the sizzling king prawns
and, um, the Peking duck?

667
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,640
Is that OK?
Yeah.

668
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,280
And can we get
some fresh chilli with that?

669
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,760
We've got chilli sauce.

670
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Well, I've had fresh chilli
here before.

671
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,040
I'll see.
OK, then. See.

672
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,880
Do you love me?

673
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,920
(Laughs) What?

674
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,840
I just wondered, that's all.

675
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,280
Jesus, Heidi.

676
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,440
Am I your girlfriend?

677
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,800
I don't know. We've only just met.

678
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,560
How long will it take
before you know?

679
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,640
Don't know.

680
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,240
I think you do.

681
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,640
You're just too scared to say it.

682
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,720
I'm not scared, I just don't like
being fucking interrogated.

683
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,320
Spit 'em out.

684
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,320
Spit 'em out.

685
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,560
(Retches and vomits)

GENERAL CHATTER

690
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,000
He was a weird kid, eh?
He was from Japan or something.

691
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,760
Anyway, he made us sushi
just out of these mats.

692
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,240
Just put this rice down
and just rolled it up in the mat.

693
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,680
My brother went to school with you.
Yeah, probably.

694
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,640
Said you used to sit out
smoking dope the whole time.

695
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,200
Nothing's fucking changed.

696
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,680
Where are you staying?

697
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,920
Er, in a lodge
up at Charlottes Pass.

698
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,560
Has it got a sauna?

699
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,440
Yeah.
Yeah? How about a spa bath?

700
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,680
Yeah.

701
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,160
Sounds alright.

702
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,400
Shame you won't get to see it.

703
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,320
Think I could probably make time.

704
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,880
(Laughs) Gee,
was that a pick-up line?

705
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,560
Do you want it to be?

706
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,000
You're going to have to try
a little bit harder than that.

707
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,480
I'm pretty busy this week.

708
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,560
Yeah, he's fuckin' flat out.
Oh, really?

709
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,760
Yeah, he's fuckin' a girl
from the servo.

710
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,240
What?

711
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,080
You're a fuckin' dickhead.

712
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,000
What? That's the reality
of the situation.

713
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,600
What situation?
Nothing like a bit of rough trade.

714
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,280
She's not rough.
Oh, really?

715
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,240
You wouldn't have any idea
about her.

716
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,480
Oh! I've hurt his feelings.

717
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,440
Shut up, for fuck's sake.

718
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,080
You're acting like an idiot.

719
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,000
This is the smallest,
most bullshit part of the world,

720
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,480
you think you're king shit.

721
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,120
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Don't fuckin' worry.

722
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,560
You think fuckin' some cheap slag's
gonna make you any different?

723
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,480
Why are you so interested?

724
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,080
'Cause you couldn't get a fuck
even if you tried?

725
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,400
You know why they hang out with you?

726
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,680
So they've got someone
to fuckin' laugh at.

727
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,760
Go on, then.

728
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,720
(Urinates)

729
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,520
Hi.

730
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,520
Thought you might
like to have a drink.

731
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,760
Did you?
Yeah.

732
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,960
Look like you've had a good night.

733
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,200
Yeah, it was great.

734
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,680
It was a birthday.

735
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,360
I don't know why I said it was great.

736
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,200
It was pretty bad, actually.
Better have a drink, then.

737
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,000
When do you leave?
In about a week.

738
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,840
Come back for the auction.

739
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,200
Yeah, looks like you've been doing
some packing.

740
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,400
Yeah, I had some friends down
to help.

741
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,280
Should have got you round.

742
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,440
I was only a phone call away, mate.

743
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,120
Yeah, I'm sure.

744
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,440
I helped you with that tractor.

745
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,080
Yeah.
(Laughs) Yeah.

746
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,560
You did.

747
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,320
With Stuart.

748
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,440
Yeah.

749
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,720
We just had a fight.

750
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,800
You and Stuart?
Yeah.

751
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,920
Just a stupid fuckin' pussy argument.

752
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,920
About?

753
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,640
Oh, a girl that I know.
It's a... a friend.

754
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,120
A friend?

755
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,600
We're sleeping together,

756
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,880
but she's not like a close friend
or anything.

757
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,560
Yeah, I've got friends like that.

758
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,600
Yeah, it's nothing too heavy.

759
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,400
But you were arguing about her.

760
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,880
Yeah.

761
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,760
You know, when you were a kid,

762
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,840
did your mum ever used to spray
perfume in the air

763
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,520
and sort of walk through it?

764
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,440
Yeah, I think she did.

765
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,960
Yeah, well, she's like that.

766
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,560
Like perfume?

767
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,320
No.

768
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,400
See, when you leave,
you can still feel her on your skin.

769
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,000
(Sighs) Fuck.

770
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,800
(Thumps down glass)

771
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,200
I'm full of shit.

772
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,280
Have you got a boyfriend?

773
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,640
Yes.

774
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,200
Would you like me to give you
a lift home?

775
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,200
No, I'm alright.

776
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,720
You're too pissed to drive.

777
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,720
If you're looking for the bathroom,
it's down the hallway on the right.

778
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,960
Um... got you a blanket.

779
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,600
I don't want a blanket.

780
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,480
I don't think you know
what you want.

785
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,800
Morning.

786
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,880
Some coffee in the pot
if you want it.

787
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,520
I'm alright. Might have a shower.

788
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,720
Probably a good idea.

789
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,200
(Sobs)

790
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,600
I'm drunk. (Laughs)

01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,280

Good morning, miss.
Hello, Irene.

795
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,280
Did anyone call for me?

796
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,880
No, love. No-one called.

797
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,320
You expecting a call, are you?

798
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,720
Sort of.

799
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,080
Aren't you working today?

800
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,040
No.

801
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,560
Where'd you get
all that lovely hair?

802
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,600
I don't know.

803
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,000
My mum, maybe.

804
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,280
See you.
See you, love.

805
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,480
What about this one?

806
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,520
Angry.
Good boy.

807
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,520
(Laughs)

808
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,320
What about this one?
Very sad.

809
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,800
Good boy.

810

Hi.

811
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,520
Hello, there.
Hi.

812
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,040
Do you want a drink?
Yes, please.

813
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,240
Hi, Karl.

814
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,440
Do you remember Heidi, Karl?
She came in the car with us.

815
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,840
Yep.

816
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,360
What about this one?
What do you think he's doing?

817
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,440
He ate something
that didn't taste good.

818
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,160
Maybe. What else could he be doing?

819
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,200
Growling.

820
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,840
What's Mummy doing?

821
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,000
(Laughs)
Smiling.

822
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,400
We're both smiling. (Laughs)

823
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,920
She's got lovely eyes.

824
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,560
Yeah.

825
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,920
Does Karl ride her?

826
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,760
Sometimes. He talks about her a lot.

827
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,640
He's sort of obsessed
with his rabbits.

828
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,320
He's got Asperger's.
What's that?

829
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,040
Do you know what empathy is?
Kind of.

830
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,480
It's like if you feel pain,
I can understand,

831
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,880
or if I'm happy, you can tell.

832
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,040
He can't tell,
so he can't make friends.

833
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,960
Oh, right.

834
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,840
He just says
exactly what he's thinking.

835
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,480
He doesn't know how it's gonna make
the other person feel.

836
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,920
What else does he do?

837
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,520
Well, if you tell a joke,
he waits for everyone else to laugh

838
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,240
because he doesn't know
what's funny.

Hello, Heidi.

845
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,720
Hello.

846
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,400
Wanna stay for dinner, Heidi?

847
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,360
We've met before, haven't we?
You came in looking for work.

848
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,400
Yes.

849
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,800
Mum, can you take us
to the video shop?

850
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,280
After dinner, then,
eh?

851
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,080
Hey, I think I might go.

852
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,800
Why?
I'm just a bit tired.

853
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,000
I'll give you a lift back.
I'm on my way to squash.

854
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,480
You'll be early.

855
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,920
So, where are we off to, then?

856
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,400
Um, the Siesta.

857
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,040
Ah. You're staying there, are you?

858
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,120
Yeah. I've got a flat.

859
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,080
I didn't know Irene had flats.

860
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,760
Just one.

861
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,080
Nice, is it?

862
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,440
Where are we going to?

863
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,800
I want to show you something.

864
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,720
Pretty, eh?

865
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,200
And you are a very pretty girl,
Heidi.

866
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,760
Thank you.

You know, when the Hydro-Electric
flooded the valley,

869
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,920
they... they left the old town there.

870
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,640
Yeah. All the houses and the roads
and the shops.

871
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,360
They're all there, under the lake.

872
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,400
Town's under the water?

873
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,680
Hard to imagine, isn't it?

874
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:40,360
All of thatjust... sitting there,

875
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,520
under the surface.

876
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,320
You know, Bianca's had
a pretty rough trot of it

877
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,720
moving down here.

878
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,920
We moved from Queanbeyan.
Did she tell you?

879
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,920
She's a very good girl.

880
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,360
She's really nice.

881
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,960
You know, she's basically got
her whole life in front of her.

882
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,640
And her mum and I...

883
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,840
...we don't want anything to...
mess that up.

884
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,760
Do you know what I mean?

885
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,840
Yes.

886
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,480
I think it would be better
if you don't see her outside work.

887
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,000
I just think
you're two different types of girls.

888
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,720

Hi.

01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,960
Want a hot chocolate?

893
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,400
No, thanks.

894
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,200
Pete told me to tell you
to stop eating so much stuff.

895
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,400
I thought we were allowed.

896
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,120
Yeah, we are.

897
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,640
Within reason.

898
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,040
Within reason?

899
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,320
OK.

900
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,640

What do you reckon?

903
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,920
I don't know.

904
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,680
Roy told me what you did.

905
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,160
What?
(Scoffs)

906
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,920
What did he say I did?
I didn't do anything!

907
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,520
What did he say?
You know!

908
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,200
I didn't do anything!

909

John, shut the fuck up.

01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,160

...if you ignore someone

then you can
really hurt their feelings.

do you?

You think I'm gonna sit here
and tell you about my problems?

992
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,800
No.

993
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,480
You're too scared.

994
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,200
If you're close to people,
then that's what you do.

01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,320
You tell them things,
and you know that no matter what,

996
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,280
that they're still gonna love you.

997
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,280
You're not close to people.
You just let them fuck you.

998
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,880
I'm close to you.

999
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,240
No, you're not.

1000
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,720
Joe...
Just fuck off, alright?!

1001
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,800

Yeah, I know. I just...
You just what?

01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,880
I'm sorry, Irene.

Oh, you're not sorry.

It was an accident.
An accident?!

Walking around naked and drunk
at three o'clock in the morning -

that's an accident?

Yes.

I need the room back.

Is he getting out?

No.

1019
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,760
He won't be getting out...
for a very long time.

1020
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,480
He must've done something really bad,
then.

1021
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,520
Yes, he did.

1022

What?

1023
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,280
What did he do?

1024
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,040
He killed a man.

1025
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,640
He walked into a 7-Eleven
and shot a young man in the stomach.

1026
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,640

and before I came here I did
something really, really bad.

1040
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,440
I kissed my mum's boyfriend.

1041

And she looked at me...

1042

...she looked at me like
she didn't know who I was anymore.

I'm really sorry, Irene.

She knows you. She knows you.

1045

I think we should ring your mum.
Hmm?

1046
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,240
She wouldn't want to see me.

love...
