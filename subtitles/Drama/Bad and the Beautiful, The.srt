1
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:27,929
Princeton University September 1947

2
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,494
Mathematicians won the war.

3
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,231
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...

4
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,709
and built the A-bomb.

5
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:42,179
Mathematicians... like you.

6
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,943
The stated goal of the
Soviets is global communism.

7
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,215
In medicine or economics,

8
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,553
in technology or space,

9
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:53,455
battle lines are being drawn.

10
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:57,219
To triumph, we need results.

11
00:01:57,297 --> 00:02:00,164
Publishable, applicable results.

12
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:06,100
Now who among you will be the
next Morse? The next Einstein?

13
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:09,205
Who among you will be the vanguard

14
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:12,767
of democracy, freedom, and discovery?

15
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,541
Today, we bequeath America's future

16
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,277
into your able hands.

17
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:21,218
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

18
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,704
Man: It's not enough Hansen
won the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,800
Man #2: No, he has to
have it all for himself.

20
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,400
It's the first time the Carnegie prize

21
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,070
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

22
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,614
Man #2. Rumor is he's got
his sights set on Wheeler Lab,

23
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,377
the new military think tank at M.I.T.

24
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,147
They're only taking one this year.

25
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,381
Hansen's used to being picked first.

26
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,014
Oh, yeah, he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,956
He should be running for president.

28
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,866
There could be a
mathematical explanation

29
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,565
for how bad your tie is.

30
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:17,006
(Laughs)

31
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,870
Thank you.

32
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:24,181
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

33
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,478
Neils here broke a Jap code.

34
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,782
Helped rid the world of fascism.

35
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:30,482
At least that's what he
tells the girls, eh, Neils?

36
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,421
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

37
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,551
- And you are?
- Am I late?

38
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:35,889
- Yes.
- Yes, Mr. Sol.

39
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,192
Oh, good. Uh, hi.

40
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,392
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- Neilson. The burden of genius.

41
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,935
- Bender: There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.

42
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,698
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?

43
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:47,239
- Ah, Bender.
- Nice to see you.

44
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:49,672
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Ah, thank you.

45
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:52,176
I'll take another.

46
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:54,213
Excuse me?

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,805
A thousand pardons. I simply
assumed you were the waiter.

48
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,317
- Play nice, Hansen.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

49
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:00,613
Hansen. Honest mistake.

50
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:03,154
Well, Martin Hansen.

51
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,190
It is Martin, isn't it?

52
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,623
Why, yes, John, it is.

53
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:11,220
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,861
I've read your pre-prints...

55
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,631
Both of them.

56
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:20,604
The one on Nazi ciphers,

57
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:23,608
and the other one on
non-linear equations,

58
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,337
and I am supremely confident

59
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:27,003
that there is not a single seminal

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,980
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

61
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,344
Enjoy your punch.

62
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:38,185
(Chuckles)

63
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,088
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,

64
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,352
the mysterious West Virginia genius.

65
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:46,091
The other winner of the
distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

66
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,133
- Bender. Oh, okay.
- Sol. Oh, yeah?

67
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,498
Bender. Of course.

68
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:05,112
(Choral Record Playing)

69
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,858
(Coughs) Oh, Christ.

70
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,932
The prodigal roommate arrives.

71
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,769
Roommate?

72
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,604
Oh, God, no.

73
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,735
- Ugh.
- (Music Slows, Stops)

74
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,543
Did you know that
having a hangover is...

75
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,743
Is not having enough water in your body

76
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:40,843
to run your Krebs cycles?

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,855
Which is exactly what happens to you

78
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,481
when you're dying of thirst.

79
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,527
So, dying of thirst...

80
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,825
would probably feel

81
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:54,492
pretty much like the hangover

82
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,831
that finally bloody kills you.

83
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,200
(Chuckles)

84
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,670
John Nash?

85
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,639
Hello.

86
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,197
Charles Herman.

87
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,301
Pleased to meet you.

88
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,647
Player: All right, well done.

89
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,655
Charles. Well, it's official.

90
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:25,822
I'm almost human again.

91
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,627
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.

92
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,429
His name was Johnny Walker.

93
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,197
(Mimics Rim shot)

94
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,603
Whew.

95
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:37,108
Well, I got in last night

96
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,268
in time for...

97
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,471
English department cocktails.

98
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:41,877
Cock was mine,

99
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,280
the tail belonged to a
particularly lovely young thing

100
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,944
with a passion for...

101
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,546
D.H. Lawrence. You're not
easily distracted, are you?

102
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,456
- I'm here to work.
- Hmmm, are you? Right.

103
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:55,357
I see. Crikey!

104
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,002
Is my roommate a dick?

105
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,675
Hmm?

106
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:12,836
Listen.

107
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,277
If we can't break the ice...

108
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,616
How about we drown it?

109
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,390
So what's your story?

110
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:33,589
You the poor kid that never
got to go to Exeter or Andover?

111
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,158
Despite my privileged upbringing,

112
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:37,634
I'm actually quite well-balanced.

113
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:39,102
I have a chip on both shoulders.

114
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,968
(Chuckles)

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,065
Maybe you're just better

116
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:45,076
with the old integers
than you are with people.

117
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:47,009
My first grade teacher, she told me

118
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,070
that I was born with
two helpings of brain,

119
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,775
but only half a helping of heart.

120
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,249
(Chuckles)

121
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,684
Wow! She sounds lovely!

122
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,286
The truth is that l...

123
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:59,722
I don't like people much.

124
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,953
And they don't much like me.

125
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,256
But why,

126
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,024
with all your obvious wit and charm?

127
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:06,587
(Laughs)

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,261
Seriously, John.

129
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,701
Mathematics...

130
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:16,572
Mathematics is never going
to lead you to a higher truth.

131
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,633
And you know why?

132
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,144
'Cause it's boring.

133
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:21,804
It's really boring. (Chuckles)

134
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,210
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

135
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,812
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

136
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,652
and these books.

137
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,091
(Coughs)

138
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,651
Memorizing the weaker
assumptions of lesser mortals!

139
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,095
(Chuckles)

140
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:41,929
I need to look through...

141
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:44,094
to the governing dynamics.

142
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,408
Find a truly original idea.

143
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,467
That's the only way I'll
ever distinguish myself.

144
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,137
It's the only way that I'll ever...

145
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,612
Matter.

146
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,111
Yes.

147
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:02,949
Hansen: All right, who's next?

148
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,149
No, I've played enough
"go" for one day, thank you.

149
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:06,816
- Come on.
- l... I hate this game.

150
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:08,655
Cowards, all of you!

151
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,593
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

152
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,221
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,

153
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,323
Sol does his laundry all semester.

154
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,130
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.

155
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,568
- Bender. Look at him.
- Nash!

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,267
Taking a reverse constitutional?

157
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:25,139
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm

158
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,202
to define their movement.

159
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,717
- Oh.
- Psycho.

160
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,580
Sol: Hey, Nash, I
thought you dropped out.

161
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:37,281
You ever going to go to class or...

162
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:39,654
Classes will dull your mind.

163
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:43,217
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

164
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,229
Oh, oh, I didn't know that.

165
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,390
Nash is going to stun
us all with his genius.

166
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,058
Which is another way of saying

167
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,126
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

168
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:54,403
You scared?

169
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:55,906
Terrified.

170
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,340
Mortified. Petrified.

171
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,105
Stupefied... by you.

172
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,739
No starch.

173
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,805
Pressed and folded.

174
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,720
Let me ask you something, John.

175
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,619
Be my guest, Martin.

176
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,452
Bender and Sol here correctly completed

177
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,584
Allen's proof of Peyrot's Conjecture.

178
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,719
Adequate work...

179
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,491
without innovation.

180
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,327
Oh. I'm flattered. You flattered?

181
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,525
Flattered.

182
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,795
And I've got two weapons briefs

183
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:26,269
under security review by the D.O.D.

184
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:28,533
Derivative drivel.

185
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,407
But Nash achievements:

186
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,876
zero.

187
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:35,675
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is
there an actual question coming?

188
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:40,185
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

189
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:42,220
Huh?

190
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,756
How will it feel when
I'm chosen for Wheeler...

191
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,986
and you're not?

192
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,695
What if you lose?

193
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,601
Bender. Ah, there it is.

194
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,070
(Chuckles)

195
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:04,875
You should not have won.

196
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,377
Hmmm.

197
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:09,039
I had the first move,
my... my play was perfect.

198
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:10,604
The hubris of the defeated.

199
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,913
The game is flawed.

200
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,950
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

201
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,627
Charles. You've been
in here for two days.

202
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,502
You know Hansen's just
published another paper?

203
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,770
I can't even find a
topic for my doctorate.

204
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,006
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

205
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:48,878
This is a group playing touch football.

206
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:52,355
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

207
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:57,985
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

208
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,128
John, you watched a mugging.

209
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,667
That's weird.

210
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,431
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

211
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:09,201
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

212
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,608
See, if I could derive an equilibrium

213
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,238
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

214
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,646
where nobody loses,

215
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,741
can you imagine the
effect that would have

216
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:23,754
- on conflict scenarios, and arms negotiations...
- When did you last eat?

217
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:26,290
- When did you last eat?
...Currency exchange?

218
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,121
You know, food.

219
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:32,156
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know that?

220
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,791
Yes. But pizza...

221
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,303
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.

222
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:42,465
And of course beer.

223
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,574
I have respect for beer.

224
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,409
I have respect for beer!

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
- Bender. Good evening, Neils.
- Hansen. Hey, Nash.

226
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,163
Who's winning? You or you?

227
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,927
- Bender. Evening, Nash.
- Sol. Hey, guys.

228
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,866
Hey, Nash.

229
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,734
Woman: He's looking at you for sure.

230
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,036
Hey, Nash.

231
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,739
Neils is trying to get your attention.

232
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,146
- Bender. You're joking.
- Sol. Oh, no.

233
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,881
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.

234
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:36,023
- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.

235
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:42,131
Gentlemen, might I remind
you that my odds of success

236
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,169
dramatically improve with each attempt?

237
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,837
This is going to be classic.

238
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,478
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

239
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,312
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

240
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:37,446
in order for you to
have intercourse with me,

241
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,184
but could we assume
that I said all that?

242
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,127
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

243
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,130
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

244
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,131
Oh, that was sweet.

245
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,163
Have a nice night, asshole!

246
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,399
- (Man Laughs)
- Neilson. Ladies, wait!

247
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,100
Charles. l...

248
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,611
I especially liked the
bit about fluid exchange.

249
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,239
It was really charming.

250
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,982
Professor. Walk with me, John.

251
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:10,817
I've been meaning to talk with you.

252
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,553
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

253
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:18,790
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

254
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,593
Wheeler, sir. That
would be my first choice.

255
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,930
And actually, I don't really
have a second choice, sir.

256
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:25,629
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

257
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,331
They've written papers.
They've published.

258
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,533
I'm still searching, sir, for my...

259
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,133
- Your original idea, I know.
- Governing dynamics, sir.

260
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,872
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid

261
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,210
it's just not nearly good enough.

262
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,152
- May I?
- Thank you.

263
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:46,884
I've been working on manifold embedding.

264
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,359
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

265
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,089
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

266
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,562
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein...

267
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,623
- I've repeatedly asked you for that.
- Now, John.

268
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,134
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

269
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,669
John.

270
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,165
Do you see what they're doing in there?

271
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,902
- Professor. Congratulations.
- Max. Thank you so much.

272
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,844
Congratulations, Professor Max.

273
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,313
- Max. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

274
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:12,783
It's the pens.

275
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:15,115
Reserved for a member of the department

276
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,087
that makes the
achievement of a lifetime.

277
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,818
Now, what do you see, John?

278
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,622
Recognition.

279
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:25,458
Well done, Professor, well done.

280
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,965
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

281
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,830
Is there a difference?

282
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,199
John,

283
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,761
you haven't focused.

284
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,301
I'm sorry, but up to this point,

285
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:41,073
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

286
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,144
Good day.

287
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,490
And my compliments to you, sir.

288
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,657
Thank you so much.

289
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,250
I can't see it.

290
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,286
(Whimpers)

291
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,591
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ, John.

292
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,060
I can't fail.

293
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:34,030
- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.

294
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,090
- I got to get something done.
- John!

295
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:39,001
- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, enough!

296
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,596
Got to face the wall, follow
their rules, read their books...

297
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:43,163
you want to do some damage? Fine...

298
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,301
- But don't mess around.
...Do their classes.

299
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:47,470
Come on! Go on, bust your head!

300
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,241
Kill yourself.

301
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,680
John, do it. Don't mess around.

302
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,479
Bust your head! Go on,

303
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,520
bust that worthless head wide open.

304
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,714
Goddamn it, Charles! What
the hell is your problem?!

305
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,720
It's not my problem.

306
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:07,060
And it's not your problem.

307
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,334
It's their problem.

308
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,498
Your answer isn't face the wall.

309
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,940
It's out there...

310
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,637
where you've been working.

311
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,260
- (Panting)
- (Gasps)

312
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,357
That was heavy.

313
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:49,101
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

314
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,971
- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.

315
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,271
(Giggles)

316
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,039
John. Don't worry, that's mine.

317
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:56,307
I'll come and get it in a minute.

318
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,781
- (Both laughing)
- Oh, God.

319
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,916
- Neilson. Incoming,
gentlemen. - Sol. Ay-yi-yi.

320
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:10,661
(Sighs) Deep breaths.

321
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,424
Sol. Nash, you might want to stop

322
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:15,728
shuffling your papers for five seconds.

323
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,030
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

324
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,666
Bender. Oh, we're not
here for beer, my friend.

325
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:26,903
- John. Oh.
- (Sol Chuckles)

326
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,076
Does anyone else feel she
should be moving in slow motion?

327
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,811
Will she want a large wedding, ya think?

328
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,352
Shall we say swords, gentlemen?

329
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,389
- Pistols at dawn?
- Have you remembered nothing?

330
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,789
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,

331
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,793
the father of modern economics.

332
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:44,692
"In competition...

333
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:47,425
Sol and Neilson: individual
ambition serves the common good."

334
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,831
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.

335
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:52,893
Bender: And those who strike
out are stuck with her friends.

336
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:54,563
Hansen. I'm not gonna strike out.

337
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,369
Sol. You can lead a blonde to
water, but you can't make her drink.

338
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,433
- I don't think he said that.
- Sol: Nobody move...

339
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:01,570
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

340
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,342
Hansen. Oh, God. He may
have the upper hand now,

341
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,475
but wait until he opens his mouth.

342
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,416
- (Laughing)
- Remember the last time?

343
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:11,012
Bender. Oh, yes, that was
one for the history books.

344
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,792
Adam Smith needs revision.

345
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:20,832
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:23,561
If we all go for the blonde...

347
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,698
we block each other.

348
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:34,036
Not a single one of us is gonna get her.

349
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,774
So then we go for her friends,

350
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,610
but they will all give
us the cold shoulder

351
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:42,244
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

352
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,255
Well, what if no one
goes for the blonde?

353
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:49,088
We don't get in each other's way,

354
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:52,096
and we don't insult the other girls.

355
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,462
That's the only way we win.

356
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,034
That's the only way we all get laid.

357
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,594
(Laughs)

358
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,841
Adam Smith said

359
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,937
the best result comes

360
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:10,606
from everyone in the group doing

361
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:12,172
what's best for himself, right?

362
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,410
That's what he said, right?

363
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:14,645
- Right.
- Incomplete.

364
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,311
Incomplete, okay?

365
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:18,948
Because the best result will come...

366
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,686
from everyone in the group

367
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,456
doing what's best for himself...

368
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,087
and the group.

369
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:29,031
Nash, if this is some way for
you to get the blonde on your own,

370
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,365
- you can go to hell.
- Governing dynamics.

371
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:34,462
Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

372
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,234
was wrong.

373
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:39,106
- Sol: Oh, here we go.
- Neilson: Careful, careful.

374
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,372
Thank you.

375
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,994
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

376
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,924
(Muttering)

377
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,351
You do realize this flies in the face

378
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:05,191
- of a 1 50 years of economic theory?
- Yes, I do, sir.

379
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:07,128
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

380
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:09,064
It is, sir. (Stifled Laugh)

381
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:17,436
Well, Mr. Nash,

382
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,873
with a breakthrough of this magnitude,

383
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:24,712
I'm confident you will
get any placement you like.

384
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,019
Wheeler Labs,

385
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:36,720
they'll ask you to
recommend two team members.

386
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:38,387
(Whispering) Yes!

387
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:42,729
Stills and Frank are excellent choices.

388
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,462
Sol and Bender, sir.

389
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:48,165
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

390
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,299
Has it occurred to
you that Sol and Bender

391
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,933
might have plans of their own?

392
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,107
(Laughing)

393
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:59,980
- Baby!
- Wheeler, we made it!

394
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:05,182
- Cheers, cheers, cheers!
- To... oh! Oh!

395
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,885
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

396
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,448
Umm...

397
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:32,210
hmm.

398
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,582
Governing dynamics.

399
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,185
- Congratulations, John.
- Thanks.

400
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:41,020
- Toast!
- To Wheeler Labs!

401
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:42,855
Neilson. To Wheeler!

402
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:56,533
The Pentagon 1 953 Five Years Later

403
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:09,378
Man. General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

404
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,354
Dr. Nash, your coat?

405
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,323
Thank you, sir.

406
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:17,327
Doctor. General, this is Wheeler
team leader Dr. John Nash.

407
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,488
Glad you could come, Doctor.

408
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:20,690
Hello.

409
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:22,596
Right this way.

410
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:26,501
We've been intercepting radio
transmissions from Moscow.

411
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:29,005
The computer can't detect a pattern,

412
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,769
but I'm sure it's code.

413
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:33,208
John: Why is that, General?

414
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:35,769
Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?

415
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,011
Constantly.

416
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:44,414
General. We've developed
several ciphers.

417
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,520
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

418
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:52,027
Doctor?

419
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,621
Nash's voice.
6-7-3-7,

420
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,598
0-3-6...

421
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,498
(Mental Voice)

422
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,271
8-4-9-4.

423
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:15,846
(Continues Listing Numbers)

424
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,071
9-1-4-0-3-4.

425
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,357
I need a map.

426
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:06,626
46-1
3-08,

427
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:09,298
67-46-90.

428
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,471
Starkey Corners, Maine.

429
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,106
48-03-01,

430
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:21,676
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

431
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:24,950
These are latitudes and longitudes.

432
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,422
There are a least 1 0 others.

433
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,255
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

434
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,695
Extraordinary.

435
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:37,326
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

436
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,360
Who's big brother?

437
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:42,838
You've done your country
a great service, son.

438
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:46,606
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

439
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:49,044
Accompany Dr. Nash.

440
00:27:49,113 --> 00:27:52,048
What are the Russians moving, general?

441
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,708
Captain Rogers will escort you

442
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,582
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

443
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:57,314
Thank you.

444
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,788
Captain. Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

445
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,529
Man On Radio. None of those who have

446
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,261
said they don't like the method

447
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,701
have told us any other
method they could use

448
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,328
that would be effective.

449
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,498
- And when you hear...
- Driver: It's Dr. Nash.

450
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:18,542
All right.

451
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:27,115
Wheeler Defense Labs MIT Campus

452
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,853
- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?

453
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,292
Have they actually taken
the word "classified"

454
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:37,521
out of the dictionary?

455
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:40,530
Oh, hi. The air
conditioning broke again.

456
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,657
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world

457
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:45,567
- if I'm melting?
- Our hearts go out to you.

458
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:48,629
You know, two trips to
the Pentagon in four years.

459
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:50,230
That's two more than we've had.

460
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:51,741
It gets better, John.

461
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,369
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

462
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:56,379
You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,

463
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:58,540
the Nazis are
repatriating South America,

464
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:01,915
the Chinese have a standing
army of 2.8 million,

465
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:05,513
and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

466
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,320
You made the cover of Fortune... again.

467
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:11,021
Please note the use of
the word "you," not "we."

468
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,023
That was supposed to be just me.

469
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:15,998
Oh. (Laughs)

470
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,801
So not only do they rob
me of the Fields medal,

471
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,202
now they put me on the
cover of Fortune magazine

472
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:24,332
with these hacks, these
scholars of trivia.

473
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,001
John, exactly what's the difference

474
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:28,409
between genius and most genius?

475
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,242
Quite a lot.

476
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,579
He's your son.

477
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,049
Anyway, you've got 1 0 minutes.

478
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:36,109
I've always got 1 0 minutes.

479
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,155
Sol. Before your new class?

480
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:45,721
Can I not get a note from
a doctor or something?

481
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:48,993
You are a doctor, John, and no.

482
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,728
Now, come on, you know the drill,

483
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:52,565
we get these beautiful facilities,

484
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:54,696
M.I.T. gets America's
great minds of today

485
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:56,831
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

486
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:58,603
Poor bastards.

487
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:00,735
Now, have a nice day at school.

488
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,279
The bell's ringing.

489
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,653
(Door Opens)

490
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,802
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

491
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,735
(Loud Jackhammering)

492
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,707
Can we leave one open, Professor?

493
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:39,215
It's really hot, sir.

494
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,953
Your comfort comes second

495
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:45,148
to my ability to hear my own voice.

496
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,893
Personally,

497
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:54,932
I think this class will be a waste...

498
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:56,990
of your...

499
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,933
And what is infinitely worse...

500
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,470
my time.

501
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:06,375
However, here we are.

502
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,244
So you may attend or not.

503
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:12,509
You may complete your
assignments at your whim.

504
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,847
We have begun.

505
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:18,453
Miss.

506
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,685
Excuse me!

507
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:26,229
- Excuse me!
- Hey, hey!

508
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:28,060
Hi!

509
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:31,067
Um, we have a little problem.

510
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:34,798
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed

511
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,807
and extremely noisy with them open.

512
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:39,537
So, I was wondering if
there was any way you could,

513
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:43,240
I don't know, maybe work someplace
else for about 45 minutes?

514
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:46,307
- Worker: Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

515
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,944
- At a break!
- Got it!

516
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,181
Worker. Let's go. Let's
clean it a little bit!

517
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,890
As you will find in multivariable
calculus, there is often...

518
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:59,429
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

519
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,795
As I was saying, this problem here

520
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:09,864
will take some of you
many months to solve.

521
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,603
For others among you,

522
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:16,113
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

523
00:32:30,394 --> 00:32:33,386
Man. Professor Nash.

524
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:47,104
William Parcher.

525
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:50,238
Big brother,

526
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:52,179
at your service.

527
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,878
What can I do for the
Department of Defense?

528
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:56,817
Are you going to give me a raise?

529
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,879
Let's take a walk.

530
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:03,216
- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.

531
00:33:03,294 --> 00:33:04,659
Oppenheimer used to say,

532
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:07,254
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

533
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:09,265
You knew Oppenheimer?

534
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,995
His project was under my supervision.

535
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:14,060
Which project?

536
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,436
That project.

537
00:33:17,508 --> 00:33:19,169
It's not that simple, you know?

538
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:20,870
Well, you ended the war.

539
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:24,574
We incinerated 1 50,000
people in a heartbeat.

540
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,516
Great deeds come at
great cost, Mr. Parcher.

541
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:31,244
Well, conviction, it turns out,

542
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:34,621
is a luxury of those on
the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

543
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:38,386
I'll try and keep that in mind.

544
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:44,395
So, John, no family,

545
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:46,333
no close friends...

546
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:47,894
Why is that?

547
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,463
John: I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

548
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:54,272
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

549
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:55,573
(Chuckles)

550
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:57,204
Well, there are certain endeavors

551
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:59,078
where your lack of personal connection

552
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,277
would be considered an advantage.

553
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:06,490
- This is a secure area.
- They know me.

554
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,718
Have you ever been here?

555
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,592
We were told during our initial briefing

556
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,654
that these warehouses were abandoned.

557
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:16,893
That's not precisely accurate.

558
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:25,770
(Low Radio Chatter)

559
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:29,040
(Tapes Screeching)

560
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:40,686
(Sirens, Man Speaking Russian)

561
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:55,795
By telling you what
I'm about to tell you,

562
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:57,602
I am increasing your security clearance

563
00:34:57,675 --> 00:34:59,199
to top secret.

564
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:03,043
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

565
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:04,445
Get it?

566
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:06,540
What operation?

567
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:14,149
Those are a good idea.

568
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:19,886
This factory is in Berlin.

569
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,625
We seized it at the end of the war.

570
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,428
Nazi engineers were attempting

571
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,095
to build a portable atomic bomb.

572
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,731
The Soviets reached this facility before
we did, and we lost the damn thing.

573
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:34,970
The routing orders at the Pentagon,

574
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,241
they were about this, weren't they?

575
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:41,115
The Soviets aren't as
unified as people believe.

576
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:44,780
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

577
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:47,221
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb

578
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,919
and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil.

579
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:54,891
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

580
00:35:58,836 --> 00:36:00,463
Parcher. Man is capable
of as much atrocity

581
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:02,768
as he has imagination.

582
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:07,641
New Freedom has sleeper
agents here in the U.S.

583
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,639
McCarthy is an idiot,

584
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:12,774
but unfortunately that
doesn't make him wrong.

585
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:16,744
New Freedom communicates to its agents

586
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:19,654
through codes imbedded in
newspapers and magazines,

587
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,316
and that's where you come in.

588
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:22,825
You see, John,

589
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:25,657
what distinguishes you

590
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,493
is that you are,

591
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,157
quite simply,

592
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,999
the best natural
code-breaker I have ever seen.

593
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:41,567
What exactly is it that
you would like me to do?

594
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,644
Commit this list of
periodicals to memory.

595
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:54,782
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

596
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:56,520
decipher them.

597
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:00,723
Doctor: Place your
chin on the chin rest.

598
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,598
- Stare into the light.
- Man. Pulse 88, regular.

599
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:09,562
Okay, this may be a
little uncomfortable.

600
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,268
(Groans)

601
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,277
That's got a little
zap to it, doesn't it?

602
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:17,576
He just implanted a radium diode.

603
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:19,707
Don't worry, it's safe.

604
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,583
The isotope decays predictably.

605
00:37:22,653 --> 00:37:25,850
As a result, these
numbers change over time.

606
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:29,324
They're the access
codes to your drop spot.

607
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:34,228
So what am I now, a spy?

608
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:48,970
- (Knocking)
- Come.

609
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:54,978
Boy, you must be really important.

610
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:05,127
It's all right, Mike.

611
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:15,800
What are you working on?

612
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:19,803
Classified.

613
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,476
Everyone waited half an hour.

614
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:25,242
For?

615
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,284
Class.

616
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:29,148
You missed class today.

617
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,654
Oh. I suspect that...

618
00:38:33,557 --> 00:38:35,286
nobody missed me.

619
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,826
(Chuckles)

620
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:38,953
The problem that you
left on the board...

621
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,598
I solved it.

622
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,361
Oh, no you didn't.

623
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:46,835
You didn't even look.

624
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,964
I never said that the Vector
Fields were rational functions.

625
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:56,509
Your solution is elegant.

626
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:01,349
Though on this particular occasion,

627
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:04,445
ultimately incorrect.

628
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,309
You're still here.

629
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,243
I'm still here.

630
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:31,808
Why?

631
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:35,374
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,

632
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:38,921
if I can ask you to dinner.

633
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:45,094
You do eat, don't you?

634
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:47,596
Oh, on occasion, yeah. (Chuckles)

635
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:50,361
Table for one. Prometheus
alone chained to the rock

636
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,732
with the bird circling
overhead, you know how it is.

637
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:54,634
(Laughs)

638
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:57,999
No, I expect that you wouldn't...

639
00:39:58,075 --> 00:39:59,770
You wouldn't know.

640
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:04,774
If you leave your
address with my office,

641
00:40:04,848 --> 00:40:07,976
I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00

642
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,577
and we'll eat.

643
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:20,853
One more thing. Do you have a name,

644
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:22,922
or should I just keep
calling you "miss"?

645
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:27,760
Governor, may I present...

646
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:29,806
- Miss Alicia Larde.
- Miss Alicia Larde.

647
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:32,865
- How do you do?
- Professor, please. You and the governor.

648
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:40,610
Wait, one second. I'm
sorry. I want a copy of this.

649
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:42,811
First big date and all, you know.

650
00:40:42,886 --> 00:40:45,946
So, you boys need to look good.

651
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:53,019
Which is not a state you find
yourselves in altogether naturally.

652
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:58,924
There. Better.

653
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:02,234
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

654
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:04,171
Professor.

655
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:22,951
God must be a painter.

656
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:26,360
Why else would we have so many colors?

657
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:30,831
So you're a painter?

658
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:34,803
That's not actually what I said,

659
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:37,705
but, yes...

660
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,243
I am.

661
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:49,979
Here.

662
00:41:50,054 --> 00:41:51,954
Me.

663
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:53,580
Your date?

664
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,284
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

665
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:00,489
That's a plan.

666
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,729
Champagne would be lovely.

667
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,073
I'll be outside.

668
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,233
I will get the champagne.

669
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:22,512
Oh, thank you.

670
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:25,244
Thank you for that.

671
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:27,654
No, keep it.

672
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:30,785
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.

673
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,852
Do you?

674
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,864
No.

675
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:36,923
I don't believe in luck.

676
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,865
But I do believe in
assigning value to things.

677
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,706
Oh.

678
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:56,642
I once tried to count them all.

679
00:42:57,654 --> 00:43:02,455
I actually made it to 4,348.

680
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:06,922
You are exceptionally odd.

681
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:09,864
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

682
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:17,630
A pair of odd ducks, then.

683
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,302
Mmm.

684
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,909
Pick a shape.

685
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,945
What?

686
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:32,250
Pick a shape. An animal... anything.

687
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,286
Okay.

688
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,885
An umbrella.

689
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,331
Do it again.

690
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:18,766
(Chuckles)

691
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,428
- Do it again.
- All right.

692
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,199
- What would you like?
- Do, uh...

693
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:24,832
an octopus.

694
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:50,047
(Dog Barking)

695
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:14,409
(Alicia Chuckles)

696
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:16,878
Alicia: You don't talk much, do you?

697
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,711
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

698
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,614
I don't mean work.

699
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:29,157
I find that polishing my interactions

700
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:32,252
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

701
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,524
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow...

702
00:47:38,835 --> 00:47:41,167
by being direct.

703
00:47:42,506 --> 00:47:44,633
I often don't get a pleasant result.

704
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,005
Try me.

705
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:49,740
All right.

706
00:47:53,316 --> 00:47:55,181
I find you attractive.

707
00:47:56,186 --> 00:47:58,381
Your aggressive moves towards me

708
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:00,252
indicate that you feel the same way.

709
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:03,121
But still, ritual requires that we

710
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:05,923
continue with a number
of platonic activities

711
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:08,260
before we have sex.

712
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:11,528
I am proceeding with those activities,

713
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:13,626
but in point of actual fact,

714
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:17,800
all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

715
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:22,104
Are you gonna slap me now?

716
00:48:46,703 --> 00:48:48,796
How was that result?

717
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:07,747
Girl: What are you doing?

718
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,854
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned re-occurrences

719
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:17,559
within periodicals over time... and you?

720
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:19,864
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

721
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:26,041
Do I know you?

722
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,205
My uncle says you're very
smart but not very nice,

723
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,373
so I shouldn't pay no
mind if you're mean to me.

724
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:34,474
And who might your uncle be?

725
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:36,985
The prodigal roommate...

726
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:38,918
returns.

727
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,684
(Chuckles)

728
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:45,156
- Come here.
- Charles, Charles, Charles.

729
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,460
My sister...

730
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,902
got herself killed in a car crash.

731
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,567
Not too far now, Marcee!

732
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,041
Her cowboy husband was too drunk

733
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,238
to know that he was too drunk to drive.

734
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:05,747
So, I took her in.

735
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:10,412
- She's so small.
- She's young, John. That's how they come.

736
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,580
I'm at Harvard...

737
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:17,320
doing the great author's workshop.

738
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:19,453
D.H. Bloody Lawrence.

739
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:21,690
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

740
00:50:21,765 --> 00:50:23,790
(Chuckles)

741
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,961
Well, I've been reading a lot about you.

742
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:30,201
How are you, John?

743
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:33,299
At first all my work here was trivial,

744
00:50:33,376 --> 00:50:36,072
but a new assignment came up and...

745
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:39,138
I can't really tell you any details.

746
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:41,548
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

747
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,779
Something like that.

748
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:47,551
- And, uh...
- yes?

749
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:49,524
Well, l... I met a girl.

750
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:52,528
- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapiens.

751
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,791
- A biped?
- Yup. And contrary to all probabilities,

752
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:57,299
she finds me attractive on
a number of different levels.

753
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:58,231
(Laughs) Really?

754
00:50:58,301 --> 00:51:01,498
God, that's wonderful.

755
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,438
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

756
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,570
Should I marry her?

757
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:10,613
Oh, God. Right.

758
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,944
I mean, everything's going well.

759
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:15,610
The job is fine. I have enough money.

760
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:17,346
It all seems to add up.

761
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,355
But how do you know for sure?

762
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,695
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

763
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:27,855
That's the only sure thing I do know.

764
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:36,862
Waiter: Good evening.

765
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:45,581
Alicia, please don't be angry.

766
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:47,207
I just lost track of time at work...

767
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:50,378
- again.
- Mm-hmm.

768
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:52,944
I'm sorry.

769
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,955
I didn't have time to wrap it.

770
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:58,517
Happy birthday.

771
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:04,858
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

772
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,732
they create a full wavelength dispersal,

773
00:52:06,803 --> 00:52:08,828
so if you look inside it, you can see...

774
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:11,533
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

775
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:12,836
Yeah.

776
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:15,469
Remember you said that
time God must be a painter,

777
00:52:15,545 --> 00:52:18,343
because of all the colors?
At the governor's house...

778
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,212
you said that.

779
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:22,444
I didn't think you were listening.

780
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:27,014
I'm always listening.

781
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:35,958
It's beautiful.

782
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,967
(Chuckles)

783
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:54,912
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

784
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:56,748
'Cause I need some kind of proof,

785
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,050
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

786
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:04,660
(Laughs)

787
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:07,822
I'm sorry, just give me a moment...

788
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:12,365
to redefine my girlish
notions of romance.

789
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:17,799
A proof?

790
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:19,466
Verifiable data.

791
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:22,238
Um... okay.

792
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,911
Well, how big is the universe?

793
00:53:27,984 --> 00:53:29,576
Infinite.

794
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:30,846
How do you know?

795
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,683
I know because all the data indicate it.

796
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:34,485
- But it hasn't been proven yet?
- No.

797
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:36,422
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

798
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:39,428
I don't, I just believe it.

799
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,088
Mmm.

800
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:44,929
It's the same with love, I guess.

801
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:54,136
Now,

802
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,337
the part that you don't know...

803
00:53:58,515 --> 00:54:01,348
is if I want to marry you.

804
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:17,993
(Applause)

805
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:24,502
Smile for the camera!

806
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:29,168
Well done!

807
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:31,179
Oh, sweet pea.

808
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,908
- I love you.
- Congratulations.

809
00:54:32,982 --> 00:54:34,745
Hey, Sol.

810
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:37,116
Woman. You look beautiful.

811
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:39,383
Sol: Hi, how are you?

812
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,324
Alicia: Hey, Sol.

813
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,364
- Woman: Bye-bye.
- Man: Bye, now.

814
00:54:48,431 --> 00:54:50,422
- Bye!
- Bye!

815
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,127
Be safe!

816
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:01,701
(Gate Opens)

817
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:05,571
Cambridge, MA October 1 954

818
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:23,128
Get In. Hurry.

819
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:29,504
They're following us.

820
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:34,600
Who's... Who's following us?

821
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:36,304
The drop's been compromised.

822
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:38,313
- (Gunfire)
- Parcher. Get down!

823
00:55:39,315 --> 00:55:41,442
- Stay down.
- (Horn Honks)

824
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:49,320
- (Pants)
- (Horn Honking)

825
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:03,664
(Gun Firing)

826
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:11,409
- Here, take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

827
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:14,143
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

828
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:15,809
Son of a...

829
00:56:15,885 --> 00:56:17,750
(Screams)

830
00:56:32,468 --> 00:56:34,595
You stay back. Don't move.

831
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:41,705
(Screams)

832
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,378
(Tires Screeching)

833
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,817
Alicia. John?

834
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:31,483
Hi.

835
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:35,625
Where were you?

836
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:41,533
- S-Sol... - Yeah,
I talked to Sol.

837
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:44,232
He said you left the office hours ago.

838
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:49,303
Why didn't you call me?

839
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,345
Are you all right?

840
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:06,321
Honey?

841
00:58:06,396 --> 00:58:08,125
(Bolt Locking)

842
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:09,323
John...

843
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:12,664
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

844
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:16,034
John, open the door.

845
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:20,676
Come on, open the door! Let me in!

846
00:58:20,743 --> 00:58:22,711
Talk to me!

847
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:25,271
John!

848
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:28,442
Open the door!

849
00:58:30,386 --> 00:58:32,854
(Panting)

850
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:47,332
Woman: Watch for cars, kids.

851
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,354
(Door Opens, Closes)

852
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:31,337
John.

853
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:33,848
William.

854
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:36,214
This is not what I signed on for.

855
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:38,310
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...

856
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:42,188
I understand... better than
you could possibly imagine.

857
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:54,426
You need to calm down, John.

858
00:59:54,504 --> 00:59:57,132
Now listen to me. We're
closing in on the bomb,

859
00:59:57,206 --> 00:59:59,538
in large part due to your work.

860
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:02,271
Now don't you think your
fear is a small price to pay?

861
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:05,178
William, my circumstance has changed.

862
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:07,580
Alicia's pregnant.

863
01:00:15,858 --> 01:00:18,918
I told you attachments were dangerous.

864
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:22,021
You chose to marry the girl.

865
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:24,658
I did nothing to prevent it.

866
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,861
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety

867
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:32,134
is for you to continue your work.

868
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:34,734
Well, I'll just quit.

869
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:36,608
You won't.

870
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,112
Why would I not?

871
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:41,514
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

872
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:44,281
You quit working for me,

873
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:47,083
I quit working for you.

874
01:00:59,702 --> 01:01:01,294
Parcher!

875
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,894
Parcher!

876
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:09,504
John, you all right?

877
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:31,632
John?

878
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,328
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

879
01:01:37,106 --> 01:01:38,767
Why would you do that?

880
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:40,468
Why would you turn the light on?

881
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,033
What is wrong with you?

882
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:44,011
You have to go to your sister's.

883
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:47,612
I left the car out the
back. You take Commonwealth.

884
01:01:47,683 --> 01:01:50,914
- No side streets, you stay where it's crowded.
- John, I'm not going anywhere!

885
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:53,353
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

886
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:55,515
- No, I'm not going.
- Just get your things.

887
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:58,151
- I'm not leaving...
- stop! Stop it!

888
01:01:58,227 --> 01:02:00,821
Please, Alicia.

889
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:04,196
I'll explain when I can.

890
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:47,207
Harvard University National
Mathematics Conference

891
01:02:50,613 --> 01:02:52,547
Marcee. Uncle John!

892
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,708
Uncle John!

893
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:56,877
(Growls)

894
01:02:56,953 --> 01:03:00,411
- Hey, baby girl!
- (Marcee Laughing)

895
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:03,253
Wow, someone needed a hug!

896
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:05,954
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

897
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:08,223
"How can I miss seeing a guest lecture

898
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:10,492
by the inimitable John Nash"?

899
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,433
What's wrong?

900
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:20,635
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

901
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,541
Well, now you tell me, what is it?

902
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:24,807
Woman. Professor Nash!

903
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,144
Welcome!

904
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,648
After?

905
01:03:36,258 --> 01:03:40,388
John: So, we see that the... the zeroes,

906
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:43,057
of the Reimann zeta function,

907
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:45,862
correspond to singularities

908
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:49,132
in space-time,

909
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:52,140
singularities in space-time...

910
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:57,912
And conventional number theory...

911
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:04,377
it breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

912
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,794
Sometimes our expectations

913
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:24,305
are betrayed by the numbers.

914
01:04:24,373 --> 01:04:27,433
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

915
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,070
rational value.

916
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:52,059
Professor Nash!

917
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:04,439
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

918
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:08,646
Professor Nash,

919
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:12,154
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

920
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:14,212
What do you want?

921
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,884
My name is Rosen,

922
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,984
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

923
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:22,155
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

924
01:05:22,231 --> 01:05:24,893
I'd like you to come with me, John.

925
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:27,835
Just for a chat.

926
01:05:28,904 --> 01:05:30,929
It appears I have no choice.

927
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:35,543
Oh-hh!

928
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:44,214
Help me! Somebody!

929
01:05:48,224 --> 01:05:49,782
(Screams) Somebody!

930
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:53,260
Help me! Get off me!

931
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,695
I know who you are! I know who you are!

932
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:57,392
No, no, no, no, don't.

933
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:59,366
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

934
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:01,232
Call somebody! Call somebody, Charles!

935
01:06:01,303 --> 01:06:02,793
- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.

936
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:04,635
Get away from me.

937
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:06,971
Stay away from me!

938
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:14,372
Dr. Rosen. There, now.

939
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,281
All better.

940
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:22,187
- Everything's all right here.
- (Gasps)

941
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:26,086
Watch your head.

942
01:06:56,158 --> 01:06:58,524
(Dr. Rosen, Faintly) John?

943
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:01,587
Can you hear me?

944
01:07:10,206 --> 01:07:12,731
(Faint Whispering)

945
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:17,344
Go easy now.

946
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:20,382
Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.

947
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:25,716
Sorry about the restraints.

948
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:28,313
You've got one hell of a right hook.

949
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:31,553
(Weakly) Where am I?

950
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:33,288
Ahem.

951
01:07:33,362 --> 01:07:35,728
Macarthur Psychiatric Hospital.

952
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:41,501
I find that highly unlikely.

953
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,094
You made a mistake.

954
01:07:43,172 --> 01:07:47,074
My work is non-military in application.

955
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:49,633
Which work is that, John?

956
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:53,544
I don't know anything.

957
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:56,244
(Laughs) There's no good in
keeping secrets, you know.

958
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:00,714
(Groans)

959
01:08:04,426 --> 01:08:06,656
(Buzzer)

960
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:14,698
Charles?

961
01:08:16,105 --> 01:08:17,663
Charles?

962
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:21,342
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

963
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:25,546
I'm... I'm sorry.

964
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:32,251
Charles...?

965
01:08:38,093 --> 01:08:40,857
The prodigal roommate revealed.

966
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:46,894
"Saw my name on the lecture slate"?

967
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:49,130
You lying son of a bitch!

968
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:51,900
Who are you talking
to? Tell me who you see.

969
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:54,568
How do you say, "Charles
Herman" in Russian?

970
01:08:54,643 --> 01:08:57,168
How do you say it in Russian?

971
01:08:57,246 --> 01:09:00,545
There's no one there,
John. There's no one there.

972
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:03,176
He's right there. He's right there.

973
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:06,346
Stop! I don't know anything!

974
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:09,084
Stop! l... I don't know anything!

975
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,290
My name is John Nash.

976
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,023
I'm being held against my will.

977
01:09:15,097 --> 01:09:17,657
Somebody call the Department of Defense.

978
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:19,462
My name is John Nash.

979
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,060
I'm being held against my will!

980
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:29,600
Alicia. What's wrong with him?

981
01:09:32,281 --> 01:09:34,545
John has schizophrenia.

982
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:38,382
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

983
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:43,816
But... But his work.

984
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:46,156
He deals with conspiracies...

985
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:49,426
Yes, yes, I know.

986
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:53,628
In John's world, these
behaviors are... accepted,

987
01:09:53,702 --> 01:09:55,329
encouraged.

988
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,840
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated

989
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,738
far longer than is typical.

990
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:03,368
What do you mean? How long?

991
01:10:03,445 --> 01:10:05,504
Possibly since graduate school?

992
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:08,846
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

993
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,283
What are you talking
about? What hallucinations?

994
01:10:11,353 --> 01:10:13,583
One, so far, that I am aware of.

995
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:17,022
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

996
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:20,550
Charles isn't imaginary.

997
01:10:20,629 --> 01:10:23,223
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

998
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:26,267
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

999
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:29,202
He's always in town for
so little time, lecturing.

1000
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:32,104
- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.

1001
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,732
Have you ever seen a picture of him,

1002
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:36,437
- talked to him on the telephone?
- This is ridiculous.

1003
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,673
I phoned Princeton.

1004
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:40,612
According to their housing records,

1005
01:10:40,682 --> 01:10:42,582
John lived alone.

1006
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:48,890
Now, which is more
likely... that your husband,

1007
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,255
a mathematician with
no military training,

1008
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:53,760
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

1009
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:55,490
You're making him sound crazy.

1010
01:10:55,564 --> 01:10:58,795
...Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

1011
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:02,897
Now the only way I can help him

1012
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,336
is to show him the difference

1013
01:11:04,406 --> 01:11:07,170
between what's real

1014
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:09,403
and what is in his mind.

1015
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:13,981
Come on.

1016
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,915
What's he been working on?

1017
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,921
His work is classified.

1018
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:23,253
He mentioned a supervisor

1019
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,850
by the name of William Parcher.

1020
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:28,920
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

1021
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,465
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

1022
01:11:32,534 --> 01:11:34,024
You want me to help you get

1023
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,094
the details of my husband's work?

1024
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:39,629
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

1025
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,676
Is that what you think?

1026
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:48,815
- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?

1027
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:50,511
I don't know.

1028
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,315
I want to see what
Johns been working on.

1029
01:11:52,387 --> 01:11:55,447
- You know you can't go in his office.
- It's classified, Alicia.

1030
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:57,014
Stop. Oh!

1031
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:12,770
Oh, my God.

1032
01:12:16,845 --> 01:12:18,813
Oh, my God.

1033
01:12:25,754 --> 01:12:28,723
Why didn't you say something?

1034
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,816
Alicia, John's always been

1035
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,260
a little weird.

1036
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:36,490
He said he was doing code-breaking,

1037
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:38,760
that it was eyes-only.

1038
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:41,803
- Top secret, part of the military effort.
- Was he?

1039
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,338
Well, it was possible, you know?

1040
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:45,839
Directives come down all the time

1041
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:47,307
that some of us aren't cleared for.

1042
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:49,844
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

1043
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,743
not likely.

1044
01:12:53,448 --> 01:12:56,212
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated

1045
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,446
and then when you called...

1046
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,114
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

1047
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:03,522
Cutting out magazines?

1048
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:07,789
Well, not all.

1049
01:14:08,357 --> 01:14:10,757
(Door Opens)

1050
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,469
- Alicia: I'm so sorry.
- John: It's okay.

1051
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,742
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

1052
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:42,089
I have to talk to you.

1053
01:14:42,157 --> 01:14:44,250
Okay.

1054
01:14:48,897 --> 01:14:51,525
Alicia, I've been thinking about it,

1055
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,195
and I do realize that my behavior

1056
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:58,364
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

1057
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,874
must have appeared insane.

1058
01:15:00,942 --> 01:15:03,103
I left you with no other choice.

1059
01:15:03,178 --> 01:15:05,373
I do understand...

1060
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:08,348
- and I'm truly sorry.
- That's okay.

1061
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:11,949
Everything's gonna be all right.

1062
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:15,616
Everything's gonna be all right.

1063
01:15:16,658 --> 01:15:18,626
We just have to talk quietly.

1064
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:24,321
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1065
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,993
I'm gonna tell you everything now.

1066
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,503
It's breaking with protocol

1067
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:31,505
but you need to know,

1068
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:35,475
because you have to
help me get out of here.

1069
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:40,178
I've been doing top-secret
work for the government.

1070
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:41,977
There's a threat that exists

1071
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:44,746
of catastrophic proportions.

1072
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,653
I think the Russians feel
my profile is too high.

1073
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:50,123
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1074
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:52,490
They're keeping me
here to try to stop me

1075
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:54,893
from doing my work. You
have to get to Wheeler.

1076
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:57,022
- You have to find William Parcher.
- Stop.

1077
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:00,034
- He can help us.
- Stop. Stop. Stop!

1078
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:06,569
I went to Wheeler.

1079
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:08,302
Good, good.

1080
01:16:08,377 --> 01:16:10,436
There is no William Parcher.

1081
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:12,871
Of course there is.

1082
01:16:12,914 --> 01:16:14,848
- I've been working for him.
- Doing what?

1083
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,077
Breaking codes?

1084
01:16:17,152 --> 01:16:19,245
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox

1085
01:16:19,321 --> 01:16:21,255
for the government to pick up?

1086
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:24,621
How could you know that?

1087
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:26,820
Sol followed you.

1088
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:30,365
- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?

1089
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:42,069
They've never been opened.

1090
01:16:44,746 --> 01:16:47,442
It isn't real.

1091
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:50,747
There is no conspiracy, John.

1092
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:55,921
There is no William Parcher.

1093
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:59,426
It's in your mind.

1094
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:04,591
Do you understand, baby?

1095
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,362
You're sick.

1096
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:12,570
You're sick, John.

1097
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:14,302
John?!

1098
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:16,310
John!

1099
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:26,143
Code red.

1100
01:17:26,221 --> 01:17:28,781
(Over P.A.) Dr. Rosen, code
red. Observation room two.

1101
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:32,486
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1102
01:17:38,099 --> 01:17:39,930
(Keys Jingling)

1103
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:45,767
John?

1104
01:17:47,442 --> 01:17:49,307
John?

1105
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:53,578
The implant's gone.

1106
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:56,617
I can't find it.

1107
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:02,452
It's gone.

1108
01:18:33,622 --> 01:18:36,716
Dr. Rosen. You see, the
nightmare of schizophrenia

1109
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:39,123
is not knowing what's true.

1110
01:18:39,694 --> 01:18:41,662
Imagine...

1111
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,927
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places

1112
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,969
and the moments most important to you

1113
01:18:48,036 --> 01:18:50,504
were not gone, not dead,

1114
01:18:50,572 --> 01:18:53,097
but worse...

1115
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:55,108
Had never been.

1116
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,614
What kind of hell would that be?

1117
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,745
Administering insulin.

1118
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,055
Man. 8.42 am.

1119
01:20:08,783 --> 01:20:10,944
How often?

1120
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:15,456
Five times a week for 1 0 weeks.

1121
01:20:36,144 --> 01:20:38,544
Princeton University 1 Year Later

1122
01:20:38,613 --> 01:20:42,208
Alicia. John always spoke so
fondly of being here at Princeton.

1123
01:20:42,283 --> 01:20:44,979
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1124
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:46,748
So he keeps reminding
us, and reminding us.

1125
01:20:46,821 --> 01:20:48,721
(Laughs)

1126
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,155
Yeah.

1127
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,455
John won't come near the campus, though.

1128
01:20:52,527 --> 01:20:55,462
- I think he's ashamed.
- (Baby Cries)

1129
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:58,522
Hey. Hey.

1130
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,727
Want this?

1131
01:21:00,802 --> 01:21:04,431
So, Alicia, how...
how are you holding up?

1132
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:07,270
Well, the delusions have passed.

1133
01:21:07,342 --> 01:21:09,606
They're saying with the medication

1134
01:21:09,678 --> 01:21:11,270
and low stress environment...

1135
01:21:11,346 --> 01:21:14,144
No, l... I mean, how are you?

1136
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:23,653
I think often what I feel

1137
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:26,990
is obligation.

1138
01:21:29,064 --> 01:21:32,363
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

1139
01:21:33,401 --> 01:21:37,895
Rage against John, against God and...

1140
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:41,272
But...

1141
01:21:44,312 --> 01:21:46,507
then I look at him

1142
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:52,344
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1143
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,218
And he becomes that man.

1144
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:59,727
He's transformed into
someone that I love.

1145
01:22:01,696 --> 01:22:05,223
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.

1146
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:10,094
It's not all the time,

1147
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:13,004
but...

1148
01:22:13,074 --> 01:22:14,803
it's enough.

1149
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:17,845
I think John is a very lucky man...

1150
01:22:17,912 --> 01:22:19,573
Alicia.

1151
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:26,916
So unlucky.

1152
01:22:29,924 --> 01:22:32,017
- Alicia: This is us.
- Sol: This is it?

1153
01:22:32,093 --> 01:22:34,755
- It's nice.
- It's near where I work.

1154
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:37,354
Alicia. John? You've a visitor.

1155
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:41,969
Hi.

1156
01:22:42,036 --> 01:22:43,628
Hi.

1157
01:22:43,705 --> 01:22:45,570
I hope it's okay.

1158
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:54,572
Hey ya, chief.

1159
01:22:56,317 --> 01:22:58,649
- Cigarette?
- Ah, no, thanks.

1160
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,813
I quit, actually.

1161
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:06,791
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

1162
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,688
Have you met Harvey?

1163
01:23:10,765 --> 01:23:12,198
Umm, I...

1164
01:23:12,267 --> 01:23:13,495
(Laughs)

1165
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:15,433
- John, there's no...
- Relax, it's okay.

1166
01:23:15,503 --> 01:23:18,165
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

1167
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,230
Jesus Christ, John. (Laughs)

1168
01:23:20,308 --> 01:23:21,935
I should have known.

1169
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:25,276
Here you go.

1170
01:23:26,815 --> 01:23:28,749
I can take those later.

1171
01:23:28,817 --> 01:23:30,375
You're supposed to take them now.

1172
01:23:31,686 --> 01:23:35,087
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

1173
01:23:35,156 --> 01:23:36,680
Okay.

1174
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:42,189
So, um... yeah. l... I was in town

1175
01:23:42,263 --> 01:23:44,424
giving a workshop.

1176
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,467
I go back tonight.

1177
01:23:46,534 --> 01:23:48,798
You know, Bender, he really wanted

1178
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:53,432
to stop by and you know,
see you. You know, say hi.

1179
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:55,135
Squeamish?

1180
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:57,644
Yeah.

1181
01:23:57,712 --> 01:24:00,203
I suppose I would be, too.

1182
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:02,272
But alas, I'm stuck with me.

1183
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,951
- I'm trying to solve the
Reimann Hypothesis. - Uh-huh.

1184
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,426
Oh, yeah?

1185
01:24:12,493 --> 01:24:15,621
I figured if... if I dazzle them,

1186
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:17,892
they will have to reinstate me.

1187
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,961
But it's difficult with the medication,

1188
01:24:23,037 --> 01:24:26,473
because it's hard to...

1189
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:30,102
see the solution.

1190
01:24:38,586 --> 01:24:41,384
You know, John, you should go easy.

1191
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:44,482
There are other things besides...

1192
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:45,856
Besides work.

1193
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:50,390
What are they?

1194

What are you thinking about?

1199
01:25:31,572 --> 01:25:33,506
What do people do?

1200
01:25:33,574 --> 01:25:36,008
It's life, John.

1201
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:38,045
Activities available,

1202
01:25:38,112 --> 01:25:40,706
just add meaning.

1203
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:50,249
You could try leaving the house.

1204
01:25:50,325 --> 01:25:53,761
You know, maybe...

1205
01:25:53,828 --> 01:25:55,989
talk to people.

1206
01:26:00,601 --> 01:26:02,933
You could try taking out the garbage.

(Muffled Voice)

1208
01:26:25,059 --> 01:26:27,721

more... there's some more in...

(Muffled)

1210

Who... Who were you talking to?

1211
01:26:42,577 --> 01:26:44,704
Garbage man.

1212
01:26:53,988 --> 01:26:56,548
Garbage men don't come at night.

1213
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,319
I guess around here they do.

My mother's going to keep the
baby a little longer tonight.

1226
01:29:43,224 --> 01:29:45,419
I can get three hours of overtime.

1228

- Good night.
- Good night.

Parcher. It's good to see you, John.

1233
01:31:44,845 --> 01:31:46,870
It's been a while.

1234

Yes, sir.

I don't think that I
would go that way, John.

1240
01:32:07,468 --> 01:32:09,800
It's time for you to get back to work.

1241
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:12,896
Parcher. The bomb is
in its final position

1248
01:32:42,603 --> 01:32:47,267
We've narrowed the bomb's location
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.

1249
01:32:47,341 --> 01:32:51,971
But we haven't been able to

01:33:04,325 --> 01:33:06,054
What?

1253
01:33:06,127 --> 01:33:07,526
What?

1254
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:13,726

- Rosen! That quack!

John, look at me.

Do I look like I'm imagined?

1260
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:30,508
Wheeler has no record of you.

1261
01:33:30,584 --> 01:33:33,052
Do you think we list our personnel?

1262
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:38,352
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1263

I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

I can restore your status at Wheeler.

He's been injected

01:37:33,827 --> 01:37:35,886
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1312
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:41,058
Finish her. She knows too much now.

1313
01:37:43,537 --> 01:37:45,471
Uncle John?

1314
01:37:45,539 --> 01:37:47,564
Parcher. Take care of her,
you pathetic piece of shit,

1315
01:37:47,641 --> 01:37:48,938
or I'll take care of you.

1316
01:37:49,009 --> 01:37:50,476
John,

1317
01:37:50,544 --> 01:37:53,206
Christ, John, please do what he says.

1318
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,044
Move, soldier.

1319
01:37:56,116 --> 01:37:57,583
Now.

1320
01:37:57,651 --> 01:37:58,879
Marcee. Uncle John?

1321
01:37:58,952 --> 01:38:01,580
Charles. John, please!

1322
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,348
Now!

1323
01:38:04,425 --> 01:38:06,655
(Mental Voices) Alicia and
Charles never co-exist in the same

1324
01:38:06,727 --> 01:38:08,592
interactive field. Alicia and Parcher...

1325
01:38:08,662 --> 01:38:10,789
(Voices Continue)

1326
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:18,031
- Marcee: Let's play!
- (Voices Increase)

1327
01:38:18,105 --> 01:38:20,801
...Charles, and Marcee
cannot co-exist with Alicia.

1328
01:38:20,874 --> 01:38:22,603
I understand.

1329
01:38:22,676 --> 01:38:24,871
(Engine Starts)

1330
01:38:27,414 --> 01:38:29,006
(Screams)

1331
01:38:38,892 --> 01:38:40,883
She never gets old.

1332
01:38:43,597 --> 01:38:47,124
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1333
01:39:19,867 --> 01:39:21,425
You see them now?

1334
01:39:30,677 --> 01:39:32,406
Yes.

1335
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:37,013
Why did you stop your meds?

1336
01:39:39,253 --> 01:39:41,585
Because I couldn't do my work.

1337
01:39:41,655 --> 01:39:43,589
I couldn't help with the baby.

1338
01:39:43,657 --> 01:39:45,420
I couldn't...

1339
01:39:46,927 --> 01:39:49,122
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1340
01:39:51,465 --> 01:39:53,831
You think that's
better than being crazy?

1341
01:39:53,901 --> 01:39:56,995
We'll need to start you on a higher run

1342
01:39:57,070 --> 01:39:59,038
of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1343
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:00,733
No.

1344
01:40:00,808 --> 01:40:02,673
There has to be another way.

1345
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:05,041
Dr. Rosen. Schizophrenia
is degenerative.

1346
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:07,080
Some days may be symptom-free,

1347
01:40:07,147 --> 01:40:08,842
but over time, you are getting worse.

1348
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:11,942
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1349
01:40:12,019 --> 01:40:14,852
It's a problem with no solution.

1350
01:40:14,922 --> 01:40:16,651
And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1351
01:40:16,723 --> 01:40:18,384
- That's what I do best.
- This isn't math.

1352
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,221
Dr. Rosen. You can't
come up with a formula

1353
01:40:20,294 --> 01:40:22,091
to change the way you
experience the world.

1354
01:40:22,162 --> 01:40:25,097
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1355
01:40:25,165 --> 01:40:27,895
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't I?

1356
01:40:27,968 --> 01:40:30,766
Because your mind is where the
problem is in the first place.

1357
01:40:32,739 --> 01:40:34,969
I can do this.

1358
01:40:35,042 --> 01:40:38,671
I can work it out. All I need is time.

1359
01:40:41,715 --> 01:40:44,206
Is that the baby?

1360
01:40:45,919 --> 01:40:48,479
The baby's at my mother's, John.

1361
01:40:55,896 --> 01:40:58,262
(Marcee Humming)

1362
01:41:02,135 --> 01:41:05,571
Dr. Rosen. Without treatment, John,

1363
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:07,038
the fantasies may take over...

1364
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:09,599
entirely.

1365
01:41:27,394 --> 01:41:29,692
Alicia. You almost ready?

1366
01:41:31,632 --> 01:41:33,998
Rosen's waiting outside.

1367
01:41:34,067 --> 01:41:36,797
I can't go back to that hospital.

1368
01:41:40,774 --> 01:41:42,867
I won't come home.

1369
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,610
He said that if you said that,

1370
01:41:48,682 --> 01:41:53,119
he has commitment papers for me to sign.

1371
01:41:55,455 --> 01:41:57,218
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1372
01:41:59,059 --> 01:42:01,118
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1373
01:42:03,997 --> 01:42:06,022
I will try to figure this out.

1374
01:42:08,402 --> 01:42:10,233
Whatever you do,

1375
01:42:10,304 --> 01:42:13,637
Rosen is right about one thing.

1376
01:42:13,707 --> 01:42:16,232
You shouldn't be here.

1377
01:42:18,612 --> 01:42:20,546
I'm not safe anymore.

1378
01:42:26,186 --> 01:42:28,211
Would you have hurt me, John?

1379
01:42:37,597 --> 01:42:39,258
I don't know.

1380
01:42:40,934 --> 01:42:44,028
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.

(Footsteps On Stairs)

1386
01:43:49,936 --> 01:43:53,463
Rosen said to call if you
try and kill me or anything.

1387
01:44:09,823 --> 01:44:12,121
You want to know what's real?

1388
01:44:17,564 --> 01:44:19,532
This.

1389
01:44:26,807 --> 01:44:28,798
This.

1390
01:44:34,081 --> 01:44:36,015
This.

1391
01:44:37,417 --> 01:44:39,578
This is real.

1392
01:44:42,923 --> 01:44:45,323
Maybe the part...

1393
01:44:45,392 --> 01:44:47,792
that knows the waking from the dream,

1394
01:44:49,162 --> 01:44:51,130
maybe it isn't here.

1395
01:44:54,968 --> 01:44:57,436
Maybe it's here.

1396
01:45:02,109 --> 01:45:04,441
I need to believe

1397
01:45:04,511 --> 01:45:07,947
that something
extraordinary is possible.

Princeton University Two Months Later

1400
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:12,473
Hansen. Come.

1401
01:46:20,453 --> 01:46:22,819
Hello, Martin.

1402
01:46:27,394 --> 01:46:29,658
Jesus Christ.

1403
01:46:31,331 --> 01:46:32,457
No. l...

1404
01:46:33,033 --> 01:46:36,093
I don't have that one. My savior complex

1405
01:46:36,169 --> 01:46:37,602
takes on a completely different form.

1406
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:39,400
(Nash Chuckles)

1407
01:46:39,472 --> 01:46:42,566
I heard what happened and well,

1408
01:46:42,642 --> 01:46:45,042
l... I wanted to write and
I tried you at Macarthur's

1409
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:47,238
but you'd left, and I just...

1410
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:01,351
this is Helinger's old office.

1411
01:47:01,428 --> 01:47:03,020
Yeah.

1412
01:47:03,096 --> 01:47:05,621
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1413
01:47:07,968 --> 01:47:10,459
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1414
01:47:11,838 --> 01:47:14,807
They were wrong, John. No one wins.

1415
01:47:14,874 --> 01:47:17,604
Please, please have a seat.

1416
01:47:17,677 --> 01:47:20,612
God, it's so good to see you.

1417
01:47:22,716 --> 01:47:25,082
What brings you back to Princeton?

1418
01:47:25,151 --> 01:47:26,516
Charles. John?

1419
01:47:26,586 --> 01:47:29,817
John, I'm sorry, but
you have to tell him.

1420
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:31,982
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1421
01:47:32,058 --> 01:47:33,650
Tell him your work is critical.

1422
01:47:33,727 --> 01:47:35,991
John, please!

1423
01:47:49,576 --> 01:47:53,103
Is there any chance that you
could ignore what I just did?

1424
01:47:54,781 --> 01:47:57,682
Of course, what are old friends for?

1425
01:47:57,751 --> 01:48:01,380
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?

1426
01:48:01,454 --> 01:48:03,547
John, of course.

1427
01:48:03,623 --> 01:48:06,387
Of course. We always have been.

1428
01:48:11,598 --> 01:48:13,532
Alicia and I think that...

1429
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,397
That fitting in,

1430
01:48:15,468 --> 01:48:17,459
being part of a community,

1431
01:48:19,773 --> 01:48:21,536
might do me some good.

1432
01:48:21,608 --> 01:48:23,508
That a certain level of attachment,

1433
01:48:23,576 --> 01:48:25,567
familiar places, familiar people,

1434
01:48:27,047 --> 01:48:28,844
might help me...

1435
01:48:28,915 --> 01:48:31,406
elbow out these...

1436
01:48:34,721 --> 01:48:37,713
These certain delusions that I have.

1437
01:48:42,395 --> 01:48:45,057
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1438
01:48:47,467 --> 01:48:49,628
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

1439
01:48:52,939 --> 01:48:55,737
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1440
01:48:56,776 --> 01:48:58,676
(Sighs)

1441
01:49:04,417 --> 01:49:05,907
Huh.

1442
01:49:09,956 --> 01:49:12,117
Will you be needing an office?

1443
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:18,294
No.

1444
01:49:21,101 --> 01:49:24,002
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1445
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:26,630
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

1446
01:49:26,706 --> 01:49:29,903
- but he doesn't have I.D.
- Why can't people read their memos, huh?

1447
01:49:29,976 --> 01:49:31,671
Then he goes totally nuts.

1448
01:49:31,745 --> 01:49:33,975
John: Not real! You're not real.

1449
01:49:34,047 --> 01:49:35,947
There's no mission.

1450
01:49:36,015 --> 01:49:38,313
Oh, shit. Shit.

1451
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:42,117
Not real! You are not real!

1452
01:49:42,188 --> 01:49:44,053
Is this what you are, soldier?

1453
01:49:44,124 --> 01:49:45,421
Some useless ghoul?

1454
01:49:45,492 --> 01:49:47,483
The local madman?

1455
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:50,188
- I'm not a soldier.
- You're gonna end up in a cell!

1456
01:49:50,263 --> 01:49:52,527
Old, worthless, discarded.

1457
01:49:52,599 --> 01:49:53,827
There's no mission.

1458
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:55,527
And while you rock and drool,

1459
01:49:55,602 --> 01:49:57,160
the world will burn to ashes!

1460
01:49:57,237 --> 01:49:59,671
You are not real! You are not real!

1461
01:49:59,739 --> 01:50:01,434
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1462
01:50:01,508 --> 01:50:04,807
There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!

1463
01:50:04,878 --> 01:50:06,505
John? John?

1464
01:50:06,579 --> 01:50:08,444
John, John, John, John.

1465
01:50:08,515 --> 01:50:09,846
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1466
01:50:09,916 --> 01:50:11,474
John, John! It's okay.

1467
01:50:11,551 --> 01:50:13,678
I just heard what
happened, I'm sorry. John...

1468
01:50:13,753 --> 01:50:15,414
- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.

1469
01:50:15,989 --> 01:50:17,354
Nash, hey.

1470
01:50:17,424 --> 01:50:19,415
Hey, you're all right.

1471
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,087
Nash, Nash, hey, hey, hey.

1472
01:50:26,866 --> 01:50:29,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1473
01:50:29,803 --> 01:50:31,498
Hansen: John?

1474
01:50:33,106 --> 01:50:35,734
John. You should've seen their faces.

1475
01:50:35,809 --> 01:50:38,539
Everybody was just staring at me.

1476
01:50:38,611 --> 01:50:40,238
John...

1477
01:50:40,313 --> 01:50:43,510
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1478
01:50:43,583 --> 01:50:45,778
I know.

1479
01:50:48,054 --> 01:50:50,147
But then, on the way home,

1480
01:50:50,223 --> 01:50:53,056
Charles was there.

1481
01:50:56,896 --> 01:51:00,229
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1482
01:51:03,136 --> 01:51:05,536
Maybe Rosen's right.

1483
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:09,097
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1484
01:51:09,175 --> 01:51:11,166
No.

1485
01:51:11,244 --> 01:51:13,474
Come here.

1486
01:51:16,816 --> 01:51:19,649
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1487
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:47,146
John, now, you can't ignore me forever.

1488
01:51:52,452 --> 01:51:54,647
Charles, you've been a
very good friend to me.

1489
01:51:54,721 --> 01:51:56,416
The best.

1490
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:00,855
But I won't talk to you again.

1491
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:06,425
I just can't.

1492
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:14,162
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1493
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,333
(Sniffs)

1494
01:52:22,015 --> 01:52:23,676
Good-bye.

1495
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,655
Good-bye.

1496
01:52:46,573 --> 01:52:49,098
I was wondering if I
might audit your course.

1497
01:52:50,476 --> 01:52:53,502
It's... It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1498
01:52:56,716 --> 01:52:58,809
Is something wrong?

1499
01:53:00,086 --> 01:53:02,384
This will be my first class.

1500
01:53:02,455 --> 01:53:04,582
(Laughs)

1501
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:08,386
Good morning,

1502
01:53:08,461 --> 01:53:10,691
eager young minds.

1503
01:53:17,837 --> 01:53:19,964
(Muttering Numbers)

1504
01:53:30,483 --> 01:53:32,815
It's never gonna work, John.

1505
01:53:32,885 --> 01:53:35,376
You're just humiliating yourself.

1506
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:40,084
It's pathetic!

1507
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,218
You are being pathetic.

1508
01:53:42,295 --> 01:53:44,286
I'm ashamed of you.

1509
01:53:59,045 --> 01:54:01,570
(Laughing)

1510
01:54:09,022 --> 01:54:11,456
(Laughing Continues)

1511
01:54:11,524 --> 01:54:13,617
Oh, man!

1512
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:20,322
Are you coming? You're gonna be late.

1513
01:54:23,136 --> 01:54:24,967
- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?

1514
01:54:25,038 --> 01:54:26,699
You've got my book.

1515
01:54:26,773 --> 01:54:29,173
Oh, right.

1516
01:54:29,242 --> 01:54:30,709
Thanks.

1517
01:54:31,711 --> 01:54:33,440
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1518
01:54:33,513 --> 01:54:35,310
Alicia. See you tonight.

1519
01:54:35,381 --> 01:54:37,349
Bye, honey.

1520
01:55:57,363 --> 01:56:01,299
Princeton University October 1 97 8

1521
01:56:09,842 --> 01:56:11,434
Did you just solve Reimann?

1522
01:56:11,511 --> 01:56:13,706
Well, what do you think?

1523
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:15,247
Huh.

1524
01:56:15,314 --> 01:56:16,838
That's an analog to Frobenius

1525
01:56:16,916 --> 01:56:18,884
for non-commutative extensions.

1526
01:56:18,951 --> 01:56:20,009
(Chuckles)

1527
01:56:20,086 --> 01:56:22,350
Yes, it is.

1528
01:56:22,421 --> 01:56:25,390
But it only appears to
work sporadically, so, no.

1529
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:27,585
But...

1530
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,992
I believe I'm making progress.

1531
01:56:30,997 --> 01:56:32,988
You're...

1532
01:56:33,065 --> 01:56:35,898
Youre John Nash, right?

1533
01:56:38,337 --> 01:56:40,430
- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.

1534
01:56:40,506 --> 01:56:42,303
I've been studying your equilibrium.

1535
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:44,309
The one you wrote here, at Princeton.

1536
01:56:44,377 --> 01:56:47,005
To come up with something totally
original, the way you did...

1537
01:56:47,079 --> 01:56:48,512
You know, I was young. (Chuckles)

1538
01:56:48,581 --> 01:56:50,105
umm...

1539
01:56:50,183 --> 01:56:52,583
I've been developing a theory.

1540
01:57:06,866 --> 01:57:09,061
I believe I can prove

1541
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:11,899
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1542
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:14,371
That everything,
everything is connected.

1543
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:17,102
That it's all part of the same subject.

1544
01:57:18,177 --> 01:57:20,168
When was the last time you ate?

1545
01:57:20,246 --> 01:57:22,806
- Excuse me?
- You know, food.

1546
01:57:22,882 --> 01:57:24,850
Oh, uh...

1547
01:57:24,917 --> 01:57:26,908
My wife,

1548
01:57:26,986 --> 01:57:28,817
she loves mayonnaise.

1549
01:57:28,888 --> 01:57:32,119
Oh, thank you.

1550
01:57:32,191 --> 01:57:33,419
Thank you.

1551
01:57:34,427 --> 01:57:36,292
Go on.

1552
01:57:36,362 --> 01:57:38,455
The function...

1553
01:57:38,531 --> 01:57:40,499
- is in the two
categories. - Um-hmm.

1554
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:46,297
Hansen. Alicia!

1555
01:57:46,372 --> 01:57:49,034
Alicia!

1556
01:57:49,108 --> 01:57:52,305
John. ...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1557
01:57:52,378 --> 01:57:54,471
let us say 1 0 miles per hour.

1558
01:57:54,547 --> 01:57:57,846
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle B,

1559
01:57:57,917 --> 01:58:00,886
and the fly, who can
travel at 20 miles an hour,

1560
01:58:00,953 --> 01:58:02,614
leaves the tire of
bicycle B and it flies

1561
01:58:02,688 --> 01:58:04,815
to the tire of bicycle a
and backwards and forwards

1562
01:58:04,891 --> 01:58:07,223
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide

1563
01:58:07,293 --> 01:58:09,056
and the poor little fly is squashed.

1564
01:58:09,128 --> 01:58:11,289
- (Chuckling)
- This is the important thing

1565
01:58:11,364 --> 01:58:13,389
about actually focusing
in and comprehending

1566
01:58:13,466 --> 01:58:15,491
the area that you're dealing with.

1567
01:58:15,568 --> 01:58:18,401
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1568
01:58:18,471 --> 01:58:20,803
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1569
01:58:20,873 --> 01:58:22,306
especially the people from biology.

1570
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:23,899
Don't listen to any of those people.

1571
01:58:23,976 --> 01:58:26,308
Let me go back to what
you were doing before.

1572
01:58:26,379 --> 01:58:29,678
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1573
01:58:30,816 --> 01:58:33,114
I was thinking that I might teach.

1574
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:36,580
A classroom with 50 students

1575
01:58:36,656 --> 01:58:39,648
can be daunting for anyone.

1576
01:58:39,725 --> 01:58:42,558
John, besides, you're
a terrible teacher.

1577
01:58:43,562 --> 01:58:46,531
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1578
01:58:46,599 --> 01:58:49,568
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1579
01:58:49,635 --> 01:58:51,626
What about the...

1580
01:58:51,704 --> 01:58:53,763
Well, you know.

1581
01:58:53,839 --> 01:58:56,205
Are they gone?

1582
01:59:02,181 --> 01:59:05,116
No, they're not gone.

1583
01:59:05,184 --> 01:59:06,811
And maybe they never will be.

1584
01:59:06,886 --> 01:59:08,615
But I've gotten used to ignoring them

1585
01:59:08,688 --> 01:59:12,089
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1586
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:14,092
You think that's what it's like

1587
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:17,857
with all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

1588
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:20,956
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1589
01:59:21,033 --> 01:59:24,525
John, they... haunt you, though.

1590
01:59:24,603 --> 01:59:29,302
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1591
01:59:32,311 --> 01:59:34,245
Well, good-bye.

1592
01:59:34,313 --> 01:59:36,781
John, I'll talk to the department.

1593
01:59:38,718 --> 01:59:40,583
Maybe in the spring.

1594
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:48,023
Hey, Nash?

1595
01:59:49,662 --> 01:59:51,960
You...

1596
01:59:52,031 --> 01:59:53,726
you scared?

1597
01:59:56,168 --> 01:59:58,102
Terrified.

1598
01:59:58,170 --> 02:00:00,570
Mortified. Petrified.

1599
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:03,369
Stupefied by you.

1600
02:00:03,442 --> 02:00:04,773
Now you ought best ring Alicia,

1601
02:00:04,844 --> 02:00:06,937
- or you're gonna get me...
- I'll ring her.

1602
02:00:07,013 --> 02:00:08,378
...in an awful lot of trouble.

1603
02:00:12,251 --> 02:00:14,014
- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.

1604
02:00:14,086 --> 02:00:16,054
- Have a nice
day. - Good-bye.

1605
02:00:16,122 --> 02:00:18,955
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
"Princeton University March 1 994"

1606
02:00:19,025 --> 02:00:21,016
Professor Nash?

1607
02:00:24,263 --> 02:00:26,891
- Can you see him?
- Yeah.

1608
02:00:26,966 --> 02:00:28,558
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

1609
02:00:28,634 --> 02:00:30,795
Positive? He's within your vision?

1610
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:32,462
- (Laughing)
- Okay. Good.

1611
02:00:32,538 --> 02:00:35,530
Forgive me, I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

1612
02:00:35,608 --> 02:00:37,974
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.

1613
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:40,911
So now that I know that you're real,

1614
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:43,448
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1615
02:00:43,516 --> 02:00:46,917
Professor, my name is Thomas King...

1616
02:00:46,986 --> 02:00:48,112
- Thomas
King? - Mmm-hm.

1617
02:00:48,187 --> 02:00:49,586
...and I'm here to tell you

1618
02:00:49,655 --> 02:00:52,783
that you're being considered
for the Nobel prize.

1619
02:01:00,299 --> 02:01:03,029
John: Forgive me, but
I'm just a little stunned.

1620
02:01:03,102 --> 02:01:05,593
King: Over the past few
years your equilibrium

1621
02:01:05,671 --> 02:01:08,265
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1622
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,604
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1623
02:01:10,676 --> 02:01:14,976
What about my work on other some
such projects... manifold embedding?

1624
02:01:15,047 --> 02:01:18,244
The application of
your bargaining problem

1625
02:01:18,317 --> 02:01:22,651
to F.C.C. bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1626
02:01:22,721 --> 02:01:24,450
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.

1627
02:01:24,523 --> 02:01:26,821
I never would have considered that.

1628
02:01:26,892 --> 02:01:28,484
- Well...
- Have I just reached

1629
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:31,291
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1630
02:01:31,363 --> 02:01:33,228
(Laughs) No, no, you haven't.

1631
02:01:33,299 --> 02:01:35,324
'Cause, I wouldn't have thought of that.

1632
02:01:40,439 --> 02:01:42,532
Shall we have tea?

1633
02:01:44,477 --> 02:01:46,843
Oh, I don't go in there. I usually just

1634
02:01:46,912 --> 02:01:48,777
take my sandwich in the library.

1635
02:01:48,848 --> 02:01:52,841
Come on, John. Let's have
some tea. It's a big day.

1636
02:01:52,918 --> 02:01:54,943
M-Most...

1637
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:56,920
Most commercially
available brands of tea

1638
02:01:56,989 --> 02:01:58,616
are not suitable to my palate.

1639
02:01:58,691 --> 02:02:00,318
I'm not...

1640
02:02:00,392 --> 02:02:03,623
There are some northern Indian
teas which are dense enough...

1641
02:02:03,696 --> 02:02:06,290
I enjoy the flavor that they have...

1642
02:02:06,365 --> 02:02:08,094
I have not been in this room

1643
02:02:08,167 --> 02:02:11,193
for some many years. I
wonder what tea they serve.

1644
02:02:12,838 --> 02:02:14,465
John. Why, thank you, young lady.

1645
02:02:16,842 --> 02:02:19,208
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1646
02:02:19,278 --> 02:02:21,542
I have a son that age.

1647
02:02:21,614 --> 02:02:24,583
- Harvard.
- (King Chuckles)

1648
02:02:27,786 --> 02:02:29,879
Hmm.

1649
02:02:29,955 --> 02:02:32,515
I would have thought the nominations

1650
02:02:32,591 --> 02:02:35,059
for the Nobel prize
would have been secret.

1651
02:02:35,127 --> 02:02:38,563
I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.

1652
02:02:38,631 --> 02:02:40,792
That is generally the case, yes.

1653
02:02:40,866 --> 02:02:43,027
But these are special circumstances.

1654
02:02:44,303 --> 02:02:46,601
The awards are substantial.

1655
02:02:46,672 --> 02:02:51,234
They require private funding. As such,

1656
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:54,302
the image of the Nobel is...

1657
02:02:55,581 --> 02:02:58,641
I see. You came here to
find out if I was crazy?

1658
02:02:59,885 --> 02:03:02,115
Find out if I would

1659
02:03:02,188 --> 02:03:04,179
screw everything up if I actually won?

1660
02:03:05,724 --> 02:03:08,887
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1661
02:03:08,961 --> 02:03:10,326
things of this nature?

1662
02:03:10,396 --> 02:03:12,864
Something like that, yes.

1663
02:03:13,866 --> 02:03:15,857
Would I embarrass you?

1664
02:03:19,405 --> 02:03:21,566
Yes, it is possible.

1665
02:03:24,276 --> 02:03:26,369
You see, l...

1666
02:03:26,445 --> 02:03:29,437
I am crazy.

1667
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:33,611
I take the newer medications,

1668
02:03:37,022 --> 02:03:40,014
but I still see things
that are not here.

1669
02:03:42,228 --> 02:03:44,458
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1670
02:03:46,565 --> 02:03:48,396
Like a diet of the mind,

1671
02:03:48,467 --> 02:03:50,901
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1672
02:03:53,305 --> 02:03:56,206
Like my appetite for patterns.

1673
02:03:57,810 --> 02:04:01,803
Perhaps my appetite to
imagine and to dream.

1674
02:04:02,815 --> 02:04:04,749
Man. Professor Nash.

1675
02:04:08,887 --> 02:04:12,323
It's good to have you here, John.

1676
02:04:12,391 --> 02:04:14,325
Thank you.

1677
02:04:18,497 --> 02:04:22,934
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1678
02:04:23,002 --> 02:04:24,731
A privilege, Professor.

1679
02:04:29,008 --> 02:04:30,498
Professor.

1680
02:04:35,848 --> 02:04:38,874
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.

1681
02:04:40,019 --> 02:04:41,816
Thank you.

1682
02:04:41,887 --> 02:04:44,583
Thank you.

1683
02:04:52,665 --> 02:04:54,997
Thank you, Ed.

1684
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:05,510
That was certainly most unexpected.

1685
02:05:05,577 --> 02:05:08,842
(Applause)

1686
02:05:16,822 --> 02:05:19,791
Nobel Prize Ceremony Stockholm, Sweden

1687
02:05:19,858 --> 02:05:21,553
December 1 994

1688
02:05:26,498 --> 02:05:28,762
John. Thank you.

1689
02:05:30,169 --> 02:05:32,763
(Applause Fades)

1690
02:05:32,838 --> 02:05:35,170
I've always believed in numbers.

1691
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,800
In the equations and logics

1692
02:05:37,876 --> 02:05:39,810
that lead to reason.

1693
02:05:39,878 --> 02:05:42,779
But after a lifetime of such pursuits,

1694
02:05:43,515 --> 02:05:45,346
I ask,

1695
02:05:45,417 --> 02:05:47,977
what truly is logic?

1696
02:05:48,053 --> 02:05:51,181
Who decides reason?

1697
02:05:52,624 --> 02:05:56,082
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1698
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:58,026
the metaphysical,

1699
02:05:59,498 --> 02:06:01,466
the delusional,

1700
02:06:02,568 --> 02:06:04,593
and back.

1701
02:06:06,271 --> 02:06:09,502
And I have made the most
important discovery of my career.

1702
02:06:11,443 --> 02:06:14,776
The most important discovery of my life.

1703
02:06:17,216 --> 02:06:20,811
It is only in the
mysterious equations of love

1704
02:06:20,886 --> 02:06:23,912
that any logical reasons can be found.

1705
02:06:27,326 --> 02:06:30,591
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1706
02:06:31,797 --> 02:06:34,823
You are the reason I am.

1707
02:06:38,504 --> 02:06:41,337
You are all my reasons.

1708
02:06:45,177 --> 02:06:47,270
Thank you.

1709
02:07:40,866 --> 02:07:43,357
John: So nice to have met you.

1710
02:07:46,071 --> 02:07:47,868
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1711
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,407
Bye-bye.

1712
02:07:49,475 --> 02:07:51,136
Woman: Bye-bye.

1713
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:54,145
- Are you ready to go now?
- Oh, yes, I am.

1714
02:07:54,213 --> 02:07:56,773
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1715
02:07:56,849 --> 02:07:59,647
Thank you so much.

1716
02:07:59,718 --> 02:08:01,083
Thank you.

1717
02:08:03,622 --> 02:08:05,852
What is it? What's wrong?

1718
02:08:10,128 --> 02:08:11,459
Nothing.

1719
02:08:12,464 --> 02:08:14,455
Nothing at all.

1720
02:08:16,401 --> 02:08:19,063
- Come with me,
young lady. - Oh-hh...

1721
02:08:19,137 --> 02:08:21,605
I have a car outside.

1722
02:08:21,673 --> 02:08:25,131
Are you interested in a ride? "Nash's theories
have influenced global trade negotiations..."

1723
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:29,613
Where's it going to? "national labor relations,
and even breakthroughs in evolutionary biology."

1724
02:08:29,681 --> 02:08:33,276
John and Alicia Nash live
in Princeton, New Jersey.

1725
02:08:33,352 --> 02:08:36,480
John keeps regular office hours
in the Mathematics Department.

1726
02:08:36,555 --> 02:08:38,921
He still walks to campus every day.

1727
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:50,896
I will

1728
02:08:50,969 --> 02:08:54,461
Watch you

1729
02:08:54,540 --> 02:09:01,343
In the darkness

1730
02:09:01,413 --> 02:09:05,281
Show you

1731
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:08,808
Love will

1732
02:09:08,887 --> 02:09:14,985
See you through

1733
02:09:16,762 --> 02:09:24,134
When the bad dreams

1734
02:09:24,202 --> 02:09:31,267
Wake you crying

1735
02:09:31,343 --> 02:09:37,373
I show you

1736
02:09:37,449 --> 02:09:45,618
All love can do

1737
02:09:46,892 --> 02:09:53,923
What love can do

1738
02:09:53,999 --> 02:09:57,935
I will watch through the night

1739
02:09:58,003 --> 02:10:02,099
Hold you in my arms

1740
02:10:02,174 --> 02:10:03,869
Give you dreams

1741
02:10:03,942 --> 02:10:09,141
Where none will be

1742
02:10:09,214 --> 02:10:13,344
I will watch through the dark

1743
02:10:13,418 --> 02:10:17,115
Till the morning comes

1744
02:10:17,189 --> 02:10:20,124
All the light

1745
02:10:20,192 --> 02:10:22,524
I'll take you through the night

1746
02:10:22,594 --> 02:10:25,427
To see

1747
02:10:26,431 --> 02:10:29,491
The light

1748
02:10:29,568 --> 02:10:32,799
Showing us all love

1749
02:10:32,871 --> 02:10:37,638
Can be

1750
02:10:38,977 --> 02:10:42,071
I will

1751
02:10:42,147 --> 02:10:45,480
Guide you

1752
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:53,457
With my bright wings

1753
02:10:53,525 --> 02:11:00,863
Stay till your heart

1754
02:11:00,932 --> 02:11:09,636
Learns to see

1755
02:11:09,708 --> 02:11:15,146
All love

1756
02:11:15,213 --> 02:11:19,707
Can...

1757
02:11:19,785 --> 02:11:27,817
Be.

1758
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:56,539
(Female Vocal)
