1
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,143
Can I help you?

2
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:59,019
A neighbour of mine,
an old lady who can't come

3
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,487
because she had an accident
and broke her leg,

4
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,252
asked me to
sell this for her.

5
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,394
- What is it?
- It's English china.

6
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,398
- Does she have the whole set?
- No, I don't think so.

7
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,599
Twelve pesos maximum.

8
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,240
Tell your friend that if she
doesn't have the whole set...

9
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,915
- Twelve pesos.
- Yes.

10
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,373
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to talk to her.

11
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,779
I think she expected more.
It's English china.

12
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:35,819
- Do you want to see it again?
- No, I've already seen it.

13
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,726
- Okay.
- Bye.

14
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,131
Keep the change.

15
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,999
Thanks.

16
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:07,679
- Don't you have the keys?
- They must be somewhere.

17
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,338
What did you bring?

18
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,570
- Have you seen the teapot?
- Yes, I have it.

19
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,469
I went to see a friend of mine,
he runs an antique shop.

20
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,582
He had a look at it.
He thinks it's wonderful.

21
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,252
Really unique.

22
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,426
You know what date
is today, don't you?

23
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:47,995
Yes, I know.

24
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,572
<i>Did Guillermina call?</i>

25
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,804
- Dora...
- No, she didn't!

26
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,726
- Where are you going?
- To the supermarket.

27
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,737
- We ran out of detergent.
- Oh! Wait!

28
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:30,637
I'll give you the money.

29
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,072
I have twenty pesos
somewhere.

30
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,482
Well, I don't know.

31
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:43,051
I can't find them.
I don't know where they are.

32
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,553
Go, go.

33
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,817
I'll tell you what.
Let's not clean anymore.

34
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,788
You can put covers
on the furniture.

35
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,622
How can we live with
covers on the furniture?

36
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,697
What are you saying!

37
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,657
- Do you want to buy peppers?
- No.

38
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,574
Wait, let me see.

39
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,740
Yes, it's okay.

40
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,877
- Did you buy detergent?
- Yes, I did.

41
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,615
Well, I owe you the money.
I can't find the 20 pesos.

42
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,787
So we get this wonderful
mud, and you can see

43
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,689
how Maria Rosa
is working with it.

44
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,890
Using ascending movements,
it can be applied to eyelids

45
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,558
because it's absolutely
hypoallergenic.

46
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,898
This is going to stimulate

47
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,199
the whole of the
cellular memory of the body.

48
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:49,069
What does this mean?
That you will undergo

49
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,633
a process of
rejuvenation.

50
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,578
Now we have to let it dry from
five to eight minutes.

51
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,946
Would anyone like
to give it a try?

52
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,641
Yes!

53
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,287
Okay, hands up.

54
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,484
And now, the most
important moment of the day.

55
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:08,289
Let's introduce our new
biothermal experts.

56
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,488
A round of applause
to welcome

57
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,329
Beba Pujol, from
the "Orchids Unit"!

58
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,492
Beba, come here, please.

59
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:34,453
Welcome, welcome!

60
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,432
It's okay, Dora.
Can you pour me a whisky?

61
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,143
I'm so excited!

62
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,509
I've become a member
of a cosmetics company.

63
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,406
They have mud, creams.
I left a sample for you there.

64
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,384
Try it. Your face will be
fantastic after using it.

65
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,478
This is definitely
going to sell well.

66
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,457
By the way,
the game is on Friday.

67
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,127
Friday is my day off.

68
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,856
Well, Miss Sarah
can't make it on Thursday.

69
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,295
There's nothing we can
do, Dora. Please.

70
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,926
I'm going out with
Miguel on Friday.

71
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,537
How noisy these kids are!

72
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,267
I'd like to put a sleeping
pill in the birthday cake.

73
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,467
What are you doing, Dora?
What are you doing?

74
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,777
You can't help
doing this show.

75
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,537
I'll leave everything ready
for you to prepare your own tea.

76
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,145
I'm going to get
my things ready.

77
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,018
I'll clean this.
You pay me if you want.

78
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,954
I'm leaving.

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,923
I'd like to know how
you're going to make a living.

80
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,934
Is Miguel going to
keep you both?

81
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,967
He's not right man for you.
I've told you several times.

82
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,266
The janitor would be right,
now that he is a widower.

83
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,170
You would have
a good life with him.

84
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,714
You could come here
just a few hours.

85
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,180
It's a good idea,
isn't it?

86
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,818
Come on! You're always
listening to the news.

87
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,348
You know that Alejandro
Korn isn't Belgrano, darling.

88
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,760
Everybody knows you
and respects you here.

89
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,232
And you don't need
further education to know that.

90
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,638
Come on, Dora! I know
you like Luisito.

91
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,401
He spent some nights
in your room.

92
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,939
This house isn't like the one in
Matinez. You can hear every sound.

93
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,911
What happened?

94
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,494
Pay it with part of
the money you owe me.

95
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,685
Dora...

96
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,944
Everything's going
to be okay.

97
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,387
After the game, on Friday,
I'll pay you your March salary.

98
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:41,358
I may even pay you
half your April salary.

99
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:42,989
Here you have the
sample I told you about.

100
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:47,199
<i>Apply it to your face.</i>
<i>It's really great.</i>

101
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:51,265
<i>It has oligoelements</i>
<i>dating from the Tertiary Era.</i>

102
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,266
<i>A very good product.</i>

103
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,485
Oh, God!

104
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,878
Shit!

105
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:09,820
Bitch.

106
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:15,693
I'll pay it
with your salary.

107
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,840
Dora!

108
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:27,277
Dora! Where are they?

109
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,449
Those things to put...?

110
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,985
<i>The bandages.</i>

111
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:28,101
Don't touch me!
Bring me a whisky.

112
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,145
Where are you going?

113
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:37,342
I'm looking for the bandages.
I'll take the whisky after that.

114
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:38,382
I asked for it now.

115
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,788
Don't touch me.

116
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,688
- I'm going to disinfect it.
- What's that?

117
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:29,400
Some alcohol.

118
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,960
- Alcohol? It'll sting.
- No, it won't.

119
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:37,774
You have a splinter.

120
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,511
It hurts!

121
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,252
I did get it now.

122
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:55,152
How can you be so rough?

123
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,666
Dora, another whisky.

124
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,771
There's none left.

125
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:19,583
Give me the telephone.

126
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:36,222
- Aren't you having dinner?
- No. Go to bed.

127
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,374
I'd like to make a call
to Madrid, Spain.

128
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,399
Person to person.

129
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,110
Guillermina.

130
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,078
Her mother.

131
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,441
Okay.

132
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,576
Three, one nine, one
one, six, two.

133
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,857
Okay, I'll leave a message.

134
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:16,790
This is a message for
Guillermina. It's her mother.

135
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:22,831
Guillermina, I want
to talk to you.

136
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,640
But you're not in.

137
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,140
Well.

138
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,478
Give me a call,
will you?

139
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,178
Bye. This is mum. Bye.

140
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,235
- Were there any leaks?
- Yes.

141
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,903
The roof must be fixed.

142
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,780
- Did she pay you?
- No.

143
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,219
- Did you get anything?
- No.

144
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:58,096
The first thing I' like
to do when she pays me

145
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,001
is to buy the floor.

146
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:04,166
If she ever pays you...

147
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,938
Don't speak like that!

148
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:22,153
Don't come on Friday.
There is a game.

149
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,691
Okay.

150
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,122
Cristian, come help the lady.

151
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,861
Beba, show me.

152
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,727
This mud, which is wonderful.
You can apply it to your eyes.

153
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,273
Mud?

154
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,275
<i>Hi, Irma.</i>

155
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,834
<i>How are you? Are you</i>
<i>having your hair dyed today?</i>

156
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,915
There's a great selection
of colours. Have a look.

157
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,451
The creams I gave you.

158
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:52,648
- I'll buy the feet treatment.
- Great.

159
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:56,459
It's the one I need.
I can't buy the rest.

160
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,222
I would buy them all,
but I'm a bit hard up.

161
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,889
Can you pay Beba?

162
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,090
- No, no way.
- What do you want to do?

163
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,369
I'll come with Dora on Friday
to have our hair done.

164
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,836
That's it. We're even.

165
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,603
- Can I leave some samples?
- Yes, sure.

166
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,162
- How's your daughter?
- In Madrid.

167
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,807
Lucky her!

168
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,080
<i>This is Beba Pujol.</i>

169
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,153
<i>Leave your message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

170
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:30,421
<i>Hello, Dora.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

171
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:34,528
<i>Hello? It's me, Dora.</i>
<i>Dora?</i>

172
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,164
<i>Well, I'll be late today.</i>
<i>Don't prepare tea.</i>

173
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,902
Hello.

174
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:57,944
Hello?

175
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,941
Guille!

176
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,117
Fine, fine.

177
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,846
Putting your mother's things
in some sort of order.

178
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,121
No, she's not in.

179
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:12,557
We called you because
we had no news from you

180
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,253
and we were a bit worried.

181
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,989
Are you eating well,
darling?

182
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,234
Well, as usual.

183
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:26,106
It's not as bad as they say.

184
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:29,073
This is a quite
neighbourhood, anyway.

185
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:35,270
My house? We finished
the two bedrooms

186
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,873
and we want to buy
the floor next.

187
00:19:37,952 --> 00:19:38,919
It's going to be beautiful.

188
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:40,743
Are you coming for Christmas?

189
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,451
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

190
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,958
But it's better for you
to stay and get those papers.

191
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:50,787
My mail?

192
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:53,425
Wait a second.
I'll get a pen.

193
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,719
- Charge it to the gentleman.
- Sure.

194
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:26,958
Hello, madam.
Victor's busy at the moment.

195
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:29,136
Madam. Madam.

196
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:31,661
<i>Well, what we can you</i>
<i>is change the stick.</i>

197
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:34,036
<i>We can put one</i>
<i>like the one...</i>

198
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:38,040
Victor, has
Guillermina called you?

199
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,538
Excuse me.

200
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:43,740
What's the matter?

201
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,687
She hasn't called me either.

202
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,118
She's fine.
What do you need?

203
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:56,420
I don't know.
I'm not feeling well.

204
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,765
I fell alone.

205
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:03,932
What about lunch tomorrow?

206
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:08,208
Silvia will call
you a taxi.

207
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,609
Dora, I'm home.

208
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,046
I'm home.

209
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,928
Today was a great day.

210
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,657
These cosmetics
sell so well!

211
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,568
Here, Dora, I'll pay
you for the detergent.

212
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,883
Please buy some drinks
for the game.

213
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,921
Let's organize everything.

214
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:54,010
Madam, do you have
any of that mud left?

215
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,573
- Yes.
- It's good.

216
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,734
Very good!
I'll give you some.

217
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,910
- Shall I apply it for you?
- Yes, I'd like that. Thank you.

218
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,046
Come here.

219
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,355
Here it is.

220
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,859
Come to my room.

221
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,525
- Guillermina called.
- What did she say?

222
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,425
She wanted to talk to you,
to know if you were ok.

223
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,395
And what did you tell her?

224
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,073
That we are all fine.
She's worried

225
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,042
about the things she
reads in the papers.

226
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,578
- And how is she?
- She seemed to be fine.

227
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,544
Is she coming for Christmas?

228
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,058
She's not coming.

229
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:24,089
She always talks to you,
and never to me.

230
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,228
I'm not feeling well.
Hold me.

231
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,030
- Oh, madam.
- Hold me.

232
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,676
- Come, madam.
- Oh God.

233
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,803
Come on, make an effort.

234
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,403
No, no, no.
To Guille's room.

235
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,994
Shall you prepare
something sweet to drink?

236
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,602
No, no. Stay here.

237
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,516
You could take this room.

238
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:24,554
The closet is bigger,
more comfortable.

239
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,081
The bathroom has a tub.

240
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,585
I mean it.

241
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,029
- Where are you going?
- To my bedroom, madam.

242
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,654
- National or imported?
- National.

243
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,320
It's for cooking.

244
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,102
<i>I'll get it.</i>

245
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,177
<i>- Beba Pujol?</i>
<i>- Yes, come in.</i>

246
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,342
<i>Leave it there.</i>

247
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,679
- I need your signature, please.
- Dora, please.

248
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:13,712
It's too much.

249
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:16,622
I can give them back
in ten days if I don't sell them.

250
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,262
The Queen of Spain.

251
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:31,731
What do you think?

252
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,136
And like this?
Like Mirta Legrand?

253
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:39,705
No way. You would
have to bleach it.

254
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,880
I mean the hairdo.

255
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,491
- This.
- Ivanna Trump?

256
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:08,045
<i>Does Armandito still</i>
<i>live in Kentucky?</i>

257
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:11,181
<i>Yes, but he's being</i>
<i>transferred to Saudi Arabia.</i>

258
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>Saudi Arabia,</i>
<i>Bin Laden's country.</i>

259
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,181
He would be in better shape.

260
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,380
Your turn, Meme.

261
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:25,194
Beba, how much
do you pay Dora?

262
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,663
<i>It's rude to</i>
<i>ask that kind of question.</i>

263
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,097
<i>I want to know because</i>
<i>I'm hiring a new girl.</i>

264
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,001
<i>I think I'm overpaying her.</i>

265
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,766
<i>You can't compare Dora</i>
<i>to a beginner!</i>

266
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,509
- Isn't Dora great?
- Yes, great.

267
00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:42,979
Her complexion I mean.
Show them, Dora.

268
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:46,107
It's because of a cream.

269
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,151
I became a member of
this marvelous company.

270
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,344
- They have a mud...
- Mud?

271
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,011
- Yes, mud.
- Mud.

272
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:55,351
Yes, mud. It's called mud.

273
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,152
It's really great.

274
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:03,965
Come here, don't be shy.
I want you to touch her face.

275
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:10,931
So that you can see
how good the mud is.

276
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:19,014
- Touch her face.
- How smooth!

277
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:20,773
- Remember how she used to have it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

278
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:26,453
Come here,
show me your face.

279
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:30,092
- How nice!
- Incredible.

280
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:31,984
It's anti-age.

281
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,060
There's one for the
eyelids as well.

282
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,068
- Do we have to keep this?
- No, your cleanse it later.

283
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:50,947
- You cleanse it with what?
- Water, darling.

284
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:55,111
Dorita, can you call me
a taxi? I'm very tired.

285
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:56,708
Sure, madam.

286
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,158
Madam, have you paid
the pending invoices?

287
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:12,133
It must be the storm.
Go downstairs and

288
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:16,195
get a taxi in the street.
Go, go.

289
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,943
Put it right so
I don't get wet.

290
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,128
Leave that.
You can do it tomorrow.

291
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:52,599
I'm leaving tomorrow, madam.

292
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,222
Dora!

293
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,530
Dora, open the door!

294
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,065
Dora, open the door!

295
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,415
You were going without
even saying goodbye?

296
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:24,008
I didn't want to
bother you, madam.

297
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:29,790
I left you a note
on the fridge's door.

298
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,187
I'll be picking up my stuff
on Monday.

299
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:36,860
Well, I'll pretend you
didn't say anything.

300
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,163
You think it over
during the weekend.

301
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,840
- Hi.
- How are you?

302
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:52,470
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

303
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,912
Excuse me.

304
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,820
How are you?

305
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:07,623
- How are you?
- Fine.

306
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,130
- Have I kept you waiting?
- No, no, it's okay.

307
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:14,793
- Did you play?
- Yes, a little bit. Not too good.

308
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,602
Wine, please.

309
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:20,903
But it does you good.

310
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:32,310
I want to ask you a favour.
I need some money.

311
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,847
- How much?
- Five thousand.

312
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,628
The business is not
going that well.

313
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,200
It's high time you moved
to a smaller apartment.

314
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,465
You have too many
fixed expenses.

315
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:54,042
Dora can come only a few
hours, or she can retire and...

316
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,374
I'm not going to discuss
that with you.

317
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,877
Beba, the Torres are there
Please, don't make a scene.

318
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,841
Why don't you sell
the earrings?

319
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,113
Because I want to wear
them at Guillermina's wedding.

320
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,417
Guillermina is never going
to get married.

321
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,313
Not with a man anyway.

322
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:18,663
How dare you
give me advice?

323
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,701
You wasted mum's money

324
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,532
with your cinemas
in Florencio Varela,

325
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,189
the carton boxes factory,

326
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:30,298
the printer of stickers,

327
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:35,197
the fragrance laboratory,
the tanning lotions...

328
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,202
Beba, we both did some
very bad businesses.

329
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,872
I don't want to think about it!
The printer! To make

330
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:47,885
- football players stickers.
- Sure, they were good.

331
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,578
- Did you go dancing yesterday?
- No.

332
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,843
- Do you want to go now?
- Ok, let's go.

333
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,932
Miguel, I'm going to
quit my job.

334
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,740
You should stay.
It's hard out there.

335
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:29,512
I'm wasting my time,
she can't pay me.

336
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,647
Madam?

337
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:06,751
I'm here, madam.

338
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:10,516
Ms. Beba.

339
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,349
- Hello.
- Good morning, madam.

340
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,722
Do you have time
for a cup of tea?

341
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:59,622
- Did you give it a good thought?
- That's what I'm doing.

342
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,898
The seven salaries
I owed you.

343
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,904
This is a bonus for
your work in all these years.

344
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,634
Thank you.

345
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,741
So that you don't say
I'm ungrateful.

346
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:40,887
How can you do this to me?

347
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,556
When I need you most?

348
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,285
That must be Miguel.

349
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,678
Yes, come in.

350
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,142
- Excuse me, good morning.
- Hello.

351
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:44,352
If you need someone for
a painting job, let me know.

352
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,319
Yes, yes.

353
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,823
I need a recommendation
letter, madam.

354
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,766
Here's the address.

355
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:55,547
- See you later, Luisito.
- Bye, Dora.

356
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,415
- Did it open?
- Get a taxi.

357
00:43:57,626 --> 00:43:59,457
Yes, it opened.

358
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,109
To Constitucion Station.

359
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:44,897
<i>What would you recommend?</i>

360
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:49,276
<i>This one is better,</i>
<i>it's more classy.</i>

361
00:44:49,345 --> 00:44:51,643
<i>Those are cheaper,</i>

362
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:53,375
<i>but they are of</i>
<i>a poorer quality.</i>

363
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:55,440
- Is this resistant?
- Yes, it's the best.

364
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,176
I think the other
one is better.

365
00:44:58,254 --> 00:44:59,846
Let's not spend so much.
It's just the floor.

366
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:01,479
This is classy.

367
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,184
Excuse me,
I'll be back in a minute.

368
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:10,160
- I don't know.
- Look, it's better.

369
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,563
Why don't you get
a new job first?

370
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,164
We're running out of money.

371
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:35,189
Miguel, be careful
when you do it.

372
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,324
I left you some food in the fridge.
Try to keep everything clean.

373
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:42,587
Yes, my love.

374
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,230
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Miguel.

375
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:55,833
Miguel's busy,
come next week.

376
00:48:26,387 --> 00:48:27,877
Hello.

377
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:30,651
The people from the Energy
Company have just come.

378
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:33,891
They left this letter.

379
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:37,996
Oh, I must have
forgotten to pay it.

380
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:43,335
If they come again, tell them
I've already gone to the bank.

381
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

382
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,503
- You need coins.
- One ticket, please.

383
00:49:42,463 --> 00:49:44,260
This is overdue,

384
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,125
you have to pay it
in two days.

385
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:49,933
Pay at least fifty per cent

386
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,766
or you won't be able
to sing the agreement.

387
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,807
You can pay the rest
in installments.

388
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,872
Can you make an exception?

389
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:32,302
Shit.

390
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,767
Thank you.

391
00:52:43,402 --> 00:52:45,063
I'm testing her
for a week.

392
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:47,928
She cooks, washes, irons...

393
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:52,105
So far she's so dedicated!

394
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:54,839
She used to work for
the Archbishop of Misiones.

395
00:52:54,913 --> 00:52:57,349
- She was fired.
- Was she?

396
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:58,850
She must have
done something wrong.

397
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,286
I think you should
talk to her, instruct her.

398
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:02,854
You don't want her to...

399
00:53:02,854 --> 00:53:04,446
Your turn.

400
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:07,292
You know Beba paid
for Dora's two abortions.

401
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,852
And Dorita wasn't
as half as pretty.

402
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:11,618
Did you, Beba?

403
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:15,164
- It seems that Luisito, the janitor...
- Stop it.

404
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,001
We haven't had news from
Guillermina in a long time.

405
00:53:21,173 --> 00:53:24,233
- How is she?
- She's great. We are very close.

406
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,109
Everything's going
to be fine.

407
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:37,378
What?

408
00:53:37,556 --> 00:53:39,080
That everything's
going to be all right.

409
00:53:39,524 --> 00:53:41,126
She will come back.

410
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,390
- Oh.
- She can't live without you.

411
00:53:44,396 --> 00:53:45,863
She will come back!

412
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,122
I don't give a damn.

413
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,832
And if she doesn't, hire
another one, like Sarah did.

414
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:56,598
I'm fine. Don't worry
about me. I'm fine.

415
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:58,643
Come on! I know you.

416
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:29,434
What are you doing here?

417
00:54:30,242 --> 00:54:32,233
Let me make the bed.

418
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:36,905
Why don't you look
for a job?

419
00:54:56,968 --> 00:54:59,835
<i>Dora? Dora?</i>

420
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,376
Can you take care of Jenny?

421
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:08,775
I have to go to work.

422
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,574
Okay, just a few hours.

423
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,011
You know, I don't work for
Ms. Beba anymore.

424
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,581
- If you know of a job...
- Okay.

425
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:22,283
Bye.

426
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,443
<i>Yes, I called before.</i>

427
00:55:38,443 --> 00:55:42,880
<i>Did they tell you</i>
<i>about the arrangement?</i>

428
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,074
<i>It would be a thousand balls</i>
<i>and thirty gloves.</i>

429
00:55:49,254 --> 00:55:50,744
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

430
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,291
Ok, fine. Pesos or
dollars, it's the same.

431
00:56:00,365 --> 00:56:03,960
No, the price is okay.
But it was me that sold it.

432
00:56:04,536 --> 00:56:07,733
Sure. I see.
Well, don't worry.

433
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,539
Roberto, coffee please.

434
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,008
Miguel!

435
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,213
Miguel!
What are you doing?

436
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,846
You have to work on the floor!

437
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:36,392
It's Sunday today!

438
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,619
Come on, I'll prepare
some mates for you.

439
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,746
These creams I'm selling,
they are all natural.

440
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,064
Are you going to
buy anything?

441
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,282
No money, only food.

442
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,129
<i>Dora!</i>

443
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,482
- Nice clothes!
- A present from Ms. Beba.

444
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,580
They say food appeals you
through you eyes,

445
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,489
if a dish is nice,
people will eat it.

446
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:30,394
Ms. Beba taught me
everything I'm telling you.

447
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,303
Mary, is the champagne
in the fridge?

448
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,863
- White whine? Red wine?
- Yes, everything's ready.

449
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:39,670
Madam, this is Dora.

450
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,177
- Nice to meet you, Dora.
- Nice to meet you.

451
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,608
- Sir.
- No, thanks.

452
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,382
- Miss.
- No, thanks.

453
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,284
Sir.

454
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:05,229
Dora! Get the dogs!

455
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,770
- Mary, the dogs!
- Yes, I'm going.

456
01:00:25,309 --> 01:00:27,838
- How's everything, Mary?
- Fine, fine.

457
01:02:32,106 --> 01:02:33,641
Who's that?

458
01:02:33,641 --> 01:02:36,041
<i>It's me, Dora.</i>

459
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:45,909
Dora!

460
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:51,114
I can't find the keys, Dora.

461
01:02:54,095 --> 01:02:55,756
Go to the back door.

462
01:03:15,683 --> 01:03:18,846
Hello, Dora.

463
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,149
Darling.

464
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,414
If I had known you were coming,
I would have dressed better.

465
01:03:25,226 --> 01:03:28,525
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

466
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:32,857
Come in, come in.

467
01:03:50,151 --> 01:03:52,676
You needn't have, Dora.

468
01:03:52,754 --> 01:03:54,381
Just a little something.

469
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:59,821
- Stockings.
- I hope you like them.

470
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,592
Hold on a sec.

471
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,953
One little candle.

472
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,225
Don't forget to
make a wish.

473
01:05:31,644 --> 01:05:34,841
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

474
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:44,215
Don't cut it, save it
for your friends.

475
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,014
What friends, Dora?

476
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:21,616
Delicious.

477
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:26,097
I should be going, madam.

478
01:06:37,443 --> 01:06:41,470
One keeps so many
things in so many years!

479
01:06:42,982 --> 01:06:47,316
I have a bag of things
for you and Miguel.

480
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:53,018
Clothes, creams and mud.

481
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:02,661
Do you really have
to go so soon?

482
01:07:02,735 --> 01:07:05,761
Yes, I'm waiting for a call
from the employment agency.

483
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:10,068
I'm trying to get
a job near here,

484
01:07:10,142 --> 01:07:11,700
so I have a few extra
hours for you.

485
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:18,842
Take a piece for Miguel.

486
01:07:29,595 --> 01:07:31,256
Thank you, madam.

487
01:07:43,075 --> 01:07:44,565
Let's go.

488
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:57,552
This is the recommendation
letter you asked me to write.

489
01:07:58,624 --> 01:08:00,148
Thank you.

490
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,689
I'll walk you to the door.

491
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:15,441
<i>I hereby certify that</i>
<i>Miss Dora Dominguez</i>

492
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:18,433
<i>has worked for my family</i>
<i>for twenty-eight years,</i>

493
01:08:18,611 --> 01:08:22,103
<i>always with faultless behaviour.</i>

494
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:25,114
<i>She's hard working</i>
<i>and competent,</i>

495
01:08:25,217 --> 01:08:29,586
<i>as well as honest and respectable.</i>
<i>It's her own decision to leave this job.</i>

496
01:08:29,655 --> 01:08:31,213
<i>Beatriz Pujol.</i>

497
01:08:31,324 --> 01:08:34,088
<i>Buenos Aires,</i>
<i>November 4, 2001.</i>

498
01:09:19,463 --> 01:09:21,198
Have you seen Miguel?

499
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,859
No, I haven't seen him.

500
01:09:57,601 --> 01:09:59,159
Miguel!

501
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:01,971
Let's go home!

502
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:08,211
- In a minute.
- Come back. I'll be waiting.

503
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:45,165
Are you renting it
with the furniture?

504
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,600
I don't care, it's the same.

505
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:15,867
Be careful with the glass.

506
01:12:20,144 --> 01:12:23,477
Come on, it got stuck.

507
01:12:41,031 --> 01:12:44,626
Madam, this piano is
too big for this door.

508
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,343
No.

509
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,951
Wait.

510
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,199
Ms. Beba!

511
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,109
Come in, it's too hot here.

512
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:52,050
I'm sorry I came
without any notice.

513
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,782
You don't need
to give me notice.

514
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,754
Would you like
something to drink?

515
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:09,367
An iced tea with a few
lemon drops would be nice.

516
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,204
What a classy floor!

517
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,149
Yes, but Miguel didn't
buy enough.

518
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,220
Well, it's only details
that you're missing.

519
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:32,125
Madam, can we take
the things off the van?

520
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,923
- Yes, put the there.
- Where?

521
01:15:34,797 --> 01:15:36,398
Just there.
We'll see later.

522
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:38,161
I'm moving to a
smaller apartment.

523
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,996
I thought you could make
good use of some things.

524
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,870
You house is very nice.

525
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,706
I imagined it bigger.

526
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,545
Sit down, if you want.

527
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:36,519
It'll take time to cool
in this heat.

528
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,486
Okay.

529
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,358
Madam, how could you...?

530
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,729
Don't worry, Dora.

531
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:53,138
I'll take it again when
I move to a larger place.

532
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,112
This way.

533
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:16,922
It's out of tune.

534
01:17:17,624 --> 01:17:20,616
Don't worry.
I'll put a cover on it.

535
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:42,442
- Where's Miguel?
- He went to San Luis.

536
01:17:56,496 --> 01:17:58,896
Buenos Aires is hell.

537
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:02,428
There's such a nice
breeze here.

538
01:18:12,946 --> 01:18:16,473
It's too late. Why don't
you stay here tonight?

539
01:18:17,851 --> 01:18:19,375
<i>Madam, where shall</i>
<i>we put the bed?</i>

540
01:18:19,453 --> 01:18:21,478
Leave it inside.

541
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:03,397
<i>I miss you so much, my love.</i>
<i>I can't understand it.</i>

542
01:19:03,397 --> 01:19:07,200
<i>My life's empty without you.</i>

543
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,871
<i>I miss you so much, my love.</i>
<i>What can I do?</i>

544
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:14,898
<i>I miss you so much</i>
<i>I'm going crazy.</i>

545
01:19:29,356 --> 01:19:33,260
<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>you'll never come back,</i>

546
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:36,286
<i>but I love you and</i>
<i>I have to wait for you.</i>

547
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:40,467
<i>Fate takes me to</i>
<i>the place where</i>

548
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:43,570
<i>my love will find</i>
<i>you some day.</i>

549
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,801
<i>Oh, my divine love...</i>

550
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:51,040
<i>you have to come back soon.</i>

551
01:20:07,627 --> 01:20:10,255
<i>I miss you so much!</i>

552
01:20:11,998 --> 01:20:15,335
<i>My life's empty without you.</i>

553
01:20:15,335 --> 01:20:18,505
<i>I miss you so much!</i>

554
01:20:18,505 --> 01:20:22,642
<i>I miss you so much</i>
<i>I'm going crazy.</i>

555
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:26,546
<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>you'll never come back,</i>

556
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:30,383
<i>but I love you and</i>
<i>I have to wait for you.</i>

557
01:20:30,383 --> 01:20:34,020
<i>Fate takes me to</i>
<i>the place where</i>

558
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:37,057
<i>my love will find</i>
<i>you some day.</i>

559
01:20:37,057 --> 01:20:40,720
<i>Oh, my divine love...</i>

560
01:20:41,394 --> 01:20:45,023
<i>you have to come back soon.</i>

561
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:49,436
<i>The pain is strong</i>
<i>and I bear it</i>

562
01:20:49,436 --> 01:20:53,273
<i>because I live</i>
<i>thinking about your love.</i>

563
01:20:53,273 --> 01:20:57,210
<i>I want to see you,</i>
<i>have you, kiss you.</i>

564
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:00,407
<i>And give you my entire heart.</i>

565
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:32,003
<i>Oh, my divine love...</i>

566
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:35,871
<i>you have to come back soon.</i>

567
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:42,514
<i>Oh, my divine love...</i>

568
01:21:42,514 --> 01:21:46,041
<i>you have to come back soon.</i>
