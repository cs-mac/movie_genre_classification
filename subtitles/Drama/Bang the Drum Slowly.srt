1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,170
It's much too late.

2
00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:04,371
I'm too old.

3
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:05,710
No, no.

4
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:06,941
With your serious money

5
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:09,348
I could fiX you up
with a plan as a starter.

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,353
You know,
I been meaning to ask you...

7
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,948
but a guy my age hates
to ask a punk like you

8
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,959
for tips on things.

9
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:20,120
What do you own?

10
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,390
What do I own?

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,988
I own
two catcher's mitts

12
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,726
and a baseball autographed

13
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,997
by each and every member
of the New York Mammoths.

14
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:29,298
Put it all together

15
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:32,171
you got a fin
in any hock shop in Chicago.

16
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:33,731
What I own is debts.

17
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,333
Well, that's simple.

18
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:37,368
We'll declare bankruptcy.

19
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,210
That's something for a fellow
to look forward to.

20
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:42,510
How?

21
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:45,611
I'll show you, but you got
to do me one favor.

22
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:46,882
What's that?

23
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,117
You got to lay off Pearson.

24
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:50,784
I just joke around.

25
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:52,794
It's something
to keep up my spirits

26
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,489
that's all.

27
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,292
He's dying.

28
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,034
You mean soon, any day now?

29
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,130
Could happen
any time.

30
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:06,834
Does Dutch know?

31
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,242
No. You mustn't
tell him, either.

32
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:12,405
He'd cut him loose in a minute.

33
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,971
Only me and you know.

34
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,540
Only you
and me know...

35
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:17,575
only you and me
will ever know.

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,601
Arthur?

37
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,706
Arthur?

38
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,537
Arthur? Arthur?

39
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,133
Who is that?

40
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,509
Arthur, Arthur,
something's happening.

41
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:46,309
Something's happening to me.

42
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:53,388
Yeah?

43
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:54,946
Yeah? What's happening?

44
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,753
Where's Goose? I need help.

45
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:57,759
What for?

46
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:58,919
You know.

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,326
Well, what do I do?

48
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,389
You can talk, Horse knows.

49
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,491
He told me.

50
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:08,002
You weren't supposed
to mention it.

51
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,936
Only my roomie.

52
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,940
You got to go get this doctor,
Dr. Charleston P. Chambers.

53
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:13,963
Check.

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,770
I'm really sorry
to have woke you.

55
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:21,248
I was hoping it wouldn't happen

56
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,250
at a bad hour.

57
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:24,115
I was hoping it
wouldn't happen this...

58
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,710
Make it back to me another time.

59
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,722
No, there's not going to be
another time.

60
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,885
Dutch'll probably bring
Piney Woods back up now

61
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:36,489
and he's going to be real happy.

62
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,499
Is the doctor going to come?

63
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,522
Oh, yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:40,762
Goose went after him.

65
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:41,894
Goose? Why Goose?

66
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,802
Why Goose?

67
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,431
Well, he's right
down the hall.

68
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,032
Goose has got
a heart of gold.

69
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,042
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

70
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,566
I guess it never
really showed.

71
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:54,779
Probably you told him
or something.

72
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,011
I nev... I never told a soul.

73
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,019
Yeah...

74
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,850
Probably everybody'd be nice
to you

75
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,378
if they knew you were dying.

76
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:04,551
Everybody knows
everybody's dying.

77
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:06,754
That's why people are
as good as they are.

78
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:12,359
I'm scared. Hold onto me.

79
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,436
Who is
the sick baseball player?

80
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,480
Are you
a baseball player, too?

81
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,680
Yes, sir,
I'm Henry Wiggen, sir.

82
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,188
Thank you.

83
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:37,316
I've heard that name...
not that I follow the game.

84
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,725
I've detested it
since early childhood.

85
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,991
It's a dying game, I'm told.

86
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,725
Hmm...

87
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:54,239
Hmm...

88
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,574
Mmm.

89
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:05,876
Mmm. I think...

90
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,684
I think it's something else.

91
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:11,214
You mean something else besides
what they said in Minnesota?

92
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,727
Oh, I couldn't say about that.

93
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:14,854
I only mean that

94
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,456
I don't think
there's any danger

95
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:19,057
right at this minute.

96
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,226
Oh, boy.

97
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:21,734
'Cause this sure felt like it.

98
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,171
Now you can do me one favor.

99
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,333
Please send a bill

100
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,002
care of my wife
in Perkinsville, New York

101
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,739
and also not leak anything

102
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,178
to the papers.

103
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:33,612
I'm not in the habit

104
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,776
of leaking my, uh, house calls
to the papers.

105
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:42,517
Arthur, meet Mr. Rogers.

106
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:45,526
Mr. Rogers is a detective.

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,050
Sit down.

108
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:51,794
Mr. Rogers has been
down to Bainbridge

109
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,028
and is now on his way
up to Minnesota

110
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,798
filling in some facts for me.

111
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,862
However, you can save us
some time

112
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,931
by filling in the rest
of the story

113
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:01,636
which Mr. Rogers has begun.

114
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,509
I'll certainly try my darndest.

115
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,209
Tell him what you discovered.

116
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:11,843
In Bainbridge, Georgia,
the subject's domicile

117
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,754
I developed
the following information.

118
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:19,021
I interviewed a Mr. Jay Clark,
the mailman

119
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,358
and a colored woman named Janet.

120
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,694
Uh, never mind the facts.

121
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:25,165
Give me details.

122
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,827
The details are
that the subject, Pearson

123
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,032
told various people that he
wasn't feeling so good

124
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,370
and went to the
hospital in Atlanta.

125
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,899
The hospital in
Atlanta recommended

126
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,969
the hospital
in Minnesota...

127
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,641
If you'd actually spoken
to anybody worth the while

128
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:43,173
you'd learn that Pearson has
this old-time habit

129
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,583
of running back to Atlanta

130
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,382
maybe once
or twice a month.

131
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:49,822
No doubt you developed
that much.

132
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:53,521
No need telling you
where he went in Atlanta...

133
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,551
everybody knows that.

134
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:55,563
Naturally.

135
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:56,655
And you know

136
00:05:56,698 --> 00:06:00,964
what you sometimes pick up
in such places...

137
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:02,629
which he did

138
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:06,072
and which he'd rather not
have them treat in Atlanta

139
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,042
so close to home,
for fear of it getting back

140
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,874
and embarrassing his mother.

141
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,813
So, up he goes to Minnesota
with his fishing gear

142
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:17,511
forgetting that the ice is nine-
feet thick that time of year

143
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,520
checks in with the Mayo Brothers

144
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:22,421
gets himself shot
with a couple of miracle drugs

145
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,482
flirts with the nurses,
checks out

146
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:26,824
meets me in Cannon Falls,
we hunted...

147
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,988
What? What?!

148
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,464
We hunted up some girls we know.

149
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,990
God... damn it.

150
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,435
God... damn it!

151
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,806
Hanson?

152
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,571
Hanson!

153
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,578
Loftus!

154
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,772
Randy, get me Doc Loftus!

155
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:46,144
What's the sudden
interruption?

156
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:47,170
I don't know.

157
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:48,910
You're the detective.

158
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,145
I seen the girls
he runs around with.

159
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,177
She'll give it
to the whole club.

160
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:56,520
She'll run
right around my infield!

161
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,753
Take down your pants.

162
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,351
Are you over the clap yet?

163
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:02,090
Oh, yes, sir; long ago.

164
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,188
How do we know?

165
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,561
Check him over, Doc.

166
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,195
All I need is the clap running
through my ball club now!

167
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:10,397
Hey, Arthur

168
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:11,928
what's going on around here?

169
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,067
Sometimes I don't know
what's going on, sometimes.

170
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,202
He looks just fine to me.

171
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,680
Never better.

172
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:23,309
Healthy young man
if ever I saw one.

173
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,909
Uh, should I head out

174
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:27,581
and develop this
information farther

175
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,487
in-in Rochester, Minnesota?

176
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:31,116
Rochester, Minnesota?

177
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,956
Where you got shot
for the clap.

178
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

179
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,995
Stay with it.

180
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,592
Some things have yet
to be eXplained.

181
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:43,593
In July, we dropped a couple
more games off the pace.

182
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:46,436
It was strange...
the team was going lousy

183
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:48,669
yet I led both leagues
in wins...

184
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,405
smelling 25, maybe more...

185
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,777
and for the first time
in his life

186
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:54,179
Bruce played regular.

187
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:57,080
He didn't bust down fences
left and right

188
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:59,848
but he hit steady... 265, 270.

189
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:04,382
That's not great,
but for Bruce, it's fantastic.

190
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,586
Wouldn't you say

191
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:08,460
that if the Arcturis
Company discovered

192
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:11,158
that you'd been
writing phony letters

193
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,794
to prevent Bruce from
changing his beneficiary...

194
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,997
Oh, that's not a phony letter;
that's a real letter.

195
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,471
- You wrote it.
- The company wrote it.

196
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:20,201
Or if you didn't write it

197
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,801
your wife wrote it...
that's my guess...

198
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:26,712
and several baseball players
tell me I'm probably right.

199
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:31,651
Maybe I'll go check this
with the company themself.

200
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:33,847
They'd take away your license.

201
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,150
Throw me in jail, hmm?

202
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,054
Ruin you as an
insurance agent.

203
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,559
Hmm...

204
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,926
Well, if you say anything
to the Arcturis Company

205
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:46,024
I'll stroll down to a certain
police station on 66th Street

206
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,898
and swear out
a complaint

207
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:50,632
against a certain
"answering service."

208
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:53,971
Well, I'm not really anXious
to complain

209
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,033
to the Arcturis Company.

210
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,274
I don't see any reason
why you and I can't...

211
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,147
arrange a settlement of this
between us.

212
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,150
A deal?

213
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:04,481
A compromise.

214
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,384
I can't compromise
with his money.

215
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,820
That's none of your business.

216
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,551
You're supposed
to do what he wants.

217
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,752
I'm deciding what he wants.

218
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,021
That's illegal.

219
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:14,926
I know.

220
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:19,832
First week in August,
his father hit town.

221
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:01,405
Safe!

222
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,849
Stee...

223
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:22,886
All right, Mammoths,
let's go, let's go!

224
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,470
Safe!

225
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,416
Get a job, Wiggen,
get a job!

226
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:13,039
All right, Arthur, it's
just one of those days.

227
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,015
It's the last
of the order, Dutch.

228
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,778
You've done a lot of pitching.

229
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,251
Let somebody else mop up.

230
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:21,119
Go ahead, take it easy.

231
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,858
Let's get Caselli in here.

232
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,884
Caselli!

233
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,863
Oh, Henry.

234
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,031
Hello, Mr. Pearson.

235
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,870
Please, move on, and don't
disturb the ball players.

236
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,035
That's okay, Jim.

237
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,203
I know I am intruding
on you, and I know...

238
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,212
No, you're not.

239
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,713
You've been
intruded on enough.

240
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,874
Aah...

241
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,043
It's a ball game, sir.

242
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,711
You win 'em; you lose 'em.

243
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:56,053
No, Henry, I mean,
regarding my son.

244
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,523
Sir?

245
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:03,224
You know about...
the condition of my son?

246
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,390
Yes, sir.

247
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,059
Well, so do I.

248
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,160
Yes, sir, I suspected you did.

249
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:13,230
How-How can he be so sick
and play so well?

250
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,833
I really don't even know, sir.

251
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:17,504
If I knew, I'd say.

252
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:18,910
And not play so well

253
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,848
but better than ever,
and that's a fact.

254
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,282
That's a fact, sir.

255
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,513
There's no mistake
about that.

256
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:28,078
So, I've been wondering
if they didn't make

257
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,057
some kind of a mistake
out there at that hospital

258
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:32,059
in Minnesota

259
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:34,027
because it-it's hard
to believe

260
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:35,359
that it can be true.

261
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,523
I-I, uh...

262
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,534
I don't think
I'd count on it, sir.

263
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:44,402
They got an awful famous
reputation up there.

264
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,034
I know it's been
a terrible strain on you.

265
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:49,737
It's a lot worse on him, sir

266
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,745
and on you.

267
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,748
So, I've been...
I've been thinking

268
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,444
and I don't generally swear...

269
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,080
You go ahead and you swear,
Mr. Pearson.

270
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:02,612
Plain old mother talk

271
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,888
ain't no words
near strong enough to describe

272
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,896
such a terrible miX-up
as life, Arthur...

273
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,390
but I'm swearing, my son's
been handed one shit deal!

274
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:18,504
Yes, sir.

275
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:34,277
What'd you do that for?

276
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:37,450
That's a really
juvenile thing to do.

277
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:38,516
Don't do that.

278
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,992
Now, they bombed
you out early.

279
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,087
Why didn't you use your
energy in the game?

280
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,757
What are you doing
it in here for?

281
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,663
Listen, don't mess around
with that stuff.

282
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,531
Everybody's going

283
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:48,830
to be very...

284
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,411
You're writing
a new book, Arthur?

285
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,560
No, Joe,
I'm being interrupted

286
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:17,223
by somebody
busting in my room.

287
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:20,723
About you and Pearson?

288
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:24,329
What makes
you think so?

289
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:26,636
I didn't understand
the situation.

290
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,173
What situation?

291
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:33,008
The situation you're probably
writing the book about.

292
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:34,742
Probably what situation?

293
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,773
The way I feel
about it is this:

294
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:39,810
I believe that Pearson's
a better tegwar player

295
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:41,151
than I ever realized

296
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,555
and should play with
us all the time.

297
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,492
I swear to God, Arthur

298
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,486
I'm shaking and my knees are
trembling, my heart is sick.

299
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,431
He told me on the airplane.

300
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,025
Who told you what?

301
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,035
Goose told me.

302
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,058
Why?

303
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,032
I've been calling Pearson

304
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:03,441
"Romeo and Juliet:
Which is which," see?

305
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:06,106
Now who'll you tell?

306
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:08,012
Nobody, Arthur!

307
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,244
Absolutely nobody!

308
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:15,389
I told the wife,
and that's the end of it.

309
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:18,915
Why "told the wife"?

310
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,897
Arthur,
I tell the wife everything.

311
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,328
Hello, Doc.

312
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,837
Sidney.

313
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:31,839
What's up?

314
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:32,999
Where is everybody?

315
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,371
Nobody knows.

316
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,509
I'll bet Tootsie knows.

317
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:40,571
Knows what, Arthur?

318
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:42,310
Now look,
I know something is up.

319
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,716
The long distance
been flying far and fast.

320
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:49,318
I could use two grandstands
any weekend or night.

321
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:52,349
Yeah, well, tickets are going
to be scarcer and scarcer

322
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,360
from here on in.

323
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:55,191
Why did I see Doc Loftus

324
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:56,696
just pass through?

325
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,199
Oh, Doc Loftus in the hotel?

326
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:03,101
Doc Loftus, telephone, please.

327
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,536
Who wants him?

328
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,039
Dutch wants him.

329
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:07,370
Who's sick?

330
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:09,205
I don't know,
somebody in Minnesota.

331
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,369
I'm not clear.

332
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:13,505
Look, I only catch
a little bit now and then

333
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:15,607
and, besides, who understands

334
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,050
this medical talk
they're talking?

335
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:21,714
But I believe he has a leak
in his blood somewhere.

336
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:22,848
Room service?

337
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,824
Just a moment, please.

338
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,158
Nothing serious,
but I don't know who.

339
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,664
I never heard of it.

340
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,964
But for two more grandstands
on the following day

341
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:37,527
I can tell you
something else.

342
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,870
Yeah? I'd hate to hear it.

343
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,603
You are in the doghouse.

344
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:43,769
Why you?

345
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:45,836
You've been playing
your heart out.

346
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,906
It's some of those other
so-called baseball players

347
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,440
been dragging their foot.

348
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:52,418
That's why
we haven't won it yet.

349
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,421
Why me?

350
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:56,355
Because of your contract,
Pearson...

351
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,358
Mr. Rogers

352
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,384
the detective, broke it open.

353
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,691
You see, very easy.

354
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,630
Joe Jaros and Goose Williams

355
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:07,566
spent the winter in Minnesota
with Pearson.

356
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:11,163
You know, I didn't even know
they were that friendly.

357
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,729
Well, takes all kinds.

358
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,037
The time is 8:06.

359
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,572
Third base side, Arthur,
lower deck, not too far back

360
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:24,585
and not behind no pillars
nor post.

361
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,814
I told you!

362
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:28,981
I told you I'd get
to the bottom of this!

363
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,184
Good morning to all.

364
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,192
Good morning.

365
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:39,598
Shouldn't have kept
it a secret, Henry.

366
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,568
I can't understand
why I'm not crying.

367
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,934
Keep your hankie handy,
dearie.

368
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:47,634
Makes you think it can happen
to your own son.

369
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,643
It upset Joe
something terrible.

370
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,611
Don't you think
we discussed it enough

371
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:53,170
as far as how horrible it is?

372
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,114
Tonight is another ball game
as usual.

373
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:57,947
Maybe we can get help
from the, uh, commissioner.

374
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:58,952
You can't get help there

375
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:00,681
and keep it in this room
at the same time.

376
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,018
Well, then let
the facts out.

377
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,023
It wouldn't be human.

378
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:05,184
Is it human to lose?

379
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,625
We're calling in Piney Woods

380
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,526
from Queens City
for eXtra catching.

381
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,531
Ready on your call
to Professor Traphagen.

382
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:13,294
Do we really need him?

383
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,531
He was the greatest
catcher I ever saw.

384
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,060
Arthur, you were his boy.

385
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:20,699
You talk him into coming back
to help us.

386
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,003
He's out of condition.

387
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:23,943
He teaches English
at a college.

388
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,344
He won't play.
He'll stick to catching.

389
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,940
He'll study us, help
us make it to the end.

390
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,473
How much can I offer him?

391
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,986
The sky's the limit,
and I'm sure the boys will go

392
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,612
to a full series share
if we win.

393
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,986
Red?

394
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,651
Oh, trouble, Red.

395
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:40,160
Lots of trouble!

396
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:42,822
Arthur wants to talk to you!

397
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:46,355
Yeah, it's Arthur who got us
in trouble in the first place.

398
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:52,434
Red, we got a crisis here,
and we need your help.

399
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,000
You get a full series share
if we win it.

400
00:18:56,043 --> 00:19:00,173
Red, how do you like the sound
of a thousand dollars a week?

401
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,875
Can't find a substitute?

402
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,043
To do what?

403
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:05,052
Teach English?

404
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,054
What teach English?

405
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,181
People speak English already!

406
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,054
Red, Red, it's urgent.

407
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:16,029
I swear you won't have to play,
just instruct the catching!

408
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,530
Right!

409
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,192
Hop on the nearest plane.

410
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,723
Love and kisses, Red.

411
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,559
I hate him.

412
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:26,664
Have you thought up
anything yet, Doc?

413
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,696
I'm thinking.

414
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,437
You're a
slow thinker.

415
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:31,069
This thing, this...

416
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,636
What is it called?

417
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,944
The disease is named
for Hodgkin.

418
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,143
He's the man who identified it.

419
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:38,310
Find him.

420
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,819
Is he alive himself?

421
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:41,651
Maybe he thought up a cure
by now

422
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:44,954
that those jugheads up in
Minnesota didn't hear about yet.

423
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:47,426
What the hell kind of a place
is that anyway

424
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:50,396
to build a goddamn hospital
in the wilds of nowhere?

425
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,058
Does a man freeze his ass off

426
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,158
by the time they get him
down in bed?

427
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,635
You. You were there.

428
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,968
You sneaked out there
in the middle of winter

429
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:00,871
and all the rest
was horse feathers.

430
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,035
You and Mary "P" for palooka!

431
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:07,309
And hunting through the ice
and miracle drugs for the clap

432
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:09,441
and tricks on the telephone!

433
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:11,815
Whoo-hoo!
Howdy, partners!

434
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,012
Hey, Piney,
what's going on?

435
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,850
Tumblin' tumbleweeds!

436
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,015
Piney Woods!

437
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:17,182
Hey, Piney, Piney

438
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:18,919
did you come here
from Queens City

439
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,926
on horseback?

440
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,326
No, partner,
I flew.

441
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:24,058
Hey, it's Red Traphagan!

442
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:35,000
What's up, Arthur?

443
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,009
Damn if I know.

444
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:37,374
You know I'd tell
you if I knew.

445
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,878
It smells the same.

446
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:40,039
It stinks!

447
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,310
Human perspiration smells,
it doesn't stink.

448
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,214
Wouldn't have it
any other way, huh?

449
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,218
Arthur.

450
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:47,049
How are you?

451
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:49,214
Jesus, you've been
having a great year.

452
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:50,382
Best year of my life.

453
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:52,551
I've bet you got
no reception like this

454
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:53,560
in San Francisco.

455
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,152
No, they pray I
don't show for class.

456
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:56,561
What's up, Red?
Why are you here?

457
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,894
Let's get a statement.

458
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:58,899
Ponce!

459
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,525
Ponce, I want to talk
to my boys, huh?

460
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,229
Why is he here, Dutch?
What's happening?

461
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:03,462
- Is he going to play?
- Never.

462
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:05,062
He's here to coach
the catching

463
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:06,732
and Piney's here to
catch the catching

464
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:07,798
in case anything happens.

465
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:09,036
You'll get your story later.

466
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:10,543
- Why now?
- Mental lapse, that's why.

467
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:11,704
Beat it.

468
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:14,009
Look, there's lemonade,
there's cookies outside.

469
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,572
Why don't you get going,
stay outside.

470
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:16,583
If you want a story

471
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,084
I'll give it to you later on.

472
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:19,244
Where's your gun?

473
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:20,583
Well, right here, partner.

474
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,747
Hand it over.

475
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,916
I'm in no mood to
see anybody get killed

476
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,118
by a bullet wound.

477
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,559
Piney, I hear you had
bullets with it, too.

478
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:29,529
Well, yes, sir.
They're in the gun.

479
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,360
Why the hell didn't
you tell me?

480
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,161
Why, I didn't think
it'd go off.

481
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,565
I'm always very careful.

482
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,069
That's what everybody says.

483
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:38,537
That's why the hospitals
are full of babies.

484
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:40,369
- Jonah?
- Yeah.

485
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:42,204
You shot guns in the war.

486
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:43,870
No, sir, I played baseball.

487
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,208
Some hell of a war.

488
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,213
Canada.

489
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:47,373
Yes, sir.

490
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:48,972
- You shot guns in Vietnam.
- Right.

491
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,881
Here. Take and empty this gun.

492
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,215
Why am I here, Arthur?

493
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:54,312
Boys? Boys...

494
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,222
I want to welcome Red back
from the Coast

495
00:21:57,324 --> 00:22:00,521
to bolster us
and steady up the instruction.

496
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,831
I want to welcome Piney Woods
back from the wild, wild west

497
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,357
to ride along with us
all the way now

498
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:09,391
is what I'm hoping.

499
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:17,669
You've all been doing
very good jobs.

500
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,511
Maybe now and then
some baseball player

501
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:27,181
or other type of person gets
the idea that I'm not human.

502
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:31,385
Well, for eXample, even...
Pearson here thought

503
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:33,188
that I sometimes
wasn't human.

504
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,387
No, sir.

505
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,627
I, uh, probably ate
you out now and then

506
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,532
but never
without a reason.

507
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,198
No, sir, you only ate me out
for doing dumb things.

508
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,729
No, no, no, no,
I ate you out

509
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:48,036
for the good of the club

510
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,202
and for your own pocketbook

511
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,213
never for
anything personal

512
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,215
because I know
that you know

513
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,684
that personally
I never had anything

514
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,211
but the greatest respect
for you as a human being.

515
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,747
Yes, sir,
that was how I always felt.

516
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,092
When I die...

517
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,590
When I die...

518
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,930
...the papers will write
in the headlines

519
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:24,968
"Son of a Bitches of the World
Have Lost Their Leader."

520
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,947
Yet, many a boy
might shed a tear or two

521
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:31,179
that rode along with me
into the big bunny

522
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,778
and, uh, that's why
I maybe now and then

523
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:36,847
I ate Pearson out or
some other type of person.

524
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,357
It's time, Dutch.

525
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:39,689
Yeah.

526
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:41,524
I'll say it's time!

527
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:42,790
Let's go, boys!

528
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,027
Now that you're here

529
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,536
tell me what you see, okay?

530
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,038
'Cause I know I got faults.

531
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,403
I always did.

532
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:59,042
Throw the ball back
to the pitcher better.

533
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,546
Make it easy on him.

534
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:01,707
Right, I will.

535
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:03,376
I really will now.
I'll do that.

536
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:04,907
I told you that
a thousand times.

537
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:06,544
When he tells you,
you believe him.

538
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,054
Yeah, but he's a catcher.

539
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,215
You ain't no catcher.

540
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:12,225
We're of the tribe
of catchers.

541
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,385
Yeah, huh.

542
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:14,553
Oh, yeah, but when you hit

543
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,721
don't chew.

544
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,355
There's a system
to your chewing.

545
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:18,558
You give yourself away.

546
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,396
When he tenses up,
he stops chewing.

547
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:21,560
That's it.

548
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,729
Oh, one other little thing...
use a lighter bat.

549
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:25,705
I always thought you used
too heavy a bat.

550
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:28,003
Big, strong boy like you,
you just meet the ball.

551
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,009
Don't murder it.

552
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:30,305
Okay.

553
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:34,506
Is she familiar to you?

554
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:35,708
Oh, you bet.

555
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,478
I seen her on TV.

556
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,079
Plus, she was voted
Miss Industrial Progress

557
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:43,146
not so very long ago.

558
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,953
I believe I recall
the event.

559
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:50,430
Tell Mr. Wiggen your present
business address.

560
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:54,423
66th Street.

561
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:58,063
Where you've got
a golden lifetime pass to

562
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,073
just as soon as I lay my hands

563
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:02,132
on that Change
of Beneficiary form

564
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:04,940
to you-know-who's policy.

565
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:13,215
Miss Industrial Progress here
is a baseball fan

566
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,220
from way back,
aren't you, honey?

567
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,849
I sure am.

568
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,950
You won't play ball forever.

569
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:22,052
You got a short life.

570
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,360
Why not live it up a little bit?

571
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,458
I mean,
why worry so much about...

572
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,628
you-know-who and his family

573
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,797
and his little old policy.

574
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,070
Why?

575
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:35,175
Why?

576
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:38,406
I don't know why you don't
live it up all the time

577
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,743
when dying is
just around the corner

578
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:43,079
but you don't.

579
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:45,677
You'd think you would,
but you don't.

580
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,679
I don't know why.

581
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,301
All right, bring them in.

582
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:18,309
As I was walking the streets
of Laredo

583
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:22,982
As I walked out
in Laredo one day

584
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:28,552
I spied a young cowboy
all wrapped in white linen

585
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:34,761
Wrapped in white linen
as cold as the clay...

586
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,895
Then the cowboy speaks.

587
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:38,268
Try a different song!

588
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,102
Yeah, I don't like that song.

589
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,164
No, the cowboy speaks.

590
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:43,266
I don't want to hear
the cowboy speak.

591
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,338
I seen by his outfit
that he was a cowboy

592
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:53,183
And as I walked near him
these words he did sigh

593
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,283
"Come sit down beside me
and hear my sad story

594
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,759
Shot in the breast,
and I know I must die"...

595
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:02,386
You got another number, Piney?

596
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:03,953
That song stinks.

597
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,555
It's a cornball song.

598
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,829
Hey, I think it's letting up.

599
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:09,392
Let him sing.

600
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:10,596
Yeah, it sounds good.

601
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:14,073
Yeah, the cowboy tells
his sad story.

602
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:18,840
Yes, once in the saddle,
I used to go dashing

603
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:23,111
Once in the saddle,
I used to go gay

604
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,985
First down to Rosie's,
and then to the card house

605
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,287
Shot in the breast,
and I'm dying today

606
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,389
Get 16 gamblers
to carry my coffin

607
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:45,167
Get siX pretty maidens
to sing me a song

608
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:50,871
Take me to the valley
and lay the sod o'er me

609
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:58,208
I'm just a young cowboy,
and I know I done wrong.

610
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,784
Come on, boys.

611
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:06,350
Why don't you join in a little
like they do, you know?

612
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:14,732
Oh, bang the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly

613
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:21,469
Play the dead march
as they carry me along

614
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:28,778
Put bunches of roses
all over my coffin

615
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:35,448
Roses too deaden the clods
as they fall.

616
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:11,315
Hey!

617
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,383
Hey, it's Arthur!

618
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,395
Hey, Arthur, hat's off.

619
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:16,589
Come on in, Arthur.

620
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,995
Come on,
join the celebration.

621
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:20,499
I guess I will... I live here.

622
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:22,764
Celebrating what?

623
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,634
Uh...

624
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:26,639
celebrating!

625
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:29,267
Celebrating celebration.

626
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,276
Yeah, hats off!

627
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,778
Hey, gee, Piney,
he said "Hats off"

628
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,781
So take your hat off.

629
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,682
Well, whatever Bruce says,
I'll do, for in my opinion

630
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:40,152
there's no greater catcher
in baseball today.

631
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,346
Hats off.

632
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:50,286
Baltimore won.

633
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:54,330
Well, that's okay

634
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:57,098
'cause they ain't going
to beat us!

635
00:29:58,305 --> 00:29:59,431
Best of five.

636
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,498
Hey, hey, why, hats off.

637
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:04,169
Oh, give me a home
where the buffalo roam

638
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:08,806
And the deer
and the antelope play

639
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,874
Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word...

640
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:12,885
I thought I might be dreaming.

641
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,887
I figured I'd wake up

642
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:16,411
and they'd be
ragging each other

643
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:18,014
and slinging horse shit
as usual.

644
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:19,753
But it was real.

645
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:22,125
They were there,
and Bruce amongst them.

646
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:24,995
It was a club.

647
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:29,696
...Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word

648
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,601
And the skies are not cloudy
all day...

649
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:35,506
No, there's no...

650
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,203
I don't want to be here
when he shoots.

651
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,778
He's gonna shoot goddamn...

652
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:46,152
Ah, my eyes.

653
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,380
Glass all over the floor.

654
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:49,651
Where's my shoes?

655
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:52,818
Arthur.

656
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,985
You all right?

657
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:55,153
Yeah.

658
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:56,753
Oh, they're a great bunch
of boys.

659
00:30:56,797 --> 00:30:58,890
They always was.

660
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,525
Put a card there,
all right.

661
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,694
Joe, you up.

662
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,034
Yeah, I'm betting right now.

663
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,539
I want five dollars more.

664
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,767
I'm putting in five.

665
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:09,241
Five more.
What are you betting on?

666
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,209
Five. I'll tell you
after you put in the five.

667
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,506
And I'm going
to raise you two.

668
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:13,513
Okay, what are?

669
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:15,014
- Raise me two.
- I want to raise two.

670
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:16,811
- All right, he can raise.
- You owe.

671
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,181
Two and two better.

672
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:19,344
I'll raise you two.

673
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,876
Hey, you're not putting
in any money.

674
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:21,979
What are you holding, Joe?

675
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:23,649
- The siX dollars.
- What are you holding?

676
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,157
- I got it.
- I'll just raise you two.

677
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:26,853
Are you talking big,
or are you holding?

678
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:28,588
No, no, no.
I want to see his money here.

679
00:31:28,628 --> 00:31:29,754
I just raised two, though.

680
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:31,388
I can't play.
Listen, put in the money!

681
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,194
I'll put it in,
but I don't understand...

682
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,201
Put in another
three dollars there.

683
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:36,361
That's it.
Three more.

684
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:37,768
- Here it is.
- No, but he didn't...

685
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:39,362
Jack and a three,
and it's all mine.

686
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,203
- Wait a...
- I've got the trump card here.

687
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,332
15, 15!

688
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,740
I haven't even played my hand...

689
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,903
No good, no good!

690
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,173
Wait a minute,
we got a split.

691
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:47,737
We got a run
right through the ten...

692
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,146
Can you beat
a Coney Island tady?

693
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,308
Yeah. Well, well...

694
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,011
Well, what about
this double ace deuces?

695
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:54,043
I wish you a lot
of luck with it.

696
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:59,319
It was a club

697
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,793
like it should've been all year
but never was

698
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,228
but all of a sudden become.

699
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:06,061
We'd begun to pull ahead.

700
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:50,602
Please welcome

701
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:52,612
for a return engagement
on this program

702
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:53,613
the Singing Mammoths

703
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:55,581
and their newest member,
Bruce Pearson.

704
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:58,714
Please eXcuse my tears

705
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:02,415
'Cause I've been
on the road to tribulation

706
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:07,449
And I find
no consolation here

707
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:12,727
What good is a love song
if the words are second-hand?

708
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:19,228
They don't belong
to anyone you can't get near

709
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:25,107
'Cause I live on the outside
of your joy and laughter

710
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:30,640
You gave me a good ride,
but I can't come after

711
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:32,879
All is said and done

712
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,184
I'm not the one
you really took me for

713
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:41,818
And so, you better look
before you leap

714
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,190
Yeah.

715
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,031
Come on there, Bruce.

716
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,435
Play it.

717
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:53,439
Whoo!

718
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:56,067
Yeah.

719
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,773
Yeah.

720
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,678
Whoo!

721
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:03,842
Yeah!

722
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:06,307
Whoo!

723
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:10,212
Yeah.

724
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,291
Ooh!

725
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,728
Yeah.

726
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,669
Uh-huh.

727
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:29,869
I live on the outside
of your joy and laughter

728
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:35,575
You gave me a good ride,
but I can't come after

729
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,344
All is said and done

730
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:40,820
I'm not the one
you really took me for

731
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:46,622
And so, you'd better look
before you leap

732
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:52,428
So you better look
before you leap

733
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:57,903
So you better look
before you weep.

734
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:11,017
Bruce, you
did it, man!

735
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:12,313
Get it over here!

736
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:14,479
Hey, get over here!

737
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:24,588
What, what?

738
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,758
Ah, nothing.

739
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:35,806
I'll call a
doctor, okay?

740
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,833
No.

741
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,507
Is it the real thing?

742
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:44,517
Well, yes and no.

743
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:47,315
I just feel a little dipsy.

744
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,345
Maybe if you open a window.

745
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,066
Hi, Katie.

746
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm okay.

747
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,004
Well, I'm feeling
a little dipsy.

748
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:15,904
Uh, no, I don't think he did.

749
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,382
Oh, he's getting to it.

750
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:20,545
Mm-hmm.

751
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:22,418
No, he's getting to it.

752
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:24,150
Yeah.

753
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,417
Uh...

754
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,620
Katie? But I didn't...

755
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,664
Katie?

756
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,959
Katie?

757
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,337
Well, okay, yeah,
and I love you, too.

758
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,396
Yeah.

759
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:52,284
I'll get Perry to warm you.

760
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:54,513
No, no, I'm okay.

761
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:57,580
Am I throwing
the ball back better?

762
00:36:57,624 --> 00:36:59,592
Oh, yeah

763
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,617
and it's helping
me out a lot, too.

764
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,431
Everything had been
going our way

765
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:14,372
and when the Pirates came
to town

766
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,204
we had ourselves
a good cushion.

767
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,210
We were unstoppable.

768
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,405
It was only a matter of time.

769
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,318
Oh!

770
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:11,956
Keep it moving,
don't slow it down.

771
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,192
Are you all right?

772
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:15,224
You don't look all right.

773
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:30,878
Strike Three! You're out!

774
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,677
Hey, uh, are you all right?

775
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:36,848
Bruce?

776
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,619
He's all right.

777
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:40,523
We'll take care of him.

778
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,341
Stee!

779
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,651
Strike two!

780
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,705
Come on! Go!

781
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,582
Yes!

782
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,592
Heads up, Bruce, heads up!

783
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:55,163
He's not too clear
in his head, Dutch.

784
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:58,659
Then let's keep your sign
off the bench.

785
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:03,199
Ah, tell Horse to cover
pop flies around the plate.

786
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:19,150
Stee!

787
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:00,264
Ball two!

788
00:41:05,938 --> 00:41:07,269
Stee!

789
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:00,583
You can go in now.

790
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,781
It's sad; makes
you want to cry.

791
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:09,454
It is sad...

792
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:11,486
makes you want to laugh.

793
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:16,991
Hey.

794
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:18,003
Hi.

795
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:19,061
Hey.

796
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:22,233
Hi, Joe.

797
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,970
Hi.

798
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:27,002
Hope I brought
the right combination.

799
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:28,013
Yeah.

800
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:29,674
Did anyone bring my shoes?

801
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:31,307
Yeah, sure.

802
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:21,966
Thanks for everything, Arthur.

803
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,059
Thanks a lot.

804
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:24,729
And I'll be back in the spring.

805
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,362
I'm going to be in shape then;

806
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:27,895
you'll see.

807
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,568
Yeah, I'll see you then,
and, Bruce...

808
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,975
Yeah.

809
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:34,980
...see you in Aqua Clara,
all right?

810
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:36,481
Yeah.

811
00:44:45,324 --> 00:44:48,487
Hey, Arthur, don't forget
to send me a scorecard

812
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:50,017
from the series, okay?

813
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,393
You bet I will.

814
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,455
Okay.

815
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:55,194
I'll see you.

816
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,864
I'll see you.

817
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:33,763
We breezed through the playoffs

818
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:35,899
and wrapped up the series
on a Sunday.

819
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,341
My win.

820
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:40,106
I took the scorecard home
and threw it on the shelf

821
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:42,273
and left it lay there.

822
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:45,011
It would've been simple
to shove it in the mail.

823
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:46,848
How long would it have took?

824
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:49,912
Couldn't I afford the stamps?

825
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:54,052
In my Arcturis calendar
for December 10, it says:

826
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:56,653
Desoto visited Georgia, 15-40.

827
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:58,129
This hands me a laugh.

828
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:01,065
Bruce Pearson also visited
Georgia.

829
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,534
I was his pallbearer

830
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:06,129
me and some local boys.

831
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:08,163
There were flowers
from the club

832
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,072
but no person from the club.

833
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:13,567
They could've sent somebody.

834
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:16,308
He wasn't a bad fella...

835
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:19,546
no worse than most
and probably better than some...

836
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:21,348
and not a bad ballplayer
neither

837
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,184
when they give him
the chance...

838
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,156
when they laid off him
long enough.

839
00:46:25,257 --> 00:46:31,526
From here on in, I rag nobody.
