1
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,096
Thank you, sir

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,889
I wish you had stayed on
to take your degree

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,694
I couldn't afford to

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,534
But don't give up your writing

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,699
I remember your stories in the
college magazine about village life

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,015
They were very good. You know,
one can earn a living by writing

19
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,969
Good morning. Sit down

20
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,094
What use will that be?

21
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,889
It will rest your legs

22
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,899
I haven't come up to rest my legs

23
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,254
You know very well why I'm here

24
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,977
I'm going to ask a straight question,

25
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,297
and I'd like a straight answer

26
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,890
- What is the date?
- The tenth

27
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,619
- How many months rent do you owe me?
- Three

28
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,215
That makes twenty-one rupees

29
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,015
Will you pay me now,
or shall I return this evening?

30
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,975
That makes three questions, not one

31
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,932
It's not fair

32
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,218
Many things are not fair

33
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,733
Is it fair
that I should house you for nothing?

34
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,129
That you should use electricity
all day without paying for it?

35
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,454
You have had education.

36
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,010
You have pictures
of great men on the wall

37
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,656
Is it fair
that you don't pay the rent?

38
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,137
It's a sign of greatness, you know

39
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,811
I, too, could turn a pretty phrase...

40
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,578
...but it would not be fit

41
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,375
for your young ears

42
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,814
Anyway, either I get my money
this evening...

43
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,298
...or I'll look for a new lodger

44
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,170
This letter is for you, not me

45
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,178
We're both Rays

46
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,209
We are pleased to accept your short
story "A Man of the Soil"...

47
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,095
...for publication in the next
issue of <i>Sahityik</i>

48
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,774
Not bad news, I hope

49
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,809
Why do you get so few letters?

50
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,489
Does nobody write to you?

51
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,931
I'd like to open a love letter
by mistake

52
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,494
Perhaps it's as well

53
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,251
I've experienced
matrimonial complications

54
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,658
HARIMATI PRIMARY SCHOOL

55
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,649
You advertised for a teacher

56
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,769
Qualifications?

57
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,653
- Intermediate Science
- No good, we want Matriculation

58
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,934
But I got that before Intermediate

59
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,494
What did the advertisement say?

60
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,454
It did specify Matriculation

61
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,650
Then why harp on Intermediate?
What's the point?

62
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,296
Would you work
for ten rupees a month?

63
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,290
Well?

64
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,413
I understand
you want someone in your factory.

65
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,178
I have Matriculation

66
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,330
Any experience of labelling?

67
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,738
Labelling?
No, but I can learn

68
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,256
Go through that door
and down the passage.

69
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,771
Take a look first

70
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,853
Pulu!

71
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,928
You're a fine friend.

72
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,294
Why didn't you tell me
you'd left the student hostel?

73
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,498
I've been searching north Calcutta
for you since four o'clock

74
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,496
I finally got your address from the
people you give private lessons to

75
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,857
What's so funny?

76
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,858
You've put on weight

77
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,017
I had.
I lost it these last three hours

78
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,852
Would you like tea at the cafe
around the corner?

79
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,858
All right.

80
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,974
But I've two tickets for
us to see Sadhabar Ekadashi

81
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,853
Is this a hideout? Are you
forging banknotes or something?

82
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,098
I wish I could

83
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,894
And you cook for yourself?

84
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,849
I'll cook you a meal one day:
Rice and potatoes

85
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,130
What about the railway job?

86
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,409
I thought you'd got it

87
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,933
There was a strike on, and they
wanted people as strike-breakers

88
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,729
So you've been unemployed?

89
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,536
I give some private lessons

90
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,772
- How much do you make?
- Fifteen rupees a month

91
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,934
Didn't you learn to type?

92
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,058
Yes, I thought it might be useful

93
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,889
Good. I'll get you a job
as soon as we return

94
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,535
Where are we going?

95
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,532
You'll come with me to my cousin
Aparna's wedding on Monday

96
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,816
- Where?
- Just for a few days

97
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,489
- But where?
- Khulna.

98
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,975
Khulna!
It's a hundred miles away

99
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,174
You'll love it there

100
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,493
An old-world village,
a lovely river with boats on it

101
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,817
Fields of grass and paddy.

102
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,898
Bamboo groves, mango orchards

103
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,739
Doesn't it tempt you?

104
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,530
Trees full of birds:
Magpies, thrushes, nightingales

105
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,729
And in the evening,
fireflies and oil lamps aglow

106
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,373
No electricity

107
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,732
Doesn't it sound tempting?

108
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,731
You'll come, won't you?

109
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,770
Take me back to thy lap,
O Mother Earth

110
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,451
Take back thy son and wrap him
in thine ample robe.

111
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,533
Let me be one with the soil,
and spread myself

112
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,334
Far and wide,
like the joys of spring,

113
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,293
let me burst the heart's narrow cage

114
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,529
reak down the stonewalls of self
and the cheerless prison of the mind

115
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,698
To rush forth in a rapture of delight

116
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,336
And flow to the far ends of the earth,

117
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,453
surging, billowing, rolling on

118
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,608
A policeman

119
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,219
Who's there?

120
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,537
I Am Mainaak,
son of the Himalayas,

121
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,459
hiding my wings in the sea

122
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,018
What's come over you?

123
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,133
You sound
as if you've had too much to drink

124
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,050
I don't think I'll take that job

125
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,773
Don't be absurd

126
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,331
Why should I become a clerk?
There is no reason why I should

127
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,057
I'm a free man, without ties,
no one to worry about

128
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,900
Why should I become a clerk?

129
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,899
But you can't keep pawning books
to pay the rent

130
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,138
- Things will change
- Not without a job

131
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,379
Listen, those with real talent...

132
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,890
Needn't eat?

133
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,898
Apurba Kumar Ray

134
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,569
Make fun of me, but just wait and see

135
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,891
Something up your sleeve?
Some new poems?

136
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,898
You're too prosaic

137
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,729
You'll go abroad,
become an engineer,

138
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,253
get a fat job and settle down

139
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,729
So I'm prosaic? That's gratitude!

140
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,734
Who took you in hand in Calcutta?
Country bumpkin scared of the traffic

141
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,734
Who read your first short story,
and what did he say about it?

142
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,730
Don't get so worked up

143
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,457
Do you know why I feel so elated?

144
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,729
I've had my first good meal
for months, thanks to you

145
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,058
Well, are you writing anything?

146
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,295
A wonderful novel

147
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,413
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,058
- Do you know a good publisher?
- No problem

149
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,740
A boy

150
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,852
A village boy.
Poor, but sensitive

151
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,733
Father, a priest. He dies

152
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,379
The boy doesn't want to be a priest.
He wants to study, he's ambitious

153
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,453
He studies

154
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,778
In the process, I see him struggle

155
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,690
He sheds superstition and prejudice

156
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,494
He takes nothing on trust

157
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,736
He tries to be rational

158
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:53,129
He has imagination,
he's intrigued by little things

159
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:59,131
He has greatness in him, perhaps.
He has the ability to create

160
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,058
But he doesn't

161
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,059
Right, but that's not a tragedy

162
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,015
He remains poor, in want

163
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,374
But he doesn't turn from life,
he doesn't want to escape

164
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,734
He is fulfilled, he wants to live

165
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,376
This is autobiography

166
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,735
Partly, but there are imaginary
characters, plot, love...

167
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,131
Love?
What do you know of love?

168
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,173
You've never been
within ten paces of a girl

169
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,179
It's not that easy,
you have no experience

170
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,739
- Is imagination worth nothing?
- Not where love is concerned

171
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,251
- You're quite wrong
- I'm absolutely right

172
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,896
How much further wilt thou lead me,
O Fair One?

173
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,411
Tell me what shore thy golden boat
will touch

174
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,339
Whatever I ask thee, O thou
from distant lands

175
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,657
Thou smilest in thine own sweet way

176
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,137
And I can never know
what is in thy mind

177
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,934
Silently, thou liftest a finger
pointing to the trackless, wild sea

178
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,815
As, far to the west,
the sun goes down in the sky

179
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,498
What lies there?
What do we go to seek?

180
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,329
Tell me, I pray thee,
O stranger fair

181
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,817
Where, at the edge of evening,
glows the day...

182
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,018
Give me your hand

183
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,819
Wonderful. Really wonderful

184
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,451
Look who is here!

185
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,096
It's Pulu, and not alone

186
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,091
I hope the journey was not
too unpleasant for city people

187
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,817
My youngest son, Murari.

188
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,933
He's studying at Daulatpur College

189
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,098
Take his luggage

190
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,097
My aunt

191
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,411
It's a pity you didn't think of him
as a possible son-in-law

192
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,089
Where have I seen him before?

193
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,735
Lmpossible. He's never been here

194
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,092
But I know his face so well

195
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,889
Yes, I saw a picture of Lord Krishna
looking just like him

196
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,938
Lord Krishna...

197
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,415
...complete with his flute

198
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,530
Binu, my son, come out now

199
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,530
What's wrong? Isn't he well?

200
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,697
It's nothing. The sun was so hot

201
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,533
The long journey and the fasting
must have upset him

202
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,531
Bring water, and a fan

203
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,413
This is a fine wedding

204
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,419
That boy is insane

205
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,375
Who says so? He is perfectly sane.

206
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,218
The journey and the heat...

207
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,651
If you don't stop the wedding, I will

208
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,694
But the auspicious hour is passing

209
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,369
Leave this room!

210
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,616
It's you who is mad

211
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,850
When the hour has passed,
my daughter will never marry

212
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,495
Isn't there another auspicious hour,
at ten?

213
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,854
Don't ask me. This means ruin for me

214
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,652
Have I missed the ceremony?

215
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,495
There's no wedding

216
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,859
The bridegroom is mad

217
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,098
Apu, everything depends on you now

218
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,455
Are you joking?

219
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,732
What is all this?

220
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,535
If the wedding does not take place
at the auspicious times...

221
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,209
...the bride is cursed

222
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,933
But what can I do?

223
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,455
We have to find another husband for
her and you are the obvious choice

224
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,850
You want me
to be a substitute bridegroom?

225
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,136
Is this a play or a novel?
What do you take me for?

226
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,532
Are you still living
in the Dark Ages?

227
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,813
Calm down and listen to me

228
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,489
No, I won't listen
to a pack of lunatics

229
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,850
Everything depends on you

230
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,859
It's no use, let's go

231
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,852
Come here a moment

232
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,058
Can you really get me that job?

233
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,657
You'll have to lend me a shirt,
and I must have a shave

234
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,975
Your daughter
didn't worship Shiva in vain.

235
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,013
A curse became a blessing

236
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,052
The moment I saw him,

237
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:12,175
I knew he was nearer to me
than my own kin

238
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,774
Pulu has brought many
of his friends here...

239
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,099
...but I've never felt so drawn
to anyone

240
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,017
There are a few things
that I must tell you

241
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,859
I've had no opportunity before

242
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,177
How much do you know about me?

243
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,850
Has Pulu told you anything?

244
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,732
Yes

245
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,850
What did he say?

246
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,699
You're an orphan

247
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,817
Yes.

248
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,650
I lost my father when I was ten

249
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,494
Mother died seven years later

250
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,576
I had a sister, too

251
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,860
What else did he tell you?

252
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,256
You write well

253
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,850
He told you that, did he?

254
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,851
Can you read?

255
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,655
Yes. Bengali

256
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,098
I'm writing my novel in Bengali

257
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,132
I know

258
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,852
What else did he say?

259
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,017
Nothing else

260
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,499
That's not very much

261
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,894
You know little
of the man you married

262
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,052
I have no means, no job...

263
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,654
...and almost no future

264
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,735
What kind of home
shall I take you to?

265
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,849
You've been brought up
in these surroundings

266
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,851
A spacious house, servants,
fine rooms

267
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,413
This marriage was forced on me.

268
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,851
I was against it, but...

269
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,169
Something changed my mind,
I felt I would be doing a noble thing

270
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,858
Everything became confused

271
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,415
Why don't you say something?

272
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,851
I can't decide
until I know your mind

273
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,658
Aparna, will you be able
to endure poverty?

274
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,850
Can you live with a poor husband?

275
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,536
Yes

276
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,177
Can you really?

277
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,897
Why not?

278
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,019
Then I'll take you with me.

279
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,973
If your father objects,
I'll ignore him

280
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,058
- Will you object?
- I don't know

281
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,019
- I wonder what they'll say
- Who?

282
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,052
My neighbours.

283
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,015
I went to a wedding,
but I shall return with the bride

284
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,494
I'll come back for the luggage

285
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,493
This is my room

286
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,936
Sit down. I won't be long

287
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,535
You must be very sad

288
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,728
Really not?

289
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,818
They want to see us downstairs

290
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,811
Make way. Let's see the bride

291
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,377
What a lovely bride!

292
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,734
Why gawp? Am I new?

293
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,413
Only after meals. You promised

294
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,653
Do you lament your decision?

295
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,659
What?
I don't know such difficult words

296
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,489
Will "regret" do?

297
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,009
Yes

298
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,814
- Do you regret it?
- Regret what?

299
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,011
- Do I have to explain that too?
- Yes

300
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,491
You missed out on a rich husband

301
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,338
- You're laughing!
- No, I'm crying

302
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,529
You must feel sorry

303
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,535
Of course.
I could have had an easy life

304
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,650
- I'm going.
- Where?

305
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,817
To look for a maid servant

306
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,811
Don't be silly. Come back, please

307
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,815
Who will pay for the servant?

308
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,819
I'll get more private lessons

309
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,139
Then send me back to my parents

310
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:10,497
One lesson is bad enough
after a hard day's work

311
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,816
What should I do, then?

312
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,139
I'll tell you:
Give up the lesson you have

313
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,979
And then what?

314
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,975
Then my poor husband
will come home early

315
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,570
Then I shall lament no more

316
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,730
God of Fire!
Destroy his meditation!

317
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,970
Are you cross with me?

318
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:55,331
Yes. Why do we always take a cab?

319
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,657
Buses are crowded. We're alone here

320
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,216
But it costs much more

321
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,973
Does it matter?

322
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:10,612
Soon you're going to your parents,
my expenses will be halved

323
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,014
Only for two months

324
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,454
Isn't that a long time?

325
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,410
What about the extra expenses
when we come back?

326
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,412
Ah, yes...

327
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,611
I wouldn't have let you go,
but your mother was so insistent

328
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,290
And I felt you'd rather be with her

329
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,535
at such a time

330
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,369
A relief for you, too.
No one to bother you for two months

331
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,980
One job will be done

332
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,095
I'll have time to work on my novel.
I haven't touched it since we married

333
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,888
Is that my fault?

334
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,698
No, it's your virtue. You know how
much my novel means to me, don't you?

335
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,895
- Well, you mean much more
- Really?

336
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,978
I shall dedicate it to you

337
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,489
You'll what?

338
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,414
I know what "wife" means

339
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,211
You don't. I do

340
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,377
I do, too

341
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,097
- What?
- The matches

342
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,858
What is there in your eyes?

343
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,698
Kajal
[Kohl]

344
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,536
We'll expect you in the holidays

345
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,529
I'll do my best. Send a telegram
when you arrive; letters take so long

346
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,610
- Promise you'll come
- Haven't I given my word?

347
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,697
You must write twice a week

348
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,540
- You must write, too
- Not unless you do

349
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,698
Write to my office address,
or Mr. Ray will open your letters

350
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,495
I had so many things to tell you

351
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:14,170
Yes, I asked Pintu's mother
to make you some cakes

352
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,378
There's a bill to pay at the grocer's

353
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,777
I've left some jewellery behind

354
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,494
Please take care of yourself

355
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:42,729
You'll see her in a week,
so cheer up

356
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,294
I wish I knew your secret

357
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,410
How to be married and happy
on forty-five rupees a month

358
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,419
How do you know I'm happy?

359
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,418
I can guess

360
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:25,089
I don't know what your wife is like,
but mine...

361
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,099
I like them to be a little pert...

362
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:35,090
...a little saucy, a little naughty

363
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:41,299
It adds spice to a marriage,

364
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,138
don't you think?

365
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,578
My wife is just the opposite

366
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:53,492
Never quarrels, never complains,
never answers back...

367
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,692
...always meek and obedient

368
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,409
Utterly bland, tasteless

369
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,338
Plus this

370
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,655
You've promised to come on the 8th

371
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:28,651
If you don't,never spea
to you again, never, ever

372
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,411
You should have sent me
eight letters last month...

373
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:39,172
...and I only got seven

374
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:43,089
I should never trust you

375
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:21,137
And I feel jealous of that girl
next door

376
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:26,938
She sees you morning and evening,
and I don't

377
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,495
Do keep the window shut

378
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,737
What else is there to tell?

379
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:21,730
The more I write, the more
you will laugh at my mistakes

380
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:26,810
ut I don't care.
You are the writer, not me

381
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,419
Please take good care of yourself

382
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,091
I am well, but my heart is sick.
IT will heal when you come.

383
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,817
If you don't, I'll never speak
to you again, never, ever

384
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,290
What is it?

385
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,532
Aparna...

386
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,776
In childbirth...

387
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:49,572
She said: "I'm leaving him
in your care, Mrs. Ganguly

388
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:53,569
"He's so absent-minded,
he forgets to eat sometimes"

389
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:00,572
Such sweet words
and such gentle ways

390
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,888
Well, it's a good thing
the baby was saved.

391
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,535
Fate works in strange ways

392
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:15,408
But a young fellow like you
shouldn't give up

393
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:21,616
"While Krishna has
his knot of hair and flute

394
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,414
there'll be women to serve him"

395
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:28,693
Why, you could marry ten times over
if you wanted

396
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:22,370
<i>Dear Pulu. You must have heard</i>
<i>the news by now</i>

397
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,170
<i>I hear you're going abroad.</i>
<i>I Wish you success.</i>

398
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,576
<i>I'm going away, too</i>

399
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,169
<i>I don't know where I'm going,</i>

400
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,736
<i>But I do know why:</i>
<i>I want to be free</i>

401
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,898
<i>I'm taking my novel with me.</i>

402
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,899
<i>I'll send it to you if I finish it</i>

403
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,978
<i>You may publish it</i>
<i>if you like it enough.</i>

404
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,899
Yours, Apu

405
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,852
What have you thrown in my food?

406
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:17,012
I'll teach you a lesson, my lad!

407
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,210
He's bitten me

408
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,858
Wait and see
what your grandfather will do

409
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,979
You'll tell grandfather?

410
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:34,889
Just wait. You need a good hiding

411
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,731
He'll bash you if you do

412
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,892
Who will bash me?

413
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,971
My father. He lives in Calcutta

414
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,370
Father! That's a good one!

415
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:58,179
We haven't seen his pigtail
these last five years

416
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,533
Do fathers have pigtails?

417
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:18,695
He's not shown up once,
even to see his own son

418
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,776
He's sent three money orders.

419
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:26,576
Perhaps he calls that doing his duty

420
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,374
Where is Apu?

421
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,538
I was dead against the marriage

422
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:38,850
It was you and your aunt
who took my daughter...

423
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:44,214
Do you know where Apu is?
I'd just like to know

424
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:49,858
Somewhere in Central India, working
in some coal mine, the vagabond

425
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:54,372
And the boy takes after him

426
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:59,370
Always running around
and getting up to mischief

427
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:02,857
When your aunt was alive
she could manage him,

428
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,177
but it's too much for me

429
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:09,216
Do you know Apu's address?

430
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,379
Whatever is on his letter

431
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,174
Do you think he'll come back?

432
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:21,375
Not that heartless brute

433
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,138
When did you get back?

434
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:34,132
I went to my uncle, looking for you

435
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:43,534
- What are you doing here?
- Working

436
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,256
- Since when?
- About a year

437
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,814
So far from home?

438
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,455
I didn't come here for a job

439
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,212
I arrived here in my wanderings

440
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,617
I had to fill my stomach

441
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,779
- Has it been filled now?
- More or less

442
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:11,450
How is the novel getting along?

443
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,250
I threw it away

444
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,050
Why throw it away?

445
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,173
What's the use?

446
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,848
Come along

447
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,052
Are you going to stay here?

448
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:42,172
- I'm thinking of going away
- Where?

449
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,849
Anywhere. Perhaps abroad.
I'm saving up

450
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,379
Going alone?

451
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:54,335
- Who else is there?
- Kajal

452
01:24:55,620 --> 01:25:01,331
Your son

453
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:08,853
So that's what they called him

454
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:29,011
- Go back home
- Why?

455
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:34,854
The boy needs someone
to look after him

456
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,169
There's such a thing
as a father's duty,

457
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,337
or did you throw duty away, too?

458
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:46,011
Who says I don't do my duty?
I've sent money

459
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:52,330
- Is that all you can do?
- I can't do any more

460
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:04,849
Don't you love your son?

461
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:10,851
No

462
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,654
How can I love him?

463
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:25,258
I've never seen him,
to me he is unreal, untrue

464
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,854
For me he doesn't exist

465
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:35,657
You must have lost your senses

466
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:47,054
Anyway, I've done my duty.
The rest is up to you

467
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,335
Come here for a moment

468
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:03,138
My train leaves at seven

469
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:09,090
Come here

470
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,409
Please do something for the boy,
put him in a home or something

471
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:27,010
- Do that yourself
- No, I can't

472
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:34,329
- It's not possible for me
- I can't understand why not

473
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:39,337
There is something
which I can't forget

474
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,218
Because Kajal exists...

475
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,218
Aparna does not

476
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,339
I've sent money
and I'll send more if necessary

477
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:11,013
More than that, I cannot do

478
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:17,650
I have no love for him.
He is like a stranger

479
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:23,012
If you think
he is not being looked after...

480
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:27,851
...make some arrangement for him

481
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,337
Shall I give you money now?

482
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:43,455
I've no time. I have to start
a new job on Monday

483
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:55,334
Who is it?

484
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:03,850
Who do you want?

485
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:11,095
I'm Apurba

486
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,465
Have you come to fetch him?

487
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,573
I've arranged to leave him
with friends in my home village

488
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,457
I'm going away

489
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:50,129
He's upstairs

490
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:55,218
He's been feverish,
but he's better now

491
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,289
I'm your father

492
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:37,728
What are you doing?

493
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:45,253
You might have killed the boy

494
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,770
Won't you make friends with me?

495
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:02,858
I know lots of good stories

496
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:07,850
Ghost stories,
stories about demons...

497
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:13,135
...kings, queens, princes
and winged horses

498
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:18,979
Want to hear them?

499
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:35,214
I'll leave this jewellery with you...

500
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:39,015
...in case you want to send him
to boarding school

501
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:43,851
It seems to be the only way
to be relieved of his burden

502
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:51,852
Can't you take him with you by force?

503
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,849
As his father
you have the right to do that

504
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:59,851
No, I couldn't do that

505
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:06,849
I knew it. I knew all along
that you could do nothing

506
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:20,211
What do you want to say, Kajal?

507
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,254
Where are you going?

508
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,734
Will you come with me?

509
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,053
Are you going to Calcutta?

510
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,097
If I did, would you come with me?

511
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,132
Would you take me to my father?

512
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,376
Certainly

513
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:42,538
Will he be cross with me?

514
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,449
Why should he be?

515
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,577
He'll never leave me?

516
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:55,449
Never

517
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,936
Who are you?

518
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:08,011
I'm your friend

519
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,291
Will you come with me?

520
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,779
Grandpa will be angry

521
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:32,089
Grandpa won't know, I won't tell him
