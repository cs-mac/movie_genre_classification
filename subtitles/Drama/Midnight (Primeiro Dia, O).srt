355
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,920
 help with housework 

356
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,640
 What is wrong with you 

357
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,480
 boss 

358
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,760
 They also understand the situation 

359
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,120
 And then wait for a while 

360
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,000
 I went over there, Dr Chan 

361
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,240
 You stay with him for 

362
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,840
 Why can not I go home to die 

363
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
 You can spend the night here today 

364
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,880
 Aunt to buy a lot of good 

365
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
 Hamburg fried chicken to you 

366
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,720
 why 

367
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,520
 This is the inspection report for you 

368
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,320
 Thank you 

369
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 Lele is type AB 

370
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,280
 like me 

371
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,000
 Grow up must be very clever 

372
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
 That type O it 

373
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
 It is also very clever 

374
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,120
 Who is type O 

375
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
 mark 

376
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,040
 mark 

377
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
 Your father is type O 

378
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,640
 Ah My father is type O 

379
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 How you coming 

380
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,240
 Lele's mother 

381
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,480
 What is your name 

382
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
 I do not know 

383
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,720
 Then you explain to me 

384
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,680
 Why is your blood type 

385
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
 And does not match Lele 

386
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
 I do not know why 

387
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,200
 why 

388
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,640
 Because Lele 

389
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,320
 Is simply not your real daughter 

390
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,640
 Lele is my daughter 

391
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
 Your blood type does not match and Lele 

392
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,240
 But you she has her birth certificate 

393
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
 why 

394
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
 Lele is my daughter 

395
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,720
 The child in the end is where's the 

396
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,680
 mark 

397
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
 Only you tell me the truth 

398
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 I can help to you 

399
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,240
 The child in the end is where's the 

400
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,960
 what 

401
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,880
 I'm looking for a lawyer to 

402
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
 Blood does this matter 

403
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
 In fact, very simple 

404
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,520
 I explain to you 

405
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
 You know 

406
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,240
 Blood what constitutes it 

407
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,440
 Three genes 

408
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,840
 ABO 

409
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,240
 It is a dominant gene AB 

410
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,680
 O is recessive gene 

411
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,280
 So these three genes twenty-two group phase 

412
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,560
 What is obtained after permutations 

413
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,200
 Get our biology. 

414
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,120
 Six kinds of blood 

415
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,920
 Which six kinds 

416
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,000
 AA 

417
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
 AO 

418
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
 BB 

419
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
 BO 

420
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
 AB 

421
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
 And O 

422
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,200
 Then just said 

423
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,640
 O because it is a recessive gene 

424
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,080
 So when it encounters 

425
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
 A and B that two major 

426
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
 When the dominant gene 

427
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
 It does not play any decisive factor 

428
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,960
 That is to say 

429
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,880
 AB blood type of a child 

430
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,120
 His parents must have the same time 

431
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,480
 A and B are two major dominant gene which 

432
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
 To be able to give birth to a 

433
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,400
 AB blood type of child 

434
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,680
 Blood type O 

435
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,400
 Of course, no AB blood born children 

436
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,560
 In the end what you say ah 

437
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
 If not natural 

438
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,280
 That come from Lele 

439
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,720
 Ok 

440
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,360
 Mark economic conditions 

441
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,720
 It is impossible to adopt a child 

442
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,360
 it is good 

443
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,200
 Not adopted 

444
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,760
 But Mark 

445
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,480
 There is a hospital birth certificate 

446
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
 The fact is certainly not 

447
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,680
 Mark said that the way 

448
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,040
 boss 

449
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,640
 at the begining of 

450
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,440
 Mark took the children 

451
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,120
 You appear in 

452
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,800
 right 

453
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,160
 it is good 

454
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,600
 So tell us 

455
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,240
 That evening 

456
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,400
 In the end is what happens 

457
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,680
 For ah boss 

458
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,080
 Lele in the end is where the ah 

459
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,320
 As we all know that 

460
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,760
 Lele's mother threw her 

461
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,480
 Then Mark 

462
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,800
 A shoulder to take up the responsibility of raising Lele 

463
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,080
 Trying to be a good father 

464
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,760
 This is what happened that night 

465
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,080
 Yep 

466
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,120
 there is only one truth 

467
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,160
 Those abducted the child's parents 

468
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 Genes have left information 

469
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,760
 We just find 

470
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
 Children of unknown origin 

471
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,240
 We will put the child's genes 

472
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,680
 And database to do than to 

473
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,800
 The truth soon surfaced 

474
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,920
 I've asked the head office of legal affairs 

475
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,600
 To deal with the case of 

476
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
 That will happen next 

477
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,760
 Lele now 

478
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,240
 Come back yet 

479
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,520
 Mark insist on keeping the hospital to visit Lele 

480
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,160
 Can you win back 

481
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,760
 difficult 

482
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
 Just because he can not hear the ear 

483
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 illiterate 

484
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,600
 still is 

485
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,160
 Yes 

486
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,360
 Not entirely 

487
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,440
 I do not worry too much about it first 

488
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,600
 Now there is no evidence of adverse Mark 

489
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,600
 Unless it is proved 

490
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,400
 Lele is really abducted 

491
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,280
 But if it is the case 

492
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,520
 That might come back Lele 

493
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,640
 Hello there 

494
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
 I am a lawyer Yan 

495
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,360
 Come 

496
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,200
 Your friend 

497
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,760
 Please let me be your lawyer 

498
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,560
 Do you accept 

499
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,120
 Ok 

500
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,760
 If accepted 

501
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,000
 You can immediately go 

502
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
 When will I 

503
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,840
 You can see Lele 

504
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
 Oh Lele 

505
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
 I have been proposed to apply 

506
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,080
 You can see her 

507
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,480
 But she can not take away 

508
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,200
 why 

509
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,520
 Because blood typing 

510
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
 Lele completely unrelated to you 

511
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
 She has not your child 

512
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,680
 My dad is Lele 

513
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,240
 She was abandoned by her mother 

514
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,840
 You do not so impulsive okay 

515
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,960
 Ok 

516
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,640
 The other side waiting for such an opportunity 

517
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,200
 You want to fight for custody of Lele 

518
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,320
 Chances are very low 

519
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,200
 Why do you 

520
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,280
 You no blood 

521
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,120
 You can not hear 

522
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,840
 illiterate 

523
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,000
 Your income is low 

524
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
 I will try to fight 

525
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,040
 But you have to prepare mentally 

526
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
 If you found 

527
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,440
 Lele's biological father and mother 

528
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,720
 You're no chance at all of 

529
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800

 She hoped that the aircraft can meet with you 

573
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,800

584
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,640

 You took me to retrieve it 

588
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,960
 Like Tarzan 

589
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,160

593
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,840

 You put yourself into a 

610
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,880
 Intractable dilemma inside 

611
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,960

00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,920
 Away from me 

613
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,160
 You're Lele biological mother 

614
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,560
 She will leave no stone unturned 

615
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
 Jean-Marc forever 

616
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,440
 Not able to close Lele 

617
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,000
 You must not give up 

618
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,240
 She is now the only way to rely on 

619
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,200
 It is for you 

620
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,520

 I really hard to imagine 

623
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,400
 Her five years 

624
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
 Over what kind of day 

625
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,360
 may 

626
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
 For Lele speaking 

627
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,760
 If you can 

628
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
 Back to her real mother there 

629
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,000

630
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
