00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:07,819
This film is an adaptation of the journal, written by
Alain Marécaux in detention and published by Flammarion in 2005

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,839
Your civil status?

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,639
Alain Marécaux...

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,479
Born 27 May 1964,

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,839
at Linselles, Northern France.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,879
Profession?

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,319
Bailiff.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,599
Your marital status?

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,759
Married to Edith Vauchelle,

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,399
three children.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,559
How was your family life?

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,559
Good, it was...

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,999
my reason for living.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,719
Only problem was...

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,719
I worked too much.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,639
I wasn't home enough.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,279
How was your work?

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,519
Fine.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,079
I really liked my job,

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,919
my team,

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,319
the application of the verdicts,

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,679
in respect for the law
and the parties.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,639
I felt I was being of use.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,359
I was proud to be
an agent of justice.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,399
What do you do in prison?

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,999
I try to read, but it's hard.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,519
I watch TV.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,999
I smoke.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,719
I lie on the bed and I wait...

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,639
I wait for it to pass.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,119
The toughest part...

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,159
is having gone
from twelve-hour days,

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,999
to doing nothing at all...

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,399
and not seeing my wife and kids.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,959
I've not heard the word "dad"
for 2 months.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,439
PRESUMED GUILTY

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,439
What's going on?

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,879
Visitors.

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,399
I'll go see.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,079
- What's up?
- Mr Marécaux?

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,839
- Yes, why?
- Captain Dury.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,439
You're under arrest.
We'll now search the house.

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,839
What?
Have you letters rogatory?

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,119
Fabrice Burgaud,
investigating magistrate.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,919
You could show your card.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,879
So what am I accused of?

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,999
You and your wife are accused
of raping under-15s.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,839
What? That's outrageous!

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,159
Stay here, madam.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Let go of her!

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Let go of me!

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,439
- Easy on!
- Get off me!

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Calm down!

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,999
Or I'll cuff and floor you.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,079
Let me.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Wake up.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,079
What's going on?
Mom!

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,279
We're the police.

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,479
Who are they?

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,479
- I'm here, darling.
- What's going on?

61
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,879
Hurry up.

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,479
Stay!

63
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,679
Be right back.

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,719
- Madam, keep your distance.
- What?

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,479
Just ask him to get dressed.

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Not taking the diskettes?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,279
- They're blank.
- Seize them anyway.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,599
What'd we have to do with rape?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,079
It makes no sense,
must be a mistake.

70
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,679
What's in there?

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,959
No idea, never looked.

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,879
Open it!

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Sign here.

74
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,999
- Well?
- Nothing.

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
And here.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Come back here!

77
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,559
Let go!
At least let me reassure her.

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Easy, pet.

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,719
I love you...

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,559
Don't worry, it's a mistake.
It'll all work out.

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,399
I love you pet, I love you!

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,679
Let's go.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,799
I want to talk to my lawyer.

84
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,799
Later, for now you come with me.

85
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,519
I found this.

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,719
Wow, hot stuff.
Is this yours?

87
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,239
No, it's my wife's...

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Don't piss me about.

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
It's yours.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,199
No, she got it as a joke
for her sister's wedding.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,359
To give her a bunch of photos
of naked men.

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,999
But it was too crude.
Forgot it was there.

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,559
Sure it's not for showing to kids?

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,119
That's sick! For what?

95
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,519
Found this!

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Stashed in the wardrobe.

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,199
Now we're talking!
What's on here?

98
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,399
I don't know, ask her!
It's her wardrobe.

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
Where is she?
Where are my kids?

100
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,439
Let's have a look.
Here!

101
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,119
Christophe Dugarry with a shot...

102
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,479
What a goal!

103
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,399
What do I do with him?

104
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,799
Put him outside.

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,879
I can't, there's no fence.

106
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,079
Can I call my parents
to fetch him?

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,359
You call no one.

108
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,159
Better give him food and water.

109
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,239
It can wait till tonight.

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,359
It might take you a bit longer.

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Let's go.

112
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,759
Know these people?

113
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,879
Think not, but I can check.

114
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,519
Apart from Thierry Delay,
for a welfare case...

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,079
the others, no.

116
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,959
May I know exactly why I'm here?

117
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,039
Know these people?

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
No.

119
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
But earlier,

120
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,119
you said you knew Thierry Delay.

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,679
No, I said
I served two writs on him.

122
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,039
My office handles over 6,000 a year.

123
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,999
And his wife, Myriam Badaoui?

124
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,719
- Neither.
- And the two below,

125
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,839
David Delplanque,
Aurélie Grenon?

126
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,679
They say you and your wife
raped their children,

127
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,279
since the winter of '99.

128
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Are you crazy!

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,039
That you sodomized them,

130
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,319
had them perform oral sex.

131
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,479
That's nonsense!

132
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
That you came on to them
with animals

133
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,679
on a farm in Belgium,
filming them

134
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,319
to feed a paedophile ring!

135
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,639
To accuse us of such monstrosities,

136
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
it must be a mistake!

137
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,359
And they don't ring any bells?

138
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,359
I think number 1

139
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,919
is a school buddy
of my kid son Sébastien.

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,559
He said he and his brothers
came to your house...

141
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,999
That you made advances...

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,679
Come on, that's rubbish!

143
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,199
- Think we arrest on a whim!
- We have proof!

144
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,359
You stand accused by four people.

145
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,759
So you'll talk.

146
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,719
Right now!
You filthy bastard!

147
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,279
Child raper!

148
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,039
Alain Marécaux.

149
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
This way.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,359
Get undressed.

151
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,439
Undress!

152
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,399
Your ring, watch...

153
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,719
And your belt.

154
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,879
Over there.

155
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
Remove your laces.

156
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,759
Your socks.

157
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,839
Face the wall, drop your shorts.

158
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Face the wall.

159
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,799
Remove your shorts!

160
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Hurry up!

161
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,519
Hunker down and cough hard.

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,159
Okay, get dressed.

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Door!

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,799
Stop here.

165
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Marécaux Alain.

166
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,919
Edith!

167
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Let's go!

168
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Edith!

169
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,479
Be brave, my love!

170
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,079
It's a mistake, it'll work out.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,519
I love you.

172
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Quiet!

173
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,439
Go sit down.

174
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Sit down!

175
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,439
Good day, Mr Marécaux.

176
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
So?

177
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,279
- Still won't confess?
- Of course not.

178
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,039
I'm totally innocent.

179
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,599
In that case,
I'm extending custody.

180
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
A pity you persist in denying...

181
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,639
after what your son Sébastien
just told us.

182
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,279
My son? What did he say?

183
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,159
Let's go.

184
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,839
- What did he say?
- This way.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,559
I want to see him!

186
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,359
How were things with your wife?

187
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,439
We'd argued in recent years.

188
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,519
She said I worked too much,

189
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,919
not caring for her and the kids.

190
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,919
But of late we were rebuilding.

191
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,239
How often did you have sex?

192
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,479
- I don't have to answer that.
- No discussion, just answer.

193
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,519
When did you last make love?

194
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,079
Answer.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Monday.

196
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,719
Marécaux, we know you're homosexual.

197
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,519
What?

198
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,199
You lied.
That gay mag was yours.

199
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,439
Not at all.

200
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,359
I explained.
And it was in my wife's wardrobe.

201
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,879
And the gay porn links
on your computer?

202
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,919
But everyone used that computer.

203
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,359
Just come clean!

204
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,279
As you're a fag,
your wife needed sex with kids!

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,719
Your reasoning is totally warped.

206
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,719
You had sex
with your wife on Monday,

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,239
but without penetration.

208
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,119
She was indisposed.

209
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,079
A mere detail for a sodomizer
like you, no?

210
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,839
Admit you're a fag!

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,239
Can't you quit that?

212
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,639
Not till you admit

213
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,359
that at least you have tendencies,
goddammit!

214
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,559
We have proof!

215
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,519
Okay, maybe I visited a site or two!
Happy now?

216
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,439
At last!
We're getting somewhere.

217
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Alright?

218
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Hungry?

219
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,159
Want a cigarette?

220
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,239
Here, that's for you.

221
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,119
Listen, I see criminals and rapists
all day long.

222
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,199
I know you're not that kind.

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,159
You're just ill.

224
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,359
And we're here to help you.

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,519
So, here's what we'll do.

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,759
I'll take your statement...

227
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,479
and tonight your wife and kids
will sleep at home.

228
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,599
Well?

229
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,279
What do you say?

230
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,919
You can do that for them, no?

231
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,039
Great.

232
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,319
You won't regret it.

233
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm listening.

234
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,679
I want to talk to my wife first.

235
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,079
You can't see anyone.

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,919
But you'll see her later, I promise.

237
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,839
Now, go ahead.

238
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,519
I'll say nothing
until I've spoken with her.

239
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Goddammit!

240
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,959
Don't come crying
when you've got twenty years!

241
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,919
Hello, Mr Marécaux.
Hubert Delarue, barrister.

242
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,359
Your lawyer, Mrs Thérin,
asked me to defend you.

243
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,759
Hello, sir.
Thank you for coming.

244
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,719
Here, this'll do you good.

245
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,319
Thank you.

246
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,999
So?

247
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,439
How was custody? Tough?

248
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
A nightmare.

249
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,399
Any news of my family?

250
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,639
No, but I'll find out.

251
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,239
So far I've only read
the police transcripts.

252
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,639
Seems like one hell of an affair.

253
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,079
I don't understand anything.

254
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,239
People I don't even know accusing me

255
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,959
of doing things to their children
that I wouldn't dare repeat.

256
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
And what's more,

257
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,799
it seems my son said stuff too,
but I don't know what.

258
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,439
Come now, Mr Marécaux,
you're no longer alone.

259
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,239
Nothing actually happened?

260
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,199
Of course not!

261
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,959
Then rest assured,
I'll free you.

262
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,799
Good day, please be seated.

263
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,519
So...

264
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,319
as investigating magistrate
in charge of the case

265
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,439
the State prosecutor
has asked me to indict you

266
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,719
for having committed, at Outreau,
by violence or threat,

267
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,519
acts of sexual penetration
on children Delay and Delplanque

268
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,759
and sexual interference
on your son, Sébastien,

269
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,559
qualified as rape and molestation
of under-15s and punishable by law.

270
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,719
Sir, any comment?

271
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,879
Given the absence of proof
and my client's denial

272
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,999
I feel the case is too weak
to warrant indictment.

273
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,319
Presumption of innocence
should apply

274
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,919
at this stage of the procedure.

275
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I disagree.

276
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,839
I hereby indict you

277
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,159
pending referral
to the custodial judge.

278
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,279
That's all for now, Mr Marécaux.

279
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,239
Hello, Mr Prosecutor.

280
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,119
Mr Marécaux.

281
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,599
It's not looking good.

282
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,239
Your wife and four others
are being held for the same affair.

283
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,359
Let's go see the judge.

284
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,519
Given the gravity of the accusations
and apparent proof,

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,279
investigations required
to ascertain the truth,

286
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,599
the need to safeguard
the evidence

287
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,599
and the disturbance
of public order

288
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,519
whereby children live in fear
of their aggressors,

289
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,319
I ask for Mr Marécaux
to be remanded in custody.

290
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,399
Mr Marécaux, anything to say?

291
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,159
I'm living a nightmare.

292
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,959
I'm innocent.

293
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,639
You're totally mistaken.

294
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,519
Committing
a huge miscarriage of justice.

295
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,799
At the Prosecutor's request,
I hereby remand you in custody

296
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,559
at Beauvais prison.

297
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,679
My client is presumed innocent,

298
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,479
as there is as yet
no material proof of his guilt,

299
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,959
conditional freedom should prevail
over detention.

300
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,199
Nothing warrants such a decision.

301
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,719
Whatever you do,

302
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,479
in jail, mention
neither your profession

303
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,319
nor the alleged crime.

304
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,439
Rest assured, I'll appeal
this decision immediately.

305
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,679
Good day.

306
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,319
This is Mr Marécaux.

307
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,319
- Thank you.
- His kit.

308
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,839
Have a good day.

309
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Hello.

310
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,919
I'm not allowed to.

311
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,319
Offenders like you
are very much at risk here,

312
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,959
but I guess you know that?

313
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,799
So for safety, stay in your cell.

314
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,439
Right profile.

315
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,679
Higher...

316
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,719
A bit more...

317
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,839
Now, eyes straight ahead.

318
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
Let's go.

319
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,239
Stop.

320
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,839
Go ahead.

321
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,919
Where's Riton?

322
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,199
Visiting room.

323
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
And his things?

324
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
There.

325
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,519
The criminals vanished aboard
a second car but without their loot.

326
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,599
A seeming case
of domestic paedophilia

327
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,039
has taken a more serious turn.

328
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,319
In Outreau,

329
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,039
six children were abused
and twelve adults are being held.

330
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,399
This report from Erwan Marsiac
and Bastien Sartis.

331
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,919
At 8:30 this morning

332
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,679
a cortege of unmarked cars
arrives at Boulogne courthouse.

333
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,799
Leading the investigation
is Judge Burgaud.

334
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,039
Poverty and debt

335
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,399
drove this Outreau family
to sell its young children for sex.

336
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,239
See how many they are?

337
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,759
They were raped
by local shopkeepers,

338
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,599
and gradually the ring
of abuse widened

339
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,879
to include a bailiff
from a neighbouring district

340
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,719
his wife and a priest.

341
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,239
A Boulogne taxi-driver
even drove them to Belgium

342
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,079
for the shooting
of a paedophile video...

343
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Sure you're alright?

344
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,399
Other arrests may be made
in coming days...

345
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,719
The alleged murderer of little
Caroline Dickinson

346
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,359
is being extradited from the US...

347
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,119
Workshop.

348
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,799
I'm still eating.

349
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,279
Move it.

350
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,879
A bit of space.

351
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,079
I'm sick of that workshop.

352
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,919
So? Any news of my family?

353
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Hello, Alain.

354
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,799
It's a sordid affair.

355
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,999
Two couples
who raped their own children.

356
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,239
Apart from Delay,
who denies it all,

357
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,119
the other three are accusing
others of taking part

358
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,599
in their orgies
including you and your wife.

359
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,439
But there's no material evidence

360
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
only allegations

361
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,279
which under scrutiny turn out
to be random and contradictory.

362
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,119
And Sébastien, what did he say?

363
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,039
The questions posed by the police

364
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,679
were very suggestive,
very insidious, like:

365
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,799
"Did your mom or dad ever touch
your willy or bottom in play?"

366
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,839
What you never say to a kid.

367
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,239
So they got him to say
ambiguous stuff like...

368
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,439
that you'd lie on him,
your willy against his leg,

369
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,919
at times it was hard...

370
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,399
I don't believe it.

371
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,799
Yet the very same day

372
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,279
they sent him to hospital

373
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,599
where the doctors declared
he was perfectly fine

374
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,279
and showed no signs at all
of sexual interference.

375
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,399
But even if he was led on,
why did he say that?

376
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,039
I don't know...

377
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,519
Unless he was influenced
by little Jimmy,

378
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,039
the most traumatized
of Delay's sons,

379
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,919
who inundated the school with tales
of a highly sexual nature.

380
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,079
Who knows what he told your son?

381
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,119
How do you explain the gay magazine
wrapped in a Playmobil catalogue?

382
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,159
I told you already,

383
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,959
my wife bought it
as a joke on her sister.

384
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,359
No relation
to your homosexual tendencies?

385
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,719
I don't have homosexual tendencies.

386
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,279
You admitted you did.

387
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,639
I never said that.

388
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,719
Under police pressure
and in all honesty

389
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,999
I admitted to visiting a site
or two, but that's all.

390
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,079
Your son Sébastien spoke
of a game you played,

391
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,199
"The kissing machine".
Can you explain?

392
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,279
What was this game, Mr Marécaux?

393
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,959
You chase, catch
and kiss all over.

394
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,559
With no ambiguity,
despite what you imply.

395
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,399
Your son also said you touched
his willy in your wife's absence

396
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,959
and that he felt your penis
was hard.

397
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,399
Any comment?

398
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
I don't know.

399
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,999
I can't understand why.

400
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,919
Your Honour, the police questioning
was strongly suggestive.

401
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,799
That same day, Sébastien
made no complaint to the doctor

402
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,279
specialized in child rape testimony.

403
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,199
That's all you have to say?

404
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
I dunno...

405
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,559
I worked a lot,
barely saw my kids

406
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,199
so on Sunday mornings
we'd tussle on the bed.

407
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,279
I may have rubbed up against him
and he misinterpreted it.

408
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
In what way?

409
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,199
I'm just trying to understand
why he said that!

410
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,119
My kids are my whole life,
why'd I sully them?

411
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,439
I'd have to be mad!

412
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,199
How come Jimmy Delay declared
that you sexually abused him?

413
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,839
How come?
I don't even know the kid!

414
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,479
He's my son's friend,
we barely spoke.

415
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,079
Under police questioning,

416
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,159
Jimmy accuses my client,
but photo-identifies someone else.

417
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,439
Yet he recognized the room

418
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,839
where you and your wife
made advances?

419
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,919
Impossible,
he never came to our house.

420
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,999
He also says his brothers were there
during the alleged rape,

421
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,679
yet they denied it
and couldn't ID the house.

422
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,039
Sir, I'll take your remarks later.

423
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,879
How do you explain Badaoui,
Grenon and Delplanque's claim that

424
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,919
you sodomized their children
in various ways

425
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,439
and had them fellate you?

426
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,639
According to the adults,
all the children were raped,

427
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,479
yet five, except Jimmy Delay,
deny it. It doesn't hold up.

428
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,679
Stop interrupting, Sir,
and let me question.

429
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,959
Why would these people
incriminate you

430
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,519
admitting their own involvement

431
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,879
if it does not undo
their responsibility?

432
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,479
Hell, why must I explain?

433
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,199
Maybe they mistook me?

434
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,919
Wanted revenge on me as a bailiff?

435
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,519
Or maybe it's a frame-up?

436
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,319
Of which your son is part?

437
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,719
Sir, over to you.

438
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,319
Have you seen Edith and the kids?

439
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,759
Edith is coping well.

440
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,439
The kids are with host families.

441
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,879
They're fine, they send their love.

442
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,119
- Why not with their grandparents?
- The judges refused.

443
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,199
To protect them
from influence by family

444
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,599
over critical
of the investigating magistrate.

445
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,479
But we've appealed.

446
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,079
I'm sorry...

447
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,159
How are Mom and Dad?

448
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,479
They're okay.

449
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,999
It was tough at first, but...

450
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,959
They're bearing up.

451
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,879
And you, my brother,
how are you faring?

452
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,279
You look exhausted.

453
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,679
I'm totally innocent.

454
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,279
You believe me?

455
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
Of course.

456
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,079
Everyone believes you.

457
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,959
What did I do
for Sébastien to say that?

458
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,199
I wasn't caring enough?

459
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,159
Or I cuddled him too much?

460
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,119
I just don't know...

461
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,839
Lord,

462
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,639
I know I'm not here through
God's justice, but that of men.

463
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,839
Yet I beg you,

464
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,279
help me,

465
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,119
protect my wife and children

466
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,079
and help that young judge

467
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,319
to have little common sense
and lucidity.

468
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,159
Remove his handcuffs.

469
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,519
The first time he came
with an inspector, as I owed money.

470
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,399
They noted the furniture and left.

471
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,199
He returned alone that afternoon

472
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,919
and I found it odd that a bailiff
should joke with my husband.

473
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,039
He came back that night.

474
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,079
David, Aurélie and their kids
were there too.

475
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,799
It was tough,
because the kids didn't want to.

476
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,799
I had to beat them
for them to obey.

477
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,479
They raped them.

478
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,919
Penetration and oral sex.

479
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,239
Exactly when and where?

480
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,079
In early 2000.

481
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,039
Three times at home
and twice in Belgium.

482
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,359
How was he dressed?

483
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,039
Grey pants,

484
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,319
a blue shirt

485
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,799
and a khaki jacket.

486
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,119
Miss Grenon, you declared that

487
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,879
Mr Marécaux sodomized the children
with his penis, a dildo

488
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,359
and had fellatio.

489
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,359
Do you confirm this?

490
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,559
Sure.

491
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,519
Where, when and how many times
did he rape them?

492
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Twice,

493
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,519
at Mr and Mrs Delay's,
in '98, when I used to see them.

494
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,319
What was he wearing?

495
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,119
Both times,

496
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,679
he wore a dark suit,
but I can't recall what colour.

497
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,119
Mr Marécaux, as Miss Grenon's
testimony confirms Mrs Badaoui's

498
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,719
what do have to say?

499
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,799
Are you kidding?
They disagree.

500
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,679
On both clothing and dates.

501
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,279
Mrs Badaoui says 2000,

502
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,479
while this lady says 1998.

503
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,919
Miss Grenon says it took place
in 1998 and you in 2000.

504
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,479
Can you be more exact?

505
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,239
I must give precise dates?

506
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,279
Yes, be as precise as possible,
Mrs Badaoui.

507
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,079
Well, it took place both in '98
and in 2000.

508
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,639
Twice in '98,

509
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,199
once in 2000 at home

510
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,839
and twice in 2000 in Belgium.

511
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,919
Madam, you first said my client
raped the children in 2000

512
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,239
and having heard Miss Grenon
you now say '98 and 2000.

513
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,239
Can you explain
this discrepancy?

514
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,719
I made a mistake.

515
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,359
He came once in '98,
when nothing happened,

516
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,479
and later, twice for sex.

517
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,399
Can you date
these events of '98 exactly?

518
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,599
I can't recall,
but I know your game.

519
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,399
You want me to catch myself out.

520
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,599
Where's that mad woman going?

521
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,999
She admits raping her kids
and heads off home?

522
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,959
So to be with my family,
I must say I'm a child raper!

523
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,159
Don't be silly,
this is all so pathetic and surreal

524
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,159
it simply won't hold up.

525
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,359
Yet I'm still here?

526
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,999
I'll immediately request
your liberation and face offs.

527
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,199
Chin up, you'll be home
for Christmas.

528
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,479
Marécaux, you leave in one hour.

529
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,719
You sure lost weight.

530
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,399
So I hear you're a hunter?

531
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,559
Not at all, why do you ask?

532
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,799
Where are we going?

533
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,879
Your place, for your khaki jacket.

534
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,559
Madam, please!

535
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,879
Any news of the kids?

536
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,439
Thessy said they're fine.
And you?

537
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,279
I wrote, but no reply.
Did you get my letters?

538
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,799
No, and mine?

539
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Please, that'll do.

540
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,679
You look worn out.
Hang in there, okay?

541
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,999
Sure, don't worry.

542
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,799
We'll be out for Christmas.

543
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,519
What are you looking for?

544
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,359
Prints from the Delay kids.

545
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,879
We told you, never came here.

546
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,879
Forget it, they'll find nothing.

547
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,839
Enough, now shut it you two.

548
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,799
That's my kids' stuff!

549
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,199
The Delays identified it.

550
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Ridiculous.

551
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,919
They say it's theirs.

552
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,079
But they were never here.

553
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,359
They're making the whole thing up.

554
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,799
Okay, that's enough.
Let's go.

555
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,439
My darling wife...

556
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,919
our life has changed dramatically,
but this day was one of joy.

557
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,639
What a delight to see you,

558
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,199
to touch, embrace and smell you...

559
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,199
I felt happy for a moment.

560
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,359
I hadn't felt us
this close in years.

561
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,879
I found you so beautiful, so strong.

562
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,199
I was so proud of you.

563
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,159
I always thought
I was the strongest, but no.

564
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
I love you.

565
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,719
Marécaux, visiting room.

566
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,639
- No news from the Clerk's Office?
- No.

567
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,959
You're sure?

568
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,919
Yeah, but I'll check later.

569
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,799
- Hello, Mr Chairman.
- Alain...

570
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,079
This comes as a surprise.

571
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,239
Your sister let me have
her visiting slot.

572
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,519
I'd like to assure you of my fullest
support and solidarity.

573
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,479
Thank you.

574
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,079
So?

575
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,479
How are things at the office?

576
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,599
I wrote all your clients to explain

577
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,239
that your incarceration is temporary

578
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,559
and that you remain
presumed innocent.

579
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,279
I'm glad you did that.

580
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,239
We feel it's now...

581
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,279
but a matter of days.

582
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,439
Good, I'm delighted.

583
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,879
Yet there is one thing...

584
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,999
Excuse my directness,
but your image has been tarnished

585
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,079
and even if you do get out soon,

586
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,159
perhaps you shouldn't rejoin
the firm.

587
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,199
But I'll be totally exonerated.

588
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,479
Yes, I know, but after what happened

589
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,039
I feel you and your family
should leave the region.

590
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,559
To go where?
I was born here, my family's here!

591
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm sorry.

592
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,519
You're right.

593
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,199
You'll need to sell your practice.

594
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,959
I shopped around
and I got a few offers.

595
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,759
But you know it's worth far more.

596
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,359
The last is not too bad.

597
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,519
The longer you wait
the more value it'll lose.

598
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,239
But of course, it's your decision.

599
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,159
What matter,
compared to this hellhole!

600
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,479
Your resignation...

601
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,519
You must sign that too.

602
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Hunker down.

603
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Cough.

604
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,719
Turn around.

605
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,359
Drop your shorts.

606
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Cough.

607
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Okay.

608
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,199
Drop your shorts.

609
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
Hunker down.

610
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Cough.

611
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,279
Marécaux, a notification.

612
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,839
DOUAI APPEAL COURT

613
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,199
My sweet, my wonderful love,

614
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,159
all five letters,
they moved me so.

615
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,359
God or no god, I'll never forgive

616
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,639
their taking my loved ones.

617
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,879
I was against having more kids.

618
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,719
Now I think it'd be a good thing.

619
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,079
Keep this news in mind.
May it strengthen you.

620
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I miss your warmth.

621
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,799
Dear Dad, I'm writing
to give you some news.

622
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,399
First, I was in the same family
as Sébastien,

623
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,119
but from bawling him out
for what he said, they changed me.

624
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,719
We all still meet...

625
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,399
Hi Dad, I really miss you.

626
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,159
I'm writing to say I love you.

627
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,999
My auntie is very nice,
and I call Thomas and Cécile.

628
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,839
School is good too...

629
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,319
Dear Daddy,
I'd really love to see you.

630
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,719
I think of you, I miss you.

631
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,639
I'll send you loads of letters
and drawings?

632
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,959
Lots of hugs and kisses, Daddy.

633
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:09,199
Happy New Year!

634
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,719
Happy New Year...

635
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,039
What are you doing here?

636
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,559
What's wrong?

637
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,839
What is it?

638
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,240
Mom is dead.

639
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,719
What happened?

640
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,559
Since your arrest,

641
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,519
she'd stopped speaking,

642
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,879
she'd stopped eating,

643
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,879
she cried all the time.

644
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,359
She was waiting for you.

645
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,959
Time to go now.

646
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,959
My brother...

647
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,999
Mr Marécaux, please...

648
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,960
Alain!

649
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,719
Are you alright, Mr Marécaux?

650
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Alain...

651
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,279
Alright, sir?

652
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,720
Alain?

653
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,999
Want to postpone the questioning?

654
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,079
Your civil status?

655
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,639
Alain Marécaux...

656
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,479
Born 27 May 1964,
at Linselles, Northern France.

657
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,799
Father's name?

658
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,799
Léon Marécaux.

659
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,079
Date of birth?

660
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,519
He was born in 1925...

661
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,359
Can't recall the date.

662
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Profession?

663
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,199
Retired teacher.

664
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,639
Mother's name?

665
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,359
Reine Wyart.

666
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,679
Born in 1927.

667
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,279
Profession?

668
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,039
I'm sorry...

669
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,479
I was just told of her death.

670
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,879
Yes, I know.
But what was her job?

671
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,159
She was a shopkeeper.

672
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,839
Two chilling new revelations
in the Outreau affair

673
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,279
say that a six-year old girl

674
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,519
was beaten to death
after being raped by two people.

675
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,079
Claims which, sadly, seem credible.

676
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,359
This report...

677
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,039
After an early evening break,
the police resumed their dig

678
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,319
in this garden in Outreau,
Pas de Dalais,

679
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,359
in their search
for the body of a little girl

680
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,719
murdered in 1999

681
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,439
after having been raped.

682
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,639
Corroborated by a woman accused
of selling her own children for sex,

683
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,439
she led the investigators

684
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,319
to the spot
where the child may be buried.

685
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,999
Nothing is taking its normal course.

686
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,399
Impossible to contact the judge.

687
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,999
I still don't have all the elements.

688
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,719
Others accused by Badaoui and family
haven't even been questioned.

689
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,039
As for her murder claim,
it's total lunacy.

690
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,519
Yet it feeds into Burgaud's frenzy.

691
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,599
He'll end up digging in your garden!

692
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,399
But as he never finds any proof
the balloon must surely burst.

693
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,199
I think you're in depression.

694
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,879
You feel responsible
for your mother's death.

695
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,759
We must end this distress,

696
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,479
so I suggest a stay
in a psychiatric hospital.

697
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,519
No, I refuse, I'm not mad.

698
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,159
I didn't say you were,
but you've had a major shock

699
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,719
that you need help to cope with.

700
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,319
Don't let the word "psychiatry"
daunt you.

701
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,919
Sure...

702
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,279
You want to commit me,
but all is well.

703
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,959
I've no place in an asylum.

704
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,639
Even less than in jail.

705
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,359
Your head will be shaven

706
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,359
They'll put you in chains

707
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,919
Your back will be broken

708
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,319
And I'll die of pain...

709
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,839
I didn't kill

710
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,199
I didn't steal

711
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,799
But my mother I didn't believe

712
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,879
And I recall she loved me well

713
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,079
As I labour without reprieve

714
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,599
So, how do you feel?

715
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,399
Better... Much better, doctor.

716
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,199
Only, the judge is against
your being here

717
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,799
due to risks of outside influence.

718
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,919
I can't go back there, I'd die.

719
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,319
I can ask to have you sent
to the medical unit in Amiens.

720
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,399
It's a new facility specially
equipped for people like you

721
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,999
with adapted treatment.

722
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,479
Go ahead.

723
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,119
Excuse me.

724
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,319
Yeah?

725
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,119
- Got any medicines?
- Depends what you're after.

726
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,319
Tranxene, Xanax, Prozac...

727
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Theralene,

728
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,199
Anaphraline and Stilnox.

729
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,959
Should have Stilnox
later in the week.

730
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,239
I'm interested.

731
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,199
Your hairdresser said
you made an appointment

732
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,279
on 24 February 2001 at 12 noon

733
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,599
- unusual for you -
and that you asked for:

734
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,359
"A change of look".

735
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,559
Why did you make this appointment?

736
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,159
I don't know.

737
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,479
I guess my hair was too long,
and so what?

738
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,879
Delay and Badaoui
were arrested on 20 February 2001

739
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,839
and you dash to the hairdresser's
on the 24th to change your look.

740
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,399
How do you explain this coincidence?

741
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,279
Not coincidence, chance.

742
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,399
I guess the 24th was a Wednesday,
so I was near my hairdresser's

743
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,239
and I needed a haircut.

744
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,719
You knew the Delays
had been arrested?

745
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,639
I didn't even know them!

746
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,759
So why did you shave your beard
in June 2001?

747
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,920
Sorry?

748
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,279
I've never been clean shaven.

749
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,719
Then why did people say

750
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,359
you'd shaved and cut your hair
if not to change your look?

751
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,159
Hell, I don't know!
Shaving irritates my skin.

752
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,279
I'll ask you one last time.

753
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,599
Why, at the very moment
your name figured in this case,

754
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,199
did you cut your hair and shave
if not to avoid recognition?

755
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,919
I told you,
I never shaved my beard.

756
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,639
Ask my colleagues, my friends,

757
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,239
the Prosecutor, whoever,
I've always been bearded.

758
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,679
Why insist, Your Honour?

759
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,519
He told you three times he never
shaved his beard, next question!

760
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,239
That's my decision, Sir.
I didn't ask you to speak.

761
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
Fine.

762
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,039
Charlotte Vilanelle,
neighbour of your beach house

763
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,839
declared that
on the night of 27/28 July 2001

764
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,119
noise of children and adults
could be heard.

765
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,679
Can you explain?

766
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,039
It's a place where we entertain
and that we often lend.

767
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,039
Have you ever slept
with children there?

768
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,799
Never. There's one room for the kids
and another for us.

769
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,679
So how come Mrs Vilanelle

770
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,959
heard you spend the night
with children

771
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,759
and say: "Pyjama's on!"

772
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,919
What is this? A bad joke?
So what if I did?

773
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,599
What are you trying to prove
with such tattle?

774
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,199
Mom...

775
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,399
I know you're there, I beg you...

776
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,319
I cannot bear the pain.

777
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,839
Help me to be with you.

778
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,839
Help me.

779
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,519
Come on now.

780
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,599
You can do it, sir.

781
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,999
Can you hear me, sir?

782
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,999
Alain?

783
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,639
Can you hear me?

784
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,439
Can you hear me?
I have good news, Alain.

785
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,599
Your wife
has been released on probation

786
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,159
and Burgaud transferred to Paris.

787
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,479
We'll ask for new face-offs

788
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,959
and re-appeal your detention.

789
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,680
Guard!

790
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,999
Yeah, what's up?

791
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,479
Should be a release order for me.
Can you go see?

792
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,719
The office is closed now.
No outs before tomorrow.

793
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,679
Here, for you.

794
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,999
Raise your arms.

795
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,439
Okay.

796
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,039
Raise your arms.

797
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,159
Okay.

798
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,599
Thomas was being very difficult
and dragging Sébastien down too.

799
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,639
The grandparents
couldn't handle him,

800
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,359
so I tried taking him,
but to no avail.

801
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,759
He won't get out of bed,

802
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,999
won't go to school, runs away.

803
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,239
He saw his mom one weekend,
it was a disaster.

804
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,759
So the family judge decided
to place him in a home

805
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,719
and he agrees.

806
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,959
He suffers for you.

807
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,279
Constantly asks to see you.

808
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,479
But the judges refuse

809
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,519
for fear you use him
to pressure his kid brother.

810
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,680
And Edith?

811
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,399
Any news?

812
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,679
I've had no letters since she's out.

813
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,719
Edith has cut all contact with us.

814
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,999
It appears she's met someone.

815
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,879
And just so you know,

816
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,839
your in-laws haven't exactly
redeemed your image

817
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,479
in the children's eyes.

818
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,799
Visiting time's over.
Finish up.

819
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,839
You have to sign
for the sale of the house.

820
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,199
I got the money
for the practice.

821
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,359
Enough to pay you later
and keep the bank at bay.

822
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,479
Chin up, my boy.

823
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,879
Keep the faith.
Delarue has appealed anew.

824
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,839
Dear Mr President,

825
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,199
I wish to inform you of my dreadful
ordeal of the past 20 months

826
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,239
and my intention to die in prison
by going on hunger strike...

827
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,199
Dear Minister of Justice,

828
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,639
I wish to inform you of my dreadful
ordeal of the past 20 months...

829
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,879
Dear Chairman of the Senate,

830
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,119
I wish to inform you
of my dreadful ordeal...

831
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,439
Dear mayor,

832
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,639
I wish to inform you
of my dreadful ordeal...

833
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,079
Dear Mr Prime Minister,

834
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,479
I write to you as a last resort,

835
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,039
that my distress be heard
and my innocence recognized.

836
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,079
You are Alain Marécaux,

837
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,999
number 251266A?

838
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:50,759
Yes.

839
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,439
It's my duty to summon you here,
as you've begun a hunger strike.

840
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,719
Are you continuing it?

841
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,919
That makes one more.

842
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,119
Goodbye, sir.

843
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,399
11.5, a bit low Mr Marécaux.

844
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,999
A deep breath.

845
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,520
Ready.

846
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,119
There you go.
You may get dressed.

847
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,920
Mr Marécaux!

848
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,679
Are you okay?

849
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,959
Sit yourself down.

850
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,719
How do you feel?

851
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,239
I'm okay.

852
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,599
Like a glass of water?

853
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,679
It's not too hot?

854
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,760
I'm numb.

855
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,560
And there?

856
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,880
Get the doctor.

857
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,679
Feel anything?

858
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,719
We warned you, Mr Marécaux.

859
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,519
You risk losing
the use of your legs.

860
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,199
Your ordeal is an outrage.

861
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,759
I've appealed anew,

862
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,039
but the judge is dragging his heels.

863
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,839
So I wrote to the Minister
of Justice holding him responsible.

864
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,599
I beg you, Alain,
you must stop this.

865
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,159
You must hold out
till the Assize hearing.

866
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,879
I promise we'll win.

867
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,479
Can you hear me, Mr Marécaux?

868
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,439
Do you have children?

869
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,839
What ages are they?

870
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,639
You don't remember?

871
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,200
And their names?

872
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,919
Mr Marécaux, you've been freed.

873
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,960
Wake up.

874
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,079
The ambulance is on its way.

875
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,199
Come, Mr Marécaux, you'll be treated
in a special hospital.

876
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,039
Up you get, nice and easy.

877
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,519
That's right.

878
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,559
- Is this okay?
- Thank you.

879
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,599
Mr Marécaux,

880
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,479
be a nice chap and eat something.

881
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,639
It's got no taste.

882
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,759
It's normal, taste and smell
take months to recover.

883
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,879
You'll be
on probation till the trial.

884
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,119
You can neither see your kids

885
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,439
nor leave Haute-Saone
where your niece agreed to host you.

886
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,039
They prefer that an alleged
paedophile live

887
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,679
with three young children

888
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,159
than at his father's.

889
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,439
Where?

890
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,199
Blackcurrant?

891
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,279
No, redcurrants!

892
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,319
The phone's ringing!

893
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,999
We'll pick other fruit.

894
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,079
Off you go.

895
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,760
Hello?

896
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,160
Yes, fine.

897
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,959
Soon time for their bath.

898
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,439
Sure... No bother at all.

899
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,839
Have fun.

900
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,199
Well, I never!

901
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Hello?

902
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,760
It's me...

903
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,959
Alain.

904
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,079
Am I disturbing?

905
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,360
No...

906
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,799
Are you okay?

907
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,279
Fine... And you?

908
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,879
I'm okay.

909
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,239
Do you see the kids? Are they well?

910
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,279
I saw them today at my Parents'.

911
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,079
They were good.

912
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,799
They said you'd written
and they'll answer soon.

913
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,079
Why are you doing this, Edith?

914
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,919
It's over, Alain. It's too late.

915
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,639
I no longer love you.

916
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,839
Hello, pet.

917
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,199
I want custody
of Cécile and Sébastien.

918
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,519
- And Thomas?
- No.

919
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,039
I can't handle him.

920
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,919
He's increasingly tough
and disobedient.

921
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,399
Wait!

922
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,239
I'll go get him.

923
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,359
Mr Marécaux?

924
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,679
And you?

925
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,279
Forbidden, for now,
from looking after them,

926
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,119
I must agree.

927
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,679
But I'd like visiting rights.

928
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,439
They're still highly traumatized

929
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,879
so I'd prefer visiting rights later,
when they're better.

930
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,559
I tend to agree.

931
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,559
And Thomas, unfortunately,

932
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,959
is an unruly child

933
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,719
needing special care.

934
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,999
I see no other solution
but to leave him in the home.

935
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,279
I disagree.
True, Thomas isn't easy.

936
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,839
But when I left him
he was a top student.

937
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,079
Today, he's out of school,
drifting from home to home,

938
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,559
drinking, smoking,
attempting suicide.

939
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,239
All because of you judges!

940
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,159
My kids needed love and care

941
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,599
not to be treated like misfits
and given to strangers.

942
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,279
All rise!

943
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,719
The court is now in session.

944
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,599
And all the others you accused
during the inquiry

945
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,239
but not investigated by
Judge Burgaud, are they guilty too?

946
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,039
For example, Gilles Bertrand?

947
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,039
Don't know him.

948
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,959
Yet you claimed
he drove your children to Belgium.

949
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,639
Problem is, he's handicapped.

950
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,639
He can't walk unaided,
he can't even drive!

951
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,439
Maybe I mistook him.

952
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,160
And...

953
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,199
Dr Marielle, remember?

954
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,599
You accused him too.

955
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,759
He's different.
I accused him out of revenge.

956
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,520
For what?

957
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,599
One day he hurt my son.

958
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,279
How? While examining him?

959
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
Yes.

960
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,599
So you lied?
He never raped your children.

961
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,039
True, I lied for him.

962
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,800
But only him.

963
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,119
But if you lied for those two,
Mrs Badaoui,

964
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,559
what proves you're not lying
for the 13 others here present?

965
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,439
Don't shun responsibility
by implicating innocent people.

966
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,799
Weigh your words carefully.

967
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,719
Those accused
risk 20 years in prison!

968
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,839
All the accused here present,

969
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,719
they all did something.

970
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,039
The hearing will resume at 2 pm.

971
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,359
Mind what you say.

972
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,759
I hope you get 20 years,
you sick bitch!

973
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,199
Child rape is vile!

974
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,919
Like accusing innocent people!

975
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,799
Look me in the eye!
I can say I'm clean!

976
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,559
Hello, Jimmy. Are you well?

977
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,159
Recognize these people?

978
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,680
Jimmy?

979
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,959
Do you recognize any of them?

980
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Yes.

981
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,479
They all raped me.

982
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,679
So you went to the Marécaux's?

983
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,599
Yes.

984
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,999
And what happened?

985
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,719
They made advances.

986
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,439
And who else was there?

987
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,919
Can you show me?

988
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,079
Sandrine Lavier was there?

989
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,559
No, she did nothing.
She was nice.

990
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,279
Yet you accused her too?

991
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,999
I made a mistake.

992
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,719
So, who else was there?

993
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,399
- Alain Marécaux?
- Yes.

994
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,879
He was there.

995
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,239
Can you point him out?

996
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,200
Well?

997
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,559
You don't recognize this man
whom you accused for 3 years?

998
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,839
I thought he was a lawyer.

999
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,959
Roselyne Godard was there!

1000
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,759
I saw her kill her husband
with a spade!

1001
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,799
I'd ask you to stop
this police interrogation!

1002
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,119
You insinuate he's a liar,
when he's a victim!

1003
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,279
We have many questions for Jimmy,

1004
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,919
given that he's accused
over fifty people!

1005
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,439
Including, here present,

1006
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,039
13 men and women
jailed for 3 years

1007
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,639
mainly on the basis
of his testimony!

1008
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,719
Your Honour, Mrs Badaoui
has important revelations

1009
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,279
to make to the court.

1010
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,599
Then let's hear her.

1011
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,559
I don't know how you'll take it,
but I have to say it.

1012
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,399
Roselyne, you did nothing.

1013
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,840
Sorry.

1014
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,159
Mr Godard, neither did you.

1015
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,599
Sorry.

1016
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,639
Karine, you did nothing, sorry.

1017
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,679
Mr and Mrs Marécaux,

1018
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,319
I don't even know you.

1019
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,199
You did nothing.

1020
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,200
Sorry.

1021
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,319
David Brunet,

1022
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,559
Thierry,

1023
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,720
Pierrot,

1024
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,399
Sandrine and Franck,
you did nothing either.

1025
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,359
Sorry.

1026
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,239
I'm sick,

1027
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,319
I'm a liar...

1028
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,079
But I didn't want my boys
to be called liars

1029
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,959
so I backed what they said
from the start.

1030
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,479
I lied about everything.

1031
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,039
Only four of us raped the kids,
from beginning to end.

1032
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,159
Me,

1033
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,439
my husband,

1034
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,039
Aurélie Grenon and David Delplanque.

1035
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,839
That's what I had to say.

1036
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,479
Your Honour, if I may?

1037
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,639
Mrs Badaoui,

1038
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,199
If you didn't know the Marécaux's,
how did you come to accuse them?

1039
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,399
The judge told me the kids
mentioned a bailiff.

1040
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,639
I had debts

1041
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,799
that bailiffs Lambert and Pascal
were dealing with.

1042
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,679
So I gave their names.

1043
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,599
But the judge said:
"No, another."

1044
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,719
"Think hard."

1045
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,199
But as I didn't know any others,
I asked him:

1046
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,999
"What kind of name is it?"

1047
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,519
And he said: "The children
gave the name of Marécaux."

1048
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,319
"And children don't lie."

1049
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,799
So I confirmed it.

1050
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,959
But that's not how it's noted!

1051
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,519
Well, that's how it happened.

1052
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,919
Yet you photo-identified them?

1053
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,239
Easy, their names were written.

1054
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,239
Well,
I propose we adjourn for today.

1055
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,919
We can't stop there!

1056
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,879
I have jurors here
with trains to catch.

1057
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,240
I demand that

1058
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,439
the court acknowledge
what's just been said!

1059
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,519
It can wait until tomorrow.

1060
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,319
Adjourned till 9 tomorrow morning.

1061
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,679
Mr Burgaud!

1062
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,039
Like to comment?

1063
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,279
Any comment?

1064
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,839
Are you aware of the new
developments in this case?

1065
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,799
I did hear about

1066
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,719
Mrs Badaoui's clearing of
the 13 accused and her retraction.

1067
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,999
And does this beg
any questions for you?

1068
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,639
I came here to explain
my methodology of investigation

1069
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,959
with no certainty
but a critical eye.

1070
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,439
As for new elements,
I've no comment.

1071
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,199
So what material proof did you find

1072
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,519
of this paedophile ring,
by way of DNA tests,

1073
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,879
phone-taps, investigations
and searches in France and Belgium?

1074
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,959
Admittedly, nothing very conclusive.

1075
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,039
So "methodology" and "critical eye",
but no proof?

1076
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,519
Due to media coverage
elements were doubtless destroyed.

1077
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,399
Your naivety is staggering!

1078
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,519
For you, all was in order.

1079
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,879
Weekly, Mrs Badaoui and her children

1080
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,719
were making
ever crazier allegations.

1081
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:22,159
The Belgian police found no farm,
crime, but no corpse...

1082
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,679
Didn't it ring a bell?
Of doubt?

1083
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,159
The Belgian inquiry proved
fruitless, yet it was just one lead.

1084
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,639
But behind it all are human beings,

1085
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,279
broken lives.

1086
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,439
My client repeatedly
attempted suicide,

1087
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,279
his mother died.

1088
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,079
A 14th accused person died
in jail of depression and pills.

1089
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,599
How do you feel about that?

1090
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,839
Our job is not emotion.

1091
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,239
It is to analyse a dossier,
a purely technical task.

1092
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,919
My decisions were vetted
by the examining chamber

1093
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,959
and if they ratified them,
it's not for me to say.

1094
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,679
But you are also human.

1095
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,479
So kindly leave the judge aside.

1096
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,879
I'm addressing you
on behalf of these men and women.

1097
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,079
Look at them.

1098
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,199
Look at them!

1099
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,599
No need to, I know them already.

1100
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,959
But with no proof
you don't let people rot in prison!

1101
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,119
Was that technical too?

1102
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,319
Fear pervaded this case.

1103
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,519
Each time, detention was referred
to the custodial judge.

1104
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,399
So you have no qualms.

1105
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,399
You repeatedly hide
behind other judges.

1106
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,839
You regret nothing in the disastrous
way you led this investigation?

1107
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,319
No further questions, Your Honour.

1108
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,239
As for those remanded in custody,

1109
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,079
it does beg certain questions.

1110
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,239
And rightly so.

1111
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,319
And I bow
to those unjustly implicated,

1112
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,639
who deserve our compassion.

1113
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,039
Yet what is indisputable
in this case,

1114
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,479
which Judge Burgaud's
thorough investigation

1115
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,279
has all too clearly demonstrated,

1116
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,639
is the suffering of these children,

1117
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,439
the existence of a murky coalition

1118
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:42,319
of certain people tacitly profiting
from their prostitution...

1119
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,119
The devious behaviour
of certain parents

1120
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,039
with regard to their own children.

1121
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,639
We denounce an unprecedented
collapse of the law, firstly

1122
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,519
the incompetence of a young judge

1123
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,279
who investigated solely
upon accusation,

1124
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,919
but also of all those bodies
meant to supervise him,

1125
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,119
starting with the State Prosecutor,

1126
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,440
you yourself,

1127
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,599
as judge and part,

1128
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,319
whose apparent reason for being here

1129
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,159
is to save the institution
of the law by ensuring

1130
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,639
that this trial does not end
with 13 acquittals!

1131
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,319
The Assize Court
hereby returns its verdict.

1132
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
The court and jury,

1133
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,759
having deliberated
for each of the accused, sentences

1134
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,359
for rape, sexual molestation

1135
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,519
and corruption of minors,

1136
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,639
Thierry Delay, please rise,

1137
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,879
to 20 years' imprisonment...

1138
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,679
Myriam Badaoui,

1139
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,199
15 years' imprisonment...

1140
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,999
David Delplanque,

1141
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,719
6 years imprisonment...

1142
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,879
Aurélie Grenon,

1143
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,119
4 years' imprisonment...

1144
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,239
Dominique Weil,

1145
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,839
7 years' imprisonment...

1146
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,959
But I'm innocent!

1147
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,879
Franck Lavier,

1148
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,599
6 years' imprisonment...

1149
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,199
We didn't do anything!

1150
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,360
Some justice!

1151
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,719
Thierry Dausque,

1152
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,439
4 years' Imprisonment...

1153
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,639
Like the liars said,
they did nothing!

1154
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,800
Silence in court!

1155
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,759
Daniel Legrand junior,

1156
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,799
3 years' imprisonment...

1157
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,399
I don't even know them!

1158
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,959
For sexual molestation of his son,

1159
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,719
Alain Marécaux,
an 18-month suspended sentence...

1160
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:05,079
Sandrine Lavier,
a 3-year suspended sentence.

1161
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,199
The Assize Court hearing
is hereby adjourned.

1162
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,999
Well done!

1163
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,319
I'd have preferred 20 years
for Jimmy

1164
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,319
than 18 months suspended for my son.

1165
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,439
We'll appeal, Alain.

1166
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,280
But I'm flat broke.

1167
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,679
Don't worry.

1168
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,759
Mr Marécaux,
would you care to comment?

1169
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,720
Mr Marécaux!

1170
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,719
No, Mr Marécaux!

1171
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,119
Mr Marécaux, stay with us.

1172
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,039
What's going on?

1173
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,759
You attempted suicide.

1174
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,679
You were in a coma for two days,
but it's okay now.

1175
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,799
I suggest you apply for the status
of handicapped adult

1176
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,119
entitling you to a small allowance

1177
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,399
and a therapeutic apartment

1178
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:39,319
with home treatment and care.

1179
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,919
What do you think?

1180
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,760
The Appeal Court finally acquitted

1181
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,879
Alain Marécaux and the 5 remaining
defendants on 1 December 2005

1182
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,999
triggering the greatest French
legal scandal in living memory

1183
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,999
The Supreme Judicial Council
acknowledged blatant negligence

1184
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,319
by Judge Burgaud

1185
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,119
and imposed a reprimand upon him
on 29 April 2009

1186
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,639
No other judges were sanctioned

1187
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:00,279
Alain Marécaux resumed his functions
as bailiff on 14 March 2007

1188
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,999
All rise!

1189
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,999
The hearing is now in session,
you may be seated.

1190
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,399
This morning, the swearing in
of ministerial officers.

1191
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,519
Please, step forward.

1192
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,559
In the absence of the Prosecutor,
Deputy Prosecutor, you may sum up.

1193
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,119
Thank you, Your Honour.

1194
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,359
By order of the Ministry of Justice,
6 February 2007,

1195
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,559
Mr Alain Marécaux
was appointed bailiff.

1196
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:45,719
May it now please the court
to receive and register his oath.

1197
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,719
Bailiff Marécaux,
kindly raise your right hand.

1198
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,359
Do you swear to fulfil
your functions with probity

1199
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,799
and honour
all their incumbent duties?

1200
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,839
I swear.

1201
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,559
