1
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,002
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

2
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,297
- Good night, officer.
- Good night, sir.

3
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:00,775
(Screams)

4
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,392
(Woman) Evening, dear.

5
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,935
(Horse and carriage passing by)

6
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,604
(Driver) Whoa, whoa.

7
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,607
(Carriage stops)

8
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:09,923
Thank you.

9
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:18,723
He's so charming and elegant.
He has such wonderful taste.

10
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,267
Yes, he has,
when it comes to models.

11
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,399
Now I shan't be seeing you again.

12
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:31,736
Of course you will.
Just because the statue is finished

13
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:34,989
that is not a reason
why things shouldn't stay as they are.

14
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:37,492
But I shan't be posing for you anymore.

15
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:41,287
Surely we are past the stage
where we need an excuse to meet.

16
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,873
We have but what about other people?

17
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:47,585
Have you...
Are you going to tell them about us?

18
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,463
Let's not think of other people, hm?

19
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,674
Let's think of ourselves.

20
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,517
Excuse me a moment.

21
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,441
Janine.

22
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:12,652
This is a surprise indeed.

23
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:16,239
- How are you, Georges?
- I'm fine.

24
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,408
And you look wonderful.

25
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,659
Thank you.

26
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,413
Oh, Georges,
this is Dr Pierre Gerard.

27
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,456
- Georges Bonner.
- How do you do?

28
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,125
How do you do?

29
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,255
- Janine, it's getting late.
- Oh, no, we've plenty oftime.

30
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,382
Pierre and I are on our way
to the theatre.

31
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:39,137
I heard you had a reception here tonight
so I asked him to bring me along first.

32
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,305
I'm glad you did.

33
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:44,100
I was just about to show a few friends
my latest sculpture.

34
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:45,310
Please.

35
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,941
Georges.

36
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,152
This isn't my statue
you're unveiling, is it?

37
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:55,278
No.

38
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,823
Did you ever start it?

39
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,410
No, I'm afraid
I left the sketches in Italy.

40
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,579
Shall we go?

41
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:07,874
I'm glad Mademoiselle Dubois
brought you along, Doctor.

42
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,170
Oh, thank you. I've always wanted
to see the inside ofyour place, Bonner.

43
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:15,298
- It has quite a reputation.
- A good one, I trust.

44
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:19,302
Very. Tell me, how many patients
can you accommodate at one time?

45
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,637
Oh, not more than 15.

46
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:23,348
I have the house next to this one,
which I use as the clinic.

47
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,266
There is room for more

48
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:28,102
but I find that the patients I get

49
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,856
require a great deal
of individual attention.

50
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:34,234
- Difficult cases?
- Difficult people.

51
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,446
Their money gives them an overblown
sense oftheir own importance.

52
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:42,659
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yes, I'm sure you have.

53
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:47,121
But now I think
it really is time that we...

54
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,873
(Clears throat) Excuse me.

55
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,502
- Well?
- No sign of him, sir.

56
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:56,464
I waited till all the passengers were gone.
He just wasn't there.

57
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,217
- What time is the next train?
- In about six hours, sir.

58
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,137
All right.

59
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,764
Make sure you meet it.

60
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,974
Yes, sir.

61
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,484
I am extremely sorry
to have kept you waiting.

62
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,195
I would like to say at this stage

63
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,447
that any credit due
for what you are about to see

64
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,951
should be laid at the feet
of my charming young model.

65
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:30,248
An artist cannot form
a thing of beauty

66
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:34,419
unless he has a thing of beauty
from which to draw his inspiration.

67
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,048
And now there is
nothing else for me to do

68
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:42,260
except to throw myself
on your mercy.

69
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,764
- (Man) A most wonderful likeness.
- (Woman) Yes, isn't it?

70
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,975
Oh, Dr Bonner.

71
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,476
But it's...

72
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,854
- It's...
- A very fine piece of work, Bonner.

73
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,481
- Thank you very much.
- It's extremely beautiful.

74
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,193
You wouldn't be interested
in selling it, I suppose?

75
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,362
You can see I still have to cast it.

76
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:04,490
Anyway, sculpting is something I do
for my own pleasure.

77
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,285
Having not yet reached
the perfection I seek,

78
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:10,246
I find it quite impossible
to give up the completed work,

79
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:12,123
so I'll keep it.

80
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,667
- Oh? Where?
- Oh, not here.

81
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:18,338
Somewhere I can go occasionally
to look at it and...

82
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,882
be reminded
of my beautiful young model.

83
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,182
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.

84
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,559
It's just that I think
we ought to go, Pierre.

85
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:35,313
- Would you mind getting my cloak?
- Yes, of course.

86
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:38,816
Erm...a remarkably fine sculptor,
Bonner, don't you think?

87
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:41,235
Yes, very fine.

88
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,613
I wanted to buy it
but he wasn't interested.

89
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,240
Says he always keeps his stuff
when he's finished.

90
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,867
- Really?
- Yes.

91
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:53,122
I wonder where...
Hello! What's this?

92
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:56,167
I thought there'd be
something else here somewhere.

93
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:59,670
Mm, a torso. Oh, yes!

94
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:04,300
Oh, yes, a very beautiful woman
she must have...

95
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,806
Terribly sorry.

96
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,351
Very clumsy of me.

97
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,645
Your cloak, Janine.

98
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:20,066
Thank you, Pierre.

99
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,984
You are leaving?

100
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,946
We are already late
for the theatre.

101
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,448
I hope you have
a very pleasant evening.

102
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,744
Yes? What is it, Roger?

103
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,080
It's half past six, sir.

104
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,499
Already? Are you sure?

105
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,919
- Yes, sir. I've checked with two clocks.
- My watch says ten past.

106
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,381
It must be slow, sir.
The time is definitely half past six.

107
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,052
I need a new watch.
I need absolute accuracy.

108
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,018
Goodbye.

109
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,397
I am afraid I must ask you
to leave now.

110
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,651
You all know that my main duty
is the care of my patients.

111
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:06,988
Their needs must come
before everything else.

112
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:11,075
I would like to thank you all
for coming here

113
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,035
and...

114
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,288
and I must apologise
if I seem rude

115
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,207
by bringing this party to so...

116
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,376
to so sudden a close.

117
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,421
Strange fellow, Bonner.

118
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,632
Did you know him well
when you were in Italy?

119
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,177
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

120
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:32,138
It was just that he didn't seem
too anxious to see you again.

121
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:36,267
Yes, it did seem that way, didn't it?

122
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,563
Well, apparently
it doesn't worry you very much.

123
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:42,398
No.

124
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:43,774
No, it doesn't.

125
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,821
Oh, it was beautiful, Dr Bonner,
but beautiful.

126
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,573
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.

127
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,993
Ifyou change your mind about selling
any ofyour stuff, do let me know.

128
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,537
Good night. It has been my pleasure,
I assure you.

129
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,132
What time is it?

130
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:12,053
- It's a quarter to seven, sir.
- Thank you.

131
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:16,766
Tell Roger, if he has any news for me
when he gets back from meeting the train

132
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,226
he can come and wake me.

133
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,436
- Whatever the time is.
- Very good, sir.

134
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,438
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

135
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:19,954
(Gasps)

136
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:24,458
- I thought you had gone.
- I want to talk to you.

137
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:27,587
- Nobody knows I'm here.
- I'm sorry but you must go.

138
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,422
But I must talk to you, Georges.

139
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,841
Not now, later.

140
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,051
- I'm very busy.
- Not later, now.

141
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:36,637
I want to know
what's going to happen to us, Georges.

142
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:39,307
Look, Margo, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

143
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,434
It's Janine Dubois, isn't it?

144
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,604
You're in love with her.

145
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,148
- Please leave.
- I'm not leaving.

146
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,692
Ifyou think you can just forget me
you're mistaken.

147
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:51,277
I won't let you.

148
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,403
You can't!

149
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,615
You know I love you.

150
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,825
You made me tell it to you
time and time again.

151
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,493
You made me humiliate myself.

152
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,413
I'm not going to step aside
so you can be with someone else.

153
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,250
Get out. Get out!

154
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,794
Your eyes.

155
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,796
What's the matter with your eyes?

156
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:18,554
All right, Georges.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

157
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,264
Georges?

158
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,018
- I'm sorry.
- Too late.

159
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:31,984
Too late.

160
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,018
Margo.

161
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,480
I tried to make you go.

162
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,316
I tried...

163
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,651
very hard.

164
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:01,782
(Knock at door)

165
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,118
Wait a moment.

166
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:07,872
Yes?

167
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,543
Hello, Georges.

168
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,505
I saw the statue last night.

169
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,760
Why did you lie to me?

170
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,430
Why didn't you want me to know
that you'd started work on it?

171
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,141
Why did you start work on it?

172
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,185
I like to finish what I start.

173
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:31,896
Oh. Is that why you ran away
from me in Italy?

174
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:34,231
Is that what you call
finishing what you start?

175
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,817
My holiday was over.
I came back to work.

176
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:38,652
- So suddenly?
- Yes, so suddenly.

177
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,906
There was a case.

178
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:43,616
It was urgent.

179
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,119
I waited for you to come back to me.
I waited for you to write to me.

180
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:50,164
Then I realised that if I ever wanted
to see you again

181
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,416
I had to be the one
to make the first move.

182
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,128
Why? Why are you so afraid
of loving me, Georges?

183
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,842
I watched you towards the end
ofthe holiday in Italy

184
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,929
and you were like a man
heading towards something

185
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:07,014
which he wanted to avoid.

186
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:10,726
I began to think that I'd won

187
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:14,271
and that you were going to admit
to yourselfthat you really loved me.

188
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,274
Was I right?

189
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,989
All right, Janine.
I did fall in love with you in Italy.

190
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:27,326
This could not be so I left.

191
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:29,495
- Why couldn't it be?
- It just couldn't.

192
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,998
- But you knew how I felt about you?
- Yes, I knew.

193
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,961
And you still ran away from it.

194
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:43,217
I'm not going to give up
so easily, Georges.

195
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:45,678
Oh, tell me
you don't want me to give up.

196
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,138
No, I don't...

197
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:53,310
Oh, I knew I was right.

198
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,526
May I see your statue again?

199
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:02,778
Yes.

200
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,989
Yes, of course.

201
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:08,409
It's very lovely.

202
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:12,454
It's you who are lovely.

203
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,335
I only copied.

204
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,088
Is it finished?

205
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,923
Nearly.

206
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,136
Would you like to pose for me again?

207
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,054
When?

208
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,017
Now.

209
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,835
You still haven't accepted
that we love each other.

210
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,587
Yes, I have.

211
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,089
But it doesn't make you happy.

212
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,842
That's because it doesn't alter things.

213
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:09,261
- What things?
- Oh, the...

214
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,597
the impossibility ofthe situation.

215
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,806
(Knock at door)

216
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,225
Come in.

217
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:19,229
The gentleman's downstairs, sir.

218
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:20,564
Ludwig!

219
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,485
Oh, please excuse me, Janine.

220
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:27,154
I have been waiting so long
for Ludwig to arrive.

221
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,697
You'll understand.

222
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:38,332
Ludwig!

223
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,419
Let me... look at you.

224
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,964
Oh...it is so good to see you.

225
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,800
That's good. You look wonderful.

226
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,178
Just the same. I was worried.

227
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,514
- Worried?
- Because I am late.

228
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:57,476
I... I knew you...
you wouldn't let me down.

229
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,604
You have found the ultimate answer.
Is that it?

230
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,023
Oh, we'll talk about that later, Ludwig.

231
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:06,652
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Yes, of course, our little ceremony.

232
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,488
I haven't been too well.

233
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,991
It has affected my memory also, I think.

234
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,035
Ah, you have not forgotten
how to live.

235
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,162
What is the point
of what one is doing

236
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,873
ifyou don't enjoy life,
what it offers?

237
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,917
What is the point, as you say?

238
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:25,504
The...

239
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,047
The usual toast.

240
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,927
- Ludwig, your hand.
- Oh, yes, my hand.

241
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:35,180
- Let me have a look at it.
- No, it's not necessary.

242
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,851
I had a stroke.
That is why I was not here sooner.

243
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,062
It has left me with this legacy.

244
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:46,483
- Why didn't you let me know?
- I was frightened to.

245
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:49,778
I hoped you would have found
the answer by now.

246
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:52,489
- You have not found it, Georges?
- No.

247
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,534
No, I haven't found the answer.

248
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,164
The operation is still necessary.

249
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,168
I cannot do it.

250
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:08,964
- With your left hand.
- No.

251
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,426
We must find someone else.

252
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,473
- But that is not possible.
- Well, try.

253
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,060
We always knew
if we didn't find the ultimate solution

254
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,646
there would have to be
another surgeon someday.

255
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:28,150
- The stroke might have killed me.
- But it didn't.

256
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,236
Three weeks I have been waiting,
Ludwig.

257
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:32,738
Three weeks!

258
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,700
I have been taking this fluid
every six hours now.

259
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:38,994
Six?

260
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:41,914
It is what keeps me alive.

261
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,292
So you see, you must operate.

262
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:50,172
You...you know
what will happen ifyou don't.

263
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:53,217
Yes, I know. You will die.

264
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:58,972
You're old. You can see
death staring you in the face.

265
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,559
But I can't... I'm not going to die.

266
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:06,146
Then you must find someone else

267
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:08,524
to do the operation.

268
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:13,737
But who?

269
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,031
Who can we get?

270
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,575
We need a young surgeon, that's all.

271
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,410
Just a surgeon.

272
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:22,663
We tell him just enough to satisfy him

273
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,125
and I'll be with him
all the time he's doing the operation.

274
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,503
That's the best way, Georges.

275
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:33,340
For the first time I'll be with him
to show him what to do.

276
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:37,636
Next time,
ifyou still need the operation,

277
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,429
I shan't be here.

278
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,974
I'll be dead.

279
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,143
Find someone else? Huh.

280
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,978
It's easy to say.

281
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:50,524
- There is so little time.
- You are a doctor.

282
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,403
You must have met other doctors,
someone who will do it.

283
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:56,321
(Knock at door, door opens)

284
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:58,782
Mademoiselle Dubois is leaving, sir.

285
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:01,827
Janine.

286
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,415
I'm terribly sorry, Janine.

287
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,751
Let me introduce you
to my oldest and dearest friend,

288
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,044
Ludwig Weiss.

289
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:13,755
Ludwig, this is
Mademoiselle Janine Dubois.

290
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:16,258
It is delightful to meet you, my dear.

291
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:17,968
How do you do, Professor?

292
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:20,721
I'm sure that you have a lot
to talk to the professor about

293
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,890
so I'll say goodbye.

294
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,559
- Goodbye, my dear.
- I'll see you at dinner.

295
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:30,814
Janine, why not bring
Gerard along this evening?

296
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,441
- Pierre?
- Yes.

297
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,068
Yes, tell him Professor Weiss
of Vienna is here.

298
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:37,446
I'm sure he would love to meet him.

299
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,950
I thought we were going
to be on our own tonight.

300
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,703
Ludwig is here only for a few days.

301
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,580
We'll have so much time together.

302
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:50,375
Oh, Georges, you don't know
what it means to me

303
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,919
to see you again.

304
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,172
It means everything to me.

305
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,607
This Monsieur Pierre,
is he a doctor?

306
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,275
Even better, a surgeon.

307
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:19,321
And...do you think he'll do it?

308
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,367
If he's convinced that you give
the operation your blessing,

309
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:24,493
then he'll do it.

310
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,746
Why should he be influenced
by what I do?

311
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,835
Ludwig... Ludwig, you're still the same.

312
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,797
You just cannot accept the fact
that you are a great man.

313
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:40,050
One ofthe greatest in your own field.

314
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,552
There is no medical man in the world

315
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,597
who would miss the chance
of meeting you,

316
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:48,517
let alone work with you.

317
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:53,939
Half of what makes up this reputation
belongs to you, more than half.

318
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:56,358
You and I know that.

319
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,027
No one else does.

320
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:00,404
Listen, Georges.

321
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,198
Why not tell them?

322
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:06,368
Publish our findings.

323
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:13,709
Please, Ludwig, allow me
to decide when to publish.

324
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,378
Probably you are right.

325
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:18,964
You have invested more in this
than I have.

326
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:22,134
Yes, indeed.

327
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,385
Nevertheless,

328
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:27,514
I probably shan't be here
to see the consequences.

329
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,684
I am tired, Georges.

330
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,562
As you said just now,

331
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:38,525
I can see death staring me in the face.

332
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,486
I'm sorry, Ludwig.

333
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,780
Believe me,
I didn't mean it that way.

334
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,658
Strange, getting old.

335
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:50,579
One suddenly has no future
to look forward to

336
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:54,583
and is forced to look back and...

337
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,585
survey the past.

338
00:24:57,253 --> 00:25:01,089
Do you remember our original toast,

339
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:05,427
the first time we knew
we had succeeded?

340
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:07,304
Of course I do.

341
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,306
Say it.

342
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,435
- For humanity.
- That's right.

343
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:15,020
For humanity.

344
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,606
Not for me, not for you, Georges,
but for all.

345
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:20,192
I know what it means.

346
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,693
Do you, Georges?

347
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:25,155
Sometimes I wonder a little.

348
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:29,284
You have changed so much
since we have started.

349
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,744
That is hardly surprising.

350
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:35,457
I'm talking about our original ideas,

351
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:38,460
bright, shining ideas,

352
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:41,963
full of hope for a brave new world.

353
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,508
What happened to them?

354
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:47,302
Where did they get lost?

355
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:48,970
Why...

356
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:51,723
Why do you say they are lost?

357
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,892
I think they are.

358
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:58,355
The years have brought me
an added insight

359
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:01,858
that enables me
to see more clearly

360
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:04,027
- the fact...
- Wait a minute, Ludwig.

361
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,032
You are forgetting something,
aren't you?

362
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:11,910
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

363
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:14,996
- Do you still have that photograph?
- Photo...photograph?

364
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,833
- Our photograph.
- Ah, yes, of course.

365
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,418
- Give it to me.
- Mm...

366
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:32,013
Look at it, Ludwig.

367
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,851
And what do you see there?

368
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,062
I see the two of us.

369
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:41,898
- As we were at the beginning.
- Exactly.

370
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,484
So, remember,

371
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,195
when you talk ofthis wisdom

372
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:50,407
and this insight
that old age has brought to you,

373
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:56,329
remember I too have
this wisdom and this insight.

374
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,957
- How old are you?
- 89.

375
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,167
89.

376
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:02,169
Have another look.

377
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,796
Let it remind you,

378
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:10,469
while you have the wisdom
that comes with a life of 89 years,

379
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:13,680
I have that

380
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,475
which comes with a life of...

381
00:27:17,894 --> 00:27:19,102
104.

382
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:28,236
Yes, sir, I know
what you're saying is possible

383
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:30,530
but it's not proven.

384
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:31,698
(Chuckles)

385
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,158
Proven!

386
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:37,496
If we doctors waited
until something is proven

387
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,498
before we moved,

388
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,625
there'd be no patients left.

389
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:43,418
They'd all be dead.

390
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,631
Look, I have seen it done
in three different ways,

391
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:50,425
none ofthem completely effective.

392
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:53,595
- The first is to make an ingress through...
- Ludwig.

393
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:56,431
Just a moment, Georges.
An ingress through...

394
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:59,017
Ludwig, why not take Dr Gerard
down to the study?

395
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,686
- It will be so much easier down there.
- Yes, of course.

396
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:04,523
Come on. Come on, Dr Gerard.

397
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:07,692
- You'll excuse us?
- Oh, of course they will.

398
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:09,027
Come on.

399
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:14,074
I'll get pencil and paper
to show you what I am talking about.

400
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,160
You know, the incision
must be made directly...

401
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:27,879
Pierre seems very interested
in your Professor Weiss.

402
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:30,215
Yes, I told you he would gladly come

403
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,343
once you mentioned
Professor Weiss of Vienna.

404
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:35,136
He's a wonderful old man.

405
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,013
Have you known him long?

406
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:38,932
All my life.

407
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:41,059
We...used to work together.

408
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,271
A long time ago.

409
00:28:45,606 --> 00:28:47,315
That makes you sound very old.

410
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,954
Janine, I can't tell you how much
it means to me to have you back.

411
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,332
I missed you so much.

412
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:08,211
You needn't have. You know that.

413
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:10,088
Yes.

414
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,966
Yes, I knew.

415
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:19,180
Georges, you still haven't told me

416
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,683
why you tried to avoid
falling in love with me.

417
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:28,064
You started telling me something
this morning but you never finished it.

418
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,774
Because I had to go away.

419
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:37,365
Because I have to go away again.

420
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:38,533
Go away? Where?

421
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,952
Where is not important.

422
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:45,707
What matters is that I shall have
to leave Paris very soon.

423
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,375
But you'll come back?

424
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,501
No.

425
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:50,295
Why?

426
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:52,922
I can't, that's all.

427
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,760
You can't just stand there and tell me
you're going away and never coming back

428
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,845
without giving me an explanation.

429
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,806
My work makes it necessary.

430
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,893
Because you're a doctor?

431
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:07,395
Yes, partly.

432
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:12,942
I have to travel
where no one has ever been before.

433
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,280
I want to lift the curtain of life
and see what lies beyond.

434
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,410
To do this it is necessary
for me to go away.

435
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,919
Is it necessary for you to go alone?

436
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:40,261
All right, you've convinced me
but it's not something I'd care to try.

437
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:44,683
Ah, you lack the spirit
ofthe pioneer, Dr Gerard.

438
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,812
Being a surgeon is a practical business.
It's necessary to make a living.

439
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,106
It doesn't leave much time for pioneering.

440
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:54,567
But ifyou had the opportunity
of becoming one ofthe pioneers

441
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:58,113
by performing one simple operation,

442
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,490
what would you say then, huh?

443
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:02,617
First I'd say that no operation is simple.

444
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:05,161
Then I'd want to know
what this operation involved.

445
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:10,625
If it were impossible to explain it,
ifyou were asked to leave it on trust?

446
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,962
Then I should have to say no.

447
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:16,673
Regardless of who was talking to you?

448
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:22,512
Professor Weiss,
when we started this conversation

449
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,182
I was under the impression
that we were speaking hypothetically.

450
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,059
Are we?

451
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:30,186
No.

452
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,190
We are not.

453
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,525
I see.

454
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:39,154
I suppose I should be annoyed
at this verbal subterfuge.

455
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,030
I don't know why I'm not, really.

456
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,827
Look, suppose you tell me just exactly
what it was you asked me here for.

457
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,377
See this?

458
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,966
My right hand.

459
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:04,721
The one I would have used
if I were going to operate.

460
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:09,476
I came here for one single reason.

461
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:13,563
To save the life of Georges Bonner.

462
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:15,356
- What?
- Yes.

463
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:22,572
By performing an operation
that only I know how to perform.

464
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:28,244
You see? I can't do it.

465
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,625
Therefore, I am asking you
to take my place.

466
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:38,004
This operation, Dr Weiss,

467
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,131
what exactly does it involve?

468
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:43,676
In spite of what you said,
this one is really simple.

469
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:47,639
It involves the removal
ofthe uter-parathyroid gland.

470
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:51,768
I thought you said
this was to save Bonner's life.

471
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:53,478
I haven't finished.

472
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,231
To remove the gland
and substitute an alternative.

473
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,149
An alternative? Why?

474
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:02,529
Is it necessary to know the reason
just to perform an operation?

475
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:06,574
Physically, no,
but morally, I think so.

476
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,411
Would you be prepared to leave
the protection ofyour morals

477
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:11,955
in my hands?

478
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:15,834
I...

479
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:18,837
I'm not sure.

480
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:22,382
Look at it this way.

481
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:30,139
I am asking you to perform
a very simple, straightforward operation

482
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,769
and I am guaranteeing to you

483
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:37,772
there can be no ill effects.

484
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:39,816
On the contrary,

485
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,902
unless this operation is done,

486
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:45,572
and very soon,

487
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,241
Georges Bonner...

488
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,995
will die.

489
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:56,207
I agree that the operation is simple.
I wouldn't exactly call it straightforward.

490
00:33:56,333 --> 00:34:00,169
- It's never been done before.
- Actually, I've done it myself many times.

491
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,630
- You've done it?
- Mm.

492
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:06,301
There are no moral
or legal aspects involved.

493
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:09,053
I suppose not,
as long as the patient is willing.

494
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,306
He is willing.

495
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,145
- You will be there yourself all the time?
- I will.

496
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,189
- And will you lend your name to this?
- Mm.

497
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:26,696
Very well, I'll do it.

498
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:28,239
Good.

499
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:29,949
Now, come on.

500
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:33,620
I'll show you what's to be done.

501
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,592
Thank you.

502
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,345
This is Georges Bonner's laboratory,

503
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,722
where we will do the operation.

504
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:55,558
Wouldn't it be better in a theatre
next door to the clinic?

505
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:57,518
No, no, it's better here.

506
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:01,147
We don't want people to know
the doctor is sick.

507
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:06,277
It's bad for the morale ofthe patients.
(Chuckles)

508
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:10,156
- That's a fine piece of work, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

509
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,788
Oh, Georges, I love you so much.

510
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,748
And I love you.

511
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,291
I've tried not to.

512
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,544
I've tried very hard.

513
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,922
Is it so bad
now you've given up the struggle?

514
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,676
I don't think I could have let you go.

515
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:31,844
I'm not going to let you, ever.

516
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:35,848
(Ludwig) Georges,
Dr Gerard must go now.

517
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:37,517
Yes, coming, Ludwig.

518
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,062
It's late.

519
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:44,524
I think you'd better let
Gerard take you home.

520
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,526
Whatever you say, Georges.

521
00:35:48,862 --> 00:35:50,989
It's been a very great honour
to meet you.

522
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,032
My colleagues will be most impressed.

523
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:57,412
Please, Dr Gerard, I must ask you
not to mention our meeting.

524
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:00,039
You see, I am old and tired.

525
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:02,375
Ifthe medical fraternity
knew I was here,

526
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:06,004
they would request lectures,
addressed meetings.

527
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,548
Oh, you understand of course.

528
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:10,550
As you wish.

529
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:14,512
I'm sorry about this, Bonner,
but I have to go back to the hospital.

530
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:17,432
- Thank you for coming.
- Not at all.

531
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:20,977
- Will you see me home first, Pierre?
- Yes, of course.

532
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:22,729
(Doorbell rings)

533
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,198
- Dr Bonner, please.
- Yes?

534
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,200
I am Inspector Legris ofthe Surete.

535
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:38,369
I wonder if I could have a word with you.

536
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,079
Of course, Inspector. Come in.

537
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:41,205
Thank you.

538
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,752
- Evening, Mademoiselle, Messieurs.
- (All) Evening.

539
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:48,087
- We were just on our way...
- I shan't be long.

540
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:49,589
Don't leave on my account.

541
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:52,175
Oh, we can wait a few more moments,
can't we, Pierre?

542
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,137
- Come into the study, Inspector.
- Thank you.

543
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,771
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

544
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,485
What can I do for you, Inspector?

545
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:12,612
Just a couple of questions, sir.
Routine.

546
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:15,073
Relating to what?

547
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,160
Relating to the apparent disappearance
of a young lady, one Margo Philippe.

548
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:23,831
Did you say Margo?

549
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:26,209
But that's impossible.

550
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:29,504
- You do know the young lady, then?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course I do.

551
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,381
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday.

552
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:35,802
I had a small reception here
and she was the guest of honour.

553
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:38,221
You...you met her here, didn't you?

554
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:41,432
Oh, yes, the young lady you modelled.

555
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:42,558
Yes.

556
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,936
Did you see her leave?

557
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:47,897
I think so.

558
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:50,441
Why, yes. Yes, I'm sure I did.

559
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,195
What's happened to her, Inspector?

560
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:57,782
Well, we don't know, sir.
She has just disappeared.

561
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,661
It seems the last time she was seen
was here at your reception.

562
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:06,290
But that's terrible.
What could have happened?

563
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,919
Quite a number ofthings
could have happened, Mademoiselle,

564
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:12,463
and it's up to me
to find out the one that did.

565
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:16,968
This statue you did of her,
could I see it?

566
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:21,139
- Why?
- I understand it's an excellent likeness.

567
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,182
As I have never seen the young lady

568
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:26,519
it would help me in my investigations
if I knew what she looked like.

569
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:27,645
I...

570
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:31,482
I'm afraid, Inspector,
I no longer have the statue.

571
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:33,025
But I just...

572
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:35,862
Yes, Monsieur?
You were going to say?

573
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:38,573
Nothing, nothing at all.
It doesn't matter.

574
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:42,910
Perhaps you can tell me
who does have it.

575
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:44,287
Nobody.

576
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:46,122
A stupid accident this morning.

577
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,541
It was broken.

578
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,626
I was touching up a section ofthe plinth

579
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:53,880
and I knocked the whole thing over.

580
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:57,133
I'm afraid it was smashed to pieces.

581
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:00,970
I see. Most unfortunate.

582
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,640
Well, thank you, Monsieur.
That will be all for the moment.

583
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:07,393
You will let me know
ifthere's any news?

584
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,103
- I'll let you know.
- Thank you.

585
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,816
- Good night, Inspector.
- Good night, sir.

586
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,408
- And thank you.
- Not at all.

587
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:33,377
- What could have happened to her?
- You know the statue is in the laboratory?

588
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:37,590
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- He only wanted to look at it.

589
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,635
He would have wanted
to take it away with him.

590
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:44,096
I know how the police mind works
and, I'm afraid, I know myself.

591
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:46,224
It's probably very silly of me but...

592
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,103
I simply cannot part with my sculptures.

593
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,398
I see your point.
Well, thank you for the dinner, Bonner.

594
00:39:58,612 --> 00:39:59,779
Janine.

595
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,197
Good night, Professor.

596
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:05,493
- Good night, Gerard.
- Good night.

597
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,125
- Well?
- He'll do it.

598
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,213
Oh, good.

599
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,467
What happened to the girl?

600
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:25,096
When is he going to operate?

601
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:30,309
It is me, Ludwig, who is talking to you,
not the policeman.

602
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:32,311
What happened to her?

603
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:34,230
What is the matter with you, Ludwig?

604
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:36,649
I will tell you what's the matter with me.

605
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:40,194
Ten years ago when I came
to London to do the operation

606
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,658
a girl you modelled just disappeared
and was never seen again.

607
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,911
Ten years before that

608
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:52,415
another ofyour models just disappeared.

609
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,710
Two could be a coincidence.

610
00:40:55,836 --> 00:40:57,253
Three cannot.

611
00:40:58,463 --> 00:41:00,214
What have you done to her?

612
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,970
You're very tired, Ludwig.
So am I. You should go to bed.

613
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,597
I'm not tired, I'm frightened.

614
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:11,434
Frightened for you,

615
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:13,602
what you might have done.

616
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:14,854
Good night, Ludwig.

617
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:20,401
- When is he going to operate?
- Tomorrow morning.

618
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:16,475
I thought I told you to go to bed.

619
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:22,773
Are you going to take
another dose ofthe fluid?

620
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,317
You'd better go to bed,

621
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:28,404
unless you want to see what happens
when the dose is overdue.

622
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:33,993
I have been examining the gland.

623
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:37,538
- What about it?
- You tell me.

624
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:39,206
What is the matter with it?

625
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:42,960
Oh, don't distress yourself.
It will do what is wanted of it.

626
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:46,130
- I am not referring to that.
- Then what are you referring to?

627
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,842
This gland is not like the others.

628
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:53,429
It was taken from a...

629
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,682
from a living body.

630
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:02,855
- You're talking nonsense, Ludwig.
- Don't tell me nonsense.

631
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:05,232
I am not such a senile old fool

632
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,529
that I have forgotten the difference
between a revitalised and a living organ.

633
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:13,782
This gland has been taken
from a living body.

634
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:16,535
All right, Ludwig.

635
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:20,164
As you say,

636
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,291
it was taken from a living body.

637
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:28,172
But it was because ofyou
that I had to do it.

638
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,133
Now it's my turn to say "nonsense".

639
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:34,178
You were due here three weeks ago.

640
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,430
As always, I had
a uter-parathyroid ready.

641
00:44:37,098 --> 00:44:40,684
As always, I had removed it
and revitalised it, but...

642
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:43,604
you didn't arrive.

643
00:44:44,105 --> 00:44:48,067
I managed to keep that gland
revitalised for four days.

644
00:44:48,193 --> 00:44:49,485
Then another one.

645
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:52,821
Four separate glands
I've removed and revitalised,

646
00:44:52,948 --> 00:44:57,284
only to have them die,
and still you didn't arrive.

647
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:00,704
I just...

648
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,123
I just couldn't get access...

649
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:06,126
to any more cadavers.

650
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:07,503
No.

651
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:11,507
Oh, no, this...
This was the only answer.

652
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:13,968
The answer for whom?

653
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:16,136
For you?

654
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:18,472
Or for the poor man
you have murdered?

655
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:22,142
But I'm sorry.
It was my fault, wasn't it?

656
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:24,186
You had to do it because of me.

657
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:26,605
No, Georges.

658
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,901
I can't see how this can be justified.

659
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:36,240
You would rather
I had not been able to get a gland at all.

660
00:45:37,742 --> 00:45:40,035
You would rather this was the end.

661
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:42,288
Is that what you would have liked?

662
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,331
Yes.

663
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,125
It is.

664
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:49,712
Knowing how it would happen
you still say that?

665
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:52,214
But I'm not afraid of death.

666
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,510
If I were,
I too could have remained young.

667
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:59,930
Do you remember how we talked about it
and you tried to persuade me?

668
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:04,101
But what is death
that it should be feared so much?

669
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:08,480
You don't know
what you're saying.

670
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:10,774
Of course I know what I am saying.

671
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,943
Why should the death
ofthe other man

672
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:16,697
be of less importance
than your own death?

673
00:46:16,823 --> 00:46:20,367
By what right can you decide
a thing like this?

674
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:22,745
This is a thing
that only God can decide.

675
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:25,039
Have you become God all of a sudden,

676
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:30,169
to judge that you are
more important than the other man?

677
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,551
Of course I'm more important.

678
00:46:37,677 --> 00:46:39,887
He was nothing, nothing at all.

679
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:41,055
A nonentity.

680
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,684
He had just as much right to life
as you have, more perhaps,

681
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:49,563
because he didn't attempt to tamper
with the progression of life.

682
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,900
While you are on this pedestal
of moral indignation

683
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:56,320
you seem to have forgotten
that you are as involved as I am.

684
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,614
No.

685
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,574
I do not forget.

686
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,826
That is perhaps because I am so sad.

687
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:06,163
I am sad for you too.

688
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,375
You have changed so much.

689
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:14,421
I'll tell you why I have changed.

690
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:18,175
It's being alone,

691
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:21,887
so utterly alone,

692
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:24,014
again and again.

693
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,519
Every few years having
to sever all contacts, cut all traces.

694
00:47:29,354 --> 00:47:31,980
Having to disappear
and start a new life.

695
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:37,444
You knew this would be the case
when you set out.

696
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:41,323
Knowing something
and living with it are...

697
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,535
...are two very different things.

698
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:48,789
I often think I can't bear it any longer.

699
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,550
Georges?

700
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:05,264
We have come to a time
where we must consider with great care

701
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,599
whether what we are doing
should continue.

702
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:10,102
No, let me say what I have to.

703
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:13,063
No man can live alone all his life.

704
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:14,815
It's not natural.

705
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:18,110
It rebels against human nature.

706
00:48:18,236 --> 00:48:20,988
But as long as you continue

707
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:23,449
you must remain alone.

708
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:24,825
No.

709
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:27,369
No, there is an answer.

710
00:48:27,495 --> 00:48:29,413
Not to continue.

711
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,582
No, to continue.

712
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:36,712
But not to continue alone.

713
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:39,381
Georges, you're not being serious.

714
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:40,799
Of course I'm serious.

715
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,428
Do you think
I've never thought about it?

716
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:47,014
This must be the answer.

717
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:50,350
Georges.

718
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:54,313
What you are suggesting is monstrous.

719
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:55,981
But why?

720
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:59,568
Why is it monstrous to want
to be with the person you love, always?

721
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:03,447
Mademoiselle Janine?
It is she you talk about?

722
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:04,865
Yes, Janine.

723
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:07,576
I will not hear of it

724
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:10,078
and I must ask you to promise me now

725
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:13,582
not to consider it again.

726
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,292
I cannot promise that.

727
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:17,753
Then you are truly alone now.

728
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,174
For I will have nothing more to do with it.

729
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,509
Ludwig.

730
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:39,775
No, Georges, you mustn't do it.

731
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,945
Don't be stupid, Ludwig.
Give me that key.

732
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,323
Give me that key.
It is past time already.

733
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:49,076
Yes, Georges, it's been
many years past time.

734
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:51,411
Ludwig, that key, quickly.

735
00:49:52,664 --> 00:49:54,706
All right, I promise.
Now, give me that key.

736
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,792
You're lying.
I can see it in your eyes.

737
00:49:56,918 --> 00:49:59,002
You are lying to save yourself.

738
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,173
Give me that key!

739
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:08,929
Ludwig.

740
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:10,889
Look.

741
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,603
Please.

742
00:50:18,356 --> 00:50:19,648
No.

743
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:22,860
It is better that it end here
before further damage is done.

744
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:26,572
This must be the end.

745
00:50:57,228 --> 00:51:00,105
No, you must...
You mustn't do it.

746
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:02,065
You fool! This...

747
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:04,902
- This is all I've got.
- Yes, I know.

748
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:09,281
And I know it will take you two years
to make a fresh supply.

749
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:26,882
No, no.

750
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:28,175
No, don't.

751
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:29,760
Don't do it.

752
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,303
(Screams)

753
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:25,107
(Knock at door)

754
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:28,402
Dr Gerard, sir.

755
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:29,987
Oh.

756
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,364
- Good morning, Dr Gerard.
- Good morning.

757
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:35,617
Everything is ready,
including the patient.

758
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:37,703
Where is Dr Weiss?

759
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:41,331
Oh, I'm afraid
he had to leave late last night.

760
00:52:41,457 --> 00:52:44,459
He received an urgent message
from his home in Vienna.

761
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:47,963
He asked me to...
to apologise on his behalf.

762
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,257
Monsieur Bonner.

763
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:54,928
Without Dr Weiss it is out ofthe question
for me to perform this operation.

764
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:59,683
Last night you agreed.

765
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:03,353
The Doctor's reputation is such
that under his patronage I agreed to do it,

766
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:06,481
but if he is not here, it's...
it's impossible.

767
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:09,109
You must or I shall die.

768
00:53:10,194 --> 00:53:12,195
I recommend you to see another doctor.

769
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:15,323
Wait.

770
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:19,703
- I'll pay you well.
- That's of no consequence, Monsieur.

771
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:24,791
Ifyou are in the critical condition
that you say you are in,

772
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:28,045
I advise you to go
to a reputable hospital immediately.

773
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:32,841
It's possible that they may be able
to do for you what I cannot do.

774
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:35,010
Good day.

775
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,020
- (Knock at door)
- Come in.

776
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,190
Inspector Legris to see you, sir.

777
00:53:48,316 --> 00:53:49,691
Oh, yes. Show him in.

778
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:54,446
Good morning, sir.

779
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:57,240
- I hope you'll forgive this intrusion.
- Morning.

780
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:58,825
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

781
00:54:01,996 --> 00:54:06,333
- What can I do for you?
- This is a little difficult, sir.

782
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:10,295
Are you a particular friend
of Monsieur Georges Bonner?

783
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:11,880
No, I'm not.

784
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:14,758
I only met him for the first time
the day before yesterday.

785
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,135
Then there's not much
you can tell me about him.

786
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:18,261
No.

787
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:20,806
When we met last night
I received the impression

788
00:54:20,932 --> 00:54:22,557
that you wanted to say something.

789
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:25,143
Yes, that's quite correct, Inspector.

790
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:28,563
Remember that statue
that he said was broken?

791
00:54:28,689 --> 00:54:31,858
Well, he didn't break it.
It's in his laboratory.

792
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:32,984
That's strange.

793
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:37,739
I take it you haven't managed
to find the girl yet.

794
00:54:37,865 --> 00:54:39,116
No, sir, we haven't.

795
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:42,244
And you think Bonner knows
something that will help you?

796
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,413
I don't know what to think.
The deeper I get into this case,

797
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,375
the more complicated
and unreasonable it becomes.

798
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:50,210
Unreasonable, Inspector?

799
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:53,255
How old would you say
Monsieur Bonner was?

800
00:54:54,966 --> 00:54:58,009
- About 35.
- Yes, that's what I would have said.

801
00:54:58,136 --> 00:54:59,594
Why do you ask that?

802
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,346
Look, sir,

803
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:04,266
I need your help,
I don't mind admitting it.

804
00:55:04,392 --> 00:55:07,060
- To find this girl?
- No, it goes deeper than that.

805
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:08,395
Far deeper.

806
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:11,523
I'm going to tell you something

807
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:14,526
and then perhaps you may be able
to give me the help that I need.

808
00:55:14,652 --> 00:55:16,403
Please do.

809
00:55:16,529 --> 00:55:18,363
Ten years ago in London

810
00:55:20,324 --> 00:55:22,409
a young woman disappeared,

811
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:24,870
later presumed to have been murdered.

812
00:55:24,996 --> 00:55:28,331
That's not very interesting, you'll say.
It happens all the time.

813
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:31,418
Well, exactly ten years before that

814
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:35,297
the same thing happened
in San Francisco

815
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,925
and ten years before that,
in Bern, Switzerland.

816
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:43,138
Three completely isolated cases.

817
00:55:43,264 --> 00:55:45,932
Then, two years ago,

818
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:49,394
the international files
at the Surete were being tabulated.

819
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,148
A fact was noticed that tied
these three disappearances together

820
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:58,069
and pointed towards them
all having been perpetrated by one man.

821
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:01,615
In each case

822
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:06,661
the girl in question had been posing
for a statue prior to her disappearance.

823
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:10,373
In each case the sculptor was a doctor.

824
00:56:11,584 --> 00:56:15,629
And in each case
the doctor disappeared shortly after.

825
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:19,716
All this is carrying coincidence too far.

826
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,803
You see what I'm getting at,
don't you, sir?

827
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:27,265
Yes.

828
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,017
I see what you're trying to get at.

829
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,687
But if Bonner is the man
you suspect, sir,

830
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:37,692
- he'd be over 60 by now.
- Yes.

831
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:41,154
That's where the whole thing
becomes unreasonable.

832
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,700
You said yourselfthat he was about 35,
certainly not more than 38,

833
00:56:45,826 --> 00:56:47,244
and I agree with you.

834
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,876
I assume you haven't said anything
to Bonner about this?

835
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:57,087
What's the point?

836
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,801
These statues ofthe women
who disappeared,

837
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:05,262
- were they ever found?
- No.

838
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,472
That's another peculiarity.

839
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:11,309
The statues were seen by a small number
of close friends ofthe sculptor

840
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:15,188
and remarkably fine pieces of work
they were too by all account.

841
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:17,315
Then they were never seen again.

842
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:20,944
How can I help you, Inspector?

843
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,238
Well, as you've met Monsieur Bonner,

844
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:26,533
I had hoped that you might
be able to give me a lead.

845
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:28,702
I have checked
his background thoroughly.

846
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:32,163
His movements seem all perfectly normal
as far as I can trace back.

847
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:35,583
And then I reach a complete dead end.

848
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:40,755
How far back
before you reach this dead end?

849
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,717
Ten years.

850
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:49,597
Look, I think I may be able
to give you some sort of lead.

851
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:52,350
It may not mean anything
but it's worth a try.

852
00:57:54,395 --> 00:57:57,314
See what you can find out
about Professor Ludwig Weiss.

853
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,942
- You've heard of him, of course?
- Weiss? Vaguely.

854
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:04,237
- He's a doctor, isn't he?
- He was one ofthe very greatest.

855
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:08,658
He was at Bonner's house last night.
You saw him there.

856
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:15,498
Try to find out if he was in London,
San Francisco and Bern

857
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:17,584
at the time that those girls disappeared.

858
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:23,089
You don't think Professor Weiss
could have been responsible?

859
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:25,508
No, I don't, not directly.

860
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,429
But you will try?

861
00:58:29,555 --> 00:58:31,681
Dr Gerard, I'll try anything.

862
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,394
Needless to say, you won't say a word
about this to anyone, will you?

863
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,272
Naturally not, Inspector,
ifthat is your wish.

864
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:40,440
Thank you.

865
00:58:40,566 --> 00:58:43,860
I don't know your reasons for wanting
me to do this, Monsieur Dumont,

866
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:46,279
but whatever they are,
I must decline.

867
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:47,781
I'm sorry.

868
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:54,996
But you're not making sense, Pierre.

869
00:58:55,122 --> 00:58:58,041
You come here with a story
which you admit is mostly guesswork

870
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,001
and you expect me to believe it.

871
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:03,088
All I'm trying to do is to warn you
against Georges Bonner.

872
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,465
I gathered that,

873
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:07,842
but you still haven't explained why.

874
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:11,513
I can't give you all the details
until I am sure ofthem myself.

875
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:14,265
But...the man's abnormal.

876
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,478
For heaven's sake, Pierre.

877
00:59:18,604 --> 00:59:20,605
Try to talk sense.

878
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:25,151
Last night Professor Weiss asked me
to perform an operation on Bonner.

879
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:29,656
I agreed, and today
Weiss isn't there anymore.

880
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,701
Well? What's so mysterious about that?

881
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:37,247
By itself, nothing, but added
to other things that I have discovered...

882
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,208
Oh, not that idiotic story
about those statues again.

883
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:43,086
I've never heard anyone talk
such nonsense in all my life.

884
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,630
I admit it does sound far-fetched.

885
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:48,174
That is why I want you to wait...

886
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,760
until I can get more information.

887
00:59:50,886 --> 00:59:53,221
Spy on him.
That's what you mean, don't you?

888
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,476
You came to make an impression
upon me with your story about Georges.

889
00:59:58,602 --> 01:00:00,395
Well, you've done that.

890
01:00:00,521 --> 01:00:04,566
But it was about you and not Georges
that you made the impression.

891
01:00:04,692 --> 01:00:06,651
You are jealous of him.

892
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,279
You're jealous of his work
and about me.

893
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:13,992
Well, I love him.

894
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:17,829
And I'm going to marry him.

895
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,958
It's unusual, Monsieur Dumont.

896
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:25,295
You will grant me that.

897
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,380
So is the fee I am offering you.

898
01:00:27,506 --> 01:00:29,090
Yes, that's true.

899
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,177
Very well, then. When is it to be?

900
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:34,929
I, er...

901
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:39,017
I think I could manage next Tuesday.

902
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:42,228
It is to be now, tonight,
and at my place.

903
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:45,690
Very well, then.
I'll put my things together.

904
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:50,904
One needs many instruments
for an operation.

905
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:55,533
What's this?

906
01:00:56,577 --> 01:00:58,953
This is a scalpel, Monsieur Dumont.

907
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:01,247
You couldn't be expected
to know what that is

908
01:01:01,373 --> 01:01:05,126
but to us doctors
it is the principal instrument,

909
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:08,379
like a spade is to a farmer, you know.

910
01:01:08,506 --> 01:01:10,924
And just about as filthy too.

911
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,760
Leave all this.
I have all the equipment you need.

912
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:15,637
You have? Very well.

913
01:01:20,017 --> 01:01:23,978
I always have a small one
before I operate.

914
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:27,607
My hand is not as steady
as it was, you know.

915
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:32,362
Wait for me.

916
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,959
Oh... Oh, Janine.

917
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:48,211
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

918
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:51,297
I hope you don't mind
my coming here like this.

919
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:54,092
No, of course not.
I was looking for you all afternoon.

920
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:57,053
- The clinic didn't know where you were.
- I have been busy.

921
01:01:58,138 --> 01:02:01,766
Janine, there is something
I must tell you.

922
01:02:01,892 --> 01:02:02,892
I...

923
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:09,065
Georges, are you ill?

924
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:10,483
No, no, of course not.

925
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:12,735
- Why?
- Oh, it's just that...

926
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:17,156
Pierre was here earlier this afternoon.
He said something about an operation.

927
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:20,994
He's got some fantastic story in his mind
about you and Professor Weiss.

928
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,121
What sort of story?

929
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:25,999
Oh, it's too ridiculous for words.

930
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,459
Something to do
with glands and statues.

931
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:30,795
I really didn't know
what he was talking about.

932
01:02:34,216 --> 01:02:35,258
Darling?

933
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,760
- Are you sure you're not ill?
- No, of course not.

934
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:40,930
I'm just tired.

935
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:42,473
Yes, just tired.

936
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:46,185
I was so worried about you
this afternoon,

937
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:49,772
thinking you were ill
and not knowing where you were.

938
01:02:49,898 --> 01:02:51,232
- Janine...
- Yes?

939
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:02,118
- Would you do something for me?
- Anything in the world.

940
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:05,913
Then come with me.

941
01:03:22,222 --> 01:03:25,058
Georges, what a strange place.

942
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:26,726
- Is it yours?
- Yes.

943
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:31,814
There's my statue.
What's it doing here?

944
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:33,608
I'll...

945
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:36,986
I'll explain in a minute.

946
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:38,863
I love you.

947
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:45,953
But it's simply wonderful.

948
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:50,166
So many beautiful things.

949
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,463
- It must have taken years to do.
- Yes, yes, a long time.

950
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,633
Wait, I'll...I'll show you something.

951
01:04:04,848 --> 01:04:08,059
This is the very first thing I ever did.

952
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:09,394
I was 12.

953
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:11,938
It's charming.

954
01:04:27,913 --> 01:04:31,582
1798? Oh, Georges,
you've got the wrong date on this.

955
01:04:32,543 --> 01:04:34,544
Ifyou modelled this when you were 12

956
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:38,047
then this date makes you...104.

957
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:41,259
Georges?

958
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:44,971
Georges!

959
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,225
Yes, I heard what you said.

960
01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:52,186
104.

961
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:54,689
I don't believe it.

962
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:58,735
Whether you believe it or not
is of no importance.

963
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:02,530
It is important that you do this operation.

964
01:05:04,032 --> 01:05:06,659
My answer is the same
as before, Bonner. No.

965
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,494
Wait a minute, Gerard.

966
01:05:09,913 --> 01:05:11,706
Listen to me once more.

967
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,501
Then we'll see
ifyou feel the same afterwards.

968
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,215
Weiss and I...

969
01:05:22,468 --> 01:05:24,427
were fellow students.

970
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,804
I was his senior by 15 years.

971
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,348
- His senior?
- Yes, his senior.

972
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:35,897
I met him when I returned to university
for a refresher course on surgery.

973
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:40,818
Quite by accident we discovered

974
01:05:40,944 --> 01:05:43,362
we were interested
in the same line of research.

975
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,658
And then...

976
01:05:50,078 --> 01:05:53,456
finally we discovered
the secret of immortal life.

977
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:59,337
But we had to prove
what up till then had been only theory.

978
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:01,172
So...

979
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:07,261
I volunteered to be the first guinea pig.

980
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,644
Since I embarked on this experiment,

981
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:17,814
I have never been ill,

982
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:21,317
never had a blemish on my skin.

983
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:25,279
Sickness and disease
have passed me by.

984
01:06:27,074 --> 01:06:28,699
So you see,

985
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:31,994
not only did we discover
the secret of perpetual life,

986
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:36,874
but of perpetual health as well.

987
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,502
Then why didn't you
publish your findings?

988
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:47,927
We haven't published
because to do so would bring disaster.

989
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,890
The balance of nature is such

990
01:06:53,016 --> 01:06:56,185
that the population ofthe world
is kept at a level

991
01:06:57,479 --> 01:07:01,190
where the world can adequately provide
food and living space for our people.

992
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:04,527
If it were suddenly made possible

993
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:08,281
for people to remain
alive and healthy indefinitely

994
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:13,452
the whole structure of nature
would collapse.

995
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:15,997
Within one generation

996
01:07:16,123 --> 01:07:19,500
the population ofthe earth
would be doubled, then quadrupled.

997
01:07:19,626 --> 01:07:23,379
There would be famine
on a scale never before dreamed of.

998
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:31,512
This is one reason we haven't published.

999
01:07:31,638 --> 01:07:33,806
- One reason?
- Yes.

1000
01:07:34,975 --> 01:07:36,517
There is another.

1001
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,689
Every ten years it is necessary
to have the uter-parathyroid replaced.

1002
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:46,277
In order to replace an organ
you must first find a replacement.

1003
01:07:47,905 --> 01:07:52,283
With no one dying
there would be no replacement.

1004
01:07:54,077 --> 01:07:58,372
You told me earlier on about a fluid
that you have to take to keep alive.

1005
01:07:58,498 --> 01:08:00,875
Only in the latter stages
of each ten-year cycle.

1006
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,378
If, for any reason,
the operation is delayed,

1007
01:08:04,504 --> 01:08:07,256
it is possible to remain alive
for four weeks

1008
01:08:08,342 --> 01:08:09,759
by taking this fluid.

1009
01:08:12,012 --> 01:08:13,095
Not desirable,

1010
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:18,309
for it has an unpredictable effect
on the mental balance.

1011
01:08:20,312 --> 01:08:22,313
And you have none ofthis fluid left?

1012
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:28,444
Enough to keep me alive
for another six hours.

1013
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:35,034
I shall become the inheritor
of all my 104 years,

1014
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,829
of all the sickness I have never had,

1015
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:42,833
of every pain, blemish, disease,

1016
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:46,462
a lifetime of illness,

1017
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,757
in one moment.

1018
01:08:51,468 --> 01:08:54,470
That is why you must perform
this operation.

1019
01:09:02,396 --> 01:09:05,189
I'm sorry, Bonner, but I still can't do it.

1020
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:07,441
Why not? Tell me why not.

1021
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:10,528
You are asking me to participate
in an offence against nature.

1022
01:09:10,654 --> 01:09:13,239
You said so yourself.
An offence against God.

1023
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:17,451
Nothing you can say
will make me change my mind.

1024
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:27,503
You're in love with Janine, aren't you?

1025
01:09:29,172 --> 01:09:31,090
Yes, I am.

1026
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:33,884
You wouldn't like
anything to happen to her?

1027
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,304
What do you mean?

1028
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,142
At this moment
Janine is somewhere only I know.

1029
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:45,229
Ifyou perform this operation
and perform it successfully,

1030
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:47,189
I shall release her.

1031
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:50,276
Ifyou don't perform this operation,

1032
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:53,320
or if anything should happen to me
while you are operating,

1033
01:09:54,406 --> 01:09:58,075
Janine will not be seen
by you or anyone else again.

1034
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:03,539
You have two hours to verify the facts.

1035
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:05,958
Then I shall expect you at my house.

1036
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:08,294
Two hours.

1037
01:10:09,463 --> 01:10:10,463
Remember.

1038
01:10:18,555 --> 01:10:20,473
Here you are, dearie.
Drink it up.

1039
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:22,558
Why? What's the hurry?

1040
01:10:22,684 --> 01:10:24,685
No hurry, no hurry at all.

1041
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:28,397
But I'm a working girl, remember.
Time is money after all.

1042
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:30,858
You'll get paid so stop nagging.

1043
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:33,235
(Door opens)

1044
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:45,581
Cognac.

1045
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:57,510
I'm sick of waiting here
for you to fill your great fat stomach.

1046
01:10:57,636 --> 01:11:00,054
- I'm going.
- What are you doing? What about...

1047
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,807
What, do you think I'm a girl
who can be bought for money?

1048
01:11:02,933 --> 01:11:05,351
- I've never been so insulted.
- You said 50 francs.

1049
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:08,938
It isn't safe for a respectable girl
to be around on her own.

1050
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:11,232
My escort's here now, anyway.

1051
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:35,047
(Cat screeches)

1052
01:11:40,303 --> 01:11:41,929
Mind the dustbins, dear.

1053
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,856
(Woman screams)

1054
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:32,062
(Doorbell rings)

1055
01:12:40,614 --> 01:12:42,239
Never mind, Roger.
You go to bed.

1056
01:12:42,365 --> 01:12:43,365
Yes, sir.

1057
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:50,289
Good evening.

1058
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,375
Everything is ready.

1059
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:54,501
Please.

1060
01:13:11,269 --> 01:13:14,396
If I perform this operation
you will release Janine immediately?

1061
01:13:14,522 --> 01:13:15,648
I give you my word.

1062
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:53,686
It will be extremely unfortunate

1063
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:56,021
if I don't survive this operation.

1064
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:57,815
(Train passing)

1065
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:24,591
(Woman laughing)

1066
01:15:06,676 --> 01:15:08,218
No!

1067
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:20,689
No, no!

1068
01:15:28,281 --> 01:15:29,281
Drink this.

1069
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:54,556
I am very grateful, Doctor.

1070
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,644
You can show your gratitude best
by taking me to Janine Dubois.

1071
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,480
Of course.

1072
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,777
You'll be strong enough to do that
by the time I'm ready.

1073
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:21,458
It means nothing to you that you saved
me from an extremely horrible death?

1074
01:16:21,584 --> 01:16:22,584
Nothing.

1075
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,548
Try getting up and moving around a little.

1076
01:16:32,262 --> 01:16:33,679
How does it feel?

1077
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,101
I said, how does it feel?

1078
01:17:07,672 --> 01:17:10,090
- Did you see Bonner go out?
- No. I heard him, though.

1079
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,844
- Have you any idea where he went?
- No, sir, I haven't.

1080
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:16,346
Find Inspector Legris and bring him here.

1081
01:17:16,473 --> 01:17:18,932
- Yes, sir.
- And hurry. It's desperately urgent.

1082
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:24,271
(Train passing)

1083
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:51,215
(Grunting and groaning)

1084
01:17:54,135 --> 01:17:57,012
- Where have you been?
- Later. Come on.

1085
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:04,561
You said you wanted to be with me.

1086
01:18:05,813 --> 01:18:06,813
Always.

1087
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,816
- Is that still true?
- Yes.

1088
01:18:09,943 --> 01:18:10,943
Yes.

1089
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:13,779
Whatever it may mean?

1090
01:18:13,905 --> 01:18:15,531
Whatever it may mean, yes.

1091
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:20,410
Janine,

1092
01:18:21,746 --> 01:18:23,580
I'm going to tell you about myself.

1093
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:28,752
It all started 70 years ago.

1094
01:18:37,095 --> 01:18:39,638
Those are Monsieur Bonner's
private papers.

1095
01:18:39,764 --> 01:18:41,723
Never mind that.
You leave this to me.

1096
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:43,517
Now, then, sir. What's the matter?

1097
01:18:43,643 --> 01:18:46,311
Bonner has abducted Janine Dubois.
He's hidden her.

1098
01:18:46,437 --> 01:18:49,439
Wait a minute, sir.
Please will you start at the beginning?

1099
01:18:50,984 --> 01:18:54,403
Earlier this evening
Bonner came to see me.

1100
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,281
He asked me
to perform an operation on him.

1101
01:18:57,407 --> 01:19:00,367
This has been my...existence.

1102
01:19:01,494 --> 01:19:02,619
Not life,

1103
01:19:03,871 --> 01:19:04,871
existence.

1104
01:19:06,749 --> 01:19:08,000
Until I met you.

1105
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,296
Now you're going to
come with me, Janine.

1106
01:19:12,422 --> 01:19:14,840
But first you must become
exactly as I am.

1107
01:19:14,966 --> 01:19:16,216
Think of it.

1108
01:19:16,342 --> 01:19:19,344
Never to grow old,
always to stay as we are,

1109
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:22,347
as we are now,
never to be ill.

1110
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:27,769
To stay as beautiful
as you are now.

1111
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,314
- No.
- Always.

1112
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,857
Through all time.

1113
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,570
And this fluid affected his reason?

1114
01:19:36,696 --> 01:19:40,657
For the few moments before taking it
he became without reason at all.

1115
01:19:40,783 --> 01:19:42,284
Homicidal, completely mad.

1116
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,245
That's when he killed those three women.

1117
01:19:45,371 --> 01:19:48,665
- And at other times?
- At other times rational, sane,

1118
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,709
charming, intelligent.

1119
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:53,587
Here's a carrier's receipt.

1120
01:19:53,713 --> 01:19:57,257
"Unspecified crate, 3x2x2,
collect at this address,

1121
01:19:57,383 --> 01:20:00,302
"deliver to railway arches,
Gare du Nord."

1122
01:20:01,638 --> 01:20:02,721
Today's date.

1123
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:05,432
The statue.

1124
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:08,268
It was here yesterday.
It's gone now.

1125
01:20:08,394 --> 01:20:10,646
We must try it.
It's the only clue we've got.

1126
01:20:12,482 --> 01:20:13,940
If what you say is correct

1127
01:20:14,067 --> 01:20:18,487
then he must be all right
now that you've performed the operation.

1128
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:22,199
I made the incision
but I did not perform the operation.

1129
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:25,369
It will be all right, I promise you.

1130
01:20:26,704 --> 01:20:28,455
- No, no!
- Janine!

1131
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:30,082
No!

1132
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:41,009
He didn't.

1133
01:20:41,886 --> 01:20:44,680
He didn't do the operation.

1134
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,933
He didn't do the operation!

1135
01:20:52,605 --> 01:20:54,481
(Groaning)

1136
01:20:54,607 --> 01:20:56,358
(Second woman laughs)

1137
01:21:11,374 --> 01:21:19,381
I am going to die.

1138
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:22,259
(Screaming)

1139
01:21:29,892 --> 01:21:32,144
- Janine! She's in there.
- What?

1140
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:34,104
Break that door down quickly.

1141
01:21:56,294 --> 01:21:57,711
Get out of here.

1142
01:22:12,852 --> 01:22:14,436
(Woman screams)

1143
01:22:22,361 --> 01:22:25,614
(Bonner screams)
