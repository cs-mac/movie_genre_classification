1
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:23,167
- He's arrived
- Yes, yes.

2
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,626
There he is. He's here.
There! You see? etc.

3
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,251
I see the other one!

4
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,959
Stop!

5
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,792
Stay behind the others.

6
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,542
What is it?

7
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,209
What's he doing?

8
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,876
He's got a suitcase

9
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,126
There!

10
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,626
- Don't move.
- What are you doing here?

11
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,501
Ah… nothing. Give me a moment…

12
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,584
I can explain everything

13
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,584
We'll open his suitcase?

14
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:50,751
Yes!

15
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,584
And your French is not good.

16
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:22,334
I'm sorry, we were forced
to take advantage of your light.

17
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,667
The plane was losing fuel.

18
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,709
I'm afraid I'm supposed to be…
eighty miles further on.

19
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,876
Do you think…
could you tell me where I am?

20
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,584
You've landed near a village called St Benoît.
It's close to a town called Poitiers, all right?

21
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,459
Yes, I think I have heard of it, you know…

22
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,126
So, how do I look?

23
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,959
I'd rather not look at you too closely. It's
an element of risk we don't need to take.

24
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:05,292
In my experience, it's best... it really
is best... if you just obey the rules.

25
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,126
I'll take you to the village.
Then you must make your own way.

26
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,626
How long have you been here?

27
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,917
About a year, off and on.

28
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,501
How's everyone at home?

29
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,542
They're fine.

30
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:34,917
The boss?

31
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:38,709
He's fine. He, um… gave me
some cufflinks at the aerodrome.

32
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,042
Told me my chances.

33
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,501
Fifty-fifty?

34
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,584
- Yes.
- He's getting out of touch.

35
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,834
How's it been?

36
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,334
Well… the Germans are still here

37
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,209
Well, I suppose that's our brief.
Keep them here… keep them occupied.

38
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,417
- Keep them from the front.
- Worst thing about the job.

39
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,501
The more successful you are,
the longer it goes on.

40
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:13,584
A friend…

41
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:18,042
a friend who was here used to
say, "Never kill a German,

42
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:21,667
always shoot him in the leg. That way, he goes
to hospital, where he has to be looked after;

43
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,376
he'll use up enemy resources.

44
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:29,126
But a dead soldier is
forgotten… and replaced."

45
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,834
- Right. Let's go…
- Okay.

46
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,334
Goodbye… and good luck, eh?

47
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,334
Cafés are bad meeting places...
much less safe than they seem.

48
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:01,209
And don't go near Bourges,
it's very bad for us.

49
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:04,667
And don't carry anything in toothpaste
tubes... it's the first place they look.

50
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:08,167
And don't laugh too much. An Englishman's
laugh just doesn't sound the same.

51
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,334
Are they still teaching you to
broadcast on the lavatory?

52
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:11,667
- Yes.
- Well, don't.

53
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,334
The whole dodge is badly out of date.

54
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,709
Gestapo have been crashing into
lavatories for a full two months now.

55
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,959
Never take the valley road beyond Poitiers.
I'll show you the side road.

56
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,501
And that's it, really.
The rest, you know… or will learn.

57
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,501
Get out.

58
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,542
Where's your gun?

59
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:19,417
- Let's get going. Come on.
- I'm sorry… I'm so sorry…

60
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,751
- I'm so frightened!
- Let's get going. Quickly.

61
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:27,126
I'm not an agent, I'm only a courier, I
just carry messages to certain circuits.

62
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,751
I came tonight... it's my first drop...
there's literally no-one else.

63
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,876
I can't tell you the mess in Poitiers!

64
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,376
My... my f... friend that I told you
about, he's been taken to Buchenwald today,

65
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:39,209
he was the wireless operator.
His name is Tony…

66
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,876
- I need to talk…
- Can't talk.

67
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,667
I need to talk, What's the point,
what's the point of following the rules?

68
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:50,084
I don't… want to die. I don't,
don't want to die like that…

69
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,209
Un ciel pommelé.

70
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,626
What do we call it?

71
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,667
A mackerel sky.

72
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,084
Hm…

73
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:07,667
I don't have to go on.
I'll stay if you like.

74
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:28,251
- Do you have a code-name?
- Yes, it's "Lazar".

75
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,501
Hm.

76
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:36,251
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, very much.

77
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:52,251
Am I right? Is this your first trip?

78
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,042
Bonjour Susan.

79
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,709
Bonjour.

80
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,584
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour…

81
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,001
Ah, bonjour, Susan.

82
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,667
Bonjour, Monsieur Villon.

83
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:49,876
I was just going through the post.

84
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,792
And yesterday's shipment...
it got there okay?

85
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,001
Yes.

86
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,417
Au revoir.

87
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,126
He's dead!

88
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,251
Yes. He's dead.

89
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,792
Ah! Brock.

90
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,542
- Good morning.
- Morning.

91
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,917
This is very much
Third Secretary stuff, I'm afraid.

92
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,126
There's a man called Radley…
dropped dead in the foyer.

93
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,876
British. Would you mind doing the honours?

94
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,876
- Not at all.
- Thanks a lot.

95
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:08,167
Oh... there's a widow, by the way.

96
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:10,501
Really?

97
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,001
British Embassy.

98
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,459
Heart attack.

99
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,542
- And the widow?
- Over there, sir.

100
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:40,751
Mrs Radley?

101
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:46,709
I'm afraid your husband's
had a heart attack.

102
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:48,709
I thought so.

103
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,126
Everyone at the Embassy
will do all they can.

104
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:54,126
The police would now like
to take the body away.

105
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,542
I shall go with them.

106
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:59,667
Or course, I mean, you're welcome,
if you'd like, if you want to…

107
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,209
come with me to the mortuary…

108
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,751
No.

109
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,001
I'm sure you can cope.

110
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,667
Merci.

111
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,584
Mr Brock.

112
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,792
Will I see you?
Will you come to the Embassy?

113
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,917
Yes, of course.
This shouldn't take long.

114
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:43,042
Ah, Brock. Join us.
You're welcome.

115
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:44,251
Ambassador.

116
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,917
I've just been conveying to
Mrs Radley the government's condolences.

117
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,584
A uniquely upsetting experience.

118
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,584
Quite.

119
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,917
But at least for him, it was painless.

120
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:59,584
I would hope. He was packing the car.
We were planning to move on this morning.

121
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:04,876
We only had two weeks… we were hoping to make
Innsbruck... at least if our travel allowance would last.

122
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:08,001
It was our first holiday since the war.

123
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,751
Brock, a handkerchief.

124
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,209
No.

125
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:16,459
I was… persuaded to opt for an embalming.

126
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,501
I'm afraid it may involve you
in some small extra cost.

127
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,667
Excuse me, but you'll have
to explain the point.

128
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,667
- I'm sorry?
- Of the embalming, I mean.

129
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:31,917
Well... ah... particularly in the summer, it avoids a
possibility of the body exploding at a bad moment.

130
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,209
I mean, any moment would be bad, that goes
without saying, but... on the aeroplane, say.

131
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,084
I see.

132
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:40,626
Mm. You see, normally the
body's simply washed, and, uh…

133
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,792
I don't know how much detail
you want me to provide…

134
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,167
- I think it would be better if...
- No, no, I would like to know.

135
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,834
Tony was a doctor.
He would want me to know.

136
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:56,584
Well, to be honest, I was…
… surprised at how little there is to do.

137
00:21:56,626 --> 00:22:01,292
There's a… small bottle of spirit... colourless...
and they simply give the body a wash.

138
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,292
The only other thing is the stomach.

139
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:06,334
Now, if there's been a meal... a
recent meal… - Tony had eaten...

140
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:12,126
at breakfast, I think. Erm, you insert a pipe
into the corpse's stomach to let the gasses out.

141
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:15,834
They insert it and there's a
strange sort of ssssssigh…

142
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,501
- I think…
- It almost leaves no mark.

143
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:23,417
Apparently, when the morgue attendants are bored
sometimes they set light to the gas for a joke.

144
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,626
- Makes one hell of a bang!
- Shall we all have a drink?

145
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,292
But I'm sure it didn't happen
in this particular case.

146
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:33,251
No.

147
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:37,042
There is gin… there is tonic… Yes?

148
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:38,126
Thank you.

149
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:44,542
I'm afraid we do need to discuss
the practical arrangements.

150
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:49,042
The whole subject is very distressing…
but do you want the body flown back?

151
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:52,667
Well, I can hardly stash it
in the boot of the car.

152
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:58,167
What the Third Secretary is saying…
not buried on foreign soil.

153
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,542
No.

154
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,959
Quite.

155
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:04,209
You see, for the moment,
the Government picks up the bill.

156
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:08,709
But later, we will have to charge it to
the estate. If there is an estate.

157
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:12,417
I'm sorry...
I don't mean to interfere.

158
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,834
Well, I think we now
understand your needs.

159
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,501
I'll have a word with the travel people…

160
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,167
and make a booking for tomorrow
morning's flight, if that suits?

161
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,167
Yes, of course.

162
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:24,209
You will be travelling back
with the body, I assume?

163
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,251
Yes.

164
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:29,584
No other dependants? Children…?

165
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:30,792
No.

166
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,876
He doesn't like you.

167
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:44,834
I'm sorry?

168
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:46,376
The Ambassador.

169
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:50,626
Oh, well, no. I don't think he's
over the moon about you.

170
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,667
I shouldn't have said that.

171
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:58,084
No, it's just that… Darwin thinks that
disasters are examinations in etiquette;

172
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:02,709
- which fork to use in an earthquake.
- Darwin?!

173
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,542
- Is that his name?
- Hm…

174
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:06,667
the mission all think it's God's joke.

175
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:11,917
God dashing off a modern Darwin who is in
every respect less advanced than the last.

176
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:18,334
I'm sorry. We sit about in the
evenings and polish our jokes.

177
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,792
Brussels is rather a debilitating town.

178
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,667
Mm.

179
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,667
Is this a bad posting for you?

180
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:29,084
Well, I had hoped for
something more positive.

181
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:30,667
Fresher air.

182
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:35,876
The flag still flies over a quarter of the human
race and I would have liked to have seen it, really

183
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:39,334
Whereas here… we're left with
the problems of the war.

184
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:43,001
- I wasn't his wife.
- No.

185
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:48,001
- Had you realised that?
- I thought it possible.

186
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,459
What about… Darwin?

187
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:54,042
- Did he realise?
- Lord, no. It would never occur to him.

188
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,542
We met during the war.

189
00:24:56,584 --> 00:25:01,542
Tony was a wireless operator for the S.O.E.
I was a courier…

190
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,501
motoring together it was easier to
say we were man and wife.

191
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:10,334
In fact, I was barely even his mistress.

192
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,751
He rang me a few weeks ago, and…

193
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:20,167
I was amazed that people in our organisation
didn't know each other all that well. I mean...

194
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,792
even now you don't know who
most of your colleagues were.

195
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:28,459
Perhaps you were in it.
Perhaps I met you.

196
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,334
I don't know.

197
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:36,251
Those of us who went
through this kind of war…

198
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:40,667
I do think we have something
in common. It's a kind of…

199
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,501
impatience. We don't suffer fools.

200
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:48,417
Back in England, the people who stayed
behind can seem childish, and a little…

201
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:51,959
silly. I think that's why
Tony wanted to get away.

202
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,876
If you haven't suffered…

203
00:25:56,501 --> 00:26:04,126
… Well. So, driving through Europe at least I knew I'd
be able to act as I pleased for a while. That's all.

204
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,334
May I ask you a question?

205
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:10,084
Yes. Of course.

206
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:14,542
- If you are not his wife... did he have one?
- Oh... yes.

207
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:16,626
- I see.
- And three children.

208
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:21,292
I had to lie about those.
I couldn't claim them, somehow.

209
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:24,084
She lives in Crediton in Devon.

210
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:27,292
She believes Tony was travelling alone. I…

211
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:35,501
think he told her he needed two weeks by himself.
That's what I was hoping you could do for me…

212
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:37,459
Ah.

213
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,626
… phone her.

214
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:45,959
I've written the number down.
I'm afraid I did it before I came.

215
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,417
And lie?

216
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:58,501
Well, yes… I would prefer it if you lied.
But it's up to you.

217
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:05,001
All right. it doesn't matter.

218
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:09,376
- No, that's not what I said.
- Please, it... it doesn't matter.

219
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,584
Why did you choose me?

220
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:18,751
- What?
- For the job. You didn't choose Darwin?

221
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,417
Well, I might have done.

222
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:34,209
You don't think you wear your
suffering a little heavily?

223
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:38,834
This smart club of people you belong
to who had a very bad war?

224
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,459
I know it must put you on a different level
from the rest of us.

225
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,376
You won't shame me, you know.

226
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:50,584
There's no point.
I wasn't particularly fond of Tony.

227
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:55,834
But we had known some sorrow together…
and I came with him.

228
00:27:56,709 --> 00:28:03,917
And it seemed a shocking injustice when he fell in the
lobby. Unjust for him, of course. But also for his wife.

229
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:09,751
Bitterly unfair if she had to have the
news from me. Unfair for life.

230
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,792
So, I approached the Embassy.

231
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:21,334
It makes no difference. Lie or don't lie.

232
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:25,292
It's a matter of… indifference.

233
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:39,876
Would you… um, perhaps... we could
have dinner? Just so we can talk.

234
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:45,709
No. If I told you anything about myself
now you would only think I was pleading.

235
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:50,334
I'll just say, "look at me."

236
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:56,334
Don't creep round the furniture.
Look at me, and make a judgement.

237
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,501
Well, that's done.

238
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:10,292
- First flight tomorrow morning, without a hitch.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:17,834
If there's anything else… there is a small chapel attached
to the Embassy… if you'd care to visit it before you go.

240
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:20,417
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

241
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,376
Have you been posted here long?

242
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,709
Oh, no, not at all.
Just a few months.

243
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:38,917
Before that, Djakarta. We were hoping for
something sunny… but Brussels came along…

244
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:44,001
er, not that we're complaining.
They've certainly got things going here.

245
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:47,542
- Really?
- Oh yes. New Europe.

246
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:52,126
Reconstruction. Massive
work of reconstruction.

247
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:58,084
Marvellous time to be alive in Europe.
No end of it. Roads to be built.

248
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:02,917
People to be educated.
Land to be tilled. Lots to get on with.

249
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,001
Have another gin.

250
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:11,626
Your wife is asking if you're
ready to go the reception, sir?

251
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,876
- Right.
- And she wants your advice on her face.

252
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:21,334
Oh. Goodbye, Mrs Radley.
I'm sorry this hasn't been a happier day.

253
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,584
- I'll lock up after you, sir.
- Thank you.

254
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:41,292
I've put in a call to England.
There's an hour's delay. I've decided to lie.

255
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:03,292
- I've told you before, get off!
- Oi!

256
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,167
Taxi?

257
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:16,584
- Could have done with you earlier.
- It's all right. We're almost there.

258
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,042
Goodness.

259
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:14,501
I expected something grander.

260
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,167
- Why?
- I don't know.

261
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,917
I'm a single working woman.

262
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:25,667
Over there you're out of touch
with how tough it is at home.

263
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:30,417
- It's worse than the war.
- No doubt. Well…

264
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,876
I've only got two days to put up with it.

265
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:42,167
Do you… may I come back next weekend?

266
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:50,376
Oh… is that what you're going to do?
Commute on the cross-channel ferry?

267
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:55,251
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

268
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,126
But the winter gets rough.

269
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:24,834
Right, let's 'ave a look.
One more, darlin', that's yer lot.

270
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:38,459
My gawd…
Oh, dear.

271
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:41,626
She didn't get them
on the rations, did she…?

272
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:05,001
Mr Medlicott. Mr Medlicott…?

273
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:08,084
I'm afraid you've confused your Guyanas.

274
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:11,959
- I beg your pardon?
- French...

275
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:18,459
French Guyana… is not in Africa.

276
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:22,126
The Himalaya is coming
from Cape Town, you see.

277
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,501
But you have it from Panama.

278
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:29,876
Ah, yes… quite. Quite so.
That is, of course, what I intended.

279
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:33,834
- Quite. Shall I correct it?
- And is there anything else?

280
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:40,751
Well, the Mooltan is due at twelve
from Bombay. I should think...

281
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,834
- Miss Park!
- Yes?

282
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:51,376
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Medlicott, I must be
a little bit late. It's because, um…

283
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:56,334
- I've been finding the work a bit much.
- Miss Park, you only joined us yesterday.

284
00:34:56,376 --> 00:35:00,459
The shock… the pace… I…

285
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,626
- And your clothes?
- Yes, I haven't been home.

286
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,334
- But, that was yesterday, Miss Park…
- Yes, well, it's just…

287
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:12,501
oh, God, you know what it's like. Last night
there was this really nice-looking boy.

288
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,584
It was lovely…

289
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:18,501
Well, Mr Medlicott, if you were his boss
this morning… come on, be grateful!

290
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,334
You'd be saying, "Isn't your hem a bit high?"

291
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:28,042
I don't mind being sacked.
Work's going out of fashion.

292
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,209
Oh, really?

293
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:32,167
Certainly. In a few years,
nobody's going to work.

294
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:35,501
How are you going to live, then?

295
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,959
Oh, by the way…

296
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:40,626
… is there any room for me at your place?

297
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:47,667
I did live somewhere, but I had to move out. I
was disappointed in love. That happens to girls…

298
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:49,792
- Oh, yes…
- Mackerel, please, love.

299
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:51,959
Right, 'ere you are, love… 'alf a pound.

300
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,251
I can't stand queues.

301
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:58,459
- What about you?
- Oh, I have a boyfriend.

302
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:00,959
- A diplomat.
- Golly.

303
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:04,876
- Yes, but he's only here at weekends.
- I don't mind, I can make myself scarce.

304
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:09,542
At heart, I'm a novelist. I can't help it,
that's what I am… I think.

305
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,959
The writer has to experience
every kind of degradation.

306
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:15,501
It's really the degradation that
attracted me to the job.

307
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:20,251
You have to live it before you can write it.

308
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:30,167
This is the place. Look, it's super. If you want
to know what's going on you need to come here.

309
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:33,334
- Haven't you heard about it?
- No, no I haven't.

310
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:36,209
Oh, yes. Everyone comes.

311
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:47,376
- Is this him?
- Yes.

312
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,751
He's not very glamorous.

313
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:55,626
No... but he's very kind.

314
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:00,376
- Here you go.
- Ouch.

315
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,126
Alice! Hullo, Alice…

316
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,042
- Mick! Darling!
- How are you?

317
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,251
Brilliant.

318
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,501
This is a bloody disgrace!
There'll be a riot here pretty soon.

319
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:40,501
It's absolutely open bloody provocation.

320
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:45,334
I'm sorry, I'm lost. Why's he so angry?

321
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:47,792
- He's a revivalist.
- What?

322
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,542
- A revivalist...
- Revivalists are peop... sorry. Please.

323
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:58,459
There are two schools of thought. The revivalists;
they say you can only play music the way it sounded…

324
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:00,501
… originally in New Orleans.

325
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:03,709
For them, nothing happens after 1919.

326
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:10,084
That saxophone…
it's unforgivable.

327
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,626
- Ah!
- Should be a clarinet.

328
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:16,792
Me, I'm mainstream… I don't care.

329
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:21,251
Susan, I think that's Alistair…

330
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:24,209
… you know, the one who's supposed
to have hair on his shoulder blades

331
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:26,459
and apparently can crack
walnuts in his armpits.

332
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,126
Oh, well, he'll never be short of friends.

333
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,917
I'm going to go and find out.

334
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,584
I don't know why you pretend to
be so enthusiastic. You don't like jazz.

335
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:55,334
I do! I'm grateful for
anything that's got a bit of life to it.

336
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,709
- Compared to work!
- Well, exactly.

337
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,959
Charlie Ventura!
It's their names that I like.

338
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:02,792
Oh, I see.

339
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:08,501
"Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside…"

340
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,709
Did we order this?

341
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:20,834
You don't order here.

342
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,542
If you need someone younger
I'm sure I can help you.

343
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:29,376
Oh, I don't like young men. You're through
and out the other side in no time at all.

344
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:33,584
- That's the fun of it.
- Yes. I've noticed your flair for agonised young men.

345
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:37,001
I think you get them in bulk
from tuberculosis wards.

346
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:42,709
Do you think this place is all right?

347
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:44,251
It's wonderful.

348
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,334
It's only three hours till
I'm back on the boat.

349
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:59,126
Do you hate my living with Susan?

350
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:01,876
No. What makes you say that?

351
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:06,459
Men are threatened by friendship
between women. They fear our mystery.

352
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:08,251
Read it in a book.

353
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:10,917
Well… somehow I think I can cope.

354
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:17,251
- Are you very rich?
- No, not really.

355
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:23,376
I just have a talent for the Stock Exchange.
Money sticks to my fingers. I triple my income…

356
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,542
- … what can I do?
- It must be very tiresome.

357
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:29,042
Hm. I'm acclimatising, you know.

358
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:35,167
I think everyone's going to be rich very soon.
Once we get over the effects of the war,

359
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:37,001
it's going to be coming
out of everyone's ears.

360
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,376
- Is that what you think?
- I'm absolutely sure.

361
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,626
I do enjoy these weekends, you know.

362
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:49,709
Susan leads such an interesting life.
Books, conversation, people like you…

363
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,959
The Foreign Office can
make you feel pretty isolated…

364
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:59,251
also, to be honest, can make you
feel pretty small. You can imagine…

365
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,959
- Yes.
- … till I met Susan.

366
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:08,042
The day I met her, I realised you must always do what
you want. If you want something, you must get it.

367
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,334
I think that's a wonderful
way to live... don't you?

368
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:11,917
I do.

369
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:16,917
You all right, darling?
Shall we go home?

370
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,042
In a minute.

371
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,959
Oh, Alice!
Alice, I'm sorry, I meant to ring you.

372
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:42,001
- Why?
- I can't come on your boat.

373
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,834
Oh, Susan…!

374
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:48,626
Medlicott's left me in charge
while he goes off to "goff", as he calls it.

375
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:51,834
But we've got it for the whole day.
We're gonna go up to Kew.

376
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:54,834
Well, I hope he trips over his sticks.

377
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:00,584
He sits there every day, staring at me.

378
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:06,167
I know he's longing to leap across the desk and
rub his wretched old body all over my ledgers.

379
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:12,501
He wants to take my ears and squeeze them against
his great thick tweeds until they bleed.

380
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:18,626
God! It would be something.
At least it would be something.

381
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:26,709
Oh, God, Alice. I need to move on.

382
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:30,126
Then do. Why all the drama? Just go.

383
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:35,709
I do it all the time. The trouble is, I go
before people even notice I've come.

384
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,709
But you could make an impact.

385
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,626
No, it's not that.

386
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:51,209
I asked because I thought
it might cheer you up a bit.

387
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:59,292
But I want to change everything…
and I don't know how.

388
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,501
Shall I tell you how my book begins?

389
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:21,584
Well…

390
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:25,334
There's a woman in a rape trial,
and the story is true…

391
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:29,959
and the book begins at the moment
where she has to tell the court

392
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:32,834
what the accused has said to
her on the night of the rape.

393
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:38,417
And she finds that she can't bring
herself to say the words out loud. So…

394
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:44,542
the judge suggests she write them down on a piece of paper
and it be handed round the court...which she does.

395
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:48,459
And it says: "I want to have you…"

396
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:52,459
"… I must have you now."

397
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:54,584
So…

398
00:43:57,417 --> 00:44:00,834
so the jury all read it and pass it on.

399
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:06,084
At the end of the second row there's a woman jurist
who's fallen asleep at the boredom of the trial,

400
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:11,709
so the man next to her has to nudge her awake
and hand her the slip of paper… which he does.

401
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:16,251
She wakes up… and she
looks at it… then at him…

402
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:21,209
she smiles… and puts it in her handbag!

403
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:28,667
Cheese omelette!
Made from powder, I'm afraid.

404
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,001
That woman is my heroine!

405
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:32,417
Yes, well…

406
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:35,292
Well… at least it's a three-spoon omelette.

407
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,334
Sod this stuff!

408
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:50,417
How am I meant to have any artistic bloody insight
when I can't get any halfway decent drugs?

409
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:55,126
It's because I'm the only bohemian in
London, people take advantage of me.

410
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:00,167
Perhaps one day Raymond will be posted
to Morocco… bring some back in his bag.

411
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:02,542
I don't think that's really on.

412
00:45:02,584 --> 00:45:06,126
Nobody would notice, from what you say.

413
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,084
- No-one else eating?
- Are they not very sharp?

414
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,501
The ones I've met are buffoons.

415
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,792
- Susan, please.
- Well, it's you who calls them buffoons.

416
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:20,126
That man Darwin… how he needs three young men from
public schools to strap him into his surgical support…

417
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,126
I told you that in confidence…!

418
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:23,917
… in gloves.

419
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:25,584
Really?

420
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:29,917
- Darwin is not a buffoon.
- From your own lips!

421
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:34,084
He has slight problems of
adjustment to the modern age.

422
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,459
You are laughing.

423
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:43,251
I'm not laughing.

424
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:47,209
There is a slight smile at
the corner of your mouth.

425
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:51,042
No, there is not. There
is absolutely no smile.

426
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:56,709
Alice, I will paraphrase it.
Let me paraphrase Raymond's view of his boss.

427
00:45:56,751 --> 00:46:02,751
It is, in paraphrase, in sum… that he would not
trust him to stick his prick into a bucket of lard.

428
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,001
Well, is he a joke, or is he not?

429
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:09,209
Certainly he is a joke.

430
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:10,959
- Thank you.
- He's a joke between us.

431
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,459
He is not a joke to the entire world.

432
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,501
I think perhaps I'd better push off.

433
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,167
I wish you would stop using those words.

434
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:23,334
What?

435
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:28,126
Words… like "push off".
You're always saying it.

436
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:31,751
"Bit of tight corner"… "One hell of a spot".
They don't belong.

437
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,001
- What do you mean?
- They are not your words.

438
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,417
- Well, I'm none too keen on your words, either.
- Oh, yes... which?

439
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:41,584
- The words you've been using this evening.
- What... such as?

440
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:45,667
- You know perfectly well.
- No... come on, tell me, what words have I used?

441
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:51,751
Words like… "bucket of lard".

442
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,834
I don't know why
you let her live with you.

443
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:16,376
I like her.
She makes me laugh.

444
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:32,834
I'm sorry. I was awful. I apologise.

445
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:37,084
But the work I do is not
entirely contemptible.

446
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:42,167
Of course our people are dull.
They're stuffy, they're… death.

447
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:45,084
But what other world do I have?

448
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:49,667
I think of France more than I can tell you.

449
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:53,626
I often think of it.

450
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:56,376
- I'm sure.
- People I met for only an hour or two.

451
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:04,251
Great kindnesses. Bravery. The fact that you
could meet someone for an hour or two…

452
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:07,626
see the very best of them…

453
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:12,084
… and then move on.

454
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:15,417
Can you understand?

455
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:19,917
- Susan…
- I think that we should try a winter apart.

456
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:25,126
I really do. I think it's all a bit
easy this way. These weekends…

457
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:29,626
nothing is tested. A test would be good.

458
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:33,167
And what better test than a winter apart?

459
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:36,042
A winter together.

460
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:43,501
I would love to come to Brussels,
you know that. I would love to come…

461
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:45,792
if it weren't for my job.

462
00:48:46,709 --> 00:48:50,584
The shipping office is very important to me.
I do find the work fulfilling.

463
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:53,667
And I couldn't let Mr Medlicott down.

464
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:56,334
I know how you hate the winter crossings.

465
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:58,292
- High seas.
- Please don't patronise me, Susan…

466
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:01,501
Anyway, perhaps in the spring
it would be nice to meet.

467
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,542
Please... don't insult my intelligence.

468
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:06,834
I know you better than you think.

469
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:14,001
When you start talking longingly about
the war… some deception usually follows.

470
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:36,209
Goodbye.

471
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:19,167
The Coronation's rather a special affair…

472
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:25,334
- I do apologise.
- Good morning.

473
00:50:25,376 --> 00:50:28,959
I have the whole thing here, lunch
for six hundred. Tomorrow's menu.

474
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:33,167
I've checked titles in Debrett and
the precedence, as we discussed.

475
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:35,584
We were just talking about
the order of toasts.

476
00:50:35,626 --> 00:50:38,792
Ah, well, I've suggested the
loyal toast before the pudding…

477
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,917
… and leave all the others
till after the cheese.

478
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:43,334
I wonder, does anyone have any suggestions?

479
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,209
- Hello, how are you?
- Have I missed anything?

480
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:49,084
Nothing.

481
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:53,417
I was going to make the rather unconventional
suggestion that we split the toasts up.

482
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:58,834
Perhaps offer just one before we have our pudding,
then leave the others until the end of the meal.

483
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:01,959
An excellent suggestion
from Viscount Tampan.

484
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:05,001
- I trust we all agree.
- Yes, yes…

485
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,834
Now, there is the
question of police routing…

486
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:12,834
Gosh, I mean, didn't
that take the bally biscuit!

487
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:15,126
Oh, it was nothing. Honestly.

488
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:21,459
I was wondering... Susan, do you
have somewhere to watch tomorrow?

489
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:24,376
I was hoping you might be able to
come and watch the whole thing with me.

490
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:26,834
Mater and Pater have a house
right bang on the route.

491
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:30,834
- You'd get a really first-class view.
- Oh, Ashley, how nice. I'd really like it.

492
00:51:31,084 --> 00:51:33,459
- I'll ring you tomorrow, all right?
- Super.

493
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:44,376
Five hundred cheese graters?

494
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:51,751
I've got five hundred cheese graters
parked round the side. Interested?

495
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,501
No, I'm afraid you're too late.

496
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:57,417
- We took a consignment a week ago.
- Oh.

497
00:51:57,542 --> 00:52:01,459
But we are using your spoons
tomorrow, at our banquet.

498
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:04,834
- I wish I could see it.
- Yes. Yes, I wish you could, too.

499
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,334
Be out of a job after this, then?

500
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:16,417
Yes... well, I am. Ah, but I'm
thinking of going into advertising.

501
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,042
- Nice.
- Yes, I met some people on the Coronation Committee.

502
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:25,376
I doubt if it'll stretch me… but it
might be a way of having some fun.

503
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,917
So, you'd better tell me how I can help.

504
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:43,834
Well, I'm looking for a father.
I, erm, I want to have a child.

505
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:50,709
Look... it really is… much
easier than it sounds. I mean,

506
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,126
marriage is not involved…
or even looking after it. Er…

507
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,959
you don't even have to see the
pregnancy through. I mean…

508
00:52:58,001 --> 00:53:00,209
conception would be the end of the job.

509
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,709
You don't want to.

510
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:13,626
No... no, I'd be delighted.

511
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,709
I'm lucky to be asked.

512
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:19,292
Not at all.

513
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:26,792
It's just, um… your own people.
Friends... you must have friends?

514
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:30,292
- Yes, it's, um…
- I mean… no… go on, say.

515
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:35,751
Well… I'm afraid I'm quite
strong-minded, as you know…

516
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:41,917
and so with the men that I've met at
work, or… my friends, as you'd say…

517
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:48,042
I usually feel that I'm holding myself in for
fear of literally… blowing them out of the room.

518
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:55,126
I mean… they are kind… they are able, but… I
don't see why I should have to compromise.

519
00:53:56,084 --> 00:54:01,709
I don't see why I should have to make some sad
and… decorous marriage, just to have a child.

520
00:54:02,584 --> 00:54:04,959
I don't think any woman
should have to do that.

521
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:08,251
- You don't have to get married.
- Ah, well…

522
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:11,417
You just go off with 'em.
You don't tell 'em.

523
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:18,626
Yes, I did think that.
But then I thought it would be dishonest…

524
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:23,126
and so I had the idea of asking
someone whom I barely knew.

525
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:34,251
- I'd really like to know…
- Yes?

526
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:41,417
… why you chose me. I mean,
how often have you met me?

527
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:46,584
Yes… that's the whole point.

528
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:51,917
With Alice a few times?
Alice says what? I'm clean…

529
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:56,667
obedient… haven't got any
morons in the family…

530
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:00,959
- It's not as calculated as that.
- Not as calculated as that?

531
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:06,334
Several hundred of us, was there?
All got notes, did we…?

532
00:55:06,376 --> 00:55:07,834
No…

533
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:14,001
Saying "Come and meet me at the
Embankment… tell no-one… bring no friends…"

534
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,876
I thought with all this secrecy
you must at least be after nylons.

535
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:20,917
Oh, I'll buy nylons,
if that's what you want.

536
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:23,584
Why me?

537
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,959
- I like you.
- And…?

538
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:37,917
I love you. I chose you because
I don't see you very much...

539
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:47,209
barely ever see you. We live at opposite
ends of town. It's… different worlds.

540
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:51,376
- Different class.
- Yes. That comes into it.

541
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:08,751
- Five hundred cheese graters.
- How much?

542
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:15,084
Something over the odds.
Bit over the odds. Not much.

543
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:18,376
Done.

544
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:25,042
Don't worry.
The Coronation will pay.

545
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:48,126
- Great sky.
- Yes… it's a mackerel sky.

546
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:52,126
That's what they call it.
A mackerel sky…

547
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:58,001
It can't be what you want.
Not deep down.

548
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,126
No…

549
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:03,209
I didn't think so.

550
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:07,001
No… deep down, I'd do the
whole damn thing myself.

551
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:11,917
But there you are. You're second best.

552
00:58:33,459 --> 00:58:40,251
The hour of eleven is approaching, not only
in London but in every corner of the world.

553
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:45,959
The prayers and thoughts of the people
are centred onto this young Queen of England.

554
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:51,709
This gracious lady, upon whom such
burdens of responsibility are to rest,

555
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:55,709
and who bears them with such royal grace.

556
00:58:56,626 --> 00:58:58,042
The Queen.

557
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:08,292
Oh... sorry.

558
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:13,584
You all right?

559
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:17,001
Has your latest chum left you?

560
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:19,876
Yes, as they all do.

561
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:23,001
He went back to his wife.

562
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:29,626
I suppose if they didn't,
I'd stop wanting them.

563
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:37,084
I had this idea that lust…

564
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,084
that lust was very good.

565
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:45,001
And could be made simple
and cheering and light.

566
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,792
Perhaps I'm simply out of my time.

567
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:57,001
We ought to do something.
Why don't we go out?

568
01:00:58,667 --> 01:00:59,876
Mm.

569
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:06,667
What about you?

570
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:12,001
Oh, I need to move on.

571
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:19,792
Is that for you?

572
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:22,709
No. He's at home.

573
01:01:23,834 --> 01:01:26,584
Mm. Well, there are other people, you know.

574
01:01:47,959 --> 01:01:50,209
I've got so much work to do.

575
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:53,376
- Who was it?
- Nobody. Wrong house.

576
01:01:58,001 --> 01:01:59,876
What do you think?

577
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:07,626
I wish she were more, um… ordinary.

578
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:11,209
- Who?
- Well, that woman.

579
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:15,459
Dog's ordinary.

580
01:02:16,376 --> 01:02:21,501
Oh, God, yes… the dog's ordinary,
no question. I'm just worried…

581
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:24,001
will the audience identify?

582
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:28,542
Well, that depends, of course, how…
ordinary they are, really.

583
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:35,626
Does the dog bowl have to be pink?

584
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:48,084
… yes, the airbrushed ones…

585
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:49,792
Lovely lunch… come on…

586
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:54,334
It's good for you…

587
01:02:56,792 --> 01:02:59,084
All right, five minutes everybody.

588
01:02:59,501 --> 01:03:01,917
Get that bloody dog back!!

589
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:07,876
Can't something be
done about that dog?

590
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,417
- Please... can you stay?
- What do you mean?

591
01:03:10,459 --> 01:03:12,126
You can't just walk out.

592
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:15,126
I've put sirloin steak in the bowl
but the dog still won't go near it.

593
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,876
- You always walk out.
- What do you mean?

594
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:21,126
Look, if we just took
them out for a drink.

595
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:24,042
Do you have any idea of the
effort I've had to put into this?

596
01:03:24,126 --> 01:03:27,792
The price I have to pay for sitting
here pretending to be stupid all day.

597
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:32,001
For God's sake, Roland... look at that
reconstituted yuck. What's it made from?

598
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:34,959
Account executives' brains?
Is that how they make it?

599
01:03:36,042 --> 01:03:41,334
I have tried. I have. I have tried for months
to sink to the level of this enterprise.

600
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,626
Well, forget it.

601
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:46,959
The dog has taste.

602
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:49,209
I'm going to go home.

603
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:03,126
Hullo, Alice.

604
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,542
Mick... hello!

605
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:08,751
Gosh, how are you?
I haven't seen you for ages.

606
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:09,626
No.

607
01:04:10,334 --> 01:04:12,751
No, well, actually, I…
I was looking for Susan.

608
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,042
Susan?

609
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:16,334
Hello, Susan.

610
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:20,751
I thought I'd… come and
say Happy New Year.

611
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,834
I'll pay for this later.

612
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:30,042
Come on.

613
01:04:41,584 --> 01:04:43,126
Susan.
Please let me talk to you.

614
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,792
What possible good could it do?

615
01:04:48,834 --> 01:04:51,501
I asked Mick to father a child,
that's what we're talking about.

616
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,126
Oh, Christ!

617
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:55,167
Well, we have tried for over
eighteen months is that right?

618
01:04:55,209 --> 01:04:57,084
- Right.
- And we have failed…

619
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,709
which leaves us both feeling pretty stupid.

620
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:04,667
Pretty wretched, I should say… speaking
for myself. And there is a point of…

621
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:08,042
decency, at which the
experiment should stop.

622
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:15,542
- Susan…
- The idea was fun, it was simple.

623
01:05:15,584 --> 01:05:17,917
It depended on two adults
behaving like adults.

624
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,042
It just feels bad.

625
01:05:19,084 --> 01:05:20,709
- It feels very bad to be used…
- I would have stopped it months ago.

626
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,251
I would have stopped it
after the second month.

627
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:23,667
You come out feeling dirty.

628
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:26,126
Well, how do I feel?
What am I meant to feel?

629
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:30,084
Crawling about in your tiny bedroom… paper
thin walls, your mother sitting downstairs…

630
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,376
Keep my mum out of this.

631
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:34,084
Scrabbling about on bombsites,
d'you think I enjoy all that?

632
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:37,459
Yeah. Very much.
I think you do.

633
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:54,834
- Look, I just think that…
- I know what you think.

634
01:05:54,876 --> 01:05:56,834
You think I enjoy slumming around.

635
01:05:57,959 --> 01:06:00,626
Then why have I not looked
for another father?

636
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,792
Because the whole exploit…
has broken my heart.

637
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:08,167
You think it's my fault.

638
01:06:08,209 --> 01:06:12,709
Oh, Lord!
Is that what you're worried about?

639
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:15,126
You think it's something to do with me?

640
01:06:15,626 --> 01:06:21,417
That was part of it. Never having to have
to drag through this kind of IDIOT argument.

641
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:27,334
you don't under... you don't
understand the figures in my mind.

642
01:06:31,126 --> 01:06:33,709
Mick, will you go now, please?

643
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:38,376
You people are cruel. Both of you.

644
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:41,042
- Mick…
- You're cruel and dangerous.

645
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:46,084
And you fuck people up… this girl here with
her string of married men, all fucked up…

646
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:48,417
… all fucking ruined because of this tart.

647
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,626
And you…

648
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:53,376
You...

649
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:01,334
Jesus Christ!

650
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:04,792
Now…

651
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:09,126
if we are to consider the exchange of
trade delegations with Romania…

652
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:18,876
… then one of the… concessions… that we would
anticipate would be... a trade-weighted guarantee…

653
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:24,542
in the area of exports and rates of exchange…

654
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,667
to use the Mannhein comparison.

655
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:32,876
- Brock speaking.
- Raymond... it's Alice.

656
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:35,542
- Sorry?
- Alice, Alice Park.

657
01:08:24,459 --> 01:08:29,126
They waited all night in their
ships, till in the morning the signal came.

658
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:30,876
The invasion was on.

659
01:08:30,917 --> 01:08:33,001
British and French troops
were finally on the move.

660
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,834
- Excuse me, sir…
- The background to these events…

661
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:36,792
Do you want me to make up a bed for you?

662
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:38,584
No.

663
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:45,209
I'm going out to dinner.

664
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:54,792
Now, after the British decision
to take part in an invasion of Egypt,

665
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:57,376
back home the whole country is torn apart.

666
01:08:57,417 --> 01:09:01,001
There is uproar in Parliament...
and not just in Parliament.

667
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,542
In the street, stranger argues with stranger…

668
01:09:03,584 --> 01:09:09,417
… about the wisdom of a policy that has led to a pitch
of public dissent unknown for many generations.

669
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:12,709
Nationwide there is a feeling of shame.

670
01:09:12,751 --> 01:09:15,501
Condemned unanimously in the United Nations,

671
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:18,834
the British Government still insists
that it will see the operation through

672
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:23,626
in spite of world-wide criticism and its
isolation from its own American allies.

673
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,626
Tonight, as the military situation worsens…

674
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,626
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

675
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:36,292
- Thank you.
- Leonard.

676
01:09:36,334 --> 01:09:38,751
- How good of you to come.
- Not at all.

677
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:41,792
Our little gathering…
we scarcely dared hope. Please.

678
01:09:48,209 --> 01:09:51,417
- Leonard, you know Monsieur Aung, of course.
- Mr Darwin…

679
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:54,501
- Rangoon.
- Now First Secretary, Burmese Embassy.

680
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:58,917
An honour, a privilege… a moment
in my career. I shake your hand.

681
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:01,751
- Good, good. Well…
- Leonard, do sit down.

682
01:10:02,209 --> 01:10:03,709
Thank you.

683
01:10:04,751 --> 01:10:06,834
I'll just tell my wife
that you're all here.

684
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,292
She's coming.

685
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:16,876
Why isn't she here?

686
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,417
Is it affairs of state
that made you late?

687
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:23,042
Precisely.

688
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:24,626
Say no more.

689
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:27,042
At home you would
not be forgiven.

690
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:32,084
In Burma we say, "If you cannot
be on time, do not come at all."

691
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:34,126
Really?

692
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:35,667
Good evening.

693
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,209
Oh, hello, Alice.

694
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:41,501
Er, but, of course,
the English... it is different.

695
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:45,042
At your command... the lion
make its bed with the lamb.

696
01:10:45,126 --> 01:10:46,834
Hardly.

697
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:50,042
Ah... Darwin of Djakarta!

698
01:10:50,084 --> 01:10:53,209
To have met the man, to
have been alone with him.

699
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:55,834
I shall dine in on
this for many years.

700
01:10:55,959 --> 01:10:57,709
Dine out on this.

701
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:04,209
The English language... she is
a demanding mistress, yes?

702
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:05,501
If you like.

703
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:08,584
And… no-one
controls her so well as you, sir.

704
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:11,126
You beat her and the bitch obeys.

705
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:14,459
Good, good, the
language of the world.

706
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:17,917
Oh, Alice, I hear you...
you've become a teacher?

707
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:22,459
Only sort of a teacher:
I teach English to foreign students.

708
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:25,167
How very interesting.

709
01:11:25,251 --> 01:11:28,792
Not really. The only fun is
in trying to mislead them.

710
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:33,042
I tell them the English are a
cheerful and outgoing people.

711
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:39,626
When you first meet an Englishman for the first time you
must at once embrace him and kiss him on both cheeks.

712
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:42,417
Oh, really?

713
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:45,792
That's what I tell them.
Then I let them loose on the world.

714
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:48,751
Good evening, everyone.

715
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,709
Leonard… how good of
you to make an appearance.

716
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,376
I'm only sorry to
have been delayed.

717
01:11:55,459 --> 01:11:59,459
Brock says you're all ragged with fatigue. I
hear you've been having the most frightful week.

718
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:00,876
It has been. Yes.

719
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:04,417
Well, don't worry. Here at least you
can relax. You've met Monsieur Aung?

720
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:06,459
Indeed.

721
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:08,167
You can forget everything.

722
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:10,167
The words "Suez Canal"
will not be spoken.

723
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,959
That will be an enormous relief.

724
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:14,292
- They are banned, you will not hear them.
- Thank you, my dear.

725
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,542
"Nasser" … nobody will
mention his name.

726
01:12:16,584 --> 01:12:17,626
Quite.

727
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:21,667
nobody will say "blunder"
… or "folly"… or "fiasco"

728
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:24,459
Nobody will say… "international
laughing stock".

729
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,376
You are among friends, Leonard.

730
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,751
Shall we all have dinner?

731
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:36,001
No-one will say,
"death-rattle of the ruling class".

732
01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:39,667
We will stick our lips together
with marrons glacés.

733
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:43,501
I hope you understand.

734
01:13:03,626 --> 01:13:08,126
I'm sorry. I did ask her to calm down.
She's been giving me hell all week.

735
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:10,084
She knows how closely
you've been involved.

736
01:13:10,126 --> 01:13:12,376
Do you think we could leave the
subject, Brock? I'm eager for a drink.

737
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:13,584
Yes, of course.

738
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:15,459
Who on earth is
that appalling wog?

739
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:18,376
I mean, in all honesty, Raymond,
what are you trying to do to me?

740
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:19,542
I'm sorry, sir.

741
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:24,876
This week of all weeks. He had his tongue so far up my
fundament all you could see of him were the soles of his feet.

742
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:27,251
- And Madame Aung!
- I know.

743
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:31,042
Traditional dance, she tells us
about, in the highlands of Burma.

744
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,417
And the plot of Lohengrin.

745
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:47,334
Mental illness, is it, your wife?

746
01:13:48,084 --> 01:13:51,959
No... no, she just
feels very strongly.

747
01:13:52,042 --> 01:13:53,876
But has there been mental illness.

748
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:55,917
Not really. A breakdown.

749
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:57,209
Yes?

750
01:13:57,292 --> 01:14:01,834
Mm. She'd been
living… very foolishly.

751
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:04,959
A "loose set" in Pimlico.

752
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:07,126
A series of jobs. Not eating.

753
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:10,167
We got engaged when
she was still quite ill.

754
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:12,167
I've tried to help her back up.

755
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:14,001
Well, that sounds very good.

756
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:16,709
Second marriage, of
course, often stabilises…

757
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,001
What?

758
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,917
Well, the chap in
Brussels. The stiff.

759
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:22,709
Oh... yes.

760
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,959
You don't have to be ashamed.

761
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,751
I'm not, its…

762
01:14:26,876 --> 01:14:31,792
In the diplomatic service, it's not as if a mad
wife were any kind of professional disadvantage.

763
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,834
On the contrary... it almost
guarantees promotion.

764
01:14:35,126 --> 01:14:36,542
Yes, well…

765
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:40,501
Some of these senior men…
their wives are absolutely barking.

766
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:44,126
I take the word "gouache"
to be the giveaway.

767
01:14:44,459 --> 01:14:48,917
When they start drifting out of the room
saying "I'm just off to do my gouache, dear"…

768
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:52,376
then you know you've lost
them for good and all.

769
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,084
Yes, well…

770
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,584
Susan is not mad.

771
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,501
No. No.

772
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:05,042
Do you want to tell me what's upsetting you?

773
01:15:06,584 --> 01:15:08,584
Yes, I will tell you.

774
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:10,626
We have been betrayed.

775
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:16,709
We claim to be intervening as a neutral party
in a dispute between Israel and Egypt.

776
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:19,792
Last Monday the Israelis
launched their attack.

777
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:26,417
On Tuesday we issued our ultimatum, saying that
both sides withdraw to either side of the Canal.

778
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:32,001
But, Raymond, the Israelis, they
weren't anywhere near the Canal.

779
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,584
They'd have to advance a hundred
miles to make their retreat.

780
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:37,459
Who told you that?

781
01:15:38,626 --> 01:15:42,334
Last week the Foreign Secretary
went abroad. I was not briefed.

782
01:15:43,584 --> 01:15:48,876
We believe he met with the French and
the Israelis… urged the Israelis to attack.

783
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:53,292
I think the entire war is a fraud.

784
01:15:53,876 --> 01:15:56,917
Cooked up by the British as
an excuse for seizing the Canal.

785
01:15:57,292 --> 01:16:02,876
And we... we, who are to execute
this policy... even we were not told.

786
01:16:06,751 --> 01:16:08,917
Well… what difference
does it make?

787
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:10,959
My dear boy.

788
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:13,501
I mean it. It makes no difference.

789
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:14,959
I was lied to.

790
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,667
Yes, but you were against
it from the start. We all were.

791
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:22,584
The Foreign Office hated the operation from the very
first mention… so what difference does it make now?

792
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:24,459
All the difference in the world.

793
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:26,084
None at all.

794
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,959
The Government lied to me.
They are not in good faith.

795
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:31,459
I see…

796
01:16:31,626 --> 01:16:36,626
I see. So what you're saying is that the British may do anything,
doesn't matter how ludicrous, doesn't matter how silly…

797
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:38,542
so long as they do it in good faith.

798
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:44,959
Yes. I wouldn't have minded how damned stupid it was, I... I
would have even defended it if only it had been honestly done.

799
01:16:48,459 --> 01:16:50,459
But this time we're cowboys

800
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:55,917
And when the British are the cowboys…

801
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:59,126
then, in truth, I fear for
the future of the globe.

802
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,376
Are you going to resign?

803
01:17:16,334 --> 01:17:21,084
Madame Aung has been enthralling us with the
story of the new Bergman film at the Everyman.

804
01:17:21,959 --> 01:17:23,292
Ah…

805
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:24,501
Ah, yes.

806
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:27,876
Apparently it's about depression…
isn't that right, Madame Aung?

807
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:31,459
I do feel the Norwegians
are very good at that sort of thing.

808
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:36,751
Oh... I don't think we have
the whole attention of the men.

809
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,542
I'm sorry.

810
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:41,834
Yes, their minds are elsewhere.

811
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:43,959
They were probably drafting a telegram.

812
01:17:44,042 --> 01:17:47,667
That's what they do, before they
drop a bomb… along the Suez…

813
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:50,584
They send their targets
notice in a telegram.

814
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:53,376
Now, what does that indicate
to you, Monsieur Aung?

815
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:57,667
I'll tell you what it indicates
to me: bad conscience.

816
01:17:58,584 --> 01:18:01,417
They don't even have the guts
to make a war anymore.

817
01:18:02,376 --> 01:18:05,667
Perhaps Madame Aung will
tell us the story of the film.

818
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:08,709
It's something I'd be very eager…
… to hear.

819
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:12,792
I feel the others have already heard it.

820
01:18:12,876 --> 01:18:15,459
Oh, go ahead. We like
the bit in the mental ward.

821
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:16,709
Ah, yes…

822
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:20,167
Raymond'll like it.
He got me out of the bin… didn't you, dear?

823
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:21,501
Yes, yes.

824
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:25,084
That's where he proposed to me.
A moment of weakness… of mine, I mean.

825
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,876
Susan… please.

826
01:18:26,917 --> 01:18:29,376
I married him because he
reminded me of my father.

827
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:30,417
Really?

828
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:34,251
Yes, at that point I didn't realise
just what a shit my father was.

829
01:18:35,459 --> 01:18:38,542
Sorry she has a sort of psychiatric cabaret.

830
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:44,334
That's very good… There's
something about Suez which...

831
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:46,251
Will you please be quiet?

832
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:52,709
The story of the film?

833
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:55,751
There's a woman…

834
01:18:55,876 --> 01:18:57,709
… who despises her husband.

835
01:19:02,126 --> 01:19:04,001
Is it getting a bit chilly in here?

836
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:11,084
October nights.
Those poor parachutists…

837
01:19:12,126 --> 01:19:15,501
I do know how they feel. Even now.

838
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:23,876
Cities, fields, trees…
farms… dark spaces…

839
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:32,001
lights. The parachute
opens. We descend.

840
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:42,251
Of course, we were comparatively welcome. I mean... we did make
it our business to land in countries where we were wanted.

841
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:48,584
Certainly the men were. Some of
the relationships... I can't tell you…

842
01:19:48,626 --> 01:19:54,459
I remember a colleague telling me of the heat…
of the... smell of a particular young girl.

843
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:58,626
The hot, wet, smell, he said…

844
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:04,376
and nothing since.
Nothing since then.

845
01:20:05,084 --> 01:20:11,334
I can't see the Egyptian girls,
somehow… no. Not in Egypt. Not now.

846
01:20:13,751 --> 01:20:16,251
I mean, there were broken
hearts when we left.

847
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:22,167
I mean, there are girls today who mourn
Englishmen who died in Dachau…

848
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:28,667
who died naked in Dachau. Men with
whom they had spent a single night.

849
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:40,001
Well… even for myself, I do like to make a
point of… sleeping with people I don't know.

850
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:45,126
I find, once you get to know them, you
don't want to sleep with them anymore.

851
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:49,792
Please, can you stop. Can you stop fucking
talking for five fucking minutes on end.

852
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:51,417
Well, I would stop, I would stop.

853
01:20:51,459 --> 01:20:56,792
I would stop fucking talking if I ever heard anybody
else say anything worth fucking stopping talking for!

854
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:02,251
I'm sorry. I apologise.
I really must go.

855
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,626
Monsieur Aung, farewell.

856
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:11,959
We are behind you, sir.
There is wisdom in your expedition.

857
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:13,209
Thank you.

858
01:21:13,251 --> 01:21:17,376
May I say, sir… these Gyps need
whipping, and you are the man to do it.

859
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:20,251
Thank you very much, Monsieur.
Madame Aung…

860
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,001
We never really met.

861
01:21:23,126 --> 01:21:25,251
No, no, we never
really met, that's true.

862
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:30,209
Nevertheless, before I go perhaps I might be
permitted to put you right on a point of fact:

863
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:36,501
Ingmar Berman is not a bloody
Norwegian. He is a bloody Swede.

864
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:39,876
Goodnight, everybody.

865
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,501
He's going to resign.

866
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:58,834
Ah! Isn't this an exciting week!

867
01:22:00,459 --> 01:22:03,042
Don't you think? I mean,
isn't this thrilling?

868
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:07,417
Everything is up for grabs. At last.
We will see come changes. Thank the Lord.

869
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:15,209
Now, I can get you more dinner. There's ham and
chicken, and... pickles, and lettuce, and tomatoes…

870
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:21,459
… and there are a couple of pheasants in the fridge. Ooh... and there
are bottles and bottles and bottles of claret from the cellar.

871
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:24,459
Why not? There is plenty.

872
01:22:26,584 --> 01:22:28,251
Shall we eat again?

873
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:19,917
Welcome, Miss Park.

874
01:23:19,959 --> 01:23:21,334
Hello.

875
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:33,292
Mrs Brock will be down.
She always rests in this part of the day.

876
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:37,042
In the afternoon?

877
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:41,667
Yes. And the morning. She
rests in her room until dusk.

878
01:23:42,501 --> 01:23:44,834
She finds the light too disturbing.

879
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:47,084
And Raymond?

880
01:23:47,209 --> 01:23:48,834
Please wait.

881
01:23:57,084 --> 01:23:58,501
Miss Park is here.

882
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:01,834
Tell her I'll be with her soon.

883
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:03,542
Right, sir.

884
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,959
Please. Mr Brock will be with you soon.

885
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:55,501
Susan! There you are!

886
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:02,876
Alice! Oh, Alice!
how nice to see you.

887
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:04,709
Gosh, how exciting.

888
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:08,626
Oh, excuse me, I've just been…
sorting these books out.

889
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:10,459
Why, Alice.

890
01:25:10,501 --> 01:25:12,251
Raymond, hello!

891
01:25:12,751 --> 01:25:14,084
You all right, darling?

892
01:25:14,126 --> 01:25:16,542
Yes, thank you, I'm fine.

893
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:19,876
Susan's lifeline: her room full of books.

894
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:25,501
I can't tell you have much we've been looking forward
to your visit. It's ages since we saw anyone.

895
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:28,417
I'm not surprised, Jesus,
the price of the tickets!

896
01:25:28,542 --> 01:25:31,917
Well, well, if you need money…
… you must ask us.

897
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:36,542
No, I'm not…
I didn't mean that.

898
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:44,292
Susan. So, tell me about it.
How's it been? Has it been fun here?

899
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:46,917
God, I've missed you.
I'm longing to hear everything.

900
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:50,042
Well, I'm very happy.

901
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:54,417
Darling, could you pass
me that book, please?

902
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:26,834
It's extraordinary... a perfect amphitheatre.

903
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:31,292
It's a style that's been around for almost
two thousand years, and it's still there.

904
01:26:31,459 --> 01:26:33,376
Really it's extraordinary.

905
01:26:33,459 --> 01:26:35,292
Can we get out and have a look?

906
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:38,126
Get out? Well, yes.

907
01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:44,792
Are you not coming?

908
01:26:44,917 --> 01:26:46,084
I've seen it.

909
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,459
I'd rather stay.

910
01:27:17,834 --> 01:27:20,834
I'm afraid we've fallen into
bad habits here at night-time.

911
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:22,667
We like to play Scrabble.

912
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:24,334
Lord, no!

913
01:27:24,376 --> 01:27:30,209
Yes… Do you play? Susan will never
forgive me. Last week I got "juxtapose".

914
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:32,126
Mmm…? Unbelievable.

915
01:27:32,209 --> 01:27:36,084
Nine letters including the "J" and the "X".
Which, I'm afraid, was on a triple.

916
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,042
It's almost unheard of!

917
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:40,584
Well, one day, no doubt,
she'll get her revenge.

918
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:44,626
D'you think this is best?

919
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,542
What? What do you mean?

920
01:27:47,959 --> 01:27:49,584
For Susan.

921
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:51,584
No... let her say.

922
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:54,334
Sedation.

923
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:56,667
Look…

924
01:27:57,626 --> 01:28:00,417
I don't like the life people
live now in London.

925
01:28:00,584 --> 01:28:04,584
All that money... does
nobody good. It rots them.

926
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:07,167
Does untold damage,
as well you know.

927
01:28:08,084 --> 01:28:15,084
Life becomes… excitable, and flashy.
Decadent. Frenzied. Diseased.

928
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:19,917
Here, there is peace and
quiet. A level way of living.

929
01:28:21,376 --> 01:28:23,792
I think you'll find it suits
Susan very well.

930
01:28:23,834 --> 01:28:25,334
If you call it "living".

931
01:28:25,376 --> 01:28:28,209
And the country itself is so…
… extraordinarily fascinating.

932
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:30,751
You could spend a lifetime
here and still not get to know it.

933
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:33,792
Which is why we're so pleased we're staying.

934
01:28:35,126 --> 01:28:37,584
Our tour has been extended another two years.

935
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:50,167
I've left my job.

936
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:51,917
Oh, really?

937
01:28:52,001 --> 01:28:54,376
Being a teacher; I decided
to throw it all in.

938
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:57,709
I'm starting a home for women who
are victims of domestic violence.

939
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,251
Really?

940
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,959
A place where they
can be safe from their husbands.

941
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:07,959
What a wonderful idea.
What will you do?

942
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:12,667
I'll run it. I will. I've decided
it's time… to do good.

943
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:19,751
What was that phrase about…
… "having to move on"?

944
01:29:20,751 --> 01:29:22,417
Oh, yes.

945
01:29:23,501 --> 01:29:27,376
I felt such relief. Just
for a while not to think of yourself.

946
01:29:29,959 --> 01:29:31,917
Shall we go back to the car?

947
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:34,251
Hm.

948
01:29:57,584 --> 01:29:59,376
It's what I want to do.

949
01:30:00,209 --> 01:30:02,792
Please, Susan, let's
just sit and talk about this!

950
01:30:02,876 --> 01:30:04,709
No. Not just at the moment.

951
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:06,584
Please, if we can...just talk it over.

952
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:11,251
Susan. Susan. Come back!

953
01:30:14,459 --> 01:30:17,292
Raymond. Raymond,
what's happening?

954
01:30:19,584 --> 01:30:21,417
Leonard Darwin is dead.

955
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,959
Oh, no. Awful.

956
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:27,959
Susan wants to go to the
funeral. In England.

957
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:33,251
Damn you. This is your fault.

958
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:43,417
Man, that is born of woman,
hath but a short time to live.

959
01:30:44,626 --> 01:30:47,501
He cometh up, and is
cut down like a flower.

960
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:51,792
He fleeth and never continueth in one stay.

961
01:30:53,542 --> 01:30:56,334
In the midst of life… we are in death.

962
01:30:58,042 --> 01:31:01,376
Of whom may we seek
for succour… but of thee, O Lord,

963
01:31:02,126 --> 01:31:04,876
… who for our sins are justly displeased…

964
01:31:07,709 --> 01:31:10,251
Even when you die
they don't forgive you.

965
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:16,792
He spoke his mind over Suez.
That's why nobody is here today.

966
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:45,251
I knew if I came over
I would never return.

967
01:32:09,084 --> 01:32:13,417
Darling, I think the driver is ready. We have to
be at Heathrow. We've only an hour… to get there…

968
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:15,751
Raymond, I've decided to stay.

969
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:22,167
Please, before you say anything,
if you could just… think about it.

970
01:32:23,459 --> 01:32:25,542
I knew we were going to be
treated to some such nonsense.

971
01:32:25,626 --> 01:32:26,751
Not at all.

972
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:28,584
I have to tell you that
this is out of the question…

973
01:32:29,626 --> 01:32:32,292
Have you any idea of the
implications of what you're suggesting?

974
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:10,126
Now, who do you know?

975
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:12,209
I'm sure you'll see some familiar faces.

976
01:33:14,959 --> 01:33:16,834
Hang on... I'll just get you a drink.

977
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:20,251
… and Tony died?

978
01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:21,917
Yes, that's right.

979
01:33:21,959 --> 01:33:24,667
In Brussels?
And you were with him?

980
01:33:24,959 --> 01:33:26,542
Was he your best friend?

981
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:30,876
He was my only friend.
Apart from one other.

982
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,959
And it doesn't look as
if he's coming today.

983
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:48,542
You were one of the few women in
Special Operations to be flown into France?

984
01:33:48,626 --> 01:33:49,917
Yes.

985
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:55,251
And, er... one of the youngest. At the time,
what did you feel you were fighting for?

986
01:33:56,876 --> 01:33:59,251
Well, I suppose we were
fighting for freedom.

987
01:34:01,376 --> 01:34:04,626
But, I'm not saying… um, please,
it wasn't a grand idea.

988
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:08,417
It was in us.
It was bred in us.

989
01:34:09,001 --> 01:34:12,001
We were fighting for a world
which could be better.

990
01:34:12,542 --> 01:34:15,417
I suppose, in spite of everything,
you must miss those days.

991
01:34:16,376 --> 01:34:20,667
Not really, no. We don't
think about them much.

992
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:34,292
Sir Andrew will see you now, Mrs Brock.

993
01:34:35,834 --> 01:34:37,959
He only has a few moments, I'm afraid.

994
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:44,126
Ah, Mrs Brock.

995
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:45,376
Sir Andrew.

996
01:34:45,417 --> 01:34:46,584
How do you do?

997
01:34:46,626 --> 01:34:49,292
We have met. The Queen's garden party.

998
01:34:49,376 --> 01:34:51,001
That's right.

999
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:54,834
And I heard you on the wireless only recently…
how extraordinary it must have been.

1000
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:57,834
This must seem a very strange request.

1001
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:00,001
If you could leave us, Begley.

1002
01:35:00,084 --> 01:35:01,334
Sir.

1003
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:04,626
Just shuffle some paper for a while.

1004
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:16,542
Sir Andrew, as you know, I take very little
interest in my husband's professional life…

1005
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:17,959
Indeed.

1006
01:35:18,001 --> 01:35:22,792
… but... for the first time in my husband's career
I am beginning to feel the need to intervene.

1007
01:35:23,251 --> 01:35:25,167
I had a message, yes.

1008
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:27,709
I hope you appreciate my loyalty…

1009
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:30,167
- Oh, yes.
- … coming here at all.

1010
01:35:30,584 --> 01:35:33,959
Brock is a man who has seen
me through some very difficult times.

1011
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:35,834
I am told.

1012
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:38,626
But this is a matter on
which I need to go behind his back.

1013
01:35:41,334 --> 01:35:45,959
It's my impression that since our recall from
Jordan he is in some way being penalised.

1014
01:35:47,501 --> 01:35:53,501
I do understand the Foreign Service now; I know my
husband could never come to ask what his prospects are.

1015
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:59,792
Signs… indications are all you are given.
Your stock is rising; your stock is falling.

1016
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:01,459
Yes.

1017
01:36:04,042 --> 01:36:07,542
Brock has been
allocated to a fairly lowly job…

1018
01:36:07,751 --> 01:36:10,126
backing up the EEC negotiating team.

1019
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:11,751
He's part of
the push into Europe, yes.

1020
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:15,292
And the foreign posts he's since
been offered have not been glittering.

1021
01:36:15,334 --> 01:36:17,542
We offered him Monrovia.

1022
01:36:17,584 --> 01:36:21,209
Monrovia. Yes. He took
that to be an insult.

1023
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:23,459
Was he wrong?

1024
01:36:24,001 --> 01:36:25,917
Monrovia… is not an insult.

1025
01:36:27,001 --> 01:36:28,084
But…?

1026
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:30,584
Monrovia… is more in
the nature of a test.

1027
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:34,084
A test of nerve, it's true. If a man is
stupid enough to accept Monrovia…

1028
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:38,709
then he probably deserves
Monrovia. That is how we think.

1029
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:40,542
But you...

1030
01:36:40,626 --> 01:36:42,501
And Brock refused.

1031
01:36:42,917 --> 01:36:46,001
Had we wanted to insult him
there are far worse jobs.

1032
01:36:46,084 --> 01:36:47,876
And in this building, too.

1033
01:36:48,001 --> 01:36:50,792
In my view, town-twinning
is the coup de grace.

1034
01:36:50,834 --> 01:36:54,709
I'd rather be a martyr to the tsetse fly than
have to twin Rotherham with Bergen op Zoom.

1035
01:36:55,084 --> 01:36:56,792
You are evading me.

1036
01:36:57,626 --> 01:37:00,459
I'm sorry. It's a habit,
as you might say.

1037
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:06,167
Your husband has never
been a flier, Mrs Brock.

1038
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:11,167
Everyone is streamed.
A slow stream, a fast stream.

1039
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:12,584
My husband is "slow"?

1040
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:14,042
Slow-ish.

1041
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:19,542
Well, what is he? First Secretary struggling towards
counsellor. At 41, it's not remarkable, you know.

1042
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:20,917
- But it's got worse.
- You think?

1043
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:23,834
In the last six months. He's never
been excluded from his work before.

1044
01:37:23,876 --> 01:37:25,584
Oh, does he feel that?

1045
01:37:26,584 --> 01:37:28,334
I think you know he does.

1046
01:37:29,334 --> 01:37:32,167
Well, I'm sure the intention
was not to punish him.

1047
01:37:33,917 --> 01:37:36,584
We have had some trouble
placing him; it's true.

1048
01:37:37,126 --> 01:37:39,334
The rather startling decision
to desert his post.

1049
01:37:43,001 --> 01:37:44,584
That was not his fault.

1050
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:45,959
We were told.

1051
01:37:46,209 --> 01:37:49,751
We were sympathetic.
Psychiatric reasons…

1052
01:37:49,834 --> 01:37:52,417
I was daunted at the prospect
of returning to Jordan.

1053
01:37:52,459 --> 01:37:56,876
Or course. Arab psychiatry… I shudder at the
thought. A heavy-handed people at the best of times.

1054
01:37:56,959 --> 01:38:01,251
Look, we understood. Family problems.
Our sympathy goes out…

1055
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:03,917
But you are blocking his advance.

1056
01:38:04,084 --> 01:38:06,792
Mrs Brock. Believe me,
I recognise your tone.

1057
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:09,959
Women have come in
here and used it before.

1058
01:38:10,001 --> 01:38:12,876
I am very keen he should
not suffer on my account.

1059
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:16,876
I also have read the stories in your file,
so nothing in your manner is likely to amaze.

1060
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:21,751
When you have chosen a particular course, when
there is something that you very badly want…

1061
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:27,292
but in this matter I must tell you, Mrs Brock,
it is more than likely you have met your match.

1062
01:38:29,959 --> 01:38:32,667
We are speaking
of achievement at the highest level.

1063
01:38:33,376 --> 01:38:36,084
No-one can be
expect to be cosseted, through.

1064
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:40,959
It's not enough to be… clever.
Everyone here is clever; everyone is gifted…

1065
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:47,667
… everyone is diligent. These are simply the minimum
skills. Far more important… is an attitude of mind.

1066
01:38:51,251 --> 01:38:59,334
Along the corridor, I boast a colleague who in 1945 advised the
Government not to accept the Volkswagen works as war reparation…

1067
01:39:00,126 --> 01:39:03,126
as the Volkswagen plainly
had no commercial future.

1068
01:39:05,084 --> 01:39:09,834
I must tell you, unlikely as it may seem,
that man has risen to the very, very top.

1069
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:13,667
Perhaps you begin to understand.

1070
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:14,709
You are saying…

1071
01:39:14,751 --> 01:39:19,001
I am saying that certain qualities are valued here
above a simple gift for being right or wrong.

1072
01:39:20,751 --> 01:39:23,334
Qualities… that
are sometimes hard to define.

1073
01:39:23,376 --> 01:39:27,834
What you are saying is that nobody
may speak. Nobody may question.

1074
01:39:29,209 --> 01:39:32,042
Certainly tact is valued very high.

1075
01:39:33,042 --> 01:39:40,251
Sir Andrew. Do you never find it in yourself to despise
a profession in which nobody may speak their mind?

1076
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:44,376
But that is the nature
of the service, Mrs Brock.

1077
01:39:45,001 --> 01:39:46,959
It is called "diplomacy".

1078
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:51,667
And in its practice the
English lead the world.

1079
01:39:55,751 --> 01:40:00,792
The irony is… when there was an Empire to administer
there was six-hundred of us in this place.

1080
01:40:02,334 --> 01:40:05,001
Now it's to be dismantled,
and there are six thousand.

1081
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:12,917
As our power declines, the fight among us for access to that
power becomes a little more urgent, a little more ugly, perhaps.

1082
01:40:14,209 --> 01:40:17,584
As our Empire collapses,
there is little to believe in.

1083
01:40:18,584 --> 01:40:20,542
Behaviour… is all.

1084
01:40:23,334 --> 01:40:25,751
This is a lesson which
you both must learn.

1085
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:27,667
I must thank you for
your frankness, Sir Andrew.

1086
01:40:27,709 --> 01:40:28,876
Not at all.

1087
01:40:29,084 --> 01:40:31,626
I must, however, warn you of my plan.

1088
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:38,376
If Brock is not promoted within the next…
six days… I am intending to shoot myself.

1089
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:43,709
Now, thank you, and I shan't stay for the drink.
I'm due for a reception for Australia Day.

1090
01:40:43,751 --> 01:40:44,834
Begley.

1091
01:40:44,876 --> 01:40:46,834
I always like to see just
how rude I can be.

1092
01:40:46,959 --> 01:40:51,417
Not that the Australians ever notice, so it does
become a sort of Zen sport… don't you think?

1093
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:54,542
John, I wonder, could you give me a hand.
If you could take Mrs Brock to the surgery.

1094
01:40:54,584 --> 01:40:58,459
Oh, no, people will be waiting for
me at Australia House. I can't let them down.

1095
01:40:58,542 --> 01:41:01,751
It will be packed full of angry
people, all searching for me, all saying…

1096
01:41:01,876 --> 01:41:06,292
"Where… where is she…? What a let down. I only came
here to be insulted and now there's no chance…"

1097
01:41:06,334 --> 01:41:08,376
Leave me alone!

1098
01:41:10,584 --> 01:41:12,792
I think you have destroyed my husband…

1099
01:41:14,292 --> 01:41:15,709
you see?

1100
01:41:31,209 --> 01:41:33,209
Tea, I think, Miss Simpson.

1101
01:41:35,459 --> 01:41:37,792
Begley, will you get
me Raymond Brock's file?

1102
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:39,292
Yes, sir.

1103
01:41:54,959 --> 01:41:56,501
You all right, darling?

1104
01:41:56,542 --> 01:41:58,501
Yes, fine.

1105
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:00,542
Been out?

1106
01:42:01,126 --> 01:42:02,501
To the pictures.

1107
01:42:04,376 --> 01:42:05,584
Goodnight.

1108
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:06,792
Goodnight.

1109
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,917
- Good morning, Margaret.
- Good morning, Mr Brock

1110
01:42:22,459 --> 01:42:27,459
Now, I know we're all aching to get away for the weekend… but
I'm afraid we're going to have to give this most of the day.

1111
01:42:28,084 --> 01:42:32,584
EEC fishing policy:
theory and practice. All right?

1112
01:42:41,126 --> 01:42:43,542
So, if we look at
page thirty of the briefing…

1113
01:42:46,626 --> 01:42:48,584
I beg your pardon, Raymond.

1114
01:43:12,667 --> 01:43:14,001
Brock, sir.

1115
01:43:14,542 --> 01:43:16,167
Ah, Brock.

1116
01:43:17,792 --> 01:43:20,334
I need to talk to you
about the incident yesterday.

1117
01:43:20,542 --> 01:43:21,876
Incident?

1118
01:43:22,501 --> 01:43:24,709
These are the pension scheme
details you asked for.

1119
01:43:25,001 --> 01:43:26,667
Do you want drinks sent in, sir?

1120
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:28,084
What incident is this?

1121
01:43:28,126 --> 01:43:30,084
No, it's not going to take long.

1122
01:44:49,167 --> 01:44:52,166
I need to ask you to move out of here.

1123
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:54,667
I'm in temporary need of this room.

1124
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:56,375
You can go wherever you like.

1125
01:44:56,376 --> 01:44:58,584
And pretty soon also
you're welcome to return.

1126
01:45:00,209 --> 01:45:02,334
You'd better tell me what
you've done to your hand.

1127
01:45:02,376 --> 01:45:05,417
Well, oh… I've been
taking some paper from the walls.

1128
01:45:07,709 --> 01:45:09,459
What have you actually done?

1129
01:45:10,376 --> 01:45:13,126
You're always telling me
how bad money is for us…

1130
01:45:13,542 --> 01:45:17,376
you yourself say it… it's money
that does it, it's money that rots.

1131
01:45:17,501 --> 01:45:21,459
Well, then, isn't this the moment
for one small gesture?

1132
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:25,876
Now… what's the best
way to start stripping this room?

1133
01:45:26,834 --> 01:45:30,334
Susan. Please. There
is some Nembutal in the desk.

1134
01:45:30,376 --> 01:45:33,084
The… lease on this
house... what, six years, is it?

1135
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:35,167
It's, it's perfect for Alice…

1136
01:45:36,084 --> 01:45:39,834
… suit her needs… all
her homeless mothers.

1137
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:42,334
This place would be just the thing.

1138
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:49,334
If we laid out mattresses…
mattresses on the floor… by our own hands…

1139
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:51,501
of our own free will.

1140
01:45:53,126 --> 01:45:56,876
An Iranian vase. A small wooden Buddha.

1141
01:45:57,584 --> 01:46:01,376
Twelve marble birds,
copied from an Ottoman king.

1142
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:04,084
What possible
use can they be to us?

1143
01:46:04,417 --> 01:46:07,292
Look. Look out the window!
Throw them all away.

1144
01:46:08,292 --> 01:46:12,459
Cutlery, crockery, lampshades,
books, books, books…

1145
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:16,334
Encyclopaedias, clutter. Meaningless.

1146
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:24,001
A universe of things.

1147
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:31,376
Mosquito nets, golf clubs, china,
marble, glass. Mementoes in stone…

1148
01:46:31,834 --> 01:46:34,126
What is this shit?

1149
01:46:34,417 --> 01:46:38,126
What are these godforsaken
bloody awful things?

1150
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:43,792
Your life is… selfish… self-interested gain.

1151
01:46:43,917 --> 01:46:46,667
That is the most charitable
interpretation to hand.

1152
01:46:46,709 --> 01:46:50,126
You claim to be protecting
some personal ideal…

1153
01:46:50,209 --> 01:46:54,334
always at a cost of almost infinite
pain to everyone around you.

1154
01:46:54,792 --> 01:46:58,917
You are selfish…
brutish… unkind.

1155
01:46:59,126 --> 01:47:04,417
Jealous of other people's happiness as well, determined
to destroy other ways of happiness they find.

1156
01:47:05,292 --> 01:47:09,917
I've spent fifteen years of
my life trying to help you…

1157
01:47:10,417 --> 01:47:12,584
just trying to be kind.

1158
01:47:12,876 --> 01:47:17,417
And my great comfort has been that I
was waiting for some indication from you…

1159
01:47:17,542 --> 01:47:21,834
some sign, perhaps, that you
valued this kindness of mine.

1160
01:47:22,917 --> 01:47:24,959
Some love... perhaps?

1161
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,209
Insane.

1162
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:39,584
And yet, I shan't really ever give up.

1163
01:47:40,209 --> 01:47:42,751
I won't surrender till
you're well again.

1164
01:47:42,834 --> 01:47:48,876
And that, to me, would mean your admitting one thing:
that in the life you have lived, you have utterly failed.

1165
01:47:49,251 --> 01:47:52,834
Failed in the very,
very heart of your life.

1166
01:47:53,042 --> 01:47:56,542
Admit that, and then you
might really move on.

1167
01:48:00,167 --> 01:48:04,834
Which is the braver, to live as I do…
or never, ever to face life, like you?

1168
01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:09,417
This is the doctor's number, my dear.
With my permission, he can put you inside.

1169
01:48:11,667 --> 01:48:14,959
I plan to play as
dirtily and ruthlessly as you.

1170
01:48:15,334 --> 01:48:17,917
And this time I'm not giving in.

1171
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:41,917
It's Easter weekend.
The doctor's away.

1172
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:49,292
Susan, please…

1173
01:48:51,751 --> 01:48:53,417
Susan!

1174
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:09,084
Oh…

1175
01:49:11,001 --> 01:49:13,084
Raymond…

1176
01:49:14,084 --> 01:49:16,292
Raymond… look at me.

1177
01:52:06,209 --> 01:52:11,126
Don't... don't take your clothes
off, whatever you do.

1178
01:52:12,292 --> 01:52:14,334
No. 'Course not.

1179
01:52:14,667 --> 01:52:16,667
That would spoil it
hopelessly for me.

1180
01:52:16,709 --> 01:52:19,042
No, I'm just going
to get my cigarettes.

1181
01:52:19,917 --> 01:52:21,459
I roll my own, you know.

1182
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:24,917
Goodness me.

1183
01:52:24,959 --> 01:52:27,834
I tell you, there are no
fucking flies on me.

1184
01:52:41,959 --> 01:52:43,876
Do you know how I found you?

1185
01:52:43,959 --> 01:52:45,251
Umm…?

1186
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:47,209
Through the BBC.

1187
01:52:48,667 --> 01:52:51,167
I just happened to catch
that programme, a few months ago.

1188
01:52:53,876 --> 01:52:56,251
They told me you were
married and living in London now.

1189
01:52:57,209 --> 01:52:58,834
They gave me an address.

1190
01:52:58,959 --> 01:53:01,209
No, I left it weeks ago.

1191
01:53:02,584 --> 01:53:05,459
Yes, I know. I went round.

1192
01:53:08,459 --> 01:53:10,626
I went round and saw the man.

1193
01:53:13,709 --> 01:53:15,917
Was he angry?

1194
01:53:16,584 --> 01:53:19,751
Angry? No. He just seemed…

1195
01:53:19,959 --> 01:53:22,251
very sorry not to be with you.

1196
01:53:32,459 --> 01:53:34,876
Listen, I have to tell you…

1197
01:53:36,542 --> 01:53:38,542
I've not always been well.

1198
01:53:40,084 --> 01:53:44,251
I have a weakness.
I like to lose control.

1199
01:53:46,042 --> 01:53:47,501
And…

1200
01:53:49,084 --> 01:53:51,167
and I've been letting it happen…

1201
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:54,751
well, a number of times.

1202
01:53:56,292 --> 01:53:59,001
I did actually shoot someone
about eight years ago.

1203
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:00,876
Goodness me…

1204
01:54:00,959 --> 01:54:02,709
… did you hurt him?

1205
01:54:02,751 --> 01:54:04,959
Fortunately, no.

1206
01:54:05,459 --> 01:54:08,167
At least, that's what
we kept telling him.

1207
01:54:10,042 --> 01:54:13,042
Raymond went round, gave
him some money in notes.

1208
01:54:15,834 --> 01:54:19,209
It was after Raymond's kindness
that I felt I had to get engaged.

1209
01:54:22,084 --> 01:54:23,167
Why do people...

1210
01:54:25,042 --> 01:54:26,417
What?

1211
01:54:27,626 --> 01:54:28,834
Marry?

1212
01:54:31,667 --> 01:54:33,667
I don't know.

1213
01:54:36,042 --> 01:54:37,709
Are you?

1214
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:39,417
What?

1215
01:54:39,459 --> 01:54:40,959
No. It's…

1216
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:43,751
- Go on, ask me anything at all.
- … nothing. I don't want to know.

1217
01:54:48,084 --> 01:54:50,001
Do you still see him?

1218
01:54:51,459 --> 01:54:53,167
Gracious, no.

1219
01:54:54,459 --> 01:54:57,084
I've stripped away everything,
everything I've known.

1220
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:02,834
The only dignity is in living alone.

1221
01:55:04,667 --> 01:55:07,251
The clothes you stand in…

1222
01:55:07,376 --> 01:55:09,376
and the world you can see.

1223
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:12,334
Oh, Susan…

1224
01:55:12,417 --> 01:55:14,251
Don't. Please, don't.

1225
01:55:16,376 --> 01:55:18,834
I want to believe in you.

1226
01:55:19,876 --> 01:55:21,626
So tell me nothing.

1227
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:25,001
That's best.

1228
01:55:26,792 --> 01:55:29,626
Someone gave me this grass.
D'you want some?

1229
01:55:30,334 --> 01:55:31,709
No.

1230
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:43,917
I don't know what I'd expected…

1231
01:55:45,292 --> 01:55:47,792
what I'd… hoped for
at the time I returned.

1232
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:54,542
Some sort of… edge to the
life that I lead. Some…

1233
01:55:55,001 --> 01:55:57,792
some sort of feeling that
their death was worthwhile.

1234
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:10,542
Someday I must tell you…

1235
01:56:11,042 --> 01:56:12,751
I haven't done well.

1236
01:56:14,542 --> 01:56:17,751
I gave in. Always.

1237
01:56:18,376 --> 01:56:20,834
All along the line.

1238
01:56:20,917 --> 01:56:22,584
Suburb.

1239
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:24,209
Wife.

1240
01:56:34,667 --> 01:56:38,126
I work for a corporate bureaucracy as well.

1241
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:40,709
Oh, Lazar, I'm sorry.

1242
01:56:41,209 --> 01:56:43,209
I'm just about to go.

1243
01:56:44,709 --> 01:56:47,626
I've eaten nothing so I just…

1244
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:49,167
go.

1245
01:56:58,709 --> 01:57:00,709
I hate this life that we lead.

1246
01:57:00,792 --> 01:57:03,042
Oh, God… here I go.

1247
01:57:06,167 --> 01:57:07,542
Kiss me.

1248
01:59:22,251 --> 01:59:23,876
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1249
01:59:24,042 --> 01:59:25,417
Bonjour!

1250
01:59:25,459 --> 01:59:27,126
You're looking at the village?

1251
01:59:27,167 --> 01:59:28,501
Yes

1252
01:59:28,667 --> 01:59:32,376
I've climbed the hill to
have a better view.

1253
01:59:32,667 --> 01:59:35,042
I've climbed the hill to
have a better view.

1254
01:59:37,167 --> 01:59:39,959
I've only spoken French
for months on end.

1255
01:59:40,626 --> 01:59:43,417
You are English? So young!

1256
01:59:43,501 --> 01:59:44,751
Just so.

1257
01:59:44,834 --> 01:59:47,126
You are glad the war is over, eh?

1258
01:59:47,209 --> 01:59:49,334
You will soon be going home?

1259
01:59:49,417 --> 01:59:50,626
Yes. At last.

1260
01:59:50,667 --> 01:59:52,251
You go to the party for the victory?

1261
01:59:52,292 --> 01:59:55,167
Soon, yes, I'm hoping.
I'm very keen to go.

1262
01:59:55,459 --> 01:59:57,542
Myself, I work.

1263
02:00:00,334 --> 02:00:02,292
The Frenchman works or starves.

1264
02:00:07,084 --> 02:00:10,084
Have you ever seen anything
as beautiful as this?

1265
02:00:14,126 --> 02:00:17,001
The English… have no feeling... yes?

1266
02:00:17,459 --> 02:00:19,334
Are stiff…

1267
02:00:20,167 --> 02:00:24,417
They hide them.
Hide them from the world.

1268
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:27,292
Hah. It's stupid.

1269
02:00:28,042 --> 02:00:30,251
Stupid... yes, it may be…

1270
02:00:31,626 --> 02:00:33,959
but things will quickly change.

1271
02:00:34,751 --> 02:00:38,001
We have grown up.
We will improve our world.

1272
02:00:39,292 --> 02:00:40,792
Eh, well…

1273
02:00:48,167 --> 02:00:49,959
Perhaps…

1274
02:00:51,959 --> 02:00:55,209
perhaps you like
some soup with us. My wife.

1275
02:00:56,251 --> 02:00:57,626
All right.

1276
02:01:02,209 --> 02:01:04,667
The walk is down the hill.

1277
02:01:04,751 --> 02:01:06,292
My friend…

1278
02:01:08,667 --> 02:01:12,209
there will be days and
days and days like this.
