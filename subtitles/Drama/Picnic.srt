1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,298
Hey, son!

2
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:40,012
This is where you wanted off.

3
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:43,891
Well, thank you, sir.

4
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:47,061
Thank you for the hitch too.

5
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:50,565
l've ridden them lots of times
when l was your age myself.

6
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:51,942
What do you want here?

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,610
A friend of mine lives here.

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,779
His old man's a big shot
in the grain business.

9
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,280
Real rich.

10
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:00,659
-Honest.
-Sure!

11
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,120
The governor's an old
sidekick of mine.

12
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,289
That's how l got this job.

13
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:51,358
Millie!

14
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,443
Does it make your mouth water?

15
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,113
lt's beautiful, Mrs. Potts.

16
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:57,823
Thank you, dear.

17
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:21,848
Ma'am?

18
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,851
Yes?

19
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:29,439
About your yard, ma'am.

20
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:33,610
l could rake it up
and burn your trash for you...

21
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,321
...or any other job needs done.

22
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,115
My gracious!

23
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,450
Nobody works today.

24
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,745
lt's Labor Day!

25
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,250
Are you hungry?

26
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,006
l guess my stomach didn't know
it was Labor Day, ma'am.

27
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:57,260
You just stop being embarrassed.
Come in and have breakfast.

28
00:03:57,468 --> 00:04:00,847
-Not unless l clean up your yard.
-All right, but after you eat.

29
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,850
Come on, get in the house
and get something to eat.

30
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,667
Madge!

31
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,296
Dry your silly hair
over somebody else.

32
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:37,134
Why don't you read your silly book
under somebody else?

33
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:51,775
My, it's hot and still today.

34
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:55,445
lt looks lovely, dear.

35
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:57,739
l wish it didn't
take so long to dry.

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,117
l think, one summer
l'll cut it short.

37
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,493
Madge!

38
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,163
She's just talking.
The way she primps and fusses...

39
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,874
...somebody'd think
she was the Queen of Sheba.

40
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,043
Well, if you fussed a little...

41
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,378
...maybe you'd have a date
for the picnic today.

42
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:15,299
l don't want any of these crazy boys
to take me anywhere.

43
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,177
Beggars can't be choosers!

44
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:20,138
Madge, that's mean.

45
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,348
There'll be dancing tonight.

46
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:24,225
Millie ought to have a date.

47
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,896
All she has to do is
dress up and act decent.

48
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:31,399
l will dress and act the way l want.

49
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:42,077
Anybody mind if an old maid
schoolteacher joins their company?

50
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:43,495
Morning, Miss Sydney.

51
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:46,123
Come out and join us, Rosemary.

52
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:51,086
-Mail in yet?
-lt's a holiday.

53
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,880
Oh, that's right.

54
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:55,174
l forgot.

55
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:00,763
Thought there might be a letter
from that man l met...

56
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:03,558
...at the high-school dance
last spring.

57
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,061
He's been wanting to
marry me ever since.

58
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,272
He was a peck of fun.

59
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:14,069
But l don't have time for any of them
when they get serious on me.

60
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,114
You schoolteachers
are mighty independent.

61
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:19,366
Shoot!

62
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:22,578
l lived this long without a man.

63
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:25,664
What's to keep me
from getting on without one?

64
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,541
What about Howard?

65
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,293
Howard Bevans?

66
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,171
He's just a friend-boy...

67
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:34,924
...not a boyfriend.

68
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:41,848
l'll bet you never had cherry pie
for breakfast before, did you?

69
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:43,016
No, ma'am.

70
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:44,726
l never did.

71
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:49,022
l'll get started on your yard now.

72
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,940
You had such a big breakfast.

73
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,068
Wouldn't you like
to rest for a while?

74
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,987
No, ma'am.
Work's good for my digestion.

75
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:09,043
l was figuring to look up
this friend of mine that lives here.

76
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,962
l was in college with him...

77
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:13,798
...some years back.

78
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:16,801
You look like a college man.

79
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:18,970
Well, thank you, ma'am.

80
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:22,140
l don't suppose you'd know him.
His name's Alan Benson.

81
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:24,517
Alan Benson!
Why, of course!

82
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,353
He visits one of
the girls next door.

83
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,481
What do you know!

84
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:32,108
lt's right around here.

85
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,236
lt'll be awful hot in that jacket.

86
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,071
You better take it off.

87
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,491
My shirt's awful dirty, ma'am.

88
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,535
l'll wash it for you.

89
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,872
You think anybody'd mind?

90
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,207
Of course not. You're a man!

91
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,210
What's the difference?

92
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:50,795
Helen!

93
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:54,757
lt's my mother.
She lives upstairs.

94
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,385
She's an invalid, you see.

95
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,387
She's very old.

96
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:02,890
Sure. Older people take a lot of care.

97
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,434
Helen!

98
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:07,187
All right, Mama.
l'm coming.

99
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:09,147
l'm coming!

100
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,887
Working over there
naked as an lndian!

101
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:41,597
Who's naked as an lndian?

102
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:44,142
Who does he think is interested?

103
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,566
-Good morning.
-Hey, Bomber, you stupe!

104
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,527
You want to knock the house down?

105
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:55,237
Go back to bed, will you?

106
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,489
Go blow your nose!

107
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,450
Tell your pretty sister
to come out.

108
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,162
lt's no fun looking at you,
goonface!

109
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,831
You take that back,
you dirty little pest!

110
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,877
Look at goonface!
She fights just like a man. Oh, boy!

111
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,930
One of these days, you'll come here
and l'll shoot you, so help me!

112
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:23,516
Morning, Madge.

113
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,101
Hello, Bomber.

114
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:27,979
A bunch of us guys...

115
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,398
...are chipping in on a hot rod.

116
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,901
l get it every Friday night.

117
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:36,947
Well, don't expect to honk the horn
and have me run out.

118
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:41,076
lf a boy wants a date, he can
come to the door and ask if l'm in.

119
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:44,371
Alan Benson sends her flowers
every time they go out.

120
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,499
l can't send you flowers, baby, but...

121
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,543
...l can...

122
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:50,795
...send you.

123
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,844
Let me pick you up some night
after Benson brings you home.

124
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,847
Will you stop being ridiculous?

125
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,436
l've seen you riding
around in his convertible...

126
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:08,063
...like you was a duchess.

127
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:11,024
Why do good-looking girls
have to be so...

128
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:13,443
...stuck on themselves?

129
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:16,321
l am not stuck on myself.

130
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,408
Let me pick you up some night
after Benson brings you home.

131
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:21,201
Bomber, will you let me alone?

132
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,703
Give a guy a break!

133
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,955
On your way, lover-boy.

134
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,375
Who are you?

135
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,756
What's that matter?
l'm bigger than you are.

136
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,139
l'm late on my route!

137
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:45,059
Go on.
Go peddle your papers!

138
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:48,980
Drop dead!

139
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:50,857
Hi.

140
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,409
Hey, you working for Mrs. Potts?

141
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,123
Just doing a few odd jobs
in the yard.

142
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,584
-She give you breakfast?
-Millie, stop it.

143
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,213
l need you girls to help me
with the picnic sandwiches, so--

144
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,425
ls there something you want,
young man?

145
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,512
Just loafing, ma'am.

146
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,308
This is a busy day for us.
We have no time to loaf.

147
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,478
Are you the...

148
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,396
...mother?

149
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,148
Yes.

150
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,705
Come on, Millie.

151
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,624
Madge!

152
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,796
Come here!
Come here a minute.

153
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,472
He knows Alan!

154
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:05,101
lsn't that nice?

155
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,440
l've never been to Kansas before.

156
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,485
Maybe you can tell me
where Benson lives.

157
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,570
He lives on the
other end of town.

158
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:18,407
Ask anyone over there.

159
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:20,909
Alan's father is an elevator man.

160
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:25,456
He owns all those big grain elevators.

161
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,004
See you.

162
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:35,925
See you.

163
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:01,952
Nice chip, Dad.

164
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,164
Keep your head down, son.
Follow through.

165
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,001
Benson?

166
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,756
Hal Carter!

167
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:15,841
Kid!

168
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:18,845
Well, where did you come from?

169
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:20,847
Oh, around.

170
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:24,601
You old son of a gun!
Of all the people in the world!

171
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,853
Hey, now. Watch it! Watch it!

172
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:29,230
Remember how we used to
wake up that fraternity?

173
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,607
Do l?

174
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,401
Who's Winkin'...

175
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:35,695
...Blinkin' and Stinkin'?

176
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:38,031
Dad, this is Hal Carter.

177
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,658
Yes, so it is.

178
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,702
l remember you
on the football field.

179
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:42,828
Thank you, Mr. Benson.

180
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:45,497
You still look able
to dodge a few tacklers.

181
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,625
You look pretty fit yourself, sir.

182
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,959
Well, l try.

183
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,628
l try.

184
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,756
Great guy.

185
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,176
-When did you get into town?
-Early this morning.

186
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:59,303
lmagine living in
a place like this.

187
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,764
Why didn't you come
to see me first thing?

188
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,059
l didn't want to walk in on you,
looking like a bum.

189
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:08,897
l thought l'd scrounge around, get me
a little change and pick up a new shirt.

190
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,107
That wouldn't have made
any difference.

191
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:13,109
Hal Carter!

192
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:16,029
Where have you been all these years?

193
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,032
l was working back home...

194
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,951
...in the filling station.

195
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,455
-Then l was in the Army.
-Yeah? How long?

196
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,206
Till l got out.

197
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,126
l heard you went to Hollywood...

198
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,796
...to become a big movie hero.

199
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,216
l was going to have a big career.

200
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:37,385
They were going to call me
''Brush'' Carter.

201
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,303
What happened, ''Brush''?

202
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:43,516
This babe told me they'd have to
pull out all my teeth...

203
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,476
...and get me new ones,
so naturally--

204
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,270
Wait a minute. What babe?

205
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,649
The babe that got me the screen test.

206
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,611
She wasn't exactly a babe.
She was kind of beat-up, but...

207
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:57,406
...not bad.

208
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,868
Same old Hal.

209
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:03,662
Aren't you glad to see me?

210
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,331
Well, sure.

211
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,209
How about lending me a razor?

212
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,503
Okay, go on now. Fill me in.

213
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:13,005
After l left Hollywood...

214
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,800
...l took a job on a ranch in Nevada.

215
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,260
You'd have been proud of me.

216
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,262
ln bed every night at 1 0...

217
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,556
...up every morning at 6.

218
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:24,601
No liquor, no babes, no nothing!

219
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,687
l even saved up 200 bucks.
Then l got rolled.

220
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,606
Rolled? You?

221
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,697
l was...

222
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,033
...hitchhiking my way down to Texas...

223
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:41,910
...on a big oil deal...

224
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,746
...when two babes pull up...

225
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:46,915
...in this big, yellow convertible.

226
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,710
One of them slams on the brake
and hollers...

227
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,380
...''Hey, beefcake! Get in.''

228
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:54,632
So l...

229
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,885
...got in.

230
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:01,055
Benson, it was crazy.

231
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:04,267
They had a shaker full of martinis
right in the car.

232
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:07,437
-Remembering old times?
-Oh, yes, sir. Oh, no, sir.

233
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,565
l'm due at the club, Alan.
Join me later if you wish.

234
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:14,444
l've got a date, Dad.

235
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,238
Same young lady?

236
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,990
Of course.

237
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:22,911
Delighted to have seen you.

238
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:24,955
lt's mutual, sir.

239
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:27,416
Great car.

240
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,753
Go on. Now tell me
what happened exactly.

241
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:33,422
You know me.

242
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,300
-l'm an agreeable guy.
-Sure.

243
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,972
So when they park in front of
this tourist cabin, l said:

244
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,060
''lf l got to pay for the ride,
this is the easiest way l know.''

245
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,604
So we got busy...

246
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,314
...on the martinis.

247
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:53,026
They must have thought
l was Superman.

248
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:56,613
Nothing like that
ever happens to me.

249
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:58,490
So then l said...

250
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,410
...''Okay, girls, party's over.

251
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,120
Let's get going.''

252
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:05,831
And one of them sticks a gun
in my back and says...

253
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,877
...''This party's going on
till we say it's over, Buck.''

254
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,422
You'd have thought
she was Humphrey Bogart.

255
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,091
Wait a minute. Then what?

256
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,301
So finally l passed out.

257
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:20,513
When l woke up, the dames were gone
and so was my 200 bucks.

258
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,599
l went to the police.
They wouldn't believe me.

259
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:26,478
They said my story was wishful thinking.
How do you like that?

260
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:29,939
l'm telling you, Benson...

261
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,692
...women are getting desperate.

262
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:39,366
Be awfully nice to
be married to Alan, Madge.

263
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,243
Better get busy.

264
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,494
Busy?

265
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:46,206
A pretty girl doesn't have long.
Just a few years.

266
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,711
Then she's the equal of kings.

267
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:54,632
She can walk out of
a shanty like this...

268
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,676
...and live in a palace.

269
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,304
lf she loses her chance
when she's young...

270
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:04,058
...she might as well throw
all her prettiness away.

271
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:06,102
l'm only 1 9.

272
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:08,897
And next summer, you'll be 20.

273
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:12,359
And then 21 , and then...

274
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:13,985
...40.

275
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:18,198
You don't have to be morbid.

276
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,701
ls this a private party l'm crashing?

277
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:21,869
Oh, no.

278
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,246
l won't be back
for lunch, Mrs. Owens.

279
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:27,207
There's a welcome-home party
at the hotel...

280
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,419
...for the new girls on the faculty.

281
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:35,216
My, isn't that scrumptious!

282
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:40,638
You'll be the belle of the ball, Madge.

283
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,308
You look nice yourself, Miss Sydney.

284
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:45,351
lt's the new fall outfit.

285
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,229
You schoolteachers
certainly have nice things.

286
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:49,939
l got it in Kansas City.

287
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:52,400
Paid $22.50 for the hat.

288
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,990
Good land! You let your daughter
read filthy books like that?

289
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,825
-Filthy?
-What are you reading, Millie?

290
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,660
<i>The Ballad of the Sad Cafe.</i>

291
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:04,038
And it's not filthy.
lt's wonderful.

292
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:07,875
Somebody wanted it
banned from the public library.

293
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:12,338
lt's on the reading list at college,
and Alan Benson loaned it to me.

294
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,131
Oh, dear.

295
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:17,301
What is a person to believe?

296
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:21,556
Well, those college professors
don't have any morals.

297
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,725
Bye, now.

298
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:31,816
Madge, let's get at this dress.

299
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:45,331
Everybody around here gets to
dress up and go places except me.

300
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,959
That's because you're not
interested in boys.

301
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,506
You'd think all boys cared
about was what somebody wears.

302
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,759
They do care about
how they look and act, though.

303
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,886
And how they smell
a lot of the time.

304
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,888
Girls, don't fight!

305
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,432
La-dee-da!

306
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:05,977
Madge is the pretty one.
But she's so dumb, they almost had to...

307
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:08,605
...burn the schoolhouse
to get her out of it.

308
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:10,649
That is not so!

309
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:12,943
You have to work in the dime store.

310
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:15,737
Bomber was right. You are a goon!

311
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:21,535
You slut! You take that back or
l'll kill you! Take it back!

312
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,043
Hello, girls.

313
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,879
Lovely morning, isn't it?

314
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,758
-Mother!
-Take it back, Madge!

315
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,761
Girls! What will the neighbors say?

316
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,472
Nobody can call me ''goon''
and get by with it.

317
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,933
You've called her worse names.

318
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,561
lt doesn't hurt, what names l call her.

319
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,941
Madge is the pretty one.
Names don't bother her at all.

320
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,570
Poor Millie!

321
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,700
All l ever hear is ''poor Millie''!

322
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,327
Poor Millie won herself a scholarship...

323
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:05,080
...for four whole years of college.

324
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,083
A girl like Millie...

325
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,045
...can need confidence in other ways.

326
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,015
With Alan...

327
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:25,393
...you'd live in comfort
the rest of your life.

328
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:29,606
Charge accounts at all the stores.

329
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,317
Automobiles and trips.

330
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:35,278
And you'd belong to the country club.

331
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,908
l don't feel right with those people.

332
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:42,578
Why not?

333
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:45,789
Your grandfather was in
the state legislature.

334
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,958
You're as good as they are.

335
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:51,754
When a girl's as pretty as you are,
she doesn't have to--

336
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:55,883
What good is it just to be pretty?

337
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:01,139
What a question!

338
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,642
Maybe l get tired of
only being looked at.

339
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:08,730
You puzzle me when you talk that way.

340
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:18,240
Does Alan ever make love?

341
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,162
Sometimes we park the car
by the river.

342
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:26,415
Do you let him kiss you?

343
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:28,918
After all, you've been
going together all summer.

344
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,212
Of course l let him.

345
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:39,137
Does he ever want to
go beyond kissing?

346
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:46,394
l'm your mother!
These things have to be talked about.

347
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:54,569
Do you like it when he kisses you?

348
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:56,154
Yes.

349
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,449
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

350
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,994
What do you expect me to do?

351
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:05,164
Pass out every time Alan
puts his arms around me?

352
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,666
No, you don't have to pass out.

353
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,795
But there won't be many more
opportunities like the picnic tonight.

354
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,255
lt seems to me you could at least....

355
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:14,590
What?

356
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,217
Nothing!

357
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,223
That dress is to be worn
only to parties. Do you understand?

358
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,601
l don't want to have to remind you.

359
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,102
And another thing...

360
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:30,231
...l want you to stop picking on
Millie all the time!

361
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,332
Poor darling.

362
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,710
Oh, don't.

363
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,635
Do you love Millie more than me?

364
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,639
Madge, of course not.

365
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,353
But sometimes you act like you did.

366
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:09,981
Don't say things like that.

367
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,108
Listen to me.

368
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,320
When you were born...

369
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,824
...we didn't know how to
hold in our joy.

370
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,909
We laughed...

371
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,078
...and we cried.

372
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:27,875
We planted that elm tree
in the back yard.

373
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:32,171
When you got older, your father
carried you on his shoulder...

374
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,924
...for all the neighborhood to see.

375
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:38,886
And when Millie came...

376
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,389
...it was different.

377
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,767
Your father wasn't home
a lot of the time.

378
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,271
He'd found other things.

379
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:52,734
Then he walked out of the house
and never came back.

380
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:59,491
lf l ever seem to favor Millie...

381
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:03,537
...maybe it's because l want
to make it up to her.

382
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:07,625
All those golden years you had
and she didn't.

383
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:17,677
l was just remembering you at school.

384
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:21,556
How you always
had things under control.

385
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:23,683
Who, me?

386
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:28,271
You never cut classes...

387
00:25:28,897 --> 00:25:31,107
...understood the lectures...

388
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:33,527
...took notes.

389
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:36,738
The hero of the campus,
and he envied me.

390
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:38,865
Yeah. Big hero.

391
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:42,327
Between the goal posts.

392
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:48,709
lt finally happened, kid.

393
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,169
Your father?

394
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:54,507
He went on his last bender.

395
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:59,011
The police scraped him up
off the sidewalk.

396
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,847
He died in jail.

397
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:02,890
l'm sorry to hear that, Hal.

398
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:09,314
You wanted to see them.

399
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:10,941
There they are!

400
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:22,703
Mr. Benson!

401
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,540
Hello, Mike!

402
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,336
You're not working today?

403
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:33,381
Have to. Got a backlog.

404
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:35,550
Come on.

405
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,351
They're loading.

406
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,353
What do you say, Red?

407
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,897
Hello, Alan.

408
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:53,735
The wheat comes down
through that spout.

409
00:26:54,486 --> 00:26:56,530
All the way from the top.

410
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:01,827
-lt must come down like a ton of--
-lt does. Come on.

411
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:05,748
-l'll give you a hand, Red.
-Thanks. l can use a hand.

412
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,585
Tie it up good, now.

413
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,713
lf these things ever get loose,
they can be mean.

414
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,883
l worked with the boys here one summer.
l was a wheat scooper.

415
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,926
No kidding.

416
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,887
Dad wanted me to learn the business
from the bottom up.

417
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,764
l guess that'll hold it.

418
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,936
-All set?
-Okay, ready to go.

419
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,272
Watch this.
l'll push a button.

420
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,784
Hey, Hart!
How you doing, Charlie?

421
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,290
What's this thing?

422
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,083
lt's the man-lift.

423
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,755
Go on! Get on it.

424
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,507
Go on! Don't be afraid.

425
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,887
This is great!

426
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:00,972
Watch your head.

427
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,948
-You own all these?
-The corporation does.

428
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,160
That one too?

429
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,204
That's their newest one.
That holds 1 0 million bushels.

430
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,123
That's a lot of biscuits.

431
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,292
You know...

432
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,544
...what l was hoping was that...

433
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,505
...you and your old man...

434
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,967
...between you might be able to
fix me up with a job.

435
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:37,677
Sure.

436
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,637
These companies can always use men.

437
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:42,891
l'm sure Dad can do something.

438
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,559
Maybe...

439
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:48,521
...something in a nice office
where l can wear a tie...

440
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,441
...have a sweet little secretary.

441
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,529
And talk over the telephone...

442
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:58,448
...about enterprises...

443
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:00,200
...and things.

444
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:06,248
l got to get someplace in this world.
l just got to.

445
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:08,209
Sure.

446
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:09,877
But...

447
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:14,590
...before you get to be president
of the company, you'll have to be...

448
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,009
...a little patient.

449
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:21,180
That's something l gotta learn.

450
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:22,390
Patience!

451
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,562
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

452
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:29,189
We're going swimming.

453
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:31,608
-With a couple of girls.
-A couple of girls?

454
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:34,569
Wait till you see mine.
She is unbelievable!

455
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:36,905
l know. Her name's Madge.

456
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:06,269
Absolutely and positively
the cutest thing l ever saw.

457
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,150
He's all right.

458
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,735
All right?

459
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:17,322
lmagine him on a cold and rainy night.

460
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:21,285
He's going to the picnic with Alan,
and he's taking me.

461
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:23,245
He's taking you?

462
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:31,128
After the picnic tonight...

463
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,340
...let's get away from the others.

464
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,301
All right.

465
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,430
We'll take a boat out on the river.

466
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:47,687
Come on, kid.
Let's show them how to swim!

467
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,357
On your mark, get set...

468
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,816
...go!

469
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,823
''Come on, kid.
Let's show them how to swim.''

470
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:00,200
Big shot!

471
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:04,455
Bomber, don't be forever a creep.

472
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,168
l want to find out something.

473
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,215
l want to find out if
you look real in the moonlight.

474
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:16,175
Don't say that.

475
00:31:16,384 --> 00:31:18,386
Why not?

476
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:19,804
Because l'm real, all right.

477
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,348
lt doesn't matter
whether you are or not.

478
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:27,937
You're the most beautiful thing
l've ever seen.

479
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:52,922
What's on your mind?

480
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:56,884
l don't know if it's a good idea,
me going on this picnic.

481
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,094
Why not?

482
00:31:58,302 --> 00:31:59,762
You're taking Millie.

483
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,309
l've never been on a picnic.

484
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,853
What are you talking about?

485
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:08,563
Everybody's been on a picnic.

486
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:10,023
Yeah? Not me.

487
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,691
When l was a kid,
l was too busy...

488
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:15,070
...shooting craps
or stealing milk bottles.

489
00:32:16,488 --> 00:32:19,825
You went on the steak fries
in the fraternity, didn't you?

490
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,245
And you know what
they turned out to be.

491
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:27,750
This picnic won't be that primitive.

492
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,086
How do you talk to boys?

493
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:34,131
Why, you just talk, silly.

494
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,972
How do you think of things to say?

495
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,309
You just say whatever
comes into your head.

496
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:48,355
Supposing nothing ever
comes into my head?

497
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,107
Why ask me all the questions?

498
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,777
You're supposed to be
the smart one.

499
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:55,654
What do you think of her?

500
00:32:57,906 --> 00:32:58,907
Who?

501
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,326
My girl!

502
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:05,331
Not bad.

503
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,458
Not bad?

504
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,919
She's the prettiest girl in town.

505
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:13,589
l bet you they announce tonight
she's going to be Queen of Neewollah!

506
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:15,424
Nee-what-a?

507
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:17,802
Neewollah!

508
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:25,143
lt's Halloween spelled backwards.

509
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:28,563
They have this big
coronation ceremony every year.

510
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:31,608
Madge should have been Queen
last year. She had 400 votes.

511
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:34,277
-Only this other jerk--
-Stop it!

512
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:37,823
-What have we been talking about?
-l don't know.

513
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,952
Get away from this wall.
You're liable to get educated.

514
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:47,791
Millie, stop it!

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,752
l can't see anything.

516
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:56,300
We brought home your wayward girl.

517
00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:00,722
Welcome back, lrma. Rosemary
told me you've been in New York.

518
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,475
Whatever she says,
l didn't disgrace myself.

519
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,813
Mrs. Owens, this is
Christine Schoenwalder.

520
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,900
She's taking Mabel Fremont's
place this year.

521
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:13,985
ln Feminine Hygiene.

522
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,905
l'm delighted to know you, Christine.

523
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:18,991
Howard phoned.

524
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:20,868
He did?

525
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:29,877
How do l look?
Now tell me the truth.

526
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,880
You look very nice.

527
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:36,801
Feel sort of funny, though.

528
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:38,177
You think he'll like me?

529
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:41,681
l don't really care anyway.
l just wonder.

530
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,308
Bye!

531
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:51,691
You better hurry if you're going
to change. Howard'll be here soon.

532
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,235
Shoot!

533
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:57,155
lt doesn't take me any time
to dress for Howard.

534
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,585
Hey, Hal! Here.

535
00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:10,920
Try this.

536
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:15,675
Can you imagine that?
Alan's brought two cars!

537
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,885
Here's your date, Millie.

538
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:22,056
Hey, kid! Look at you!

539
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:26,311
l've decided to go along too.

540
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,063
My best girl!

541
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:31,191
Romeo, you've met Mrs. Owens too,
you know.

542
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,610
Oh, sure. She's the mother.

543
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,779
l'm coming too, Rosemary.

544
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:38,782
This is Miss Rosemary Sydney.

545
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:41,243
Miss Sydney teaches
in the high school.

546
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:44,788
l'm an old maid schoolteacher.

547
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:47,541
l have every respect
for schoolteachers, ma'am.

548
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,586
lt's a lot of hard work
and not much pay.

549
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,798
lf the men will take
the baskets out to the cars....

550
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:56,592
And there's a big tub of ice,
but l don't think--

551
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:58,094
l'll handle that, ma'am.

552
00:35:58,302 --> 00:35:59,637
l'll help.

553
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:02,098
Be careful. lt's very heavy.

554
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:05,435
Here we go.

555
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:08,313
Look at him!
He carries that old washtub...

556
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,440
...as if it was
so much tissue paper.

557
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:14,361
Here, let me help.

558
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:19,616
lt's him!

559
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:22,286
Who?

560
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:27,249
lt's Howard.

561
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:32,964
lf he's been drinking,
l'm not going with him.

562
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,423
Hold it, Hal.

563
00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:36,926
l want you to meet Howard Bevans.
Hal Carter.

564
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,136
Pleased to meet you, sir.

565
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:39,929
Same here.

566
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:43,016
Hey, Millie's a good-looking
little lady.

567
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,643
l never realized that before.

568
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,146
He's right, kid!

569
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:50,148
l've been telling her that
for years.

570
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:55,362
-ls there anything else, ma'am?
-Thermoses.

571
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,281
Thermoses, coming up.

572
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:00,659
Howard, l'm going along too.

573
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,161
That's fine.

574
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:03,746
Howdy, ladies.

575
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:09,084
Alan, l think you better
hurry Madge up.

576
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,379
Say, Delilah?

577
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:13,589
-Go on up.
-Coming.

578
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:20,013
You sure look nice, Rosemary.

579
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:25,852
lt seems to me you might at least
have left your coat on.

580
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,396
lt's still too darn hot...

581
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:29,773
...even if it is September.

582
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,901
How are things across the river?

583
00:37:33,693 --> 00:37:35,362
Business is fine.

584
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,240
Back to school.
Everybody's buying.

585
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:42,453
Bride and groom!

586
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:46,040
Everybody look. Bride and groom!

587
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:55,091
lt's a picnic.
Why did you wear that dress?

588
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:59,053
l don't know, Mom.

589
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:00,513
l just put it on.

590
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:10,065
l never could wear
another fellow's clothes.

591
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:13,568
l'm kind of beefy
through the shoulders.

592
00:38:15,153 --> 00:38:17,447
l should have all
my clothes tailor-made.

593
00:38:17,656 --> 00:38:19,700
Nobody'd mind if you took it off.

594
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:22,286
Yeah, look at me. Eh, Rosemary?

595
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,629
Nothing like being loose.

596
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:35,883
We'd better hurry.
All the tables will be taken.

597
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,305
-l'll race you to the car.
-Roger.

598
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:41,889
On your marks.

599
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:43,308
Get set.

600
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,684
Go!

601
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:55,445
Ready?

602
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:02,369
See you there!

603
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:26,811
How did a boy like that
ever get into college?

604
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:29,564
On a football scholarship.

605
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:32,692
But he was in your fraternity.

606
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:34,653
Don't those boys...

607
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:37,030
...have a little more breeding?

608
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:39,783
Maybe.

609
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:43,370
But fraternities like to
pledge big athletes.

610
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,706
Hal could have been an all-American.

611
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,335
lf he'd only studied.

612
00:39:49,877 --> 00:39:52,213
He flunked out his third year.

613
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,257
<i>And on this farm he had some pigs</i>

614
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:55,800
<i>E-l-E-l-O</i>

615
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:57,802
<i>With an oink-oink here
And an oink-oink there</i>

616
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,680
<i>Here an oink, there an oink
Oink-oink everywhere!</i>

617
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,349
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

618
00:40:03,558 --> 00:40:05,185
<i>E-l-E-l-O</i>

619
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:08,188
Here's one my old man taught me.

620
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,150
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

621
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,944
<i>E-l-E-l-O</i>

622
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:16,780
At first, l couldn't stand...

623
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:19,241
...the way he bragged
and swaggered either.

624
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,994
Then we shared a room,
and l got to know him better.

625
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,122
ls he wild?

626
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,793
Not really.

627
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,753
Does he drink?

628
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:33,255
A little.

629
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,049
After all, Millie's only a child!

630
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,634
Now, Flo.

631
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,929
Don't be an old poke.

632
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,975
A picnic isn't a picnic
without a little drink.

633
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,523
Put that bottle down
where you found it.

634
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,568
Old poke!

635
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,325
What if somebody saw us
from the school board?

636
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:02,786
l'd lose my job.

637
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,707
Honey, why do you think
l drove down this street?

638
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,212
There isn't a soul in sight.

639
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,430
Come on, honey. Be a sport.

640
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:22,140
Have one little one.

641
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:24,017
Just for me.

642
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,647
lf l have one,
will you stop coaxing?

643
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:43,287
Just the same, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

644
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,682
Oh, kids!
That looks like a lovely spot.

645
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,101
Yes! That's just fine.

646
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:54,820
That's enough of you kids.

647
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:57,781
That's all the swan boat will hold.

648
00:43:22,974 --> 00:43:26,644
<i>Going to run all night
Going to run all day</i>

649
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,216
<i>Dancing tonight will begin
at 8:00.</i>

650
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:59,637

651
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:20,868
Don't overdo it!

652
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:36,592
<i>l hear</i>

653
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:41,347
<i>The gentle voices calling</i>

654
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,349
We are putting in the haystack...

655
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:45,643
...$1 25...

656
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:47,395
...in nickels, dimes and quarters.

657
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,789
<i>All the world is sad and dreary</i>

658
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,626
<i>Everywhere l roam</i>

659
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:20,888
<i>Attention, everybody! Attention!</i>

660
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:22,682
<i>A child has been found.</i>

661
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:25,018
He says he has no name.

662
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:28,063
Anyone missing
a child with no name...

663
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,565
...can claim him here
at the pavilion.

664
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,446
Get your partners
for the trained-seal game.

665
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:39,950
No, ladies.
You've got to have a man.

666
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,744
l've got one!

667
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:44,330
l'll get my pants dirty.

668
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:47,082
Now, Howard, we're going to play.
Kneel down!

669
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,585
The object of the game--
Men, put your hands behind your back.

670
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:53,756
Ladies with the jar rings,
ring the lollipop sticks...

671
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,383
...in the fellow's mouth.

672
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:03,600
Hal! Catch it!

673
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:08,271
<i>While my little one</i>

674
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:13,819
<i>While my pretty one...</i>

675
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,446
<i>...sleeps</i>

676
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:23,037
Faster!

677
00:46:23,245 --> 00:46:24,121
Go on!

678
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,459
Come back here!

679
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:41,139
And it is proper...

680
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:44,100
...that this holiday
known as Labor Day...

681
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:45,477
...be set aside....

682
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:52,651
Hey, Hal, look at the mutt!

683
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:00,200
That dog ate up our food.

684
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:03,412
No, no!
Leave room for the cake.

685
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:07,500
l've never had so much fun
since Grandma caught....

686
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,087
Since ever.

687
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,839
How about it, kid?

688
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:16,676
We'd have won that
three-legged race if l hadn't...

689
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,010
...let you down.

690
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:21,681
Millie doesn't go in much for sports.
She cultivates her mind.

691
00:47:23,183 --> 00:47:25,685
l wasn't taking anything
from her there, ma'am.

692
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:26,936
She's got a...

693
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,855
...splendid mind.

694
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:33,360
Come on, both of you!
Cut it out!

695
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:37,239
You ought to come to Halster someday
and see my shop.

696
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:40,367
Notions, novelties, school supplies.

697
00:47:41,118 --> 00:47:42,161
You too, Alan.

698
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:44,413
lt's right across the big river.

699
00:47:44,788 --> 00:47:46,540
We'll be over, sir...

700
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:49,210
...as soon as we can fit it
in our schedule.

701
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:52,630
You can't miss it.
The store right next to the bank.

702
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:54,549
l live right upstairs.

703
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:58,970
Only one big room, but it's big
enough for me and my 21 -inch TV.

704
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:03,766
Where did you ever get those boots?

705
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,895
My old man left them to me
when he died.

706
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:09,522
He had a very big foot.

707
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:13,360
ls that all he left you?
Just a pair of boots?

708
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:15,404
He used to sit on
the bed at night and l'd...

709
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:18,198
...tug them off him.

710
00:48:19,116 --> 00:48:20,534
And he'd say:

711
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:22,161
''Son...

712
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,080
...the man of the house has
got to have a pair of boots...

713
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,958
...because he's got to do
a lot of kicking.''

714
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,591
Then he said:

715
00:48:36,843 --> 00:48:38,094
''Son...

716
00:48:38,678 --> 00:48:40,596
...there'll be times
when all you've got...

717
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:43,516
...to be proud of is
the fact that you're a man.

718
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:46,895
So wear boots so people know you're
coming, and double your fists up...

719
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,773
...so they know you mean business
when you get there.''

720
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:52,108
My old man, he was a corker.

721
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:55,404
Hal's shy of people
before he meets them...

722
00:48:55,654 --> 00:48:58,282
...and then you can't keep him still.

723
00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:02,202
What line of business you in, son?

724
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:04,705
l'm about to...

725
00:49:04,913 --> 00:49:07,124
...enter the grain business, sir.

726
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:10,878
You see...

727
00:49:11,462 --> 00:49:16,217
...my old man was no aristocratic
millionaire or anything, but he had...

728
00:49:16,425 --> 00:49:19,262
...some very important friends.

729
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:20,972
Some very big people...

730
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,682
...in their own way.

731
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:26,352
And one of them was
always after me...

732
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:28,897
...to take this position with the...

733
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:30,982
...oil company down in Texas and--

734
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:34,277
Dad and l found a place
for Hal scooping wheat.

735
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:39,658
Yeah, l've decided to
start from the very bottom.

736
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,663
l sure do appreciate Alan
and his old...

737
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:46,582
...his old father...

738
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,793
...giving me this opportunity.

739
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:55,883
A young man coming to town
has got to be a good mixer.

740
00:49:56,384 --> 00:50:00,722
Wouldn't it be nice if he could join
the country club and play golf?

741
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,016
He won't be able to afford that.

742
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,770
The bowling team's a rowdy gang.

743
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:11,483
There's a young man's Bible class
at the Baptist church.

744
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,363
l learned something today.

745
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:20,367
And it's that there comes a time
in a man's life...

746
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:24,038
...when he's got to quit
rolling around like a pinball.

747
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,876
Maybe...

748
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:31,420
...a little town like this is...

749
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,674
...the place to settle down.

750
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:36,551
Where people are...

751
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:38,720
...easygoing and...

752
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:40,680
...sincere.

753
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:42,724
Hi.

754
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,143
Hi.

755
00:51:01,452 --> 00:51:02,661
l'm sorry.

756
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:08,834
Look, watermelon!

757
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:36,446
<i>ln thy dark eyes' splendor</i>

758
00:51:38,156 --> 00:51:43,120
<i>Where the warm light
Loves to dwell</i>

759
00:51:44,622 --> 00:51:49,001
<i>Weary looks
Yet tender</i>

760
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:54,841
<i>Speak their fond farewell</i>

761
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:07,062
A day like this reminds me of...

762
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:09,022
...when l was a girl.

763
00:52:10,315 --> 00:52:13,568
Things l haven't thought about
in a long...

764
00:52:13,777 --> 00:52:15,404
...long time.

765
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:16,989
Now, Helen.

766
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:20,117
Flo...

767
00:52:21,243 --> 00:52:25,831
...you'll never know what it's meant
to have you next door to me.

768
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:29,001
Watching your two girls grow up.

769
00:52:30,753 --> 00:52:32,004
lt's made it easier.

770
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:33,547
Now, Helen.

771
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:38,928
Where is everybody?

772
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:42,599
Don't you remember, Flo?

773
00:52:43,308 --> 00:52:44,684
At a picnic...

774
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:47,354
...everybody disappears.

775
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:56,989
Look at that sunset, Howard.

776
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:00,576
A sunset's a beautiful thing,
all right.

777
00:53:00,784 --> 00:53:04,538
lt's like the daytime
didn't want to end, isn't it?

778
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:08,709
lt's like the daytime was going to
put up a big scrap.

779
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:11,712
Set the world on fire...

780
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:15,800
...to keep the nighttime
from creeping on.

781
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,281
Hey, kid!

782
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,241
lt's me!

783
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,870
l had a job as a model once.

784
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,496
Like this.

785
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:49,085
They had me posing in front of
a class, almost raw.

786
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:56,968
l sure do admire people
who are artistic.

787
00:53:57,593 --> 00:53:59,929
l just like to draw.

788
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,475
People who draw...

789
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,269
...read books...

790
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,356
...listen to the...

791
00:54:09,856 --> 00:54:11,525
...better music....

792
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:18,240
l used to go with a girl
who read books.

793
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:20,200
She joined the...

794
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:21,952
...Book-of-the-Month Club...

795
00:54:22,453 --> 00:54:25,372
...and they had her reading books
all the time.

796
00:54:25,748 --> 00:54:29,418
She'd no more finish one,
and they'd shoot her another.

797
00:54:37,552 --> 00:54:41,180
Last summer l memorized
all of Shakespeare's sonnets.

798
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:43,224
No kidding?

799
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,949
You're thinking about your father,
aren't you?

800
00:55:04,038 --> 00:55:06,916
l was thinking how impressed
he'll be when he reads you were...

801
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:08,918
...picked as
Queen of Neewollah tonight.

802
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,337
But they haven't picked me yet.

803
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:13,548
Besides...

804
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,676
...l'm sure he thinks
the whole thing is silly.

805
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:19,887
No, you don't know him.

806
00:55:20,346 --> 00:55:23,766
He's always impressed by
people who win things...

807
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:26,519
...or make the most money...

808
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:31,233
...or score the most points
at a football game.

809
00:55:41,493 --> 00:55:43,704
l write poetry myself.

810
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:49,585
l've written poems l've never
shown to a living soul.

811
00:55:51,963 --> 00:55:55,383
Kid, l think you must be
some sort of a genius.

812
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,955
We're all going down to the dock
in a minute. Now remember!

813
00:57:09,752 --> 00:57:11,629
Aren't you excited?

814
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:20,096
Millie won't be shocked
to see somebody take a drink.

815
00:57:20,305 --> 00:57:22,849
-Are you, Millie?
-Gosh, no.

816
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:43,370
One more drink won't hurt you, honey.

817
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:47,917
l guess l know why you want me
to keep on drinking.

818
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,294
Now, honey, that's not so.

819
00:58:00,638 --> 00:58:01,598
Ladies and gentlemen...

820
00:58:01,806 --> 00:58:04,976
...the moment we have been
waiting for has arrived.

821
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:07,562
ls she the Queen?

822
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:09,314
l bet she is.

823
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,818
On October 31 st, next Halloween...

824
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:15,904
...we will crown our
Queen of Neewollah.

825
00:58:16,113 --> 00:58:19,616
She has not yet
reached our shores, but--

826
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:21,201
Wait a minute!

827
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:22,911
Here she comes now!

828
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:29,710
lt's Madge.
l'll bet you anything.

829
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,212
No kidding?

830
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,683
<i>Neewollah</i>

831
00:59:15,925 --> 00:59:17,593
<i>Ain't she sweet</i>

832
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,846
<i>See her coming down the street</i>

833
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,599
<i>Now l ask you very confidentially</i>

834
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:24,350
<i>Ain't she sweet</i>

835
00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:26,436
<i>Ain't she nice</i>

836
00:59:26,644 --> 00:59:28,605
<i>Look her over once or twice</i>

837
00:59:28,772 --> 00:59:31,149
<i>Now l ask you very confidentially</i>

838
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:32,400
<i>Ain't she nice</i>

839
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:34,778
<i>Just cast an eye</i>

840
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:36,822
<i>ln her direction</i>

841
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,991
<i>Oh, me
Oh, my</i>

842
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,160
<i>Ain't that perfection</i>

843
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:44,204
Shoot!

844
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:48,083
When l was a girl l was
just as good-looking as she is.

845
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,983
You know...

846
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,779
...l look forward to seeing her
every time l go to the Owens' house.

847
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,490
But l tell myself,
''Howard, old boy...

848
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,492
...you look all you want...

849
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,996
...but you couldn't touch her
with a 1 0-foot pole.''

850
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,293
Welcome to our shores...

851
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:31,045
...Your Majesty!

852
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:39,262
Ladies and gentlemen...

853
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,555
...the new Queen...

854
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,640
...Madge Owens!

855
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:44,684
Speech!

856
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:50,524
Thank you.

857
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:52,150
l'm very proud...

858
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:54,194
...and l'll try hard
to be a good Queen.

859
01:00:54,695 --> 01:00:57,531
And l'll try hardest of all
not to get conceited.

860
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,090
No, Your Majesty!

861
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:15,591
The president's first.

862
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,219
Don't you worry, Mr. Benson.

863
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:20,763
We'll not leave you out.

864
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:33,694
Land! l love that music!

865
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:34,736
Dance with me.

866
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,572
Honey, l'm no good at dancing.

867
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,324
That's just what you men say
to get out of it.

868
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:41,452
We'll show you we can do without them.

869
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,579
Won't we, Millie? Come on.

870
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,539
All right, but....

871
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:47,708
Well, l got to lead.

872
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:56,551
Mr. President, could l see you
just a moment, please?

873
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:57,885
Excuse me.

874
01:02:06,019 --> 01:02:09,314
Where's Mrs. Johnson?
l've got to return this cape.

875
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:12,609
-Excuse me a minute, Mom.
-All right, darling.

876
01:02:12,818 --> 01:02:14,569
See how Millie is.

877
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:43,641
Stop it!

878
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:48,772
-l thought we were doing very nicely.
-You think you're so funny.

879
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:53,819
Hey, kid, dance with me.

880
01:02:54,027 --> 01:02:55,988
l never dance with boys.

881
01:02:56,196 --> 01:02:59,575
Sure you can. All you have to do
is follow the steps.

882
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,497
Here's the cape, Mrs. Johnson.
All safe and sound.

883
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:22,974
More!

884
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,297
l'll show you a step l learned in L.A.

885
01:03:53,506 --> 01:03:54,966
Now watch this.

886
01:03:56,926 --> 01:03:58,761
First you've got to set the rhythm.

887
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,773
l wish l could do it.

888
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:25,539
Aren't they graceful?

889
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:29,377
You used to dance like that, Flo.

890
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:16,467
Why can't you dance that way?

891
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:19,470
Honey, l'm a businessman.

892
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,812
One night l went dancing
at a big valentine party.

893
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:31,525
l danced so hard l swooned.

894
01:07:32,359 --> 01:07:35,487
That's when they called me
the dancing fool.

895
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,115
Mighty pretty legs.

896
01:07:38,282 --> 01:07:40,242
That's just like you men.

897
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:44,163
Can't talk about anything
but women's legs.

898
01:07:44,663 --> 01:07:46,332
l just noticed their nice shape.

899
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,209
How'd you like it if we women...

900
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:51,253
...went around talking about
your legs all the time?

901
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:52,630
All right.

902
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,465
There's my legs.

903
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:01,389
l never saw anything so ugly.

904
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:07,228
Young man, let's see your legs.

905
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,148
New rule tonight.
Every man's got to show his legs.

906
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:12,526
Come on. The other one too.

907
01:08:12,734 --> 01:08:14,945
Let him alone.
He's dancing with Madge.

908
01:08:15,153 --> 01:08:16,488
lt's his turn to dance with me.

909
01:08:16,697 --> 01:08:19,908
l may be an old maid schoolteacher,
but l can keep up with you.

910
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:21,410
Come on, ride 'em, cowboy!

911
01:08:21,618 --> 01:08:22,494
But, ma'am, l....

912
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:26,165
Used to have a boyfriend
was a cowboy.

913
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:28,793
Met him in Colorado.

914
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:31,420
He was in love with me
because l was...

915
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:34,549
...an older woman and had some sense.

916
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,009
Sorry.

917
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:40,096
He took me up in the mountains
one night...

918
01:08:40,305 --> 01:08:41,681
...and wanted to marry me.

919
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,225
Right there on the mountaintop.

920
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:49,314
He said the stars would be our preacher
and the moon our best man.

921
01:08:49,856 --> 01:08:51,942
Did you ever hear such talk?

922
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:56,405
You know what?

923
01:08:57,155 --> 01:09:01,368
You remind me of one
of those old statues.

924
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:04,622
One of those Roman gladiators.

925
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:07,208
All they had on was a shield.

926
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:10,878
My, those ancient people
were depraved!

927
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:13,673
-l don't think l can dance.
-l can keep up with you.

928
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:15,424
Please, l want to dance.

929
01:09:15,633 --> 01:09:17,176
Please, l gotta dance!

930
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:29,981
He was dancing with Madge.
Let them alone.

931
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,566
They're young people.

932
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:33,026
Young?

933
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,695
What do you mean?

934
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,703
l'm sick.

935
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,792
l just want to die!

936
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:48,959
Here, Millie.

937
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,087
Over here, darling.

938
01:09:51,462 --> 01:09:52,380
l hate you!

939
01:09:55,049 --> 01:09:56,509
Madge is the pretty one!

940
01:09:56,718 --> 01:09:59,220
Madge is the pretty one!

941
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:02,557
What did she have to do that for?

942
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,893
l guess that's something wonderful.

943
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:06,394
Young!

944
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:08,813
How much do you suppose
the little dickens...?

945
01:10:09,022 --> 01:10:11,149
l want to know who fed
liquor to Millie!

946
01:10:12,484 --> 01:10:15,279
He did, Mrs. Owens!
lt's all his fault!

947
01:10:15,737 --> 01:10:17,155
Wait a minute.

948
01:10:18,073 --> 01:10:20,951
Millie was your date.
You should've been looking after her.

949
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,662
But you were too busy
making eyes at Madge.

950
01:10:25,623 --> 01:10:27,458
The boy didn't do anything.

951
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:30,878
You've been stomping around in
those boots like you owned the place.

952
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:33,965
Thinking every woman you saw
was gonna fall madly in love.

953
01:10:34,173 --> 01:10:36,968
Here's one woman
didn't pay you any mind!

954
01:10:37,468 --> 01:10:39,971
Bragging about your father!

955
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:42,307
l bet he wasn't
any better than you are.

956
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:44,934
Strutting around here
like some crummy Apollo!

957
01:10:45,143 --> 01:10:46,770
You think, because you act young...

958
01:10:46,978 --> 01:10:49,814
...you can walk in here and
make off with whatever you like.

959
01:10:51,024 --> 01:10:52,984
Let me tell you something.

960
01:10:53,902 --> 01:10:55,279
You're a fake!

961
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,991
You're no jive kid.
You're just scared to act your age!

962
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,577
Buy yourself a mirror
and take a look in it.

963
01:11:01,785 --> 01:11:03,746
lt won't be long before
you're counting the gray hairs...

964
01:11:03,954 --> 01:11:06,832
...if you've got any left!
And what'll become of you then?

965
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:09,960
You'll end your life in the gutter,
and it'll serve you right!

966
01:11:10,169 --> 01:11:13,422
The gutter's where you came from,
and the gutter's where you belong!

967
01:11:14,257 --> 01:11:16,008
Shut your mouth!

968
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:27,687
Turn that off!

969
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:29,981
This isn't a sideshow!

970
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:31,817
Go on now. Come on!

971
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:33,694
Go on about your business!

972
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:36,446
Go on about your business!

973
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:38,157
Get out of here!

974
01:11:38,365 --> 01:11:40,451
Turn out that light, l said!

975
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:42,369
What happened, Hal?

976
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,672
Answer me.
What did you do?!

977
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,884
Same old Hal!

978
01:11:57,885 --> 01:12:00,096
l'm sorry, Mrs. Owens.

979
01:12:00,388 --> 01:12:02,515
l should have known better
than to trust him.

980
01:12:11,233 --> 01:12:13,610
There's to be no more drinking!

981
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:16,196
lt was my fault, Mrs. Owens.

982
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,782
l brought the whiskey.

983
01:12:19,491 --> 01:12:21,827
Alan, come and help me with Millie.

984
01:12:37,593 --> 01:12:39,596
What made me do it, Howard?

985
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:42,599
What made me act that way?

986
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:48,104
Maybe it's...

987
01:12:49,105 --> 01:12:51,108
...the harvest moon, honey.

988
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:56,113
l wanted to have
a good time tonight, Howard.

989
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:59,616
This is my last night of vacation.

990
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:02,953
Maybe we should go for a ride, honey.

991
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:04,204
Yes!

992
01:13:04,705 --> 01:13:06,123
Yes, let's.

993
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,627
l want to have a good time!

994
01:13:09,794 --> 01:13:11,963
l want to have a good time!

995
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,983
Beat it, baby!
l'm in a bad mood.

996
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,151
Please wait a minute.

997
01:13:35,112 --> 01:13:37,531
Alan shouldn't have talked
that way to you.

998
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,033
l said, beat it!

999
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:49,001
Okay, baby, you asked for it!

1000
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:27,875
Okay, go on home.

1001
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:30,711
Tell them anything you want.
Thank Benson for his shirt.

1002
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,423
-What are you going to do?
-There'll be a freight here soon.

1003
01:14:58,574 --> 01:15:01,368
Women like Miss Sydney make me mad
at the whole female sex.

1004
01:15:04,496 --> 01:15:06,415
What's the use, baby?

1005
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,292
l'm a bum.

1006
01:15:08,793 --> 01:15:11,712
She saw through me
like an x-ray machine.

1007
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,966
There's no place in the world
for a guy like me.

1008
01:15:15,174 --> 01:15:17,093
But there's got to be.

1009
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,387
Don't pay any attention to her.

1010
01:15:19,596 --> 01:15:21,306
You are young.

1011
01:15:24,184 --> 01:15:25,643
Yes, you are.

1012
01:15:26,353 --> 01:15:28,855
But not so young you're not a man too.

1013
01:15:30,565 --> 01:15:32,734
And you're very entertaining.

1014
01:15:33,652 --> 01:15:36,446
l think you say
all sorts of witty things.

1015
01:15:37,072 --> 01:15:39,366
l just love listening to your talk.

1016
01:15:41,952 --> 01:15:43,954
And you're a wonderful dancer.

1017
01:15:44,455 --> 01:15:45,623
Thanks.

1018
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,959
l can tell a lot about a man
by dancing with him.

1019
01:15:49,585 --> 01:15:50,920
You know, some boys...

1020
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:53,589
...when they take a girl
in their arms to dance...

1021
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,802
...they make her feel
sort of uncomfortable.

1022
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:00,555
But with you...

1023
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,934
...l had the feeling you knew
exactly what you were doing.

1024
01:16:06,102 --> 01:16:08,605
And l could follow you
every step of the way.

1025
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,275
You've got lots of qualities.

1026
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:14,820
Let me level with you, baby.

1027
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,531
When l was 1 4,
l spent a year in jail.

1028
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,074
Honest?

1029
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:22,870
Called it a reform school.
Let me tell you, it was a jail!

1030
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:24,622
For what?

1031
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,293
l stole another guy's motorcycle.

1032
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,129
l stole it because l wanted to get...

1033
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,591
...so far away so fast,
nobody would ever catch me.

1034
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:38,469
Everybody feels that way sometimes.

1035
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:43,641
Then my old lady
went to the authorities.

1036
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:47,270
''l've done everything l can
with the boy.

1037
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,606
l can't do anything more.''

1038
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:53,735
So off l go to that
lousy, stinking place!

1039
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,740
When l finally get out...

1040
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,911
...the old lady's sorry
to see me back...

1041
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:08,834
...because my dad's loaded
all the time.

1042
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,462
And she's got a new boyfriend...

1043
01:17:11,671 --> 01:17:13,381
...and l'm in the way.

1044
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:18,303
lt's awful when parents
don't get along.

1045
01:17:20,138 --> 01:17:21,222
Well, there you are!

1046
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:24,225
And l never told that
to another soul.

1047
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:26,561
lf you wanna faint
or get sick or go home...

1048
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,396
...go on, because l won't--

1049
01:17:38,532 --> 01:17:40,409
Baby, what did you do?

1050
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:46,999
l get so tired
of just being told l'm pretty.

1051
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:14,277
The others!
We've got to get back to the picnic.

1052
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,784
Do we?

1053
01:19:09,502 --> 01:19:12,338
Here we are,
back where we started from.

1054
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,182
Everybody else must be home hours.

1055
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,646
l'm glad we went off.

1056
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,485
Good night, Rosemary.

1057
01:19:36,113 --> 01:19:37,656
l should say, ''Good morning.''

1058
01:19:37,865 --> 01:19:39,450
Where are you going, Howard?

1059
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:43,704
Why, home, honey.

1060
01:19:44,955 --> 01:19:46,791
You can't go off without me.

1061
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,210
Not after tonight.

1062
01:19:50,503 --> 01:19:51,796
Take me with you.

1063
01:19:53,548 --> 01:19:56,134
Honey, be reasonable.
What would people say?

1064
01:19:57,218 --> 01:19:58,344
People?

1065
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,597
What do they say
if l thumb my nose at them...

1066
01:20:00,805 --> 01:20:02,932
...or if l showed my pink panties
on the street?

1067
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:04,934
What do l care what people say?

1068
01:20:05,894 --> 01:20:07,020
Look, honey.

1069
01:20:07,228 --> 01:20:09,856
You'd better go inside
and get some sleep.

1070
01:20:10,398 --> 01:20:12,651
You got to start school
in the morning.

1071
01:20:15,821 --> 01:20:18,198
Can't we talk this over on Saturday?

1072
01:20:20,868 --> 01:20:23,412
Maybe you won't be back Saturday.

1073
01:20:24,205 --> 01:20:26,415
You know better than that.

1074
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,877
Maybe you won't be back ever again.

1075
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,758
You're not yourself tonight.

1076
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:38,720
Yes, l am.

1077
01:20:39,804 --> 01:20:42,599
l'm more myself than l ever was.

1078
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,769
l see what's in store for me.

1079
01:20:46,436 --> 01:20:47,938
After you...

1080
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,898
...someone else...

1081
01:20:50,106 --> 01:20:51,108
...then...

1082
01:20:52,192 --> 01:20:54,069
...someone else.

1083
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:55,529
Then....

1084
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:56,738
Take me with you.

1085
01:20:56,947 --> 01:20:59,783
lf you don't, l don't know
what l'll do. l mean it.

1086
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,414
When we first started
to go together...

1087
01:21:06,248 --> 01:21:08,459
...you were the best sport
l ever saw.

1088
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:11,295
Always good for a laugh.

1089
01:21:12,463 --> 01:21:14,590
l can't laugh anymore.

1090
01:21:16,467 --> 01:21:18,428
You said you'd marry me
after my vacation.

1091
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:21,222
You said you'd be waiting
with the preacher.

1092
01:21:21,431 --> 01:21:24,809
-l've had a busy summer.
-Where's the preacher?

1093
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:35,654
l'm not a boy anymore.

1094
01:21:37,322 --> 01:21:39,867
A person forms
certain ways of living.

1095
01:21:40,325 --> 01:21:43,537
And one day it's too late to change.

1096
01:21:45,915 --> 01:21:48,084
l'm no spring chicken either.

1097
01:21:49,335 --> 01:21:51,837
Maybe l'm a little older
than you think.

1098
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:55,591
My ways are formed too.

1099
01:21:56,384 --> 01:21:58,636
But they can be changed.

1100
01:21:59,846 --> 01:22:02,348
They got to be changed.

1101
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:06,519
lt's no good living like this...

1102
01:22:07,145 --> 01:22:08,897
...in rented rooms...

1103
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:14,361
...meeting a bunch of old maids
for supper every night...

1104
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:18,073
...then coming back home...

1105
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:21,618
...alone.

1106
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:29,377
Each year l keep telling myself
it's the last.

1107
01:22:30,753 --> 01:22:32,547
Something will happen.

1108
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:36,342
Nothing ever does.

1109
01:22:37,343 --> 01:22:40,597
Except l get a little crazier
all the time.

1110
01:22:41,222 --> 01:22:44,434
-Well--
-A well's a hole in the ground!

1111
01:22:45,268 --> 01:22:47,812
l wasn't trying to be funny.

1112
01:22:51,858 --> 01:22:54,027
Can't we talk this over
on Saturday?

1113
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:55,988
l'm dead tired.

1114
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:02,077
l got a busy week ahead of me.

1115
01:23:02,828 --> 01:23:04,872
You got to marry me.

1116
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:08,376
l can't marry you now.

1117
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,670
You can be over in the morning.

1118
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,312
No.

1119
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:31,733
l'm not going to marry
anyone who says:

1120
01:23:31,942 --> 01:23:34,278
''You've got to marry me, Howard.''

1121
01:23:35,696 --> 01:23:37,990
l mean, the thing is....

1122
01:23:39,408 --> 01:23:41,160
lf a woman wants me to marry her...

1123
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:44,246
...she can at least say, ''Please.''

1124
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:47,374
Please...

1125
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,460
...marry me, Howard.

1126
01:23:53,881 --> 01:23:54,882
Please!

1127
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:05,644
Come on inside.

1128
01:24:06,978 --> 01:24:09,231
Now go to bed and
get some sleep.

1129
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:11,650
l'll drive over in the morning.

1130
01:24:12,442 --> 01:24:14,236
Maybe we can talk it over.

1131
01:24:15,112 --> 01:24:17,990
Don't come unless you're
taking me away.

1132
01:24:22,077 --> 01:24:24,371
Please marry me, Howard.

1133
01:24:24,747 --> 01:24:26,248
Please.

1134
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:28,918
Go to bed.
Get some sleep.

1135
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:34,507
Please?

1136
01:25:20,221 --> 01:25:21,848
How will you get in?

1137
01:25:22,724 --> 01:25:24,601
The kitchen door is always open.

1138
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:32,317
Are you all right, baby?

1139
01:25:33,402 --> 01:25:35,320
Yes, l'm all right.

1140
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:39,575
lf l thought l'd done anything...

1141
01:25:39,783 --> 01:25:41,368
...to make you unhappy...

1142
01:25:42,494 --> 01:25:44,371
...l'd almost want to die.

1143
01:25:48,084 --> 01:25:49,502
Yes, Mama.

1144
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,629
l'm coming.

1145
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,598
You'd better go.

1146
01:26:04,517 --> 01:26:07,229
l'll take the car back
to Benson's house.

1147
01:26:09,272 --> 01:26:12,067
l didn't even think of him
until this second.

1148
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:15,612
l ought to be shot at sunrise.

1149
01:26:16,947 --> 01:26:20,034
l guess neither of us
thought too much about anything.

1150
01:26:24,288 --> 01:26:25,539
Good night.

1151
01:26:26,832 --> 01:26:28,334
When will l see you?

1152
01:26:29,085 --> 01:26:30,586
l don't know.

1153
01:26:31,462 --> 01:26:33,798
What time are you through
at the dime store?

1154
01:26:34,382 --> 01:26:35,508
Six.

1155
01:26:35,717 --> 01:26:38,011
Maybe l could come by then.

1156
01:26:43,475 --> 01:26:45,685
l start a job tomorrow.

1157
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:52,192
Maybe not with Benson.

1158
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,279
Someplace.

1159
01:27:00,075 --> 01:27:01,327
You don't mind...

1160
01:27:01,493 --> 01:27:03,495
...seeing a guy who's...

1161
01:27:03,996 --> 01:27:06,540
...just a grain scooper, do you?

1162
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,502
Of course not.

1163
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:19,095
Baby, would you...

1164
01:27:19,762 --> 01:27:21,514
...kiss me good night?

1165
01:27:22,182 --> 01:27:23,349
No.

1166
01:27:24,476 --> 01:27:25,477
Just once for...

1167
01:27:25,685 --> 01:27:27,395
...for luck maybe, huh?

1168
01:27:28,688 --> 01:27:30,690
lf l promise not to hold you?

1169
01:27:33,527 --> 01:27:35,529
Are you trying to punish me?

1170
01:27:37,114 --> 01:27:38,574
Yes.

1171
01:27:44,288 --> 01:27:47,333
l think l was trying to punish you.

1172
01:27:48,459 --> 01:27:50,044
Kiss me, Hal.

1173
01:27:59,804 --> 01:28:02,474
Being with you is wonderful, baby.

1174
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,226
You make me feel...

1175
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:07,812
...important.

1176
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:09,022
No!

1177
01:28:11,608 --> 01:28:13,318
You make me feel...

1178
01:28:14,987 --> 01:28:16,238
...patient.

1179
01:28:22,912 --> 01:28:24,288
Do l?

1180
01:28:34,173 --> 01:28:36,259
Don't kiss me anymore.

1181
01:28:36,467 --> 01:28:38,386
Please don't kiss me anymore.

1182
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:33,026
lt's all right.

1183
01:29:33,986 --> 01:29:36,113
l put Mom to bed.

1184
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,623
l was awful tonight, wasn't l?

1185
01:29:52,672 --> 01:29:56,134
Honest, l'm never gonna touch
another drink till the day l die.

1186
01:30:31,087 --> 01:30:34,006
So far, no go.
We've notified the highway patrol.

1187
01:30:34,215 --> 01:30:35,049
You've had hours!

1188
01:30:35,216 --> 01:30:37,885
Can't we all go to bed
and worry about this tomorrow?

1189
01:30:38,094 --> 01:30:40,680
-lt's only a stolen car.
-lt's not!

1190
01:30:40,889 --> 01:30:42,515
Maybe he kidnapped Madge.

1191
01:30:45,352 --> 01:30:46,728
Nobody kidnapped her.

1192
01:30:47,062 --> 01:30:48,688
She's home.

1193
01:30:51,441 --> 01:30:53,402
You got every right to be sore.

1194
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,736
l didn't start out to--

1195
01:30:54,945 --> 01:30:58,198
You saw another pretty girl,
and you had to add her to your list.

1196
01:30:58,407 --> 01:30:59,700
lt wasn't that way at all.

1197
01:30:59,908 --> 01:31:02,077
-No matter what you think.
-You're a liar!

1198
01:31:05,539 --> 01:31:07,458
You're the only friend l ever had.

1199
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,460
l'm not your friend anymore!

1200
01:31:12,713 --> 01:31:14,006
Let me go, you bum!

1201
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:16,384
You no-good hobo!

1202
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:20,597
When l think...

1203
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:23,767
...how glad l was
to see you this morning.

1204
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:26,227
How glad l was!

1205
01:31:27,687 --> 01:31:30,440
l want him arrested.
He stole my car.

1206
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:32,734
That's a lousy lie!
The car's outside.

1207
01:31:32,943 --> 01:31:34,778
lt doesn't matter.
He stole it!

1208
01:31:35,404 --> 01:31:36,655
We'll book you for the night.

1209
01:31:36,864 --> 01:31:38,741
You've got no place to sleep anyway.

1210
01:31:38,949 --> 01:31:40,409
l'm not going to any jail!

1211
01:31:40,617 --> 01:31:43,078
No damn jail, see?

1212
01:31:45,623 --> 01:31:47,375
lt wasn't the car.

1213
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:48,959
Tell him.

1214
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:54,173
Tell him it's not the car!
Tell him it's because of Madge!

1215
01:32:11,858 --> 01:32:13,443
Thanks, kid.

1216
01:32:17,614 --> 01:32:20,617
-Why don't you let him go?
-Nobody's going to push us.

1217
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,195
Let's go to bed, son.

1218
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:57,614
Don't pretend you're not
pleased about this.

1219
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:00,117
-What are you talking about?
-Madge and me!

1220
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:01,994
You wanted to break this up!

1221
01:33:02,202 --> 01:33:06,665
Well, l'm gonna marry Madge.
Start getting used to the idea!

1222
01:33:09,794 --> 01:33:12,964
l hope he gets away.

1223
01:33:50,753 --> 01:33:51,587
Over here!

1224
01:33:51,754 --> 01:33:53,422
He went over this way!

1225
01:34:21,285 --> 01:34:23,954
You check the freight cars.
l'll search the riverbank.

1226
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,884
l have to have at least
one more easy chair.

1227
01:35:18,011 --> 01:35:19,679
What about the closets?

1228
01:35:21,806 --> 01:35:23,808
Barely enough room for my suits.

1229
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:30,232
Slipcovers, l suppose.

1230
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,945
That would have to go.

1231
01:35:41,327 --> 01:35:42,494
No!

1232
01:36:04,684 --> 01:36:06,186
What happened, son?

1233
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:07,646
l remember you...

1234
01:36:07,854 --> 01:36:10,065
...saying you lived
next to the bank.

1235
01:36:10,273 --> 01:36:13,360
-The cops didn't see me hit the river.
-Cops?

1236
01:36:17,072 --> 01:36:18,240
l don't know.

1237
01:36:18,449 --> 01:36:21,035
Benson said l stole his car.

1238
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,412
Please, sir. You got to help me.

1239
01:36:23,621 --> 01:36:26,999
l have to spend the night someplace,
then get out of town.

1240
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,251
Get out of those and dry off.

1241
01:36:30,086 --> 01:36:31,379
What happened was this--

1242
01:36:31,587 --> 01:36:32,922
You don't have to tell me.

1243
01:36:33,297 --> 01:36:34,882
l understand.

1244
01:36:35,591 --> 01:36:37,343
What we need is a drink.

1245
01:36:40,597 --> 01:36:43,016
You've got your troubles,
and l've got mine.

1246
01:36:52,943 --> 01:36:54,194
You got a rag?

1247
01:36:54,403 --> 01:36:55,612
Sure.

1248
01:37:10,044 --> 01:37:12,296
You went for that Owens girl,
didn't you?

1249
01:37:20,805 --> 01:37:22,974
l'll admit they can get
under your skin.

1250
01:37:26,269 --> 01:37:29,439
That doesn't mean we got
to take them too seriously.

1251
01:37:31,483 --> 01:37:32,776
For instance...

1252
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:37,448
...you wouldn't say a man had to
go as far as marrying them.

1253
01:37:39,158 --> 01:37:41,368
You wouldn't say a thing like that,
would you?

1254
01:37:45,623 --> 01:37:47,583
You're not being very helpful.

1255
01:38:23,204 --> 01:38:24,955
Were you awake when she got in?

1256
01:38:25,164 --> 01:38:26,749
No, Mom.

1257
01:38:28,709 --> 01:38:30,753
Didn't she say anything
to you this morning?

1258
01:38:30,962 --> 01:38:32,171
Nothing.

1259
01:38:33,673 --> 01:38:35,967
She's still got her door locked.

1260
01:38:38,803 --> 01:38:40,638
Have you been smoking?!

1261
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:42,015
Hi, Mrs. Potts!

1262
01:38:42,223 --> 01:38:43,975
ls Madge all right?

1263
01:38:44,768 --> 01:38:45,852
Certainly.

1264
01:38:46,102 --> 01:38:48,396
She told me all about it.

1265
01:38:48,939 --> 01:38:52,401
She got out of the car
and left that hoodlum alone.

1266
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:54,945
And she walked home.

1267
01:38:57,739 --> 01:39:00,367
-Has anyone seen Howard?
-Why, no.

1268
01:39:00,576 --> 01:39:03,495
He said he might be over this morning.

1269
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:12,296
She's running around like a chicken
with its head off. Something's up.

1270
01:39:20,263 --> 01:39:21,139
ls Rosemary ready?

1271
01:39:21,347 --> 01:39:23,349
We promised the principal
we'd be there early...

1272
01:39:23,558 --> 01:39:24,934
...to help with registration.

1273
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:27,604
All set for school again?

1274
01:39:27,979 --> 01:39:29,397
Lovely picnic, wasn't it?

1275
01:39:29,606 --> 01:39:30,774
Wasn't it?

1276
01:39:30,982 --> 01:39:32,567
How's Madge?

1277
01:39:32,943 --> 01:39:34,695
Just fine.

1278
01:39:36,405 --> 01:39:39,825
Come on, Christine.
Let's get that sleepy girl out of bed.

1279
01:40:01,848 --> 01:40:03,641
l gotta see Rosemary.

1280
01:40:04,434 --> 01:40:05,852
l think she's expecting me.

1281
01:40:06,061 --> 01:40:09,815
Holler at the bottom of the stairs.
The others are up there with her.

1282
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:13,235
The others?

1283
01:40:13,443 --> 01:40:15,612
Miss Henderson and Schoenwalder.

1284
01:40:15,821 --> 01:40:18,866
l gotta see her alone.
l gotta explain something to her.

1285
01:40:19,074 --> 01:40:20,868
This is the beginning
of my busy season.

1286
01:40:21,076 --> 01:40:23,704
l don't think l'll be able
to make any plans--

1287
01:40:23,954 --> 01:40:24,830
lt's Howard!

1288
01:40:25,122 --> 01:40:26,957
He's come for me!

1289
01:40:30,127 --> 01:40:31,671
You came back!

1290
01:40:33,881 --> 01:40:35,466
Girls! Girls!

1291
01:40:35,675 --> 01:40:37,260
Here's my man!

1292
01:40:37,468 --> 01:40:39,387
What are you screaming
and yelling about?

1293
01:40:40,221 --> 01:40:41,681
What's the matter with you?

1294
01:40:41,848 --> 01:40:44,184
Hear the news!
Most exciting thing you ever heard.

1295
01:40:44,351 --> 01:40:45,644
We're going to be married.

1296
01:40:45,936 --> 01:40:47,687
Now! Today!

1297
01:40:48,647 --> 01:40:50,524
Let me be the first!

1298
01:40:50,857 --> 01:40:52,943
Don't worry.
lt won't take me long.

1299
01:40:53,193 --> 01:40:54,611
We'll help pack.

1300
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:57,239
Packing's almost finished.
l was keeping it a secret.

1301
01:40:57,448 --> 01:40:58,657
Weren't we?

1302
01:40:58,866 --> 01:41:00,492
Don't forget to wear something old.

1303
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:01,535
Nylons!

1304
01:41:01,744 --> 01:41:03,162
Something new.

1305
01:41:03,537 --> 01:41:04,955
My new handbag!

1306
01:41:05,206 --> 01:41:06,832
Something borrowed.

1307
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:08,334
Thank you!

1308
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:11,546
l don't see anything blue.

1309
01:41:12,129 --> 01:41:13,965
And you ain't going to.

1310
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:16,551
We'll put something funny
in her bag.

1311
01:41:16,759 --> 01:41:18,344
lrma, you kill me!

1312
01:41:22,223 --> 01:41:23,183
Congratulations.

1313
01:41:23,391 --> 01:41:25,727
l know you'll be happy.
l want you to know--

1314
01:41:28,897 --> 01:41:31,900
l called and called.
Why didn't you answer?

1315
01:41:32,734 --> 01:41:34,528
Alan phoned.

1316
01:41:34,736 --> 01:41:38,991
He said to tell you he's not angry.
He knows it wasn't your fault.

1317
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,451
And then he said....

1318
01:41:40,743 --> 01:41:42,411
Let me get this straight.

1319
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,999
He said, ''Tell Madge it's important.
l want to see her.''

1320
01:41:48,876 --> 01:41:50,878
Did you hear what l said?

1321
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:52,463
Yes.

1322
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:55,925
You ought to thank
your lucky stars, young lady.

1323
01:41:57,093 --> 01:41:58,511
Come see this divine outfit!

1324
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,805
We need your approval.
Come on!

1325
01:42:04,434 --> 01:42:06,519
Come help us with the bags.

1326
01:42:08,063 --> 01:42:09,648
He's outside.

1327
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:13,944
He's hiding in my car.
The police are after him.

1328
01:42:14,152 --> 01:42:15,487
But he says he's got to see you.

1329
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,581
Be careful.

1330
01:42:26,207 --> 01:42:29,377
l got the rice! Let's go get
some paint. Mrs. Potts has some!

1331
01:42:34,132 --> 01:42:35,758
Miss Sydney is getting married!

1332
01:42:35,967 --> 01:42:37,010
Who?

1333
01:42:38,928 --> 01:42:41,723
Let's decorate the car!
Let's get some paint!

1334
01:42:45,143 --> 01:42:48,230
Christine, get some rice.
Be ready. She'll be right out.

1335
01:42:53,986 --> 01:42:55,028
l'm gonna cry.

1336
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:57,990
lmagine something like this
the first day of school!

1337
01:42:58,907 --> 01:43:01,076
All the happiness in the world!

1338
01:43:01,368 --> 01:43:03,787
Howard, look!
The sun has come out.

1339
01:43:03,996 --> 01:43:07,124
You would pick a wonderful day.
Let's go!

1340
01:43:15,591 --> 01:43:17,844
You've been a wonderful friend.

1341
01:43:18,052 --> 01:43:20,889
l wish you all kinds
of happiness, Rosemary.

1342
01:43:21,097 --> 01:43:21,931
l mean...

1343
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:23,641
...Mrs. Bevans!

1344
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:27,812
Wait till we tell
the principal about this.

1345
01:43:28,021 --> 01:43:29,731
Where's Madge?
Goodbye, Madge!

1346
01:43:30,649 --> 01:43:31,733
Goodbye.

1347
01:43:32,985 --> 01:43:35,070
And don't worry about
the room, Mrs. Owens.

1348
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:37,030
l know Miss Breckenridge will take it.

1349
01:43:37,614 --> 01:43:39,158
And she's a darling girl.

1350
01:43:39,366 --> 01:43:40,701
Yes, she sure is. Look!

1351
01:43:41,869 --> 01:43:43,204
We've still got to
pick up the license.

1352
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,705
l nearly forgot.

1353
01:43:44,914 --> 01:43:48,209
l left my hot-water bottle
and my curlers in the bathroom.

1354
01:43:48,376 --> 01:43:51,212
Would you store the rest
of my things in your attic?

1355
01:43:51,712 --> 01:43:52,713
We'd better hurry.

1356
01:43:52,922 --> 01:43:54,549
Where are we going?

1357
01:44:01,389 --> 01:44:04,100
l got a cousin who has
a tourist camp in the Ozarks, but--

1358
01:44:04,309 --> 01:44:07,229
-l love the Ozarks!
-Wonderful this time of year!

1359
01:44:07,437 --> 01:44:10,023
l was there three years ago
for my vacation.

1360
01:44:10,232 --> 01:44:11,525
Get ready.

1361
01:44:14,236 --> 01:44:16,572
Have a wonderful time!

1362
01:44:18,073 --> 01:44:20,701
So long. You know what
you can tell the principal for me.

1363
01:44:26,874 --> 01:44:27,875
Hey, kids!

1364
01:44:28,084 --> 01:44:29,168
lt's Miss Sydney!

1365
01:44:29,377 --> 01:44:31,254
She's getting married.

1366
01:44:31,587 --> 01:44:32,588
lt's Howard Bevans!

1367
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:50,232
Hi, baby.

1368
01:44:52,818 --> 01:44:54,152
l'm in a jam.

1369
01:44:54,444 --> 01:44:55,279
Howard told me.

1370
01:44:55,946 --> 01:44:57,531
l just couldn't run out of town...

1371
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:59,074
...and never see you again.

1372
01:44:59,616 --> 01:45:00,951
Where are you going?

1373
01:45:02,119 --> 01:45:03,454
Tulsa.

1374
01:45:03,996 --> 01:45:05,456
l always get a job...

1375
01:45:05,623 --> 01:45:07,124
...Hotel Mayo.

1376
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:08,751
Bellhopping.

1377
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,296
Did you see what l put
on the back of the car?

1378
01:45:15,925 --> 01:45:17,760
lt's the young man!

1379
01:45:22,807 --> 01:45:24,559
Don't blow your top.
l'm leaving town.

1380
01:45:24,809 --> 01:45:25,644
Leaving?

1381
01:45:26,144 --> 01:45:29,106
l thought you were going
to stay here and settle down.

1382
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,733
l thought so too, ma'am.

1383
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:36,989
Aren't you gonna say goodbye?

1384
01:45:37,448 --> 01:45:38,449
Goodbye.

1385
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,368
Are you mad at me?

1386
01:45:44,246 --> 01:45:46,332
l gotta know how you feel.

1387
01:45:46,624 --> 01:45:48,209
Last night l thought...

1388
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:50,211
...you liked me.

1389
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:52,505
l did like you.

1390
01:45:52,672 --> 01:45:54,549
l liked you from
the first time l saw you.

1391
01:45:54,757 --> 01:45:57,010
Are you out of your senses?

1392
01:46:00,847 --> 01:46:02,682
l've been thinking all night.

1393
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:05,560
l've never said this before,
because it....

1394
01:46:06,645 --> 01:46:09,481
lt'd make me seem like
such a freak, but....

1395
01:46:09,689 --> 01:46:10,816
What?

1396
01:46:11,817 --> 01:46:13,151
l love you, Madge.

1397
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,653
Do you hear?

1398
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:17,281
l want you in the house
this minute.

1399
01:46:17,906 --> 01:46:18,991
Do you love me?

1400
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,242
Do you?

1401
01:46:21,327 --> 01:46:23,996
l'll have the police
put you where you belong.

1402
01:46:24,205 --> 01:46:26,874
lf you please, ma'am.
l'm catching that freight.

1403
01:46:28,834 --> 01:46:30,503
Meet me, baby.
We'll get married.

1404
01:46:31,587 --> 01:46:35,049
They'll give me a room in the hotel
until we find something better.

1405
01:46:35,258 --> 01:46:36,426
Don't listen.

1406
01:46:36,634 --> 01:46:38,678
l got a chance with you.

1407
01:46:38,887 --> 01:46:42,265
lt won't be bigtime,
but that isn't important, is it?

1408
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,060
Come on.

1409
01:46:45,435 --> 01:46:46,519
Oh, Hal, l can't.

1410
01:46:46,811 --> 01:46:47,938
Why?

1411
01:46:48,605 --> 01:46:50,899
Don't you see why?
Don't you?

1412
01:46:53,986 --> 01:46:55,487
Listen, baby...

1413
01:46:55,863 --> 01:46:58,198
...you're the only real thing
l ever wanted.

1414
01:46:58,699 --> 01:47:00,576
Ever. You're mine.

1415
01:47:00,743 --> 01:47:04,455
l've got to claim what's mine, or
l'll be nothing as long as l live.

1416
01:47:10,253 --> 01:47:11,420
You love me.

1417
01:47:11,629 --> 01:47:12,839
You know it.

1418
01:47:13,256 --> 01:47:14,465
You love me.

1419
01:47:18,052 --> 01:47:19,345
You love me!

1420
01:48:03,475 --> 01:48:06,061
You liked him, didn't you, Helen?

1421
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:09,022
Yes, l did.

1422
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:13,443
l got so used to things
as they were.

1423
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:16,029
Everything so prim.

1424
01:48:16,363 --> 01:48:18,449
The geranium in the window...

1425
01:48:18,657 --> 01:48:21,285
...the smell of Mama's medicines.

1426
01:48:21,493 --> 01:48:23,621
And then he walked in.

1427
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:25,956
And it was different.

1428
01:48:26,165 --> 01:48:29,961
He clomped through the place
like he was still outdoors.

1429
01:48:30,419 --> 01:48:32,713
There was a man in the house.

1430
01:48:32,922 --> 01:48:35,049
And it seemed good.

1431
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:50,691
When l graduate from college,
l'm going to New York...

1432
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:54,945
...and write novels that'll shock people
right out of their senses.

1433
01:48:55,153 --> 01:48:57,865
l'm never going to fall in love.
Not me.

1434
01:48:58,574 --> 01:49:00,909
l'm not going to live
in some jerkwater town...

1435
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:05,206
...and marry some ornery guy
and raise a lot of grimy kids.

1436
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,712
But just because l'm a dope
doesn't mean you have to be.

1437
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:20,096
l was watching out the window
when he said goodbye.

1438
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:27,729
Go with him, Madge.

1439
01:49:30,107 --> 01:49:33,527
For once in your life,
do something bright.

1440
01:49:51,712 --> 01:49:55,299
Hey, Madge,
do you want to go dancing?

1441
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,719
Let me be next, Madge.

1442
01:50:01,097 --> 01:50:03,308
Get out of this yard!
Get out!

1443
01:50:03,516 --> 01:50:05,060
Neewollah!

1444
01:50:18,991 --> 01:50:20,826
l'm going to Tulsa, Mom.

1445
01:50:22,953 --> 01:50:24,830
You don't know what you're doing.
You can't.

1446
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:25,915
l'm going, Mom.

1447
01:50:26,123 --> 01:50:27,708
Listen to me.
Put down that bag.

1448
01:50:27,917 --> 01:50:31,045
-Listen to what l've got to say.
-A bus is coming. l've got to hurry.

1449
01:50:31,254 --> 01:50:33,881
He's no good. He'll never
be able to support you.

1450
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:36,634
And when he does have a job,
he'll spend it all on drink.

1451
01:50:37,218 --> 01:50:39,179
And after that,
there'll be other women.

1452
01:50:39,387 --> 01:50:40,722
l know.

1453
01:50:41,514 --> 01:50:45,101
You don't love someone
because he's perfect.

1454
01:50:46,228 --> 01:50:48,480
Just think about it a few days.

1455
01:50:55,904 --> 01:50:57,823
Goodbye, Mrs. Potts.

1456
01:50:59,325 --> 01:51:01,827
l'll miss you
almost as much as Mom.

1457
01:51:02,161 --> 01:51:03,621
Madge, look.

1458
01:51:03,829 --> 01:51:05,831
You've got to be here
for the festival.

1459
01:51:05,998 --> 01:51:07,291
lt's your duty.

1460
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:10,461
Alan's going to take you.

1461
01:51:13,506 --> 01:51:16,342
But l don't love Alan, Mom.

1462
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,388
Don't worry about me.

1463
01:51:23,516 --> 01:51:25,268
My little girl.

1464
01:51:25,518 --> 01:51:26,645
My baby.

1465
01:51:26,853 --> 01:51:28,730
Don't go. Don't!

1466
01:51:44,997 --> 01:51:48,000
But there are so many things
l meant to tell her....

1467
01:51:48,501 --> 01:51:50,503
l never got around to it.

1468
01:51:50,753 --> 01:51:53,673
Let her learn them for herself.

1469
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,845
Come on, Millie! You don't
want to be late the first day!
