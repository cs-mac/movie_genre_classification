1
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:10,359
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,361
<i>this next race is</i>
<i>a claiming race for $6,500</i>

3
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:14,862
<i>for three-year-olds and up.</i>

4
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:17,265
<i>The pacers are approaching</i>
<i>the starting line,</i>

5
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,502
<i>and they're off.</i>
<i>It's Golden Girl going to the front...</i>

6
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:24,089
They got a few
pieces down, but no craps.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,092
B.J., crib, some wheels.

8
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,127
But the Rabbi's with it,

9
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,446
so you'll be pitching
right out of the synagogue.

10
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:34,449
Maybe they'll make
you honorary Jew, hmm?

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,451
Well, you get a
day's pay out of it,

12
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:39,287
but you're gonna have
to deal from the shoe.

13
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:41,573
We used to have
three spots a night.

14
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,575
Now I get a $5.00
and $10.00 poker game

15
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,079
'cause these fucking casinos
got the entire planet broke.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,282
Everything is comped
with these fuckers.

17
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,788
You know, we could take
them off at the crap table.

18
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,792
Take 'em off?
The casino? Huh?

19
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,227
There are mirrors
on every table,

20
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,678
spotters all over
the place.

21
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,581
Fucking eye in the sky,
every 12 feet apart.

22
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:08,700
What are you gonna take,
a walk around the block?

23
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,452
Come on.
You know my move.

24
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:11,770
I know you got
a great move,

25
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,273
but the casinos put
something in the craps

26
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,442
so that nobody can
switch 'em.

27
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,313
Well, how come I never
heard of that?

28
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,814
It's a federal beef,
Joe.

29
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,816
You know, bumps did
a three and change

30
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,319
for going against the casinos.
It's still on paper.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,322
Look, I got to go. I got to go.
My daughter's in town.

32
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,742
Oh, don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll find something, ok?

33
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,827
What about your kid?

34
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,330
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

35
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,765
All right.
Well, take care of yourself.

36
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:40,408
Well, you want odds
on that come back?

37
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,594
No more bets.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,381
Swing shift.

39
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,349
Table 6.

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,585
They're going
in and out.

41
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:01,480
Looks ok.
She in the book?

42
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:09,270
Yeah!

43
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,324
Ok.

44
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,234
All right.
Here we go.

45
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:43,204
Here we go. Want a 4?

46
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,290
Look.
They're out again.

47
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,484
Right there.

48
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,619
Yeah. Go.

49
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,380
You've been made.

50
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:11,198
Excuse me?

51
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,101
What are you
talking about?

52
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:15,537
Excuse me.

53
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,109
Hold the dice,
please.

54
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,245
Excuse me.
Could you come with us, please?

55
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:24,346
Why?

56
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,703
Tell 'em to grab
the beard, too.

57
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,174
- You too, sir.
- Me?

58
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,593
Absolutely. Right now.
Take your chips. Let's go.

59
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,612
That's ok.
We won't be long.

60
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,614
I didn't do--

61
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,616
Sorry, guys. Um, ok.

62
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,051
Uh, I'll be back.

63
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,922
Gonna take 'em to Dodge.
We got her. Come on.

64
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,456
Miss, have a seat.

65
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,029
Were you cheating?

66
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,031
- What? I--
- Were you cheating?

67
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,633
I-- I--

68
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,436
Jeez.

69
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,890
I'm a cosmetics
distributor.

70
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,959
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- I-- I am.

71
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:58,806
Find table four.
Zoom in on section three.

72
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:06,781
Now look, Miss,

73
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,834
This would all go
a lot smoother for you and...

74
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,253
your man if you just
come clean.

75
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:13,838
<i>What?</i>

76
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,341
<i>I don't even</i>
<i>know him, ok?</i>

77
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,643
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

78
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,563
Look, look, I come here all the time
and nobody bothers me, all right?

79
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:24,616
This is-- this is
ridiculous. It is. Look.

80
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,253
Look, I'm not upset. I just want
to get out of here, all right?

81
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:28,970
Get the hammer.

82
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,022
A hammer? N-no.
This is insane.

83
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,358
- I want a cop here now.
- Oh, really?

84
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,625
Yeah.

85
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,663
All right, play it.

86
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:44,469
All right, freeze it.

87
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,790
What are you doing there?

88
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,758
- Um...
- Sit down.

89
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,577
Uh, ok.
I'm getting my makeup out.

90
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,579
What, I-- I can't
do that or what?

91
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,414
Where's the dice?

92
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,783
I don't know what
you're talking about.

93
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,469
Lady, we know our equipment.
Where the fuck are the dice?

94
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,187
I don't...

95
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,708
Hammer,
take a look at this.

96
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,078
They went out
on her roll.

97
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,547
Any big winners at the table?

98
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,652
You find anything on her?

99
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,104
What about this guy?

100
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,657
You know him?

101
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,093
I've seen him before.

102
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,513
How ya doin'?

103
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,117
Yeah, how ya doin'?

104
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,973
Hey,
how's it going?

105
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:39,841
- Let me see your hands, Honey.
- Yeah, sure.

106
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,709
Mm-hmm.

107
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,980
Where's the dice?

108
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,114
I don't have any dice.

109
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,683
- I know you don't.
- I don't.

110
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,560
Rouge.

111
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,630
Rouge?

112
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:04,565
W-what does that mean?

113
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:08,136
It means that,
without any money lost,

114
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,139
anything found on them,

115
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,574
no harm done.

116
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,131
That's very cute.

117
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,133
See, my bosses
are bean counters.

118
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,135
They need proof.
I don't, though.

119
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,620
I don't give a fuck what
you do out on the street.

120
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,090
Don't fuck with me.

121
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,092
Take your shit,

122
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,595
get the hell out of here, and don't
come back. Get her out of here.

123
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,597
- I'm filing a complaint.
- You do that, sweetie.

124
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,032
Yep.

125
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,101
And you...

126
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,554
Maybe it's a fluke,
you come running up

127
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,106
Like the white knight at the
last second, but I doubt it.

128
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,609
Been in the game
too long.

129
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,613
Consider yourself the
luckiest man in Atlantic City.

130
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:55,049
Now fuck off.

131
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,621
What's with this rouge?

132
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,573
It's talc and oil.

133
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,625
The eye sees it
as ultra-red.

134
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,126
Shoots the back of
the second mirror.

135
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,996
That's why we couldn't
see through it.

136
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,917
- Well?
- Well.

137
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,952
Stanley was right.
They're marking the dice.

138
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,454
Yeah? You see it?

139
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,422
<i>Yeah, I saw it.</i>

140
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:37,892
That's just terrific because I'm not used
to getting treated like that, you know?

141
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,693
Come on, Jan. How was I to know
they were gonna back-room us?

142
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:41,262
- Oh, you knew.
- I didn't know.

143
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,298
- You fucking knew.
- No, I didn't know. Come on.

144
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,266
Stanley said they were
marking the dice,

145
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,302
So I figured you smeared
them up a little bit,

146
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,804
You know, make a few false
moves, get a reaction.

147
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,640
I mean, the worse that could
happen was they ask us to leave,

148
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:53,975
which they eventually did.
- No.

149
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,977
They kicked us out,
remember?

150
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,479
After they snapped
our pictures.

151
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,481
Don't you think they're gonna
pass those pictures around

152
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,483
to the other casinos
on the boardwalk?

153
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,986
No, they don't need to.
I mean, they got us on tape.

154
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,438
Oh, really?
That's-- that's just great.

155
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,458
So this casino thing,
is it over or what?

156
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,910
- Oh, no, no. It's not over, no.
- Great.

157
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,362
- Come on, Jan.
- Uh-huh.

158
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,864
What are you worried about?
There's nothing to worry about.

159
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,750
- Come on, Honey.
- Don't "Honey" me.

160
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,308
<i>Wayne.</i>
<i>Yeah, it's Joe.</i>

161
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:29,827
Yeah, the results come in
from Belmont yet?

162
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,329
Ooh. No, no, no.
I couldn't make it last night.

163
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,332
Uh, what's the spread
on Boston?

164
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,335
No, no, it's too high.
No. All right. I'll call you back.

165
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:46,310
Jeff. Hey. It's Joe.

166
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,345
Yeah, what are you
showing on Boston?

167
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,347
No, come on. You keep moving it around.
There's no room there.

168
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,349
I'll tell you what,
you know what?

169
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,820
Give me the Knicks
plus 7 1/2 for a dime,

170
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,705
and give me, uh...

171
00:10:57,706 --> 00:11:00,208
give me Buddy's Revenge
in the late-night double.

172
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,143
$50 box. Yeah.

173
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:03,711
You know what?
I got a call.

174
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:06,214
All right, I got to go.
I'll call you back. All right. Bye.

175
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:08,883
Hello?

176
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,885
Hey, Irene, yeah.

177
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,238
How you doing?

178
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:20,394
Yeah.

179
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,363
All right.

180
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,899
Yeah, I'll be there
tomorrow.

181
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,901
Yeah. Bye.

182
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,383
<i>He participates. It's not that.</i>

183
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:02,386
<i>They all love him.</i>
<i>He's always been a model client.</i>

184
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,871
Then what is it?

185
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,957
Well, as you know,
he's very high-functioning.

186
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,459
He reads, he writes, he
has excellent comprehension.

187
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,762
It's just that his
mood swings are intense.

188
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,698
Irene, what did he do?

189
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,700
It's not just
one incident.

190
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,702
His whole attitude is
becoming more and more hostile.

191
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,704
In the 12 years that
he's been with us,

192
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,039
he's never used
profanity like this.

193
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,375
You know what? I'll donate more,
whatever it takes to get over this.

194
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,377
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not a question of money.

195
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,848
He turns 21 in three weeks.
He's got to move on.

196
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,318
You need to come
and pick up your son

197
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,403
next Wednesday
morning.

198
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:37,905
I can't take him with me.
That's impossible.

199
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:41,142
I'm a salesman. I'm on the
road constantly. You know that.

200
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:43,060
That's good.
Joe loves to travel.

201
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,330
He takes the buses, the
subways, everywhere by himself.

202
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,133
Wait a minute. What are you saying,
that I should take him to work with me?

203
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,451
He can't stay here.

204
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:51,953
He attacked an employee.

205
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,906
We have a no-tolerance rule
against that sort of thing,

206
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,657
and I'm gonna tell you
right now,

207
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,326
so will that group home.

208
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:02,480
All right. What happens
if I don't take him?

209
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,099
Well, then I am gonna
have to refer you

210
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,417
to some state-run
facilities.

211
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,920
Come on, Irene. You know
what those places are like.

212
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,655
You would do that?

213
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,640
I'm not the one
who makes that decision.

214
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,058
Well, isn't there
another place

215
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,978
until he's ready
for the group home?

216
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,813
Well, there's
the Golden Angels.

217
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,732
It's a private facility
in Greenburgh,

218
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,817
but it's expensive.

219
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,268
All right. How much?

220
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,320
It's a great deal
of money, Joe,

221
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,823
Plus there's a lot
of red tape involved.

222
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,825
You mean tax forms,

223
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,827
work stubs,
all that nonsense?

224
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,746
The whole 9.

225
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,032
Look, the logical place
for Joe is the group home.

226
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,767
It's where he belongs.

227
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,188
He'll get a job and
he'll live productively.

228
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,690
That's all I want.

229
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,692
Well, good.
If you take him now,

230
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,594
he'll see what it's like
to be with family.

231
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,879
And in 6 months,

232
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,098
you can reapply for the next
transitive training session.

233
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,550
In 6 months?

234
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,386
You're killing this kid if you
put him with me for 6 months.

235
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,137
He was supposed to enter
the program in three weeks,

236
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:02,974
but he's simply
not ready.

237
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,229
Let's go, let's go.
Concentrate.

238
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,570
Joe Duma's the winner!

239
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:22,009
If you can
get him to agree

240
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,278
To go into the group home
on his own

241
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,865
And stop the cursing and fighting
within the next three weeks,

242
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,301
I'll take another look.

243
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,439
All right.

244
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,176
There it is.
He got it.

245
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,937
Hey, what, do you got a little
hand action going back there?

246
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:11,025
All right.
Whose deal?

247
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,509
My deal.

248
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,128
Come on, ante up.

249
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,130
10.

250
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:29,426
What time did that fuck say
he's getting back?

251
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,995
Why don't you just deal
the damn cards?

252
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,414
I'm waiting on him
same as you.

253
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,903
All right.

254
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,305
One for you,
one for you.

255
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,491
One for little boy blue,

256
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,777
and there and there
and there.

257
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,990
Ok, I bet that.

258
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,691
Yeah, I--I'm in.

259
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,026
I'm out.

260
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,748
I'll raise.

261
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:12,353
There's 14 and change
in the pot.

262
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,489
You can go all in.
You know that?

263
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,975
Hey, this game's pot limit,
not table stakes.

264
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,978
I can go
in my pocket.

265
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,648
You're betting into trip 10s.
You got to have three kings full.

266
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,918
I don't have
three kings full.

267
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,803
Really?

268
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,574
No guts, no glory.

269
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:37,845
I'll call.

270
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,688
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to bet the pot.

271
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:58,999
I'll call.

272
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,036
Aces full.

273
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:11,478
You played that hand
to catch an ace?

274
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:14,331
There was only two out.
They were both in my hand.

275
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:17,601
You said you didn't have
a full house.

276
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:23,724
All the years I've
been playing cards,

277
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:26,143
I never seen a hand
played like this.

278
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,747
I think there's something
going on over here.

279
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,816
Something funny's
going on.

280
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:37,938
I think there's something
funny going on here!

281
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,358
You want
your money back?

282
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,710
Huh?

283
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,612
You shuffled the cards.
You dealt them.

284
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,614
I can't help it
the way they turned out.

285
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,115
That's why
they call it gambling.

286
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,467
You don't like it,
take your money back.

287
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,172
Go ahead.
Take it back.

288
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,649
You're pretty good,
my friend.

289
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:34,878
Lyin', fat fuck.

290
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,065
Hey, hey!
What the hell you doing?

291
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:41,068
Joe, not for nothin', but how'd
you get him to deal the cooler?

292
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,886
I didn't see nothin'.

293
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:46,423
Got to keep your eyes on me.
I'm a little fast. Let me show you something.

294
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,432
Oh, Gee. Huh?

295
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,218
On the cut, baby.
I came in on the cut.

296
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,354
Double George.

297
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,140
What'd I tell you?
You see that?

298
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,744
He's the fucking
best.

299
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,113
Did you see me give him
the "what do you do," huh?

300
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,447
Oh, yeah, real good.

301
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,865
Ha ha ha ha!

302
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,450
You're my hero.

303
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,386
That's it. Come on.
Let's all take a bet.

304
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,829
All right,
I'm clean now.

305
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,331
Oh, he's clean.

306
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,266
Ha ha ha!

307
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,761
It's a nice suit.

308
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,682
It's white.

309
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,254
Yeah,
I can see that.

310
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,257
You know, I'm sorry
I haven't been around much.

311
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,259
Been having
to travel.

312
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,629
Work things.

313
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,414
I got your letters,
though.

314
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,349
Thanks.

315
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,353
I'm not much
of a letter writer.

316
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,964
Don't worry.

317
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,432
You'll be back with your
friends before you know it.

318
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,351
I can go back there?

319
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,854
Well, I mean
to the new place.

320
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,356
I'm not going there.

321
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:19,376
Listen, kid, you're
going to go, ok?

322
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,378
Let's not talk
about it now,

323
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,881
but let's be
realistic here.

324
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,384
I know a girl.

325
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,386
Oh, yeah?

326
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,721
She's pretty.

327
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,791
Is that a fact?

328
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,627
She likes me
very much.

329
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,629
Well, who could
blame her,

330
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,698
you know,
a nice boy like you?

331
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,133
She showed me her clit.

332
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,536
It's pink
and sensitive,

333
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,621
and sometimes
it hides on you

334
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,557
and you have to find it
with your tongue like this.

335
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,067
Great.

336
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:05,072
All right.
Let's go inside. Come on.

337
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:10,461
We have a pitching
game here in the middle of the 9th.

338
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,397
Got a tie ball game...

339
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,830
Hey. Heh!
How's my robe?

340
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,331
It itches.

341
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,832
It itches?

342
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,301
Come here.

343
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,753
Come here.
Roll here. Come on.

344
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,689
You got to keep your eyes on me.
I'm a little fast. Let me show you something.

345
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,057
All right, here.
Watch this, here.

346
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:58,892
All right.
This is called a Fast Jack move.

347
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:00,194
- Fast Jack.
- Fast Jack.

348
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,595
Here's what we do.
All right.

349
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:03,097
You see that?
They're pulling 6.

350
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:05,599
You gonna fade to 6, right?
We're gonna fade to 6.

351
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,017
Who else wants to bet?
Anybody else want to bet?

352
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,519
- They were red.
- That's right.

353
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,020
They were red.
Now look at them now.

354
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,438
They're white.
You see that?

355
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,857
You like that, huh?

356
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,276
See, I use the two
different colors.

357
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:16,777
This way I could watch
the switch.

358
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,279
I could watch if there's
any leaks involved.

359
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,147
See what I'm saying?
Why don't you try it? Go ahead.

360
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:23,066
All right, just--
all right. That's it.

361
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,568
All right, yeah.
Easy with the money.

362
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,036
Put the money down.
Just roll the dice.

363
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,040
That's it. All right.

364
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,043
So, Joey, um, you know,
they said that--

365
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,996
Miss Santini says you're giving
them a hard time over there.

366
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,047
Yeah?

367
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,049
Anybody bothering
you there?

368
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,550
- No.
- No?

369
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,052
They're my family.

370
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,553
They're your family?
All right.

371
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,722
And what about the guys
you live with? I mean, uh,

372
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:47,224
huh? Are they
nice guys?

373
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

374
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:53,263
Um, but, J-Joe,
you can't keep--

375
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:55,149
Just stop for a second.
Look, look. I spoke to Miss Santini,

376
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,652
and she says that if you keep
cursing and fighting, you see,

377
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:01,655
they can't let you
in the group home, ok?

378
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:03,390
I'm not going there!

379
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:04,825
No, what do you mean,
not going there?

380
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,810
- Look look, look. You got to go there, ok?
- No.

381
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,262
- Listen to me. You'd be on your own.
- No.

382
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,314
You're gonna make new friends.
It's gonna be really nice--

383
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,249
I said no!

384
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:18,923
Joe!

385
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,010
Joe! Come back here!

386
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:26,713
Joe! What the hell
is wrong with you?

387
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,200
Get inside. Joey!

388
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,787
Hey! Hey!

389
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:35,689
What the hell is wrong
with you, huh?

390
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,492
Nice people
don't act this way.

391
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,660
That's right.
Stare at me.

392
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:43,447
Go ahead. Stare in these eyes
and see how much I like this.

393
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,449
You are gonna learn whatever
the hell they want you to learn,

394
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,369
And you are gonna go wherever
the fuck they want you to go,

395
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,039
because it's gonna be them or
me, and it ain't gonna be me.

396
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,743
I'm sorry, ok?
I didn't mean it like that.

397
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:58,979
Look, I know
I wasn't there and all,

398
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,881
But I was a phone call away, ok?

399
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,616
Your mother
wasn't there either.

400
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:04,184
My mother's dead!

401
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:09,089
Your mother's not dead, and
stop saying that, all right?

402
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,341
Just stop saying that.

403
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:14,244
Listen to me.

404
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,845
She took off, ok?

405
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,314
What was I
gonna do, huh?

406
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,717
Hands off, fruity pebbles.

407
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:24,738
Look, I don't even know what to
say to you anymore, all right?

408
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,556
What do you say maybe
I get you tickets

409
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:30,244
to, like, some wrestling matches.
How's that? Ok?

410
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,198
I wrestle Greco-Roman.

411
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,950
Tomorrow,
I tell you what,

412
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:40,137
I'll take you
somewhere nice.

413
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,338
Nice?

414
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,707
Yeah. You like
nice, right?

415
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,492
Come on. Come on.
Let's-- everybody likes nice.

416
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,096
Come on. Come on.

417
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:02,459
How you doing, guys?

418
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,427
- Hi, fellas.
- Hey!

419
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,932
Yeah.

420
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,567
Hey, Stan.

421
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,819
Hey, Joe.

422
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,508
Hey, this is Joe.
That's my kid.

423
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,844
I'm making belly
strippers for 30 years.

424
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,415
Some half-ass hustler is gonna
score big with this paper,

425
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,466
and me?
I get $12 a deck.

426
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:29,219
Well, I've heard it before,
Stanley, ok?

427
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,806
Hey! Get away
from there, please.

428
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,378
All right, just...
it's ok.

429
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:41,848
Just tell Stanley
you're sorry, all right?

430
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:45,902
Tell his mother to go
eat a bowl of cocks!

431
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,672
My mother has been dead
for a very long time, kid.

432
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,408
Let's dig her up
and fuck the skeleton.

433
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,014
Oh, shit.

434
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,866
I'm sorry, Stanley.

435
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:03,136
I like him.

436
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:05,072
Listen to me.
Listen to me, ok?

437
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,574
You can't talk like this
to people, all right?

438
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:10,176
You're not
a kid anymore.

439
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:12,695
Just sit down.

440
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:16,333
Listen, I need a full line
of tops for the bait tomorrow.

441
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,451
What do you need?

442
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:19,085
11/16, tangerine,
and do me a favor.

443
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:20,687
Would you give me
the sand finish?

444
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:22,272
You know, the polished ones
are too slippery.

445
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,808
Yeah. In the cabinet.

446
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,478
Joe, I think I found something.
Two guys out of Miami.

447
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:31,248
They got a ton of money.
Perfect for the turn.

448
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,050
Listen, every time you want
to do something like that,

449
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,484
you know what happens,
you know?

450
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,103
These double-cross moves
always come back to haunt you.

451
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:40,440
Joe, listen to me.
These guys are rank suckers.

452
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,475
They go off big
in Vegas.

453
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,711
We can take down some
serious numbers here.

454
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,381
Yeah? Well, you know what?

455
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:49,049
I don't mind robbing
these guys.

456
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,917
I don't mind robbing anybody,

457
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:52,652
but I don't do it
with my mouth.

458
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:54,688
I do it with my hands,
all right?

459
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,761
I'll get that move.

460
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:02,712
Yeah,
someday, huh?

461
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:05,982
See these, kid?
These are tops, ok?

462
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:07,751
You know why
they call them tops?

463
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:11,221
They got no 5s, they
got no 3s, and no Aces.

464
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,939
You see?
We get away with it

465
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,375
Because you only see three
sides of the cube at once.

466
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:17,861
See that? Here.
I'll give you $20

467
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,463
If you can make
a 7 with these.

468
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,465
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

469
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:23,834
Maybe.

470
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,737
No, no, not maybe.
Definitely.

471
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:30,073
Maybe we can go
another way.

472
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,708
What do you mean?

473
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,510
The casinos
in Atlantic City,

474
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,179
What do they use to make the
dice glow, make the 7 light up?

475
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,135
Black light gel.

476
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:45,622
But you need an ultraviolet
lens or filter to see it.

477
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,925
You know, like the eye
in the sky.

478
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,393
Kid, come on, please.
Please stop that.

479
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,662
Can you get me
any of that stuff?

480
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,683
All right, forget it.
You know what?

481
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:58,118
What do I owe you
for the tops?

482
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,452
Ah, we're even.

483
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:00,537
Joe!

484
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,206
Please. It's ok.
Let him have it.

485
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:04,024
Go ahead.

486
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:07,010
All right, come on.

487
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,430
Here. I'll give you $20
for trying to make the 7.

488
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:11,548
I didn't make the 7.

489
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,618
That's ok.
Come on, let's go.

490
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,886
I'm sorry about the kid,
you know.

491
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:20,924
He's, uh-- I--

492
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,626
- See you later.
- <i>Bye.</i>

493
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,138
Just a sec!

494
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,457
Hey!

495
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:41,728
This is Big Joe.

496
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:44,815
Hey, Big Joe.
I'm Janice.

497
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,816
Hi.

498
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,386
- Hi. How you doing?
- Good.

499
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,736
We got some stuff
from Gino's.

500
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:53,056
Great.
Come with me.

501
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,308
Janice, this is a very
beautiful house.

502
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,576
Oh, thank you.

503
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:58,311
I have to use
the bathroom.

504
00:29:58,312 --> 00:29:59,963
Oh, yeah, sure, sweetie.
Just straight down there.

505
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,598
Dad, I'm using
the bathroom.

506
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,033
All right. Go ahead.

507
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,119
So what's
the problem?

508
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,921
I need you to help me
do something, all right?

509
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,106
I got to convince this kid
to get into the group home.

510
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,190
Well, I don't know
what the big deal is.

511
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:12,909
He seems
very sweet to me.

512
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,110
- Sweet?
- Yes, sweet.

513
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,679
Sweet? He ran out
in the street naked,

514
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,348
he beat the shit
out of an orderly,

515
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,284
and then he told Stanley
to eat a bowl of cocks.

516
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:22,619
It's not funny.

517
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,987
No. Well, Stanley needs
to eat a bowl of cocks.

518
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:27,924
Listen to me. I am stuck
with this kid for 6 months

519
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:30,827
if I don't get him into
that home in a few weeks, ok?

520
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,096
It's not the end of the world.
Joe, it's--

521
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,349
What's your
address here?

522
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,853
It's 1524 Pelham Manor.
Excuse me.

523
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:42,622
You come sit down
and eat

524
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:45,325
right here in the chair
of honor.

525
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,543
Want a breadstick?

526
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,029
Yeah.

527
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,265
Let me serve you some...

528
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:58,471
Oh. This is my high school
grad ring. See?

529
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:03,076
Hey. Hey, you. Uh-uh.

530
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,198
You know, your father tells me
that you'll be graduating soon

531
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,001
from that place
where you live.

532
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,969
Yeah!

533
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,671
Come on,
hurry up and eat.

534
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,640
Chasing the shots
is running tonight.

535
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,391
Well, I don't think
I can make it tonight.

536
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,543
What? Are you
kidding me?

537
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,179
I've been waiting
6 months for this horse.

538
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,647
He's a mudder
and it's gonna rain.

539
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,315
Well, the problem is
you make grocery money

540
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,666
and I blow the whole
bankroll.

541
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,267
So who says you have
to bet on every race?

542
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:29,102
Dad.

543
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:30,721
I can't bet one race.
I'm broke.

544
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,072
Dad!

545
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,373
What?

546
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:38,528
There's this guy and
he went to the doctor

547
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:43,733
and the doctor says,
"I have good news, I have bad news.

548
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:47,504
The good news--
the bad news is you have cancer

549
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,723
and you're
gonna die.

550
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:55,379
But the good news was
the nurse in the hall...

551
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,850
Um... the bad news was
the nurse in the hall--"

552
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,219
No, that's the good news.

553
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,220
Yeah.

554
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,488
"The nurse in the hall...

555
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,822
I'm fucking her!"

556
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,590
Yeah,
"I'm fucking her!"

557
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,603
He's a character.

558
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,075
<i># if you want to see her #</i>

559
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:29,846
<i># tell her that you aren't</i>
<i>very far away #</i>

560
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,614

561

<i># we have a love</i>
<i>we can't betray #</i>

564
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:45,228
<i># I'm gonna find my way</i>
<i>to get to you #</i>

565
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:49,800
<i># and make our dreams</i>
<i>come true #</i>

566
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,721
<i># the road ahead of us</i>

567
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,289
<i># ahh ah ah... #</i>

568
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,925
Hey, Joe, want to bring
that music down?

569
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,126
Come on,
give me a break.

570
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:04,730
<i># you know I need you,</i>
<i>you know I love you #</i>

571
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,765
Hello?

572
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:08,384
Mr. Duma,
it's Irene Santini.

573
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:09,552
Hello, Irene.

574
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,954
I just want
to let you know

575
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,723
That I spoke to the
administrators at the group home

576
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:16,943
and they've done everything they
can, but their quota is filled,

577
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:19,829
so it's not possible
to take Joe Junior on,

578
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,964
not in the time
that we discussed.

579
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:23,216
What?

580
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:25,035
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,836
I mean, come on, Irene,
he's doing so good.

582
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,304
He's not cursing
or anything.

583
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:31,441
The filing is done and it's
too late to begin the process.

584
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,177
You told me three weeks,
so what do I do now?

585
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,263
The next session for the group
home begins in the fall.

586
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:40,249
I told you, I can't
keep him here that long.

587
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,888
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>there is simply no other option.</i>

588
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,456
All right, what about
that place we talked about,

589
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,841
that Golden Gates
or something.

590
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:50,910
<i>Oh, you mean,</i>
<i>the Golden Handle?</i>

591
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:52,144
Right.

592
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:54,146
<i>Like I mentioned, it is</i>
<i>a great deal of money.</i>

593
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:56,382
What about if I'm willing to
pay the whole thing in one shot,

594
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,017
you know, for the year?

595
00:33:58,018 --> 00:33:59,302
If that's what
you really want to do,

596
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,070
then I will pass on
my recommendation,

597
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:03,122
and I'm sure that
it will help.

598
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:06,810
Yeah. All right, thanks.

599
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,131
<i># used to be</i>
<i>all by myself #</i>

600
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:33,637
<i># I needed someone else #</i>

601
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,404
<i># to give me... #</i>

602
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:37,691
You know, they grabbed
my picture at the casino.

603
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:39,358
Janice's too.

604
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,860
They got us on tape.

605
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,896
That's how you
discovered the gel, huh?

606
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,564
What were you,
playing to smear?

607
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,532
Ah, you know,
it don't matter.

608
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,735
They got you on tape,
you're fucked.

609
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:50,904
They got us on tape
doing nothing.

610
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,006
Janice was just picking up
the dice and throwing it.

611
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,775
That's it. The tape
could prove that.

612
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:57,811
You know, and I could walk
into any casino I want.

613
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,178
I just can't take down
the money.

614
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,546
Joe, you're not thinking
about going back

615
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:02,315
to Atlantic City,
are you?

616
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:03,883
No, I'm not going
to Atlantic City.

617
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,252
I'm going to Vegas.

618
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:08,237
Vegas?

619
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:10,740
That's a whole other
ball of wax.

620
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,610
Security in Vegas is 10
times tougher than A.C.

621
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,812
That's right. And if A.C. has it,
you can bet that Vegas had it first.

622
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:18,248
You better believe it.

623
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,899
So if we're gonna
make a move,

624
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,918
I say we make a move in the spot
where we can grab the most money,

625
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,919
and that's Vegas.

626
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,171
Move? What move?

627
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,906
Even if you can get
the dice into the game,

628
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:29,208
how are you gonna get
them back out again, huh?

629
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,794
A table gets hot,
every rat spotter

630
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,981
and high-line surveillance
device is gonna be on you.

631
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,267
And on top of that,
they got cameras,

632
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,169
they got tape
everywhere.

633
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,254
No one can overcome that.
No one.

634
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:46,175
Look, Joe, Joe.
Why are we fucking around here?

635
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,611
Why don't we just turn these
two schmucks from Miami?

636
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:49,612
It's a sure thing.

637
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,581
We don't have to take
any chances.

638
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,816
It's not a sure thing.

639
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:55,885
And I need money now.

640
00:35:55,886 --> 00:36:01,057
You get me that black light gel
and I'll come up with something.

641
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,893
All right.

642
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:07,764
Here we go, my boy.
You stick with Teddy, you'll learn plenty.

643
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:14,037
Your daddy's got a set,
let me tell you,

644
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,872
monkey balls.

645
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,374
You're gonna knock all five
of these levels into the game

646
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,427
in one shot.

647
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:24,480
Uh, levels or fronts
are square dots,

648
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,482
which means there's
nothing wrong with them.

649
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:30,886
We got to get them in so your daddy
can match them up with the tops.

650
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:34,223
And the tops is what
gets us the money.

651
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:38,228
We just got to
dirty them up.

652
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,882
Come on.

653
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:45,551
Now shake 'em up.
Shake 'em up real good.

654
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:48,004
Yeah, real good.
Come on.

655
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,490
That's good.

656
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:54,277
Now, you see, now they look more
like the one's they're using.

657
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:58,564
200 open. I got 40.
Who's got the rest?

658
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:00,549
All right, come on.
I'm laying it down. I'm laying it.

659
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,503
Come on, I'll lay 150.
Come on, put it down.

660
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:05,288
Bring it there.
Clean it up, boys.

661
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,623
I'm laying he ain't
making it.

662
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,742
Come on, who wants
a lay in?

663
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:11,678
You're laying 120.

664
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,414
Well, look who's here.
It's aces full.

665
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:19,569
Hey, Mickey, where you at?
I hope you brought your checkbook.

666
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,004
I'm just jocking,
just jocking.

667
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:23,540
What you doing here?

668
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,991
Me? What the fuck are
you guys doing here?

669
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,977
I bought a row of
tickets from Benny.

670
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,729
I do it every year.
Got to support the locals.

671
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,880
Benny who?

672
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,816
You guys want to
dance, go find a dance floor.

673
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,100
I'm here
to play dice, ok?

674
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,202
Who's in the middle?
There's 100 open. Let's go.

675
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:37,988
Yeah, I'm a really
good dancer.

676
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,055
I know you are.

677
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,657
- Who's he?
- That's my son.

678
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:42,541
Looks just like you.

679
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,876
7 away.

680
00:37:43,877 --> 00:37:46,579
That's me. 7 away.
All right, come on.

681
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,699
All right, there's 300 in.
I'm good. Let's go.

682
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,768
I'm in for 100.
I'm laying in.

683
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,419
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.

684
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,604
300 in. Do it.

685
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:58,008
All right.

686
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,742
Come on, come on.
Let me have the dice.

687
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,331
Ok. All right.
You ready?

688
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:06,766
Coming now.

689
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:13,222
6 is the number.
6 is the name.

690
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:16,092
6, ok.
Come on, baby. 6.

691
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,345
Ok, here we go.
Here we go, here we go.

692
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:20,513
Smack 'em, guys,
smack 'em.

693
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:22,348
6, baby, 6.

694
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:32,392
9. Looking for 6.

695
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,709
I'm laying 200.

696
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,995
Ok, put it down.
Here we go.

697
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:38,431
100 more is right.
100 more is right.

698
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,184
Get out of here,
will you?

699
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,503
Get him out
of here.

700
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:44,787
6 is the winner.
That's money.

701
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,956
Winner, gentlemen!
A winner!

702
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:52,077
He may be fat and ugly, but
he sure can throw them bones.

703
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,413
$200 coming out.

704
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:56,666
Come on, I got 200
coming out.

705
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,908
You want to change this
for me?

706
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,636
Come on, come on. Don't hold
me up here. Give me the dice.

707
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:17,736
Let's go.

708
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:20,473
This guy's got bad dice.

709
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,358
What?

710
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,643
What are you
talking about?

711
00:39:24,644 --> 00:39:25,644
Let's see your pockets.

712
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:27,446
Get your fucking
hands off me.

713
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:29,082
This guy's got extra
dice on him.

714
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,150
What are you, fucking crazy?
I'm out of here.

715
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,403
He's a cheat and these
other guys are with him.

716
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,037
Yeah, I'll bet he's afraid
to go to sleep at night

717
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,556
thinking somebody's
going to steal his shoes.

718
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:37,740
Shut up!

719
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,659
I got nothing in my
pockets, fellas, all right?

720
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,761
Nothing's here. Look.
See the rabbit ears?

721
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:44,147
Nothing there,
including my money.

722
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,849
If somebody's cheating
here, I want my money back.

723
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,201
This guy cheated me
once before.

724
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,019
I ain't gonna let you get
away with it this time.

725
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,204
You know what, don't you
coat it for me. All right?

726
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:54,491
I came here, I lost my
money, now I want out.

727
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,708
Ok, I'm outta here.

728
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:56,675
You ain't goin' nowhere.

729
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:57,844
Yaaah!

730
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:00,179
Hey!

731
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,747
Come on. Let's get
him out of here.

732
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:07,020
Joe Duma's the winner!

733
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,121
Who's this belong to?

734
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:10,189
Come here.

735
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,590
The retards
like the zoo.

736
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,676
All right. Break
it up. Game is over.

737
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,428
Everybody
go home.

738
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,214
- You ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.

739
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,565
What the fuck was that all about?

740
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:22,034
I don't know.
I got made going into my pocket.

741
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:23,403
Fucking Tom is still
steaming from the cooler hand.

742
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:24,670
Should have
just brushed.

743
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,388
We got us an awful lot of man here.

744
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:28,524
That damn knocker
didn't know what hit him.

745
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,693
Yeah. That's right, Teddy.
Encourage him, ok?

746
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,428
Encourage him.

747
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:35,865
This is the kind of shit that got him
tossed out of that spot in the first place.

748
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,300
Here, Fitz. Take this.

749
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,752
What the hell is the matter with you--
attacking this guy?

750
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,487
You know you're not supposed
to put your hands on anyone.

751
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:44,873
You know that! I told you:
Nice people don't act this way.

752
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:46,692
Now get in the car, Joe.

753
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:48,761
I wish you were dead
instead of ma!

754
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,346
Hey, hey.
Don't say that.

755
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,281
- I said get in the car.
- Don't say that.

756
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:54,450
- I'm going home!
- What home?!

757
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:58,321
You got no home, kid!
That place is done with you. It's over.

758
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,123
Now get in
the fucking car!

759
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,891
Fuck your mother!

760
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,977
Joe, Joe!
No good here!

761
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:08,298
I fucked yours. I fucked
yours and look what happened!

762
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,483
Huh? Look what happened
when I fucked yours!

763
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:11,684
Come on. Joe.
Calm down.

764
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:13,236
Calm down,
calm down.

765
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,472
Come on. Come on. I'll take
care of him. I'll take him home.

766
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:19,308
Calm down. Calm down.
Come on. God! God!

767
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:21,277
You ready up
those Miami guys.

768
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,995
- All right.
- I am done with this kid!

769
00:41:22,996 --> 00:41:24,630
You got it.
Get in the car.

770
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:29,836
Go home.

771
00:42:30,163 --> 00:42:31,597
How did
you get here?

772
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:33,198
JOE JR:
You take the New Haven line

773
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,334
to new Rochelle,
Mamaroneck Road,

774
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:37,436
and then you
walk four blocks

775
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:41,507
and you catch the number 35
to new Main Street

776
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:43,876
and you walk
the rest of the way.

777
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:46,629
Oh. You know, you
could have called me.

778
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,432
I would have come
and got you.

779
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,468
Back in the bunk--
that's where I live--

780
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,737
I named it that,
'cause it sounds cool.

781
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:57,239
Now everybody
names it that.

782
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:03,412
My friend Brian-- he can only
take the bus when he's with me.

783
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,381
'Cause they
all trust me there.

784
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,283
And I'm never late.

785
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:14,273
My friend Brian had reconstructive
surgery on his eyes and his lip.

786
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:16,174
He's still ugly.

787
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:27,853
You really like it where
you live, don't you?

788
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,622
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

789
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:31,523
In the morning,
in my room,

790
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:34,460
when the sun comes up
a certain way,

791
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:36,829
my face looks good.

792
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,065
Oh, I think your face
is beautiful.

793
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:41,733
All the time.

794
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:46,839
I hurt someone today.
I hit him good.

795
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,374
- He tried to hit my dad.
- I know. I know.

796
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,609
He told me
what happened,

797
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,578
and you were very
brave-- you were.

798
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,831
But I just don't think
it's a good idea

799
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:58,434
to hurt anyone,
no matter what.

800
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,935
I'd do it again.

801
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,038
I'll do it again if they
make me go to that place

802
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,539
Where no one
comes back from.

803
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,307
You know what?

804
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:08,844
Maybe the reason no one
comes back from there is

805
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:14,433
because, I don't know, 'cause
they like it so much. Right?

806
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:20,122
You know, your father
really cares about you.

807
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,623
He's just--

808
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:26,462
He just has a hard time
showing it sometimes.

809
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,797
Does he care for you?

810
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:40,509
He told me about
your wrestling medal.

811
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:46,098
Yeah. He did. He came right to
the racetrack and showed it to me.

812
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:48,651
You should-- I'm telling you,
you should have seen his face

813
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,887
When he was bragging
about you, how you won.

814
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,473
First place-- was, the
second class division?

815
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:56,459
- Middleweight.
- Middleweight.

816
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,628
That's what I meant.

817
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,496
I have
very powerful legs.

818
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,264
Yes, you do.

819
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,735
Yonkers Joe's not much
of a letter writer.

820
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:09,154
I know, and he can be
a jerk sometimes.

821
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:10,923
I know.

822
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:14,860
But it's just because--
because he's different

823
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:17,530
From a lot of people,
you know?

824
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:19,598
A lot like you.

825
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,652
Do you understand that?

826
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,571
Hmm?

827
00:45:27,607 --> 00:45:29,742
I have
a very good build.

828
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,864
Oh. Oh, you do. I'm gonna
have to contain myself.

829
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,534
I'm gonna go get you
a pillow and blanket,

830
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,470
and you are gonna stay
right here tonight.

831
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,756
Ok.

832
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:11,300
JOE JR:
Go 8! Go 8!

833
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,421
Janice, I won!

834
00:46:15,422 --> 00:46:17,657
oh...

835
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:20,375
See? You should have done
some reading about tactics.

836
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:22,128
Bet to win
and what happens?

837
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:24,113
- We won.
- Yeah. We won.

838
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,582
- I'm gonna get my money.
- All right.

839
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,634
You know where to go?

840
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,321
Hey, Joe. Joe.
Let's go.

841
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,592
Come right back.

842
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,160
Bye, sweetie.

843
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,680
He's been doing better,
don't you think?

844
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:45,467
Yeah.

845
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:48,237
Listen, thanks for
coming down, you know?

846
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,339
The kid really
likes you.

847
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,673
Sure.

848
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:54,026
No problem.

849
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:01,049
Stop worrying.
He'll be fine.

850
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,620
Oh, goody, your shadow.

851
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,755
You didn't tell me
he was gonna be here.

852
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:08,190
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

853
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:09,391
We were just
bragging about you.

854
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:11,660
This is Bam and Dino from New York,
but they live here now.

855
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:12,961
Good to meet you.

856
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:14,864
Dino, this is
my wife Janice.

857
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,799
How you doing,
Janice?

858
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,267
Good. How you doing?

859
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,736
These guys, they did some
business with Carmine in Yonkers.

860
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,155
Yeah. We were supposed to be a part
of those British junkets to London.

861
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:24,941
- Missed a hell of a score.
- Heh.

862
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,276
I know all about it;
you're top of the line.

863
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,178
We heard what
you did in Gibraltar too.

864
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,698
They actually signed
the casino over to you?

865
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:34,683
It was hardly
a casino.

866
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,170
You know, we've been around the
counters for years, you know.

867
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,456
Bam here fucks with
those snappers himself.

868
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,173
Is that right?

869
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:42,625
I can hold up
a crap.

870
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,442
I got a little
bum shot going.

871
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,211
Ooh. That'll
get the money.

872
00:47:46,212 --> 00:47:48,381
Listen, you guys
are serious about this?

873
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:52,951
They just need a few
details, Joe, that's it. Yeah.

874
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:57,506
We're not 100% convinced
about the eye in the sky.

875
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,925
Now, how are you
gonna block that,

876
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:02,377
even for a second?

877
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,830
I'm not.

878
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:07,016
<i>I want the eye</i>
<i>watching me.</i>

879
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,667
<i>I want them all</i>
<i>watching me.</i>

880
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:11,303
This way we don't have
to worry about a blow.

881
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:12,538
Watch.

882
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,475
Do it again.

883
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:22,865
Fuck!

884
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,250
Hey, I'm looking right at 'em.

885
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:27,569
I--I don't see anything.

886
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,020
That's a good switch.

887
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:30,689
- But where's the leak?
- Leak?

888
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,090
Leak?

889
00:48:32,091 --> 00:48:33,425
Every move has a leak.

890
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:34,459
You know, an angle
where you can see

891
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,428
the other dice
in your hand.

892
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:37,913
There is no other
dice in my hand.

893
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:46,555
That's impossible.

894
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,140
It's on the back
of your palm.

895
00:48:48,141 --> 00:48:51,026
Uh. Uh. I spilled.

896
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:54,863
Hi!

897
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:56,832
I'll talk
to you guys later.

898
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,567
I'll see you upstairs,
ok? Can't talk here.

899
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,703
I gotta go. I'll meet you guys
back in the club house, all right?

900
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:01,737
Joe, hold on.

901
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,072
Spilled?

902
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,691
He's just pulling your prick a little.
Hey, Joe.

903
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,509
What, they got hot horses?

904
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,678
They're all hot to Joe.

905
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,469
I won.
I was number 8.

906
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,853
Congratulations, son.

907
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,622
- JOE JR: Hi! I won.
- Joe.

908
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,491
Joe. Hey, Joe.
Hold on. Hold on.

909
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:27,496
My dad--he lost,
but I bet three...

910
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,047
Here's the works.

911
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:31,150
It's a dead
ace-deuce splitter.

912
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:34,886
- Perfect. Joe, can we--? Listen. Man!
- What?

913
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:36,772
- I couldn't get the black light gel.
- What?

914
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,774
Listen, man.
Let's be realistic.

915
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,226
We have a better shot at
moving tops on the president

916
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:42,528
Than beating a casino.

917
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:44,763
Now, listen, we can
turn these guys.

918
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:47,299
They know you're capable.
All you got to do is show them the way.

919
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,600
- All right?
- Yes.

920
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,202
- All right.
- All right. Ok. Yeah.

921
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:53,038
- All right. Let me get my kid, all right?
- Yeah.

922
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,059
I won.

923
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,727
Can I have my money?

924
00:49:59,912 --> 00:50:03,198
I--I had three bets.
I was number 8.

925
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,268
Joey. Hi. Heh.

926
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,037
Hi. Come here.
It's ok.

927
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:11,039
Come on. Come here.

928
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,475
What the hell is
the matter with you?

929
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:15,477
- I won.
- Come on! Let's go!

930
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:18,514
- I won the money.
- I know you won. A lot of people won.

931
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,432
Ok? A lot of people
win with this.

932
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,134
What are you
doing in there?

933
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:24,153
- I won!
- Ok. That's only for the owners and the jockeys.

934
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,090
You cash the tickets up there. Come on.
It'll be all right.

935
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,459
Just come on.

936
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,327
Hurry up.

937
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,528
Hey. Is he ok?

938
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:35,264
Yeah. He's ok.
Hurry up. Come on.

939
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,099
I got to put
that bet in, ok?

940
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,268
- Joe?
- Come on. This horse!

941
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,569
I got to bet it now.
Come on!

942
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,636
You want to tell me
what's going on?

943
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:43,439
- Just come on!
- Aw, jeez.

944
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,275
Come on, Janice.
I don't want to get shut out, all right?

945
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,844
I only got one play
today and this is it.

946
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,763
Ok. Fine.
Just tell me what's going on.

947
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:52,748
These two guys from
Miami, you know?

948
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,483
They're half-assed
hustlers.

949
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:58,086
They think they're with it.
They don't even know they're alive.

950
00:50:58,087 --> 00:51:00,088
Come on.

951
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:01,957
Stanley wants to put
'em through, you know?

952
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,426
Come on. Let's move
here, please.

953
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:06,227
Cut the crap, ok?
What?

954
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:09,565
All right, Joe. Look.
That's where you cash your tickets,

955
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,500
right over there.
Go over there,

956
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,770
cash your tickets. Ok?
Go ahead. And then come right back here.

957
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:20,042
Come right back
when you're finished, ok?

958
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,378
Look, Stanley wants to
turn these guys, Janice.

959
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:24,947
That's why
we're down here.

960
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,431
"Turn"? What does
that mean?

961
00:51:26,432 --> 00:51:30,185
He wants to take 'em to Las Vegas,
you know, play it on the square.

962
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:31,920
Use their money.
Take a shot with it.

963
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,889
Well, why would
you do that?

964
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,108
Well, why not? They think I'm
gonna move loaded dice to the game.

965
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:40,496
We told them up front,
"you could still lose with loads.

966
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,097
there's no guarantee."

967
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,933
Meanwhile...
I pretend to move.

968
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:48,504
We use their money.
Right? If we win, great.

969
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,906
- If we lose, it doesn't cost us nothing.
- Wait wait wait.

970
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,541
Pretend to move?
I don't get it.

971
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,942
What advantage
does that give you?

972
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:55,711
You'll be gambling
on the square.

973
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,813
Wouldn't you want
someone to give you

974
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,364
- 100 large to Gamble with?
- Yeah.

975
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,650
I mean, 'cause that's what
they're coming up with-- 100,000.

976
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,485
But it still doesn't
mean you're gonna win.

977
00:52:03,486 --> 00:52:04,786
You know,
this is ridiculous.

978
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:06,688
If these sick degenerates
didn't have to bet every horse

979
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:08,623
in the goddamn race,
I could've been down by now.

980
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:10,325
Just tell me
what's going on.

981
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:13,062
No more bets.

982
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,297
Do you believe this?

983
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,932
Huh?

984
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,934
That's 'cause everybody's
gotta bet every horse.

985
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,252
Hey, hey. Joe. Joe.
Come on.

986
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:24,372
Look, Stanley will go off with
half that bankroll in chips

987
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:26,541
if the dice
don't go our way.

988
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:27,976
We will get the money.

989
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:31,046
What happened to you do it
with your hands, not your mouth.

990
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,280
What happened to that?

991
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:35,751
You know what, Janice?
I don't like it, either.

992
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,452
But I'm tired of
the whole thing, you know,

993
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:39,421
and I'm tired of Stanley;
I'm tired of these guys.

994
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,757
And you know
something else?

995
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:45,043
- We're not qualified to take care of the kid.
- Shh!

996
00:52:45,044 --> 00:52:47,596
Can I tell you
something? Can I?

997
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,831
- Yeah.
- Just one thing.

998
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:52,634
You're full of shit.

999
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:54,603
- Did you get your money?
- Yeah.

1000
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,071
<i>$20!</i>

Come on.

1016
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,198
Welcome
to the grand plaza.

1017
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:15,884
There's no obligation
to buy.

1018
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,418
Your prints
will be at the counter.

1019
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:18,887
Honey, we'll take
our own pictures, ok?

1020
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,489
Thank you.

1021
00:54:36,088 --> 00:54:37,756
Holy shit.

1022
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:40,358
These guys must really
want to impress you, huh?

1023
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:42,528
Yeah. It's all right.

1024
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,496
Ha ha! More than
all right!

1025
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,485
Whoa.

1026
00:54:53,455 --> 00:54:55,691
Thanks for helping out
with the kid.

1027
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,226
Yeah. You mentioned
that already.

1028
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,867
Viva Las Vegas!

1029
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:07,769
Whoo!

1030
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,271
Hey, suckers!

1031
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,073
Whoo!

1032
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,436
JOE JR:
Hey, Teddy.

1033
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:27,439
Do you know they've been
together for 20 years?

1034
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,375
- Who's that, my man?
- My balls.

1035
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:34,379
Hey, that's pretty good, kid.
I gotta remember that.

1036
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:08,680
So...

1037
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:12,734
what do you think
of these egg rolls?

1038
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:16,638
Not much.

1039
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,640
What?

1040
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:19,941
There's nothing for me.

1041
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:22,310
Oh, God. Give me that.
Lookit here.

1042
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:25,847
These egg rolls.
These egg rolls has dropped from

1043
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:28,016
a $40,000 allowance
to a claimer.

1044
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,118
He should win
going away.

1045
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1046
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,456
He's also the favorite,
got the best weight,

1047
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,157
the fastest time, and
everybody's picking him.

1048
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:38,026
- That's right.
- Can't possibly win.

1049
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,361
Oh, God.

1050
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,130
You are the worst handicapper
I know, you know that?

1051
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:45,767
What do you
wear that for?

1052
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,836
- I don't know. 'Cause I like it.
- Yeah?

1053
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,504
'Cause I like you.

1054
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:52,941
- Hey, Jan.
- Yeah?

1055
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,677
Remember those monitors
at Atlantic City?

1056
00:56:57,012 --> 00:56:59,715
Yeah. Why?

1057
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,483
The camera.

1058
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,285
I could get in so close
to the shooter that

1059
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:06,120
I could actually see
the dice in their hands.

1060
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:07,722
Right?

1061
00:57:07,723 --> 00:57:09,541
I mean, but how could the camera
stay on everybody at the table

1062
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:11,443
at the same time?

1063
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:13,312
- If the person--
- Wait, wait, wait.

1064
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:16,447
Could we just talk about
something else, please?

1065
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:18,349
This is important, Janice.
Like what?

1066
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,720
Like, I don't know.
How about your son?

1067
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:23,388
Yeah.
What about him?

1068
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:27,092
Well, ok, I-- I
think it would help him

1069
00:57:27,093 --> 00:57:29,778
if he knew that you
cared about him, you know?

1070
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,214
So he could do well
at that group home.

1071
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,149
They're not gonna
let him in the group home.

1072
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,950
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Why not?</i>

1073
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:38,420
Red tape bullshit.
I don't know.

1074
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,239
I spoke to the woman
that runs the place.

1075
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,075
You know, she told me
about a spot that--

1076
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:45,444
it's like the Taj Mahal
for kids like this.

1077
00:57:45,445 --> 00:57:47,612
It's very expensive.

1078
00:57:47,613 --> 00:57:49,881
That's why we got to
make this score, Janice.

1079
00:57:49,882 --> 00:57:53,185
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't got to put him in that place.

1080
00:57:53,186 --> 00:57:57,789
Listen... has it really
been all that bad?

1081
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,458
You know, the time
he's spent with us?

1082
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:02,694
Why don't you just
let him stay awhile?

1083
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:04,946
I-- I'd help you out.
I would.

1084
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:07,282
You want to get
realistic here, Janice?

1085
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,535
Why? He's your
fuckin' son.

1086
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:15,073
I mean, he's your blood.
What's more realistic than that?

1087
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,141
You believe in God?

1088
00:58:17,142 --> 00:58:18,092
What?

1089
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:20,596
Do you believe in God?

1090
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,197
- Yeah. Why?
- Yeah. Well, so do I.

1091
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:25,833
Nancy and I were
young and healthy.

1092
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:30,005
She was pregnant.
I don't care what the doctor said.

1093
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,207
You know, I didn't
push her; she fell.

1094
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,276
'Cause we were going at
it like two stupid jerks,

1095
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,894
- like animals.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1096
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:38,413
Are you saying that that's the
reason he turned out this way?

1097
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:42,734
How could a mother take
off and leave her kid?

1098
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:44,302
How could a woman
do that?

1099
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:46,905
I don't know, but it's got
nothing to do with who he is.

1100
00:58:46,906 --> 00:58:48,690
It's payback
for what I do.

1101
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,892
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1102
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:52,477
Come on.

1103
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:55,163
I'm always figuring,
figuring it in my head.

1104
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,898
And his head
don't work.

1105
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:58,867
It's fucking perfect.

1106
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,069
His head works fine.
And if you believed that,

1107
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,204
you should have quit
a long time ago.

1108
00:59:03,205 --> 00:59:05,440
Hey. I gotta live.
Ok? I gotta eat.

1109
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,141
This is what I do.

1110
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:08,677
Nobody gets a pass
in this life, Janice.

1111
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,746
And this kid is
my fucking sentence.

1112
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:16,952
You know what?
You're a fucking asshole.

1113
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,870
You got a kid who loves you,
who needs you,

1114
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:22,023
and for whatever the fucked-up
reason, you won't let him in.

1115
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:24,025
You won't let anyone in,
and you know why?

1116
00:59:24,026 --> 00:59:26,310
Because you got
no fucking balls, man!

1117
00:59:26,311 --> 00:59:30,132
You're so fucking scared,
you can't even see.

1118
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,200
You know what?

1119
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,852
I'm out of here.
I'm going home.

1120
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:36,070
- This is stupid.
- No. That's not true, what you said.

1121
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,172
- Oh, it is true.
- That's not true!

1122
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,373
Hey!

1123
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,358
What are you looking at?
You can't see me anyway.

1124
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:42,777
It's not even
about us anymore.

1125
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:44,646
It's about your kid,

1126
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,197
who's more of a fucking
man than you are.

1127
00:59:46,198 --> 00:59:48,617
- The kid doesn't even like me.
- Oh!

1128
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,368
That is such
bullshit!

1129
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,037
You are so fucking
full of shit!

1130
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,691
You know, I may be old
and I may be ugly,

1131
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:59,844
but I am not
full of shit.

1132
00:59:59,845 --> 01:00:02,013
You want to know why
I wear this thing?

1133
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:04,232
I wear it all the fucking time.
You want to know why?

1134
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,184
Because it reminds me
of who I am.

1135
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,738
A dumb, Yonkers girl
from Lincoln High.

1136
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:13,575
I have done fucking
nothing with my life,

1137
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:15,343
but I don't bullshit...

1138
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:21,016
and I promise you...

1139
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,355
we got a chance to do
something good here...

1140
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,794
and you are fucking
blowing it.

1141
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,499
I mean, you're ask--

1142
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,670
I don't know what
you want me to do. I don't.

1143
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:58,569
You're not ugly.

1144
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:21,960
3. Craps.

1145
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:23,962
It's all right.

1146
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:36,507
5 to the point.

1147
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:01,983
Oh, jeez.

1148
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,391
What are you doing?

1149
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:14,979
What--

1150
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,131
What's this?

1151
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,833
A present for you.

1152
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:22,570
Oh, that's so sweet.

1153
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,240
I love the wrapping.

1154
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:28,326
- It's pink.
- Yeah. Ha ha!

1155
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,363
That is
definitely pink.

1156
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:33,748
"The plaza." Hmm.

1157
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:39,471
Oh, my God, it's us.

1158
01:02:39,472 --> 01:02:41,990
Ha ha ha!
Look at you.

1159
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:45,459
Oh, you look
so happy there.

1160
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,845
Look at your father.
He's got a little smile.

1161
01:02:47,846 --> 01:02:52,900
Oh, oh, I love this.
Thank you so much.

1162
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:58,689
My friend Joe.
Come here. Mwah!

1163
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,858
Mm. Oh, I'm sorry.

1164
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:03,161
Oops. Ha ha! Yeah.

1165
01:03:03,162 --> 01:03:05,430
Oh, that was
so sweet of you.

1166
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:07,549
Thank you.

1167
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,634
Ooh. Ooh. Heh heh.

1168
01:03:09,635 --> 01:03:11,937
Ok. Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

1169
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:13,004
That's enough.
That's enough.

1170
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:15,489
No, no, no, no.
Joe, Joe, Joe, stop.

1171
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,358
Hey, hey, hey,
slow down, Joe.

1172
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,595
Hey, what
are you doing?

1173
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,531
Come on, J--

1174
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,567
Joe, come on.
Stop it. No.

1175
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,536
No. Please.

1176
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,538
Please don't do this, Joe, please.

1177
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:34,910
Joe, don't do this.
Joe! Joe, get off!

1178
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,578
Stop it! No!

1179
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:41,549
Stop it! No!
Goddamn it!

1180
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,419
Get off me!

1181
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,704
Get off me! No!

1182
01:03:46,705 --> 01:03:48,639
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1183
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,775
Huh? Huh?

1184
01:03:50,776 --> 01:03:53,244
Are you crazy?

1185
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:54,996
You son of a bitch.

1186
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:58,699
- Huh?
- Get off.

1187
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,018
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1188
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:02,753
You hurt her?

1189
01:04:02,754 --> 01:04:05,723
You fucking
hurt her?

1190
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:08,509
Stop. Please.
Please get off.

1191
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,744
Leave him alone.

1192
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:16,851
He'll never change,
all right?

1193
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:18,085
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1194
01:04:18,086 --> 01:04:20,104
- Are you all right?
- I'm ok.

1195
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:22,256
Please.

1196
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:25,860
Bring him back,
please.

1197
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:28,396
Go get him.

1198
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,666
Oh...

1199
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:35,704
Oh, shit.

1200
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:49,417
Janice!

1201
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,157
Janice!

1202
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,944
Hey! Look at me.
Look at me. Huh?

1203
01:04:59,945 --> 01:05:01,845
What you did--

1204
01:05:01,846 --> 01:05:04,582
What you did
was inexcusable.

1205
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,400
You hurt somebody
who cares about you,

1206
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:08,436
who loves you very much.

1207
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,672
Janice loves you.

1208
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,607
Everybody loves you.

1209
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:15,943
<i>Just let me go home.</i>

1210
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:18,296
I'll be right again.

1211
01:05:18,297 --> 01:05:20,031
You don't have to see me.

1212
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:23,268
You don't have to write me.

1213
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:26,220
Just let me go
back to the bunk.

1214
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:28,289
Don't you think
I would if I could?

1215
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,858
I know how bad you
want to go back there,

1216
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:34,361
- But there's no going back.
- Fuck you!

1217
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:38,299
Fuck you. You turned
your back on me,

1218
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:43,504
And that's a rotten
fucking thing to do.

1219
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:44,872
Janice!

1220
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:46,874
Stop it, Joe.

1221
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:50,078
S-stop it.

1222
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,348
I shouldn't have done that.

1223
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,850
- I shouldn't have done that.
- Joe, listen to me.

1224
01:05:55,851 --> 01:06:00,722
- Listen to me.
- I don't belong here.

1225
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,826
I have three chromosomes,
and you have two.

1226
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:08,863
That's why I'm
so fucking ugly.

1227
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:11,599
Nobody's ever
gonna love me.

1228
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,952
You know
that's not true, huh?

1229
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:15,904
There's something
out there for you.

1230
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,106
We just got to find it,
that's all.

1231
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,325
I'm not gonna
turn my back on you.

1232
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:21,675
You went through
some shit now.

1233
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:23,144
Every man goes
through shit.

1234
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,746
Every man has got
problems, right,

1235
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:27,999
And you're a man,
right?

1236
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,752
I wear musk for men.

1237
01:06:31,753 --> 01:06:34,739
That's right.
Listen to me.

1238
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,658
We're gonna do this
together, ok, me and you.

1239
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:40,795
You're fine.
You're not ugly.

1240
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,498
You're ok,
but right now,

1241
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,583
you're gonna go upstairs,
and you're gonna apologize

1242
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,469
to Janice because that's
what a man does.

1243
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:53,157
Now come on.
Come on.

1244
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:57,961
What's out there?

1245
01:06:57,962 --> 01:07:00,331
There's nothing
but desert out there.

1246
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:05,336
Come on.

1247
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:11,108
There's the shuttle
to New York.

1248
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:12,943
I know.

1249
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,388
Joe has something
to tell you.

1250
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:49,914
I'm sorry.

1251
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:51,365
All right, all right.
Come on.

1252
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:54,669
Sit down.
Just sit down.

1253
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,555
Listen. He was screaming
your name out there.

1254
01:07:57,556 --> 01:08:00,308
He's-- he's sick
about it, Janice.

1255
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:04,462
I mean,
he knows he's wrong.

1256
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:09,267
Are you
still my friend?

1257
01:08:11,536 --> 01:08:13,804
Yeah.

1258
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:17,592
Yeah.
I'm your friend,

1259
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,394
And I want
to forgive you,

1260
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:24,064
But you can never, ever
do that again to anyone.

1261
01:08:24,065 --> 01:08:30,821
That is not how you show
affection to a woman.

1262
01:08:30,822 --> 01:08:33,274
- Men don't act that way.
- That's right.

1263
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,844
That's exactly it.
That's it. That's it.

1264
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:38,213
It's all right.
It's all right.

1265
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,415
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's ok.

1266
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,933
Shh. It's ok.

1267
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:46,220
It's ok. It's ok.

1268
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:50,458
Shh.

1269
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,294
I know.

1270
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:08,793
Joe, it's me.
Open up.

1271
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,514
What's up?

1272
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:14,882
Well, what's
going on here?

1273
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:16,617
Look. We got two apples
building at the table downstairs.

1274
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:17,968
We got to make
a move right now.

1275
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:19,704
I'll be down
in a minute.

1276
01:09:19,705 --> 01:09:20,938
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1277
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,323
You know you're gonna put
me in a hell of a jackpot

1278
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,958
with these guys if we
don't do this thing.

1279
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,226
You put yourself
in the jackpot, ok?

1280
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:28,613
- Listen. I came up with something.
- What?

1281
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:30,298
What, what, what?
You came up with something?

1282
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,899
- Yeah.
- Well, then tell me about it.

1283
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,500
I want to know
right now.

1284
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:36,504
- I mean--
- Uh, Joe. It's ok.

1285
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,674
It's ok.
I'd like to hear it too.

1286
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,010
Ok.

1287
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:45,647
Let's do it. Come on.
Hey, come on.

1288
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,448
- Hey.
- Hi, Stanley.

1289
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:51,819
The eye in the sky
is gonna be watching me

1290
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,222
because I'm
the shooter, right?

1291
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,474
What happens if I grab
the dice with an open hand

1292
01:09:56,475 --> 01:09:58,743
and show that I have
nothing in it?

1293
01:09:58,744 --> 01:10:00,043
Oh, come on, Joe.

1294
01:10:00,044 --> 01:10:02,029
How you gonna make a move
with nothing in your hand?

1295
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,481
You're the expert,
right?

1296
01:10:04,482 --> 01:10:06,918
When the player shoots
and the dice are in the air,

1297
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:09,119
- can you see them?
- What?

1298
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,538
Can you see the dice
in the air?

1299
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:14,391
Well, there's no reason to even
look at them when they're in the air.

1300
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:15,459
As long as they hit
the backboard,

1301
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,595
nobody touches them,
what's the matter?

1302
01:10:17,596 --> 01:10:19,597
- That's right.
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

1303
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:24,052
Are you saying that you can
switch the dice in midair?

1304
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,721
I'm gonna show you.
Joe, come here.

1305
01:10:27,722 --> 01:10:28,889
I want you
to sit over here.

1306
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,458
I want you to help me out
here with this, ok?

1307
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,226
Here. Put this
over here. Come on.

1308
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:33,310
Just sit down
over there.

1309
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:35,346
Yeah.
All right? Here.

1310
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:36,630
Listen.

1311
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,834
Ok? All right.

1312
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:42,636
Ha ha ha!

1313
01:10:42,637 --> 01:10:44,422
See, here's
what I'm gonna do.

1314
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:48,342
Here. Watch.

1315
01:10:48,343 --> 01:10:50,160
The eye in the sky
is gonna see this.

1316
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:53,181
I'm gonna pick up the dice
with an open hand, right?

1317
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,899
Now watch.

1318
01:10:59,605 --> 01:11:01,055
Good job, Joey.

1319
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,173
I don't understand.
What just happened?

1320
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:05,309
Yeah. It couldn't
be more simple.

1321
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,711
I hold on to one
of the die.

1322
01:11:07,712 --> 01:11:08,962
Do you understand?

1323
01:11:08,963 --> 01:11:11,365
I only let one go.
Stanley, come on.

1324
01:11:11,366 --> 01:11:13,450
I'm gonna whip it
really fast, right?

1325
01:11:13,451 --> 01:11:15,469
When that dice hits
your side of the table,

1326
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:17,571
All you have to do
is let go of the load.

1327
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:19,574
You don't even
have to look.

1328
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:20,875
Do it just
like Joey did.

1329
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:23,444
Just let it go.
Let it fall down.

1330
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,996
Come on.

1331
01:11:24,997 --> 01:11:26,530
Janice, you'll be
on my right side.

1332
01:11:26,531 --> 01:11:28,382
I could cling
to you afterwards.

1333
01:11:28,383 --> 01:11:30,784
Well, that's still
only one die.

1334
01:11:30,785 --> 01:11:32,854
What about
the other one?

1335
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:35,656
- You do it twice.
- You do it twice.

1336
01:11:35,657 --> 01:11:38,659
What's the matter?
You never made two moves before?

1337
01:11:40,913 --> 01:11:44,832
That's great.
It's great.

1338
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,868
- Eh, no. It won't work.
- What?

1339
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:51,772
You don't have
the black light gel.

1340
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:53,858
I got it.

1341
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:55,393
- You got it?
- That's right.

1342
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,493
I got it.
It's back home.

1343
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:59,012
We could be back
here in two days,

1344
01:11:59,013 --> 01:12:01,348
And one more thing--
Teddy remains.

1345
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:04,001
Joe, the Miami guys
are my play.

1346
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:06,069
I put it in motion,
right?

1347
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,605
What do we need
Teddy for?

1348
01:12:07,606 --> 01:12:09,740
Because the Miami
guys are green.

1349
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:11,525
That's why I need
you and Teddy

1350
01:12:11,526 --> 01:12:13,160
At the table
to guide them.

1351
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:14,895
They don't know
what they're doing.

1352
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:16,480
We got about 8
or 10 rolls

1353
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:18,316
Before the heat
comes down,

1354
01:12:18,317 --> 01:12:20,884
so every bet counts.

1355
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:23,153
I don't need to wake them
up with any bad money plays.

1356
01:12:23,154 --> 01:12:24,421
Ok. All right.

1357
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:26,289
Now, how you gonna get
the loads out of the game?

1358
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:29,410
I'll move them out.
You just get them in.

1359
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,812
Then you're clean.
You got nothing on you.

1360
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:35,232
We ain't
bullshitting nobody.

1361
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,788
All right. All right.

1362
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,223
Let me go down,
deal with them.

1363
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,350
Thanks, Travis.

1364
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,218
That's a half
a yard for you.

1365
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,020
It's a 3-4 splitter.

1366
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,923
Combine this with the ace-deuce
and knock out the 7s.

1367
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:18,041
Hey, that combo is gonna
make us a lot of low numbers.

1368
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:19,943
Uh-huh,
mostly, 4s, 5s.

1369
01:13:19,944 --> 01:13:22,613
Now, I reversed the
deuces on the weight

1370
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:23,814
So you can
identify them.

1371
01:13:23,815 --> 01:13:25,449
Now, the spots,
they go

1372
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,351
From the right
to the left

1373
01:13:27,352 --> 01:13:28,419
When the 6
is up.

1374
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,720
- Can you see that?
- I see it.

1375
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:32,590
All right. Here.
Watch this. Take a look.

1376
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,891
- Oh, damn.
- What do you think?

1377
01:13:34,892 --> 01:13:37,294
Yeah. I got to admit it.
The gel is great.

1378
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:39,029
It's the same shit
they stamp your hand with

1379
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,231
At the track in Miami.

1380
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:42,433
I got it at the raceway.
You have any problems?

1381
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:43,851
Nah, nah, nah.

1382
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:47,504
Just melted it down.
No. It's perfect.

1383
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:49,173
What?

1384
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:55,579
I can't
make the drop.

1385
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:58,249
I thought about it
for a long time.

1386
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,368
If I get made,
I'm ruined.

1387
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,636
I mean,
I blow my business,

1388
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:04,138
My license to sell,
everything.

1389
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,455
Joe,
it's a good idea.

1390
01:14:05,456 --> 01:14:06,507
No. No, no, no.

1391
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,143
It's a fucking
great idea.

1392
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,211
I just
can't do it.

1393
01:14:11,212 --> 01:14:12,346
I mean, come on.

1394
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:13,447
The only way we could
have a problem

1395
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:14,615
Is if you don't
drop the dice.

1396
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,167
I mean, I've seen you
make much harder moves

1397
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:17,868
For much less money.

1398
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:20,304
Joe, even if we get by,
this is Vegas.

1399
01:14:20,305 --> 01:14:22,139
They get wind
of my business,

1400
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,125
They're gonna know
that I'm around mechanics.

1401
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:27,228
I don't mind
lumps for trumps,

1402
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,598
But, you know, we can
wind up in the can here.

1403
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:34,217
I still think
our best bet

1404
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:36,654
Is to turn to
these Miami guys.

1405
01:14:36,655 --> 01:14:38,171
I mean, they're
raring to go.

1406
01:14:38,172 --> 01:14:40,374
They'll do anything
you say, you know?

1407
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:43,477
Why don't we just stick
to the original plan?

1408
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:46,363
That was never my plan.

1409
01:14:51,102 --> 01:14:52,470
Oh, damn it, Joe.

1410
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:54,271
I'm a hell of a lugger and
a pretty good takedown man,

1411
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:56,039
But I ain't never been
much of a mover.

1412
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,842
- You know that.
- What mover?

1413
01:14:58,843 --> 01:15:00,210
We're talking about
opening your hand

1414
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:02,780
And let the dice
drop out.

1415
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,651
Joe, you know,

1416
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:09,604
with your past, this is not
gonna be like bumpsy, you know?

1417
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,839
They're gonna throw
in a conspiracy charge,

1418
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,507
and you'll do
a dime over this.

1419
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:16,477
Is this worth 10
years of your life?

1420
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:21,164
All right.
All right.

1421
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:23,534
- I got an idea.
- What?

1422
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:26,670
Well, I think
this might work.

1423
01:15:26,671 --> 01:15:30,407
The kid.
Let him do it.

1424
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:32,709
We already
know he can.

1425
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:33,844
How's that?

1426
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:34,912
I seen him
do it.

1427
01:15:34,913 --> 01:15:35,896
It got by me.

1428
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:37,081
Plus,
anything happens,

1429
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:38,382
What are they
gonna do, huh?

1430
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:39,817
They take one
look at him.

1431
01:15:39,818 --> 01:15:41,485
They slap him on the hand.
They throw him out.

1432
01:15:41,486 --> 01:15:43,337
I could do it.
I'm good at this.

1433
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:45,789
Damn right.
It could work, Joe.

1434
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,174
Yeah, right.

1435
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,442
The skies will fall
from fucking heaven

1436
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:51,245
before I involve
my son in this.

1437
01:15:53,264 --> 01:15:54,548
Ok, Joe. All right.

1438
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:56,283
Then what do you
want to do here, huh?

1439
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:57,935
We got these guys
waiting back in Vegas

1440
01:15:57,936 --> 01:16:00,070
with
100 large cash.

1441
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:04,074
You want to see that money
go out the front door?

1442
01:16:04,075 --> 01:16:08,245
Dad, I could help you.
I could drop the dice.

1443
01:16:08,246 --> 01:16:10,698
That's not why
you're here, Joey.

1444
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,199
Oh,
Jesus Christ,

1445
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,018
What are we
gonna do here?

1446
01:16:14,019 --> 01:16:15,318
Look, Joe.

1447
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:18,939
Why don't we just turn
these Miami schmucks, huh?

1448
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,892
Otherwise, they're
gonna lose every dime

1449
01:16:21,893 --> 01:16:24,995
of the money,
every dime.

1450
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:27,314
He's right, Joe.

1451
01:16:27,315 --> 01:16:29,750
I mean, is it better that
we let the casino get it?

1452
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,989
Come on, Joey.
Let's go.

1453
01:16:54,025 --> 01:16:55,892
Well, I still
don't understand

1454
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:57,627
why you're marking dice
you're not gonna use,

1455
01:16:57,628 --> 01:16:59,696
and don't give me that bull about
them wanting to see them after

1456
01:16:59,697 --> 01:17:02,566
because I'm the one who's
supposed to get rid of them.

1457
01:17:02,567 --> 01:17:04,168
Oh, fuck.

1458
01:17:05,486 --> 01:17:07,470
You're gonna make the
move yourself, aren't you?

1459
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:10,607
- You're crazy.
- No. You're fucking crazy.

1460
01:17:10,608 --> 01:17:12,810
You can't do it,
ok, not alone.

1461
01:17:12,811 --> 01:17:14,078
I got the gel.

1462
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:16,197
I get the dice
in the game, I'm clean.

1463
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,565
You get out of there,
they got nothing.

1464
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,017
- The bad dice will still be on the table.
- So?

1465
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:21,452
So they'll find them.

1466
01:17:21,453 --> 01:17:24,221
That's right.
They can't prove it's me.

1467
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:27,274
No. It's crazy.
You know what?

1468
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,660
I'll do it.
I'll make the drop.

1469
01:17:29,661 --> 01:17:32,329
No. I can't.
I got to cling to you.

1470
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:34,882
Ok. Then I'm
not going in.

1471
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,950
I'm not. I'm not
gonna help you, ok?

1472
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:38,669
It's nuts.

1473
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:43,490
Are you telling me you want
6 more months of this

1474
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:46,160
After what happened?

1475
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,096
Especially after
what happened.

1476
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:52,999
JOE JR:
I could help you, dad.

1477
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,286
All right.

1478
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:57,838
I could help you.

1479
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,691
- What are you doing?
- I could help you.

1480
01:18:01,692 --> 01:18:04,344
What are you
doing, huh?

1481
01:18:04,345 --> 01:18:06,880
I could
drop the dice.

1482
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:10,417
I could help you.
I could drop the dice.

1483
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:13,920
I could make the move.
I could help you.

1484
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:18,942
Dad, I could
help you.

1485
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,237
All right.

1486
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:34,174
Go wait over there.
Go ahead.

1487
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,110
Joe, what
are you doing?

1488
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,612
Just wait
over there.

1489
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,764
Look. He could
drop the dice.

1490
01:18:40,765 --> 01:18:42,066
We could tell him
to wait right here

1491
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:44,051
for us
at the Vegas club.

1492
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,753
Are you fucking crazy?

1493
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:49,055
You can't pressure him,
and he won't freeze up.

1494
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,292
if anything happens,
I take the blow, not him.

1495
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:54,929
And if you do take the blow,
what happens to him?

1496
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,748
Right. You hadn't
thought of that.

1497
01:18:57,749 --> 01:18:59,516
Forget about it.
It's a bad idea.

1498
01:18:59,517 --> 01:19:00,718
Janice,
listen to me.

1499
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,452
You're gonna use
your son like this?

1500
01:19:02,453 --> 01:19:04,337
- It's not about me this time.
- Bullshit. Bullshit.

1501
01:19:04,338 --> 01:19:05,739
- It's about you.
- No. It's not about--

1502
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,975
Hey, listen to me.
It's not about me this time.

1503
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,626
It's about him.

1504
01:19:09,627 --> 01:19:11,311
I'm telling you,
he has caught

1505
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:13,763
Every bad break
a human being can catch,

1506
01:19:13,764 --> 01:19:16,200
including me for a father.

1507
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:17,601
All he wants to do
is help me,

1508
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:19,403
And I have done
nothing for him.

1509
01:19:19,404 --> 01:19:21,739
I don't buy it.

1510
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:26,226
Janice, I've been
alone all my life,

1511
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:29,429
but I'm never lonely
until I look at this kid.

1512
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:32,116
Right or wrong,

1513
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:35,369
I want to help this kid
right now.

1514
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:39,506
Please, let him feel
like he's part of something.

1515
01:19:39,507 --> 01:19:41,925
He's part of this.

1516
01:19:41,926 --> 01:19:45,195
Let him help me,
Janice.

1517
01:19:45,196 --> 01:19:48,232
He could do it.
I know it.

1518
01:19:52,253 --> 01:19:53,420
Ok.

1519
01:19:57,358 --> 01:19:58,575
Ok.

1520
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:00,777
- Ok.
- Good luck.

1521
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:05,115
Come on.

1522
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:18,345
Can I get you
something?

1523
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:21,414
- Yeah. Give me an iced coffee.
- Sure.

1524
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:28,939
Yes!

1525
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,907
10, a hard 10.

1526
01:20:32,076 --> 01:20:33,927
Mopping all the hard ways.

1527
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:39,633
- Shoots. 6.
- All right. Ok.

1528
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,751
Keep the change.

1529
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,858
7, the winner.

1530
01:20:50,228 --> 01:20:52,429
You
get them, baby.

1531
01:20:54,782 --> 01:20:57,084
Get hot. Get hot.
This is your night.

1532
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,085
Come on, man.
Let's go.

1533
01:20:59,086 --> 01:21:00,821
Roll the dice.
Roll the dice.

1534
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,023
Come on.
Come on.

1535
01:21:05,243 --> 01:21:07,911
- 8 is the point. Mark it.
- All right.

1536
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:48,902
7 out.
Line away.

1537
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:24,404
Come on, shooter.
Make some money here.

1538
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:32,846
Number 7.
Lucky 7.

1539
01:22:40,638 --> 01:22:45,292
- 8. An easy 8.
- Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1540
01:22:49,147 --> 01:22:51,197
7 out. Line away.

1541
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,436
All right. It happens.
It happens. It happens. Yeah.

1542
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:58,521
New shooter
coming out.

1543
01:22:58,522 --> 01:23:01,391
Yo, 11 and
around the world.

1544
01:23:01,392 --> 01:23:02,542
Not any craps

1545
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:05,646
And make sure those
hard ways are lucky.

1546
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:16,906
4 is the point.
Little Joe.

1547
01:23:21,879 --> 01:23:24,764
Let me have
the 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10,

1548
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:26,533
And, here, put this
on the 10.

1549
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,519
So, what do you got,
5 times off?

1550
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,172
Give me odds on 4.

1551
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,376
Let me have
the 9 too.

1552
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:39,262
All bets down.

1553
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:47,654
Hey. Hey, how you
doing today?

1554
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,056
Do you happen to
have any I.D. On you?

1555
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,457
JOE JR:
I'm good at this.

1556
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,475
I'm sorry, kid, but
if you don't have I.D.,

1557
01:23:51,476 --> 01:23:52,942
I can't have you
at the table.

1558
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:54,377
Hey, leave
the kid alone.

1559
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:57,931
Pop, come on, brother.

1560
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:01,451
All right. Let's go.
Give me the 4.

1561
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:04,454
- 6.
- Looking for a 4.

1562
01:24:07,641 --> 01:24:08,659
Hey, kid,
I'm not kidding.

1563
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,261
You got to get
out of here.

1564
01:24:11,262 --> 01:24:12,979
Come on. Now.

1565
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,239
Give me full odds on the
nickel and all the numbers.

1566
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:31,498
Probably his kid.

1567
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,316
Yeah. Need more
money, my man, more money.

1568
01:24:54,872 --> 01:24:57,391
Give me that 4, man.
Give it to me.

1569
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,094
A 5. 5.

1570
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:11,071
22!

1571
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:13,657
5 alive.

1572
01:25:15,692 --> 01:25:18,495
Pay the man.
Pay the man.

1573
01:25:18,496 --> 01:25:21,548
You watch it. You watch it.
We're still alive.

1574
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:24,784
One more time.

1575
01:25:24,785 --> 01:25:27,354
22! Give me that
number right now.

1576
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,672
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Nice.

1577
01:25:29,673 --> 01:25:32,091
Nice dice.

1578
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:50,777
Dice, come on!

1579
01:26:00,721 --> 01:26:03,423
Makes the carry over
from the 5.

1580
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,726
A 5.

1581
01:26:06,727 --> 01:26:09,362
Press it up
one more time.

1582
01:26:09,363 --> 01:26:11,348
One more time.

1583
01:26:11,349 --> 01:26:13,333
5 is a winner.

1584
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,503
Another 5.
Believe that, pal?

1585
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:30,216
Want you to hold it.
Chips coming in.

1586
01:26:30,217 --> 01:26:32,718
Watch the layout
over here.

1587
01:26:45,732 --> 01:26:48,468
Come on, boy.
22. 22!

1588
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,736
Come on, daddy.
Come on, daddy.

1589
01:26:50,737 --> 01:26:53,890
- 4 is the point.
- Yes.

1590
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:06,519
Keep doing it.
Come on. Come on.

1591
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:11,208
4. A winner.

1592
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:20,750
Now. Now.

1593
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,788
You should take
them out now.

1594
01:27:25,789 --> 01:27:27,857
Don't whisper.
It wakes up the dead.

1595
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:30,143
All right.
Hold those dice.

1596
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:32,061
Bring them in.
Bring them in.

1597
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:44,924
Sir, would you
open your hand?

1598
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:47,027
I said open your hand.

1599
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:05,461
Give him the dice.

1600
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,476
Look at table
craps 19.

1601
01:28:19,477 --> 01:28:21,210
Make sure
they're our dice.

1602
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:22,462
Thank you.

1603
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:36,376
Looks good.

1604
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:38,378
Let me check
the shooter.

1605
01:28:45,052 --> 01:28:47,654
Shooter is clean.

1606
01:28:50,774 --> 01:28:52,642
Change the dice.
Give him that.

1607
01:28:52,643 --> 01:28:53,910
They're in the middle
of a roll.

1608
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,030
What kind
of shit is this?

1609
01:28:58,031 --> 01:29:00,817
Nobody changes the
dice when I'm losing.

1610
01:29:03,587 --> 01:29:05,655
Very good point.
Very good point.

1611
01:29:05,656 --> 01:29:06,973
Hey, quit cock
blocking, will you?

1612
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,242
I'm on
a streak here.

1613
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:11,577
He's right.

1614
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:14,880
What is this,
a schoolyard game?

1615
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,055
You know what?
This is bullshit.

1616
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,890
They shouldn't switch the dice.
That's for you.

1617
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:25,858
Thank you.

1618
01:29:32,082 --> 01:29:34,367
Yeah. Take me down, too.
This is bullshit.

1619
01:29:34,368 --> 01:29:37,503
Had enough with this shit.
Take me down.

1620
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:40,090
Give me
a couple reds.

1621
01:29:42,943 --> 01:29:45,661
Excuse me, ma'am.
May I have the glass, please?

1622
01:29:48,065 --> 01:29:49,382
Oh, I'm just gonna--

1623
01:29:49,383 --> 01:29:51,985
Ma'am, you can't
take out the glass.

1624
01:29:55,806 --> 01:29:57,674
Pass the dice.
I'm out of here.

1625
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:04,381
I'll be right back, ok?

1626
01:30:04,382 --> 01:30:07,334
Ma'am, you can't
take out the glass.

1627
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,501
Um...

1628
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:16,209
can I just finish it?

1629
01:30:38,098 --> 01:30:40,015
Color me up.
I'm done.

1630
01:31:07,227 --> 01:31:08,561
That was some move
you pulled.

1631
01:31:08,562 --> 01:31:10,263
- Joe, Joe JR. Is not in there.
- What?

1632
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,498
I talked to them.

1633
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:12,832
He said
he never came in.

1634
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,401
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1635
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,636
I've been walking up and down
the strip looking for him.

1636
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,104
All right.
Stay here in case he shows.

1637
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,972
- Where are you going?
- I got to go find him.

1638
01:31:19,973 --> 01:31:21,474
What are you doing?
You can't go back in the casino.

1639
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:23,410
Where else am I gonna go?
It's the only place he knows.

1640
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,811
All right,
but don't panic.

1641
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:28,748
- I won't panic.
- All right. Joe!

1642
01:31:30,217 --> 01:31:31,618
Joe!

1643
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:47,567
Joey.

1644
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:27,289
Joe, where you going?
Come on.

1645
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,025
The bus will take me
all the way

1646
01:32:29,026 --> 01:32:31,827
to Grand Central Station
in New York City.

1647
01:32:31,828 --> 01:32:33,746
Then I get
on the number 7

1648
01:32:33,747 --> 01:32:35,164
to route 100,

1649
01:32:35,165 --> 01:32:37,651
and it takes me
all the way home.

1650
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:39,769
Come on. What are
you doing here?

1651
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:42,555
I called Miss Santini.

1652
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:45,024
You have to dial
a 1 first.

1653
01:32:45,025 --> 01:32:48,160
She said Janice
sounds very nice.

1654
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:50,513
I told her
that I was sorry

1655
01:32:50,514 --> 01:32:53,332
and I want to go
back to the bunk.

1656
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,603
You know, this greyhound must
be a three-day ride, you know?

1657
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:59,588
Two days, 10 hours,
and 50 minutes.

1658
01:33:01,491 --> 01:33:04,394
I told Miss Santini
that every man

1659
01:33:04,395 --> 01:33:07,597
has got problems,
and I'm a man,

1660
01:33:07,598 --> 01:33:10,133
and I have problems,
but my dad says

1661
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:13,002
that the group home
sounds like a nice place,

1662
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:15,505
and I believe him.

1663
01:33:17,808 --> 01:33:19,692
She said that
I could go home

1664
01:33:19,693 --> 01:33:21,510
until the group home
is ready for me,

1665
01:33:21,511 --> 01:33:26,415
and in 6 months, they're
gonna need me very much.

1666
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:29,202
Yeah. Well, I need
you very much.

1667
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:32,004
I want you to stay
with me.

1668
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,025
I want to go
to the group home

1669
01:33:36,026 --> 01:33:40,213
and get a new job
and meet new friends,

1670
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:41,898
but you can write me.

1671
01:33:41,899 --> 01:33:44,567
You can write letters
if you want to.

1672
01:33:44,568 --> 01:33:47,703
Ok, but I want you
to come home with me

1673
01:33:47,704 --> 01:33:51,374
and Janice, ok,
on the plane, all right,

1674
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,277
And then we'll
talk about it.

1675
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:07,056
I love you, dad.

1676
01:34:11,011 --> 01:34:14,280
I love you, dad.

1677
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,837
I love you very much.

1678
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:25,642
I know.

1679
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,734
Hey...

1680
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:37,653
Hey, wait a minute.
You take this money.

1681
01:34:37,654 --> 01:34:40,073
Take some money.
Need some money?

1682
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:42,192
Here. When you
get back there,

1683
01:34:42,193 --> 01:34:44,860
you call me, all right?

1684
01:34:44,861 --> 01:34:46,896
I'll be
waiting for you.

1685
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:07,099
Joe Duma the winner.

1686
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:11,103
Ha ha ha!

1687
01:35:33,093 --> 01:35:35,662
Oh...
What happened?

1688
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:39,566
Did you find him?

1689
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,935
I found him.

1690
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:44,671
Where is he?

1691
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:48,608
He went back to
the place he likes.

1692
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:51,811
You let him go?

1693
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:54,581
He let me go.

1694
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,798
You're not gonna
believe me, Janice.

1695
01:35:55,799 --> 01:35:58,651
What happened,
he called Miss Santini.

1696
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:01,120
He got on a Greyhound
bus by himself.

1697
01:36:01,121 --> 01:36:04,056
He had maps, schedules.

1698
01:36:04,057 --> 01:36:05,992
He had everything
all planned.

1699
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:08,160
You should see
how happy he was.

1700
