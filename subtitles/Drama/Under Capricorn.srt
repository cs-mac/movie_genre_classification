1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
Under the sign of Capricorn
Translation: palanca (CST) - Portuguese Portugal

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,880
In 1770 the master
Cook discovered Australia.

3
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,600
60 years later, Sydney,
capital of New South Wales,

4
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,560
... emerged over 4 million
km2 of land unknown.

5
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
The colony exported raw materials.

6
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,440
A material matter
primitive: prison.

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,280
Many convicted unjustly.

8
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,800
But settlers would
a large area.

9
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,760
In 1831 the Crown of England
had sent a governor...

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,120
... to govern the colony.

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
So begins our story.

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,720
Present arms!

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,640
As a representative of his majesty,

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,760
... the King Guillermo,

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,080
... acted fast for your interest...

16
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,920
... for the welfare...

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
... and progress of their community.

18
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,920
I know little of you e. ..

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
... you little about me.

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,440
Many do not have good
background.

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
I have the honor of
I turn to Charles Adare?

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,920
- Yes, who are you?
-Potter, Cedric Potter.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,360
I am the director of the Bank
New South Wales

24
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,280
They told us to come
with the entourage of the governor.

25
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,840
Will be grateful to the
we can for you.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
Whatever.

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,600
- Strange place for business.
- None.

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Possibly unconventional,
but act quickly.

29
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,680
No doubt.

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,920
I had customers walking in January
in June and drinking champagne.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,480
- You will see amazing changes.
- Insurance.

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,800
Give me some time before
to talk business.

33
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
See you tomorrow.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,760
-You will be in the governor's house?
- Yes

35
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,240
-It 's cousin of his excellence?
- Yes

36
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,160
An interesting relationship.

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,520
- I hope to see again.
-Tomorrow at 11?

38
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Magnificent.

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,640
Is ending.
Should I meet with him.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,840
Gentlemen, I have
more than they say.

41
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,720
Only that they appreciate
its receipt.

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,600
Viva the governor!

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,440
Viva the governor!

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,440
- Were not very effusive.
- Is the climate.

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,600
Wellington said that no matter
the shouting before the battles.

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
We do not know what to expect.

47
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
here.

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,160
WELCOME

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,760
-Have commercial experience?
- None.

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,840
I am the lowest of three
children of a noble Irish...

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,600
... of little fortune.

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,600
Should learn to shoot and ride.

53
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,440
But I am short
I hate the sight and horses.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,800
- Poor thing.
- Poor.

55
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,320
Between!

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,880
Mr. Flusky want to see.

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,800
To wait a few minutes.

58
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,960
I am the cousin of the governor.

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Flusky, is a curious name.

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Reminds something.

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,040
Who is Flusky?

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,440
One of our
prominent citizens.

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
Has great properties.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,480
Has invested
very profitable.

65
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,160
A financial genius. The best
mare of the territory is his.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,960
Works like a slave,
with hardness.

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
Where to hear that name?

68
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,280
What is the secret
to become rich?

69
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,760
Working very much, Mr. Adare.

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,440
Ask the others,
the Flusky.

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,840
How it started?

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,480
Long story.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
We are not accustomed to speak of

74
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,960
past...

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,480
... of notable citizens.

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
An ex-con.
An emancipated?

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,920
Yes, an emancipated.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Condemned him for stealing
a bank or murder?

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
Do not speak of
affairs in Sydney.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,920
The past of a man
it is something.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
Here only to the
present and future.

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,080
That does not learn
Ireland.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,920
When it stumbles in the past.

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
May submit to him?

85
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,160
- If you want to.
- I will be cautious.

86
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,520
Among Mr. Flusky!

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,640
Come here.

88
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,640
Presenting the Charles Adare.

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,960
Cousin of the governor.

90
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,040
- Came to Sydney to fortune.
-Yes?

91
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
Very pleased.

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,840
I told you that is not
fortune as fleas in a blanket.

93
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah, I said.

94
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,520
I never saw a flea.

95
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,200
Are difficult to capture?

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,040
It depends on how fast it is.

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,920
In my country the flea
are famous for their agility.

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,360
-What is your country?
- Ireland, the west of Ireland.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
Ireland.

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
-As it is called?
- Adare.

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
Maybe.
So either make a fortune.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,800
It is not the only one.

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,920
With that account to start?

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,920
With nothing to Impress
Mr Potter.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Of the Adare Killale?

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,640
My father is Lord Killale.
You know?

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,080
give me time to think...

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,880
... and help you.

109
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,560
-If you come tomorrow...
The take-.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
If you come with me
right you a few things.

111
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,800
No long thing.
Draw something from the box.

112
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,800
See us another day, Mr. Potter.

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,160
Mr. Adare...

114
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,680
... is a strange man.

115
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
It was nice.

116
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,600
I will give you a hint.

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,840
-If you invite to come to your home will not.
-why?

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,800
A gentleman of his position
must be alert.

119
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,880
Anytime.

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
Wants
repeat what you said?

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Do you not understand.

122
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,040
'If the old Flusky
calls to your home, not go. "

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,600
He said that?

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,880
-Not paying attention.
-pay attention to me.

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Bring the horse.

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Want to make money?

127
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,880
There is a part of land
which is sold in thousand pounds.

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
I want you to buy.

129
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,720
I wanted to buy
many things,

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,840
... but no money.

131
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,400
Potter you will
Short-term loan.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,720
I will buy you this land
by more than paid for it.

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,120
I want to give
of this money?

134
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
-Is it worth it.
-why?

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,160
Very simple.

136
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,040
bought all the land
the crown that allows the law.

137
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,440
-This is a particular business.
-Not bad.

138
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm still surprised.

139
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,520
that gives me
this business?

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,440
You may have my
reasons and can not.

141
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,960
This is the office of
records.

142
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
I do some things.

143
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,400
Come and submit your offer.
Gain time.

144
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,000
Here, off
as always.

145
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
I have to pastures
your new sheep.

146
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
Do not worry.

147
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,000
-And my secretary?
-He got one.

148
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
Read and write.
Says he is a gentleman.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
-What is your conviction?
Five-years.

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,840
give a look.

151
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,040
Winter!

152
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,240
Open your mouth.

153
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,560
Very thin arms.

154
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Know-how accounts?
-Yes, sir.

155
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,120
Therefore, here.
-Do you not understand.

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
It is the fool or?

157
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
-was a fraud?
-No.

158
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,800
-A confusion of skirts.
-It is not that.

159
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,920
His father did not want
in casássemoss.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,680
Enough! In my house there
this class of problems.

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
-What is your name?
-Winter.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,800
If I accept, comply.

163
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,880
I give you my word.

164
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,560
The word of the young
is not here.

165
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,560
If you do not comply,
return to prison.

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,960
-Accepted.
-Good luck.

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,600
If well, treat well.

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
But if not...

169
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,640
-See this?
-Yes.

170
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,640
Your provisional.

171
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,000
If we put your name,
will be condemned.

172
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,960
send it to me the house.

173
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,040
Workers who sent fathoms
I serve.

174
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,960
A thief of horses
and the other a murderer.

175
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,560
I do not want to be the next target.

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,840
I do not want murderers in my house.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,960
meets the ballots.
Send to collect.

178
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,440
If you say...

179
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,080
-Not like the cuatreros.
-No.

180
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,200
-Neither the murderers.
-No.

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,600
His scripture.

182
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Learly, the lady is waiting.

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
-What do you think?
-temperamental?

184
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,960
The hell of it.

185
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
Flusky!

186
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
It is a human head?

187
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,920
Reduced.

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,920
This traffic,
although it is prohibited.

189
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,720
I pay for it.
His murderer.

190
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,160
Mr. Flusky,...

191
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,280
Come to my house tomorrow.

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,880
Any driver knows where it is.
Dinner at 18:30.

193
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,240
Thank you for your kindness,
but hurry things.

194
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,520
What do you mean?

195
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
I do not want to cause you problems.

196
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,080
why not?

197
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,960
I have not had time to get situated.

198
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,280
If you need money,
I have one hundred pounds.

199
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
This option will.

200
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,280
Talk tomorrow
better the business.

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
-Mr. Adare?
-Yes.

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
His excellence sends you greetings.

203
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,000
Want to talk to you.

204
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,720
It will be a pleasure.

205
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
-Where is your excellence?
-Here, sir.

206
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,920
-Who is it?
-Charles.

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,080
Between!

208
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
and if the desire is to serve
a drink.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
Thank you.

210
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
Where were we, Max?

211
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,120
Excuse me, Charles.
-Sure.

212
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,800
-His Excellency drew his attention...
-About?

213
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,000
Not said.

214
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,360
Yes, you say that the surroundings
the port is a muck.

215
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,720
I do not like the barrels
old, car wheels,...

216
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
... rotten cabbages,
and the cats killed.

217
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,040
That take all or
Ripped out his skin.

218
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,800
The attention it devotes to
health conditions of the port...

219
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,400
... leaves much to be desired.

220
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,080
Yes, that's what
have to say. Type.

221
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,520
Name-your attention...
-Not so loud.

222
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,320
I have to speak with Mr. Adare.

223
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,480
Do not go.
The entreteve?

224
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Yes, very much.

225
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
-It was the bank?
-Yes.

226
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
What you think of your projects?

227
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
No big deal.

228
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,600
Charles, I hope
made a great effort.

229
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,120
Where's the soap?

230
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,720
I already have.

231
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,240
I was talking
with one of the magnates.

232
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,640
Will meet here.

233
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,760
Who is it?

234
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,720
-Flusky.
-You know, Banks?

235
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,040
Yes, I know.

236
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,600
-Something that you disapprove?
-No, it is very honored.

237
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,000
Only a few problems with Mr. Correct.

238
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Who is Correct?

239
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,040
The supervisor-general.
-Sure.

240
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,400
Everyone has problems with it,
but not say anything to the contrary.

241
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,960
Receive the Flusky Box
government or socially?

242
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,520
No.

243
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,360
Mr. Potter, director of the bank,
says it is an emancipated.

244
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,600
-A convicted.
-It is not.

245
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,600
Watch out, Charles.

246
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,520
Keep in mind...

247
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
... that is my cousin.

248
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,520
I hope you have not seen
talking to him.

249
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
Tomorrow I shall dine at home.

250
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,040
What Flusky done?

251
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,920
It was nice, we talk about
the land of the crown.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
I condemned it at the.

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
I have no idea.

254
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,880
I said that is
incorreto ask it here.

255
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,760
Max!

256
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,400
With the greatest respect,...

257
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,560
... Mr. Adare is right.

258
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,120
It is customary that when
completed his sentence,...

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,080
... do not talk about its history...

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,480
... if not breaking the law.

261
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
Flusky.

262
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,600
I heard it in some part.

263
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,320
The same I said.

264
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
It is equal.

265
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,600
Today
is a very rich man.

266
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Flusky, something about a woman.

267
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,960
Can not be the same.

268
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Give me those towels, Max

269
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,280
Thank you.

270
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,400
Come with me to take
some notes as I seen.

271
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,280
See you at dinner.

272
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,280
Do not go to the house subject.

273
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,280
Must be alert.

274
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,080
Could I commit
and not draw anything.

275
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,800
Absolutely nothing.

276
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,200
It is an order.

277
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,760
I hope we can
eat in kitchen.

278
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,840
No, go back to Sydney.

279
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,520
-So far?
-If you do not mind.

280
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,320
I do not like this place.

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,960
Why?
Looks nice.

282
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,200
His appearance is less.

283
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,720
There is something strange,
understand?

284
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,760
Afraid not.

285
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,800
Rights to him that I do not like.

286
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,480
I am not not a moment.

287
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,800
-What time should I come back?
At-ten.

288
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,280
Minyago Yugilla.

289
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,520
-What?
-why cry?

290
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
Charge that it
the ladies rim well.

291
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,720
So have something than talk.

292
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,360
-The ladies?
-There.

293
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
Winter, dined
with different people,...

294
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,800
... everything is in order.

295
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,320
entrusting a good wine,
the best.

296
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,880
deal with everything.
I do not understand it.

297
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,880
I ask you to you...

298
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,040
ask me, not the lady.

299
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,200
I run the house.

300
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
Pack with you.

301
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,720
What happened?

302
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,760
He said that I condemned
by abduction.

303
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,000
Certainly.
Let the fight and the store.

304
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,880
You open the door
and serve the port.

305
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,080
gives them their ballots for
provisional freedom.

306
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,880
the return to the
and send us more.

307
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,440
Me take care of them.

308
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,560
good night.

309
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,800
I have not bothered.
Seeking entry.

310
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,600
good night.

311
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,920
the grid but not touched,
so I gave back.

312
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,320
It is strange.

313
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Delighted to see you.

314
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,080
Pass the restaurant,
if not download it.

315
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,280
I see that prepare a
big party tonight.

316
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,120
-Winter.
Say, sir.

317
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,800
Lady Flusky, should realize.

318
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,680
good night.

319
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,400
good night.

320
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,560
I present to you Reverend Smiley...

321
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,480
... and to Mr. Riggs, local engineer.

322
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,320
My wife regrets very...

323
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,960
... could not come.

324
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
Is not good e. ..

325
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,760
... Ms. Riggs is with her.

326
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,440
My wife also feels.

327
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,320
Like these parties.

328
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,120
Come on, please.

329
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,640
It is a serious illness?

330
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,280
No, sir.

331
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,680
My wife is not strong,
but recovers easily.

332
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,440
Thank you, Mr. Flusky,...

333
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,800
... their gift of the font.

334
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,600
The Lord bless the donor.

335
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,760
-Like to Sydney, Mr. Adare?
-Yes, very.

336
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
In particular, the goose,
zarigüeya and wild duck.

337
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,840
With that not disregard the ants,

338
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,320
... the laurels, cockatoo,...

339
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,400
... iguanas and kangaroos.

340
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Do not mention it,
unless the life of society.

341
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
There is?
-Not much.

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,000
Beautiful city, but
with little social life.

343
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,560
I do not care, but
heavy for women.

344
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,440
-The Governor will receive a lot?
-I it is said.

345
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,280
Do not forget our names.

346
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,480
Riggs.

347
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,760
-Mrs Riggs is all a lady.
-Do not doubt it.

348
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,920
A refined woman who lives
the time here too.

349
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,280
-I would like to know.
-Good.

350
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,640
The refinement is important,
but a load.

351
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
Yes, you see.

352
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,120
No, thanks.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
My dear sir,
How are you?

354
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,640
You may not feel Wilkins.

355
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,400
A terrible headache.

356
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,800
I have left it alone but
had to know your guest.

357
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,600
There is an epidemic among
the ladies of the city.

358
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,720
It is difficult...

359
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,680
Mr. Adare, the largest Wilkins.

360
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
-The commander of the prison.
-Good to know you.

361
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,640
How is the governor
after his trip to England?

362
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,160
-His health is excellent.
Me alegro.

363
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
Do not remember me.

364
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
I was assistant when he belonged
the staff of Wellington.

365
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,160
I hope that it will
inspect the prison.

366
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,560
It is a disgrace to the colony.

367
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,720
Do not stay there or a pig.

368
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,240
-Believes in pigs?
-No word.

369
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,840
This is something Irish.

370
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,880
-Pardon, you are Irish.
-Yes.

371
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,680
-And the governor also.
-Yes.

372
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,440
A great race.
Men wonderful.

373
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,160
Great gentlemen,
brave soldiers.

374
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,480
I hope you talk to
Sir Richard's arrest.

375
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,840
It is a scandal.

376
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,800
My prime concern
the scandals.

377
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,920
Will have their sympathy.

378
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,680
Flusky, sorry.

379
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
My wife had some commitments.

380
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,680
Mr. Adare, I guess.
I am Dr. Macallister.

381
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,560
Very pleased.

382
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,280
I feel the delay, but
My wife could not come.

383
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
A last-minute compromise.

384
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,240
Do not worry, I understand it.

385
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,360
Mr. Correct, tax general.
Mr. Adare.

386
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,000
-Both taste.
-How are you?

387
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,680
I talked to his father
on one occasion.

388
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,800
Do not remember me.

389
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,360
-Milly!
-He was right?

390
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
None of these vipers.

391
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,280
-Where?
Upstairs-see.

392
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,280
-Do not let down.
-According.

393
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,480
They should start to dinner.

394
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,200
Bring up your cups,
dinner is served.

395
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,960
Can dinner, Mr. Adare.

396
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,600
follow me, gentlemen.

397
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,040
What about our patients?

398
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,680
-I hope you sleep better.
-Very well.

399
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,840
My wife presented his apologies.

400
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,120
Seems to be the focus of the evening.

401
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,360
See their names on the cards.

402
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
Do not we have to
sit as separate.

403
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,760
Come, please.

404
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,000
-Benzo the table?
-Yes.

405
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,400
Yes, please.

406
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,040
Kind Lord.

407
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,360
It makes you the thanks for
the gifts we receive.

408
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,680
Makes nourished by them
encontremo us stronger...

409
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,360
... and able to meet
with the duties worthy...

410
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,320
... of his divine will.

411
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,520
Amen

412
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,240
Highest Wilkins,
suit you forgive me.

413
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,760
I was just A. ..

414
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
Please, feel you.

415
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,480
I hope not too late to get
take a glass of wine with Argentina.

416
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,440
My wife, gentlemen.

417
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,560
Lady Henrietta Flusky.

418
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,000
Sit down.

419
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
Please, feel.

420
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,040
-I do not recall his name.
-Adare.

421
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
... forgive me

422
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,040
... for being so silly,
know us?

423
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,480
I think so, although
I was a boy then.

424
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,240
Where we saw?

425
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,120
Adare.

426
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,040
You must be the young Charles.

427
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,280
Strange coincidence.

428
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,560
Yes, I'm Charles.

429
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,440
Yes, remember it.

430
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,440
Adare was the only
that did not fit.

431
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,560
His sister took him one day.

432
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,880
And you no longer lame
my favorite horse.

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,040
Sam has never forgiven the.

434
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
I serve it with wine?

435
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,200
No, thanks.

436
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,240
Married me with Sam Flusky.

437
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,960
But that was long after.

438
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,080
How is your sister Diana?

439
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,560
Do not write that much.

440
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
You are very good. married up.

441
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,920
-With the French?
-Yes.

442
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,040
It is natural.

443
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,560
Only two people know
these things in the world.

444
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
A man and woman.

445
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,120
Nobody knows nothing of
Sam or me, except...

446
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,560
... unless...

447
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
I am not very good.

448
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,600
I can assist in your arm?

449
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,920
Excuse me, gentlemen.

450
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,080
was a pleasure to see.

451
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,440
Sam, do not you move,
follows with his guests.

452
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
This will then.

453
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,360
Sam.

454
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,440
Stay, and Mr. Adare
I are old friends.

455
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,720
Friends of truth.

456
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,880
Thanks, was very nice.

457
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
Here I am railing.

458
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,760
Solid handrail.

459
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,880
-Mr. Adare!
-What?

460
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,760
Come soon, please.

461
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,560
Go!

462
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,200
-You have a gun?
-Yes.

463
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,360
Bring, fast.

464
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,280
The bed.

465
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
Where is it?

466
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,040
Then, in bed. Do not move.

467
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
Will no longer troubled her.

468
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,760
Thanks, I have troubled you.

469
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,840
I am very grateful to you,
very nice.

470
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,800
good night.

471
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,400
-I understand that there are rats.
-Yes, the color pink.

472
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,680
Each has their tastes.

473
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
The color is less.

474
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Thus there are rats
in New South Wales

475
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,280
I was young...

476
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
... but my aunts did it.

477
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,200
When taking the tea
always said.

478
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,360
Yes?

479
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,400
Was the topic of conversation
long.

480
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,360
I am not surprised.

481
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,000
I was a lad of-court.
-Consider it fun.

482
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,120
I started with very little boy.

483
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,480
I was many years with Consity,
as outside the family.

484
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,000
Ireland take be.

485
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,920
Taught her to ride.

486
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,360
If the visa had mounted
in a horse.

487
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,600
Had a great value.

488
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,200
Jumped a fence as the other side
was the kingdom of heaven.

489
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,680
So was this girl.

490
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,520
And so is...

491
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,360
... but tonight
not the show.

492
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,960
No.

493
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,760
Never dare
you make the cut.

494
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,880
Although he was an angel.

495
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
Understand it.

496
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,200
She took the devil in the body.

497
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
And believe me too.

498
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,440
Had to arise
and arose.

499
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,160
-You bored?
-No, follow.

500
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,680
His family was determined
to punish me and punish me.

501
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Not enter into details,

502
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
... but was lucky to
escape the gallows.

503
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,600
mandrels for me here is 7 years.

504
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,360
He will say that everything is over with this,
but no.

505
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,680
Was sold as
and followed me up here.

506
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,880
-What did you do then?
-Wait.

507
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,800
Open and eyes from
I came to this land.

508
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,600
Do not delay to make a fortune.

509
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,080
Wished only for her.

510
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,960
So had suffered.

511
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Things have not went well.

512
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,080
Kept in a separate
abyss despite the years.

513
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,000
We had that talk of
although in empenhássemos.

514
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,000
As the Bible says,...

515
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,120
... a great chasm...

516
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,360
... what was there.

517
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,160
I had my work.

518
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,080
But she...

519
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
Look...

520
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,760
... I missed of the class.

521
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,640
That was what happened.

522
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,560
Never the mencionávamos.

523
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,440
But we can not stop thinking.

524
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,320
We do not care.

525
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,160
What could I do?

526
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,520
why not to send to England?

527
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,960
In England?

528
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,160
You know why I invited you tonight?

529
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,040
No, and I knew.

530
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,200
Believed that all the drafts
colony wanted to know...

531
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,720
... the governor's cousin.

532
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,680
Perhaps better than
have not been.

533
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,400
I thought it would consolation...

534
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,200
... even if met with
poor imitation of its class.

535
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,080
I want those gentlemen.

536
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,920
Gentlemen...

537
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,800
Can I buy them,
spare me money for it.

538
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,640
So I gave the one hundred pounds.

539
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,520
No, this is different.

540
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,440
I distinguish a true gentleman.

541
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,320
Tonight it went
the bad business.

542
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
No, it is different, you assure.

543
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,040
It was not her fault
that were not women.

544
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
This as the Henrietta
is due and thank you.

545
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,720
No, our agreement follows on foot.

546
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,520
I am not convinced
that agreement. Is it legal?

547
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
Absolutely.

548
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,320
Nothing prevents you from selling
their land when it.

549
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,080
-This is the letter of the law.
-And in the spirit?

550
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,960
It is not my subject.

551
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,840
Milly!

552
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,720
Let go Milly.

553
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,480
Milly is very good.

554
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,360
I do not know what would have done without it.

555
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,240
Henrietta knows the deal.

556
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,120
We have to get
this in some way.

557
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
We?

558
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,400
I know that I am not responsible, but...

559
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,880
... was a friend of my sister.

560
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,720
Appreciate it.

561
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,560
- I think I will mind.
-I believe.

562
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,360
You can that there is some hope.

563
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
Allow me to come
see it on occasion?

564
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,040
Maybe it can interest in
that bunch of new.

565
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,880
Or dresses. Women
like a lot.

566
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
We could go to Sydney.

567
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,560
If you speak to those times,
this could help.

568
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,440
You never know.

569
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,240
Yes, really appreciate it.

570
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,040
Do not forget that we are
the same people.

571
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,880
As I told you it was very friendly
on my sister.

572
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,760
Milly, why so long?

573
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,560
The other day I gave orders concrete.

574
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,480
I told you it was not the house
this man.

575
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,360
Now I know that I disobeyed.

576
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,200
Was in a meeting
with the worst of the colony.

577
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,120
It was Mr. Correct.

578
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Where will Mr. Correct
it is something.

579
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
Undoubtedly has something
to do today.

580
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,400
What do you mean?

581
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,840
What bothers me coming.

582
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,760
Have you bother?
-Yes, very.

583
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,680
Mr. Correct is my legal adviser.

584
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,560
Come to resolve
a complicated issue...

585
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,000
... and out for you.

586
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,040
Is that your signature?

587
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,320
Yes, Richard is my signature.

588
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,600
Do not call me Richard.
you would be when I talk.

589
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,160
-All right, Mr. Do not change.
me change?

590
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
bought land from the government...

591
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,960
... without a penny?

592
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,840
I know, sir.

593
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,720
On behalf of all the devils!

594
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Suppose we have this land.

595
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,520
What you do with them?

596
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,360
-Possibly create sheep.
Create-sheep!

597
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,280
Black sheep.

598
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,160
These lands are in the
the city center.

599
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,960
This exchange the picture.

600
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
will graze the sidewalks?

601
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,760
It would be shocking.

602
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,560
If msiturou with
inadequate people.

603
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,400
Correct says Mr. Flusky
demand not violate the law.

604
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,320
More worth it!

605
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
Charles...

606
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,160
... is the son of my Aunt Carrie.

607
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,000
It forgive
some foolishness.

608
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,840
But do not sujará
the governor's house.

609
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,680
If I let it break the contract
forget what happened.

610
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,520
If not, wash your hands and go.

611
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
If it was not the son of his aunt
that would authorize the sale.

612
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,760
I suppose.

613
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,200
Put the usual
and will.

614
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,480
-Where to live?
-I do not know.

615
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,960
Insurance that Mr Flusky
I welcome the Minyago Yugilla.

616
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,840
-Where?
-Minyago Yugilla.

617
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,760
A luxurious mansion.

618
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,680
The name means:
why cry?

619
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
Or why make a mountain
of a grain of sand?

620
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,440
-It is the home of Flusky.
-I.

621
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,320
Mr. Correct me
tell your friend about Flusky.

622
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,120
Grape seed that is not escaped
with Henrietta.

623
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,040
It was a boy of blocks.

624
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,960
There is something worse.

625
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,800
It is quiet, but killed his
brother in cold blood, in Dermot.

626
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,680
If they had done justice
it would have hanged.

627
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,560
The juror said
homicide by recklessness.

628
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,480
Sentenced to 7 years.

629
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,960
This is his friend
has a reputation as a belligerent.

630
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,640
Not-so?
Thus, it is.

631
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Charles does not know this country.

632
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,080
Think.

633
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,520
Re, think
in my position.

634
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,240
Has nothing to do
with its position.

635
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,040
Now reconsidered.

636
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,880
good morning.

637
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,720
you see was a puff of smoke
Irish air.

638
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,040
I am grateful
for that and other things.

639
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,760
I also I am grateful.

640
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,960
It is a pleasure gathering darkness
across the world.

641
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,680
I have said many things.

642
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,400
-It was kind to me at dinner.
-Nonsense.

643
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,400
I remember a little of everything.

644
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,840
-I was right.
-I.

645
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,120
I was completely drunk.

646
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,840
Nobody had told me
this in my life.

647
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,080
It is a shame.

648
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,280
Yes, but nobody did.

649
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,560
Not even Sam?

650
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,360
Does not understand the situation
between Sam and me.

651
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,120
Passed
many things...

652
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,520
... and most of which do not speak.

653
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,600
My weakness has become
part of it.

654
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,040
needs help.

655
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,360
It is too late.

656
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,880
Those 7 years.

657
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,960
I thought after suffering
could be happy.

658
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,360
Not so.

659
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,360
We lost.

660
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,120
-I not worth anything.
-Do not talk like that.

661
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,760
I hoped that everything changed.

662
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,600
Including myself lived the basis
the willingness and I am exhausted.

663
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
that is tormenting?

664
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,880
I ridicule
on the night of the party.

665
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,040
I do not recall whether it was dressed.

666
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,320
It was a nightmare.

667
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,240
-I was wearing?
-Yes, more or less.

668
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,640
It is the first time
I see that smile.

669
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,960
-It is very nice.
-No, you are good.

670
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,600
Obtained as M
a dog bum.

671
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,000
I got to make housing
and food and will.

672
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,680
The Irish must cause
better impression in the colony.

673
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,120
We?

674
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,560
It does not matter.

675
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,040
Has a good effect on me.

676
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,800
I always chin
of boredom...

677
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,640
... and now boiling enthusiasm.

678
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,520
We have many things to do.
Navigate the bay.

679
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,720
Mount you. Sam says
which is good horsewoman.

680
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,480
Must be a beautiful horse.

681
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,400
It is useless, I can not.

682
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,880
Learn to take home.

683
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,600
What do the ladies?

684
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,120
-Must have the food.
Milly-dealing that.

685
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,040
Must be punctual,
stay stylish.

686
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,320
Fill the morning with your clothes
or what form the love of home.

687
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,880
Charles, Milly takes care of everything.

688
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,080
I'm finished.

689
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,120
I tried everything by Sam,
but it was useless.

690
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,680
I see myself as I am.

691
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,120
-Right?
-Of course.

692
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,520
Do not look in the mirror?

693
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,920
I have, I am disposing
makes them years.

694
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,400
What to see?

695
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,280
If you see what I...

696
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,760
... will see a very beautiful woman.

697
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,720
What do you think?

698
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,480
I'll get you a mirror,
will be your conscience.

699
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,240
If you look it
every day and say...

700
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
... sister Henrietta.

701
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,080
Come on someone?

702
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,800
The mirror will,...

703
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,920
... yes, the riding itself
for departing from the shadows...

704
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,440
... and again to be
sovereign of his kingdom.

705
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,440
I felt that someone
pisava on my tomb.

706
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,640
Milly-is.
-I believe it and fall.

707
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,520
It is a wonderful woman.

708
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,080
Want to much Sam
and is good with me.

709
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,720
His appearance is normal, but
looked at me in a way...

710
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,040
... that would have scared the devil.

711
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,240
What is that funny?

712
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,200
You said things that have made him laugh.

713
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,840
it has smiled.

714
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,840
-Who is that?
-What?

715
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,800
It is the image of Lady Henrietta or not?

716
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,200
looks like it.

717
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,200
-I am proud.
-Charles.

718
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
why not?

719
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,920
A respectful tribute
its reincarnation.

720
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,640
We were very respectful.

721
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
My intention was not another.

722
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,960
why would I observe?

723
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,520
Because it is a great lady.

724
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,240
promised to be a lady
of your home.

725
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
The first work of art
that is done and beautiful.

726
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,400
-Stressed me.
-Yes, but not finished.

727
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,040
We have done more to start.

728
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,840
Now the keys.

729
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,560
are with Milly.

730
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,040
Milly, who think he is?

731
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,680
The keys must have the
the lady of the house.

732
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,760
What to go tinkle. This
give you confidence. Okay.

733
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,560
What is the first battle?
The kitchen.

734
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,440
Milly would be furious
if the kitchen.

735
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,760
It is angry.

736
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,840
You who must give
all orders.

737
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,240
Do not forget.

738
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,440
Okay, let music.

739
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,920
Who gives the orders in
Flusky's house, home of Flusky?

740
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,400
What I would do without you?

741
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,320
Must do without me,
going to the kitchen.

742
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,840
Come with me.

743
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,040
-You are a gentleman.
-Yes.

744
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,440
A gentleman must be discreet.
So do not bring to a woman.

745
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,760
Always the same song.

746
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,560
Bottles and more bottles,
has no remedy.

747
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,800
It is a liar, Susan,
not rub the saucepan.

748
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,040
Of course the esfreguei,
and pans too.

749
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Not discussed.

750
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,520
Which of you is the cook?

751
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,600
What happens to these people?

752
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,720
Speak as Parakeets and
suddenly become silent.

753
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,040
Some are ignorant,
I take care of them.

754
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,840
No, from now on
ask me anything.

755
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,920
However, many left
things to their charge.

756
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,600
Come here every morning.

757
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,840
No, you all to my room
the morning for instructions.

758
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,960
I would like to see the wardrobe of lingerie.

759
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,960
Give me the keys?

760
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,560
Are we.

761
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,880
Yes, give me the keys.

762
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,840
Will be difficult days,
but will continue.

763
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,200
It is useless, you assure.

764
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,120
Better to leave,
is finished.

765
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,640
Do not talk like that.
has interest.

766
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,160
You saw her more than me.

767
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
Do not want to talk to her?

768
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,680
Not discouraged,
is recovering.

769
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,440
Tonight does not appear.

770
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,680
Other times it locked and
well spent whole weeks.

771
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,040
Tonight is different.

772
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,520
Almost is itself
and we must do something.

773
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,320
It is pointless and not fun.

774
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,760
I do not know what happened in the kitchen,
but Milly has a fault.

775
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,320
Do not know what Milly
have to bear.

776
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,800
That would
does not speak well of her.

777
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,120
-It is not my thing.
-It is not her thing.

778
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,160
Henrietta and I will help.

779
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,960
Do what you want.

780
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,000
Henrietta!

781
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,440
Henrietta!

782
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,480
-No answer.
-I said.

783
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,400
-Not even you.
-I do not dismay.

784
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,200
Henrietta, I am climbing.

785
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:13,920
Henrietta!

786
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,480
Henrietta!

787
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,280
Henrietta.

788
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,120
I do not want to see you again.

789
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,480
get outta here

790
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,480
I could not do what I said.

791
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
Go back to Ireland and
say die.

792
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,160
Do not say that.

793
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,080
Go back to Ireland...

794
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,040
... and I leave this wonderful place.

795
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,560
-In this beautiful room.
-No I do it.

796
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,160
You have to get up.

797
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,920
What? The one important...

798
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,440
... if you are standing or head.

799
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,160
-This is better.
-It is not better.

800
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,760
Yes that is much better.

801
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,360
You are standing.
Must always stand.

802
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,520
-Do not ever leave.
-You do honor to you.

803
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,680
Yes it does, or will.

804
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,040
I have never done anything serious
but now I'm doing.

805
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,280
Have courage.

806
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,480
Courage was his birthday,
but lost.

807
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,000
Charles, I am not brave.

808
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,640
I have a disease.

809
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,480
As I can,
but it is a misunderstanding.

810
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,720
What can not it.

811
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,120
Absolutely.

812
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,400
You know what happened in the kitchen?

813
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,360
I lose all control

814
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,920
Milly is right.

815
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,200
It would be the ruin of this house
before a week.

816
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,880
I would prepare a dinner.

817
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,520
But I can not do anything.

818
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,040
Do not remember anything.

819
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,280
You have to remember.

820
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,200
Not remember the wind
that blows from the Atlantic?

821
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,440
Fill your eyes the grass
green, the people born in?

822
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,120
The grass remains on the hill.

823
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,720
Not feel the earth tremble
under the hooves of your horse?

824
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,320
Sleep and dream of it.

825
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,280
Milly the call, the
help you sleep.

826
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,280
Ride tomorrow
to the bay.

827
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,080
A sea is like another.

828
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,960
This will bring you memories.

829
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,680
It is very good to me.

830
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,160
I honor him for Ireland.

831
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,000
Between!

832
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,240
It is you.
help to lie.

833
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,160
-You have not done?
-What do you mean?

834
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,360
Insolent.

835
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,120
I can not avoid it,
I have to say it.

836
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,680
Mr. Flusky, his wife has a problem
without putting in my work.

837
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,440
I have nothing against it,
but not my goal in kitchen.

838
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,480
What to do in other
is not my account,...

839
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,560
... but should open their eyes.

840
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,440
-Pardon, did not know...
-Stay.

841
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,320
has said he owed.

842
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,600
I do not want interference.

843
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,880
-Do not hold it all.
-What is this?

844
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,760
Those who put these ideas to
should leave him.

845
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,200
Who wants to take hat
that light.

846
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,760
One moment!

847
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,400
I believe you should hear something.

848
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,400
Beginning to understand
what is here.

849
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,320
-Last night.
-Yes, last night.

850
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,360
I could say some things
about last night.

851
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,960
Might say, intriguing.

852
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,560
Speak clear.

853
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,520
You know what happened
last night with his wife.

854
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,080
The kitchen and was met
something of a calculated and brutal abruptness.

855
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,280
Last night I saw this man
in your room.

856
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,560
The camera
and she almost naked.

857
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,600
This is rude, to the rest.

858
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,320
-What you said in the kitchen?
What-if.

859
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,200
Already told Mr Flusky,
have the right to ask me.

860
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,640
You do not!

861
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,120
Who believed, is not it?

862
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,880
Pardon is not as stated.

863
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,400
I was there e. ..

864
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,080
Yes, of course it was there.

865
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,120
Came calm and played
some bottles on the table.

866
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,000
Your Lordship knows where appropriate,
to talk about sensitivity.

867
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,960
Mr. Adare, you are
a gentleman was not so.

868
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,000
Damn gentleman,
go away.

869
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,080
You too.

870
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,160
Of course you will of this house.

871
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,920
If you accept these things as I do.

872
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,160
my work

873
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,600
-Let it go.
-We can not do without it.

874
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,480
Everything will improve.

875
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,720
Not good.

876
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,720
All the gossip was
to cover their withdrawal.

877
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,880
Do you believe?

878
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,320
Absolutely.
Do not think...

879
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I do not know what to think.

880
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,480
What do you mean?

881
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,440
It is their word against that of Milly.

882
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,080
-Accept my.
-Why is a gentleman?

883
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,520
Winter also is.

884
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,880
It seems that unite all
against the upstart.

885
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
The garbage, the world's contempt.

886
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,640
Against Sam Flusky first.
The boy in court.

887
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,880
The ex-convict.

888
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,600
My wife... is a lady.

889
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,480
The ladies and gentlemen
see things your way.

890
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,360
Can that Milly and I
see differently.

891
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,440
He said I gave him hope.

892
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,160
-Did they despised?
-Not yet.

893
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,360
I listen to myself and not
this gossipy.

894
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,560
Milly here many years.

895
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,000
If you a slander of the Milly,
can give us a hand.

896
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,000
-I understood you wrong.
-So.

897
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,120
Goodbye, Mr. Flusky.

898
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,000
Prayer.

899
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,880
Pray to the Lord
open your eyes.

900
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,400
Goodbye.

901
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,800
-What do I do with the breakfast?

902
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,000
-What do you think?

903
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,880
Milly was instructed that
and the ladies of the kitchen.

904
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,760
I ask the lady Henrietta?

905
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,640
Never gets up before noon.

906
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,960
As a rule these mad?

907
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,400
-If you charge it.
I-I can.

908
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,320
Milly was where?

909
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,200
it was.
-why?

910
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,080
What do I know?

911
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,360
Can not be. Should not go.
Come back.

912
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,880
It is stubborn as a mule.

913
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,800
Sam, this is terrible.

914
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,240
There must be a reason.

915
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,200
How are you?

916
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,600
I very well, thank you.

917
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,480
The post of governor's house.

918
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,880
There is no quote or invoice.

919
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,400
It is a wonderful morning.

920
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,320
-What happened?
Milly-is gone.

921
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,240
It is a wonderful morning.

922
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,680
It is perfect.

923
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,120
What will I do without it?

924
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,960
-Mr Adare says everything.
-We will see.

925
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,760
Will speak
with them yourself.

926
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,640
Who gives the orders
this house?

927
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,520
I will send the
all to Sydney.

928
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,440
Sam,...

929
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,880
... I will.

930
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,320
Well-Henrietta.
-Will be silent!

931
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,320
So he said, is my good heart

932
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,000
who sent it.

933
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,880
It is the truth.

934
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,560
If a woman do if your heart,

935
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,760
it throws the ruin.

936
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,680
Where the guard?

937
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,600
Search genever?

938
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,040
Not to care.

939
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,480
Not enough on top.

940
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,320
The baby that arrives.

941
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,240
Not disapproved.

942
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,960
-See what I have done?
-Yes.

943
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,840
You know what?

944
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,920
As of today do not
You 'il take anyone in this house.

945
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,440
-Understand?
-Yes.

946
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,360
yes, my lady.

947
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,280
Yes, my lady.

948
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,920
If you want to stay here
may do so.

949
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,840
There are 3 things I dislike.

950
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,120
The noise, fights and robberies.

951
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,640
If any commit any
these three things...

952
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,480
... back to the prison.

953
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,360
Yes, my lady.

954
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,240
What is your name?

955
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,960
Susan, the soft.

956
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,880
that soft?

957
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,760
Why am.

958
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,640
Smooth as butter,
as they say.

959
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,440
-Call him Susan.
-Yes, my lady.

960
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,840
Who is the cook?

961
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,240
Often-I.
-It 's a liar.

962
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,080
-I am the chef, she a killer.
-Silence!

963
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,280
-Marta, knows casserole?
-No, my lady.

964
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,760
The three will make the breakfast.

965
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,600
Coffee, toast, eggs and bacon.

966
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,040
3 cafes in the morning match.

967
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,840
Each prepare a breakfast.

968
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,400
What you do best
will be the chef.

969
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,280
Yes, my lady.

970
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,160
Well, no noise, no fights.

971
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,040
To work.

972
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,840
leave me alone.
-No, I do.

973
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,400
-Charles...
-I have news.

974
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,600
On behalf of your
Governor excellence,...

975
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,360
... Flusky Mr. Sam and his wife,

976
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,040
lady Henrietta Flusky,...

977
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,960
... are invited to the prom
of the Irish...

978
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,280
... in the palace of government
on 24 January.

979
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,760
-I do not like these games.
-It is not.

980
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,200
I got the invitation in the mail.

981
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,560
Do not understand. Never in
had invited the governor.

982
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,400
Do not invite an ex-convict.

983
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,320
My cousin is always
what you want.

984
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,760
It is a family inheritance.

985
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,200
Have to go.

986
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,480
You heard what
my husband said.

987
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,520
I agree with him.

988
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,920
I want it
Henrietta. They see...

989
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,800
Could this new dance

990
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,200
French dance. Meet the waltz?

991
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,680
It is seductive and a respectable time.

992
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,120
Do not say nonsense.

993
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,560
For years already danced in Ireland.

994
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,840
-Once you know dance.
-Do both.

995
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,400
-There.
-No.

996
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,240
What I heard, no?

997
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,160
No woman in fashion
says no.

998
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,040
What would the governor
is rejecting the call?

999
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,320
You have to show them to all...

1000
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,800
... which is a real lady.

1001
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,640
I have that dress.

1002
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,560
-I find something.
-Of course it is.

1003
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,480
Fixed then.

1004
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,320
No, do not talk anymore.

1005
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,200
It is his return to society.

1006
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,520
Will the sound of trumpeter
and violins.

1007
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,040
Do not be coward.

1008
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,880
Okay.

1009
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,280
Would you, Sam?

1010
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,640
I do not dance, and much suo.

1011
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,080
Take Mr. Adare.

1012
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,480
No one can compare it
in one hundred miles around.

1013
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,400
I will be proud of you.

1014
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,320
Is the end of everything.

1015
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,080
Be... keys.

1016
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,920
guard that ask
when needed.

1017
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,840
No, I want you to have.

1018
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,720
Hanging at the waist, as Milly.

1019
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,520
So do not lose
and enjoy it.

1020
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,360
Buy a beautiful dress.

1021
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,280
Today I will go to Sydney.

1022
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,160
Monitor or better
Henrietta and I will.

1023
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,000
You are right.

1024
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,880
I only buy chairs and harness.

1025
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,760
So the shoemaker shoes.

1026
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,760
I just write my sister,

1027
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,440
or put a few lyrics?

1028
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,360
No, make on my behalf.

1029
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,280
I write.

1030
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,720
How do I start?

1031
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,160
As you said in my
letter that is 15 years...

1032
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,960
No, put: Diana, mi...

1033
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,840
... dear friend.

1034
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,760
I hope you can
call though.

1035
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,480
certain that his brother
you said something to me.

1036
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,400
From my story.

1037
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,280
But it has said,
because they do not know,...

1038
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,080
... how grateful we are.

1039
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,920
The happier we feel
with your company.

1040
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,360
I believe
because I know.

1041
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,800
Your company.

1042
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,680
I appreciate it very much...

1043
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,520
... and should feel proud of him.

1044
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,440
Your stay means...

1045
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,280
... more than I can express.

1046
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,080
Someday you will
New South Wales

1047
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,880
Then you tell it.

1048
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,440
Must not do
Governor expected.

1049
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,360
-How do I look, Sam?
-Very well.

1050
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,200
Well? The lakes are well.

1051
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,120
The twilight of
the pyramids are right.

1052
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,560
The Taj Mahal is well.

1053
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,960
Sam, you say something more original.

1054
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,840
I think that was a jewel not bad.

1055
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,280
I think so, Sam?

1056
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,640
It is a suggestion,
a necklace of rubies.

1057
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,520
With that outfit?

1058
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,440
They seem
a Christmas tree?

1059
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,360
You are right.

1060
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,200
Do not go with this dress
and I have rubies.

1061
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,040
said it was a suggestion.

1062
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,920
Be perfect.
Will make us ugly.

1063
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,720
-Goodbye, Sam.
-Walking.

1064
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,280
Very beautiful, I
to recognize.

1065
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,000
They make a cute couple,
This blood.

1066
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,760
I collect my chest.

1067
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,600
Tomorrow beginning at
home of Mr. Correct.

1068
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,400
Admitted to me today,
therefore come too late.

1069
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,240
Can I sleep in my
old room?

1070
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,120
Will get a car
my chest early.

1071
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,040
Yes

1072
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,880
It allows me to bring

1073
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,560
something hot as before?

1074
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,400
Do cold in this house tonight.

1075
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,240
Should not expose themselves to a cold.

1076
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,080
Not enough care of himself.

1077
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,840
You will, though
be distracted these days.

1078
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,600
That is well, it was wonderful.

1079
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,440
As if it had produced
something new in your life.

1080
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,080
The dance of the governor.

1081
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,960
Not just the miracles.

1082
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,800
All the talk of your town
dress and how beautiful it is.

1083
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,240
If instructed him, Mr. Adare himself.

1084
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,680
Not a minute left or
the home of the seamstress.

1085
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,480
Everyone says that you
Adare is a lady...

1086
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,640
... because it is strange that a man

1087
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,320
deals with things of women.

1088
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,200
Although it has nothing to bad.

1089
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,080
Are noble.

1090
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,880
They have our standards.

1091
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,760
They leaflet for everything.

1092
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,480
Here I am chatting.

1093
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,440
Is loneliness.

1094
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,120
It is fair that you have fun

1095
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,520
since you do not lose your head.

1096
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,040
I should not ask me about it.

1097
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,840
Not ceased to
is doubtful.

1098
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,680
It is no longer the
court that his wife.

1099
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,480
You are a man
that respect.

1100
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,320
So you respect everybody.

1101
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,080
Or almost all.

1102
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,720
But it is wonderful that
lady has ido...

1103
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,520
... in a car in the dark.

1104
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,360
Surrounded by lights and music.

1105
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,160
There is a new style of dance.

1106
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,040
Man and woman dancing
embraced by pall.

1107
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,960
Call waltz.

1108
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,840
I do not believe that the dance party.

1109
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,440
No woman
leave a decent

1110
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,600
strange embrace it
with everyone watching.

1111
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,400
Although...

1112
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,240
Mr.... Flusky, I am worried.

1113
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,400
I hope you do not
case that Mr. Adare...

1114
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,920
... were in
quarter of the lady.

1115
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,200
She had no guilt. </ p>

1116
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,680
not
was responsible for his actions at that time. </ p>

1117
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,440
was dressed in half and gave
not account for anything . </ p>

1118
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,200
Made me fear what
took to open the door. </ p>

1119
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,080
I could have mistaken me. </ p>

1120
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,840
I wish I had wrong. </ p>

1121
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,640
Sorry, is not on the list. </ p>

1122
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,560
should be an official
jurisdiction. </ p>

1123
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,480
The right to the governor. </ p>

1124
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,360
Sorry, sir.

1125
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,320
The Honorable Charles Adare
and lady...

1126
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,880
This is not my letter.

1127
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,760
must satisfy
the card itself.

1128
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,640
-Allows me?
-Yes, major.

1129
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,560
But lack of practice.

1130
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,160
Had not seen in my life.

1131
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,040
-It is a great lady.
-Here it comes.

1132
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,880
-Who is it?
A wife of Flusky.

1133
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,680
-Who?
-It is very beautiful.

1134
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,600
A large Irish lady.

1135
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,480
Who is that
delicious creature?

1136
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,920
Who refers?

1137
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,280
Who knows. Do not get
eyes from above.

1138
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,120
That, sir?
I do not know.

1139
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,040
Ask.

1140
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,960
Can you talk a moment?

1141
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,400
Yes, what happens?

1142
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,800
produced by a
embarrassment.

1143
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,720
You can see this invitation?

1144
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,000
It is intolerable.

1145
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,840
His Excellency stressed
they do not invite him.

1146
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,360
Of course I said.

1147
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,280
Where is this person?

1148
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,120
good night.

1149
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,960
-What party so beautiful!
-Do you that?

1150
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,400
Why are you here?

1151
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,360
Nothing yet.

1152
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,800
I dance a little.

1153
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,080
Was not invited.

1154
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,520
Banks, which is forgotten
I Irish.

1155
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,960
He has nothing to do.

1156
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,360
I personally
deleted his name from the list.

1157
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,280
-why?
-You know.

1158
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,200
Disobeyed my orders.

1159
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,440
Vai in bad company and
is not better than them.

1160
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,000
Devi lheenviar Ireland
is weeks.

1161
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,800
Richard, with respect to their dependents,

1162
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,640
Plenty...
gossip.

1163
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,560
As both,
but not to listen.

1164
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,840
go away.

1165
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,360
I have just arrived.

1166
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,200
If you do not leave before
of two minutes...

1167
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,120
Sir, lady Henrietta Flusky.

1168
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,160
Charming.

1169
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,600
Hatty consists.

1170
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,520
Go,...

1171
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,960
... met his father.

1172
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,400
We saw
because prior to remember.

1173
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,280
Yes we saw.

1174
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,960
But the master of his majesty

1175
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,160
give little attention...

1176
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,600
... the girls with delantalitos.

1177
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,040
I imagine with a smock.

1178
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,880
I am confused,
remember it perfectly.

1179
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,720
it has more in our horses
that in me.

1180
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,640
Mount the horse now?

1181
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,520
-My days went from amazon.
-No way.

1182
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,440
We will give a tour one day.

1183
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,360
Dinner?

1184
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,800
I love, but Mr. Adare...

1185
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,160
Lady Henrietta, I am sorry.

1186
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,480
received urgent orders.

1187
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,400
I have to obey the next.

1188
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,920
You have to monitor the house.

1189
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,280
Sir Richard, I...

1190
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,640
I received the instructions
for its excellence in person.

1191
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,560
-We gotta go.
-Charles.

1192
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,000
No, sir.

1193
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,400
The minutes are
of vital importance.

1194
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,720
-after all...
-It is important to me.

1195
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,240
spent the two minutes.

1196
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,040
-I have no remedy to obey.

1197
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,440
-We see another...

1198
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,720
There is no other in any position

1199
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,920
like mine.

1200
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,760
I would urge you to be fired
of their excellence.

1201
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,200
What should I do?

1202
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,000
What I say and dinner.

1203
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,480
Mr. Adare, if there
served in the army...

1204
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,400
... know that if they
contradictory orders,...

1205
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,320
... will meet later.

1206
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,760
Ordering him to stay.

1207
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,160
Give me the honor?

1208
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,840
Charles is the son of a
my sister, Carrie.

1209
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,280
Highest Wilkins, I'm Mrs Riggs,
Remember me?

1210
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,120
Certainly, may I?

1211
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,640
Thank you.

1212
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,480
Sam, who changed opinion.
Magnificent.

1213
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,840
allow me.
-It 's my friend.

1214
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,280
Everything went well.

1215
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,960
Be proud, it was

1216
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,160
for dinner with the governor.

1217
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,480
-Take a cup and you explain.
-Where?

1218
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,000
Dining with the governor.

1219
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,920
Would not there is
obtained a triumph.

1220
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,800
Not the damage.

1221
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:44,760
Damage it?

1222
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,200
I believe, not worth for my wife

1223
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,640
when you poke the nobility.

1224
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,080
Do not be ridiculous.

1225
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,040
Has not dressed for the prom.

1226
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,480
Put it into a compromise.
Be reasonable.

1227
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,400
I take your hands off.

1228
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,320
I do not know
nothing more from you.

1229
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,040
prior to ten years now

1230
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,440
had me all the broken bones.

1231
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,920
Great.
why not mount now?

1232
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,760
A husband likes the horses?
-Yes, of course we like.

1233
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,200
Sam.

1234
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,320
What surprised me this.

1235
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,320
Sir Richard, I present to you
to my husband.

1236
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,480
Talking of horses.
You said...

1237
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,840
I grew up in a
stable. I have heard.

1238
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,840
Sir Richard bought the Rocks to the Pride

1239
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,760
Dad died when we take the court.

1240
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,560
-Remember the Rocks Pride?
-Yes.

1241
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,640
I left him lame and Dad thought

1242
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,320
that would have to kill him.

1243
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,560
Sam the healed.

1244
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,080
It was more, brush him.

1245
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,920
Gave him to eat,

1246
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,520
... cleaned him because pesebre

1247
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,800
was a boy in court.

1248
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,680
-married with one created.
-I see.

1249
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,560
There should be between
many gentlemen.

1250
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,440
It is a party beneficiente.

1251
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,280
My money is as true
like the others.

1252
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,560
With the greetings of Sam Flusky.

1253
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,080
This pay for dinner for my wife.

1254
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,960
I imagine that his cousin
Nor have paid.

1255
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,800
We also invite.

1256
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,720
Do not have a penny
that it has given me.

1257
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,600
Here is your part.

1258
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,480
I do not know what is being proposed.

1259
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,120
But I have very good memory

1260
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,320
for this class of incidents.

1261
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,720
What drove him to do that?

1262
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,640
Insisted that outside
and damaged everything.

1263
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,560
-You are jealous.
-Don 't know what.

1264
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,400
You know which is lower
and is felt to you.

1265
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,320
Are you top of their brightness, their world.

1266
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,160
You are crazy, go back to Ireland.

1267
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,960
suffered much.

1268
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,840
I have done so much damage you...

1269
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,560
I love to...
and I marry him.

1270
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,320
By not giving him children.

1271
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,080
I was a burden for him as

1272
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,480
to repeat these in this country.

1273
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,000
How will not hate me?

1274
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,920
Their debt is liquidated.

1275
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,360
Now it should not.

1276
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,760
This is not to pay a debt.

1277
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,480
Sam is part of me and
I him forever.

1278
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,920
This makes the learning

1279
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,280
much when I was a girl.

1280
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,120
It was well and nothing could change it.

1281
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,680
Together cavalgávamos
for miles.

1282
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,560
For hours.

1283
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,320
Sam five steps backwards.

1284
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,160
In respectful silence
as a good place.

1285
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,160
I shudder to content

1286
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,960
because I knew what love was.

1287
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,440
My father does not worry

1288
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,640
tardança on our return.

1289
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,520
Sam knew it was trust.

1290
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,400
Would return unharmed.

1291
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,120
Sit on the grass.

1292
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,920
Facing the bay,
looking the ocean calm,...

1293
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,680
... deep and quiet...

1294
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,520
... as their love for me.

1295
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,200
I knew because of his love
had spoken to me of him.

1296
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,040
With soft and sweet
Irish voices.

1297
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,800
We never said anything.

1298
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,560
One day we went to Dublin
the exhibition of livestock.

1299
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,360
Sam subjects my horse
a store front.

1300
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,560
When grabbed the stirrup
so I put up...

1301
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,040
... said with his voice rough,...

1302
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,960
... 'I condemn this. "

1303
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,640
I said: 'Sam baby,...

1304
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,520
... I will save. "

1305
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,200
That night grabbed the jewels
that was prepared...

1306
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,360
... to the dance of the viceroy

1307
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,000
and ride for hours...

1308
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,800
... in the rain until druggist.

1309
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,960
We found a fisherman who

1310
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,640
led us to Scotland by the channel.

1311
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,400
A thief of horses in
sold two animals...

1312
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,200
... with those that did
the route.

1313
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,000
A pastor in the united
in marriage.

1314
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,720
I was exhausted.

1315
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,560
We take our first

1316
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,240
breakfast in an inn.

1317
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,040
Sam looked to the front of me.

1318
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,880
Was also tired.

1319
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,040
But Sam has always
something to do.

1320
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,800
Was cleaning and pressing the

1321
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,480
gun that had brought it.

1322
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,240
ria as hum
in a low voice.

1323
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,000
Then came Dermot,
my brother.

1324
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,840
It was a great rider,
its only good quality.

1325
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,680
Carrying a pistol in his hand.

1326
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,520
With the death in the eyes said...

1327
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,440
... who married them?

1328
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,320
Not enjoy it '.

1329
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,200
Pointed his gun at me.

1330
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,080
Sam stood up for a jump.
Covered me with his body.

1331
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,240
Grabbed the gun on the table

1332
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,920
and shot against my brother.

1333
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,760
Shot under the arm of Sam.

1334
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,960
There was an expression
of amazement on his face.

1335
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,880
Dermot dropped.

1336
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,760
The gun he shot to fall.

1337
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,480
They found the bullet in
March of the window.

1338
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,280
This saved the power of Sam...

1339
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,120
... as found guilty.

1340
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,360
Did not know that he is accused.

1341
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,160
I was so sick that
I am not acquainted with anything.

1342
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,040
My family will not let me talk
with anyone.

1343
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,840
They wanted to avoid the scandal.

1344
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,600
Delirei for weeks.

1345
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,360
Once I knew what he did for me.

1346
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,200
Was arrested on a ship
of prisoners,...

1347
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,080
... across the world.

1348
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,840
I wrote...

1349
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,600
... 'if something is worth what
there was among us,...

1350
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,480
... not say anything.

1351
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,360
Do for me, my love. "

1352
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,560
I. ..

1353
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,840
... could not talk after that.

1354
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,680
Had to meet him.

1355
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,440
I did what was
in my hand.

1356
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,440
Follow it up here and talk to

1357
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,280
him through the bars of prison.

1358
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,040
How you lived these years?

1359
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,760
What matters?

1360
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,280
I thought it was a consolation

1361
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,480
to know that he was here.

1362
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,240
Wanted to offer a home...

1363
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:31,080
when to leave...
to compensate for the suffering.

1364
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,160
I thought we could redo

1365
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,840
our life in this country.

1366
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,640
But...

1367
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,520
... I was surrounded by terrible things.

1368
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,600
That hut...

1369
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,120
... in the port.

1370
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,880
Full of moisture
and insect repellent.

1371
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,760
Those women drunk.

1372
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,600
Boys looking at
refuse to eat something.

1373
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,520
That misery.

1374
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,320
Once again,...

1375
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,360
Sam tried... I forget

1376
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,040
when his sentence expired.

1377
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,800
There is nothing.

1378
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,640
It was part of me.

1379
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,360
Still would
falling below...

1380
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,200
... how far could not
reach below.

1381
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,120
Where to now nothing could hurt me.

1382
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,000
No man deserves
such sacrifice.

1383
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,880
Believes that he understands
you have done?

1384
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,800
No, still have to live your life.

1385
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,640
Is inconsistent with this.

1386
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,720
When Sam came in tonight

1387
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,480
hall, paid as it could be.

1388
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,320
Not understand.

1389
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,160
Not understand.

1390
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,040
This could not do it
the governor's house.

1391
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,920
You may be alone.

1392
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,200
Out!

1393
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,680
Sam, makes a mistake.

1394
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,560
-I heard?
-Yes, I heard you!

1395
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,480
You heard what he said.

1396
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,400
Not worth the sacrifice
it has done.

1397
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:15,840
Please.

1398
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,680
Tomorrow-speak.
Non-pass another night here.

1399
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,200
-Please, Sam.
-Outside of this house!

1400
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,120
-Don 't understand.
-Out!

1401
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,800
I listen well, back tomorrow
and if you...

1402
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,000
Sam, like going back to Sydney?

1403
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,560
Re walking, whatever.

1404
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,400
vai grab your horse.

1405
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,280
Prevent it, not let him.

1406
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,680
Mount does not know if killing.

1407
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,080
Dane-up him.
-Don 't understand.

1408
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,960
What happened?

1409
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,400
Never been so.

1410
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,800
Appeared in a crazy dance.
Now again it seems.

1411
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,120
-What is it?
-You know.

1412
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,600
Your caballerete too.
This does not make me.

1413
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,000
It is a...

1414
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,440
... shameless.

1415
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,000
Go see the mare.

1416
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,920
Do not let me near.
tired out.

1417
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,760
Can not raise.
with a broken foot.

1418
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,600
Damn the time
who came to this house.

1419
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,000
Where you going?

1420
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,400
Neither I nor my mind.
Almost kill me.

1421
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,800
Kill the horse.
Do not know what it means to him.

1422
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,640
A gentleman, a bloody murderer.

1423
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,360
Not yet?

1424
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,800
lost another job?

1425
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,720
The first is the first.

1426
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,640
need someone.

1427
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,440
It's terrible suffering
by others.

1428
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,320
I refer to Mr. Adare.

1429
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,160
The had warned.

1430
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,280
Where is it?

1431
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,720
Lady Henrietta did not see
also to Mr. Adare.

1432
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,640
Wait until you see.

1433
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,360
Milly will be
despite everything?

1434
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,000
Can I see Mr. Adare?

1435
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,880
Do hours of hope.

1436
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,040
We have specific orders

1437
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,720
not between you, lady Henrietta.

1438
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,560
I knew it would something.

1439
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,480
How could I bring to
this irresponsible idiot?

1440
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,360
Do not understand.

1441
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,160
Charles, sorry, I
to comply with my duty.

1442
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,080
Here is the general tax.

1443
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,400
You must declare
on the aggression of Flusky.

1444
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,920
The suit does not make him talk.

1445
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,760
His life in danger.

1446
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,680
I do not think it protects the woman.

1447
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,520
If you die, for nothing
serve this.

1448
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,280
Be equal at all.

1449
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,160
Charles has nothing to fun.

1450
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,600
I agree.

1451
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,960
Should begin now,
lost much blood.

1452
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,200
It is important to rest.
You should go.

1453
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,680
I believed that was what
gave the orders.

1454
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,600
Where is the general tax?

1455
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,480
You are here, come,
do what we say.

1456
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,240
How are you?

1457
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,120
you ask the doctor.

1458
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,040
For my part tell you something,

1459
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,920
... Charles is to recover the
exclude from that territory.

1460
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,760
If you die, hang your husband.

1461
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,920
I will in my colony to

1462
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,600
Flusky as a wild beast.

1463
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,440
Return to the penitentiary.

1464
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,880
This is impossible.

1465
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,320
It is not impossible.

1466
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,440
Only one release emancipated

1467
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,120
remains good.

1468
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,960
was an accident.
There was no fault of anyone.

1469
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,760
Last night I learned how
was Mr. Flusky.

1470
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,640
He knows by his violence.

1471
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,560
Escaped the gallows by miracle.

1472
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,840
No, make mistakes.

1473
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,360
It is a former prison.
This is his second offense.

1474
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,200
This is not exact.

1475
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,000
You should never condemn.

1476
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,920
For all the Saints!

1477
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,840
Killed his brother.

1478
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,680
No,...

1479
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,560
... was I who killed him.

1480
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,360
it gives an account of the case?

1481
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,240
Yes, I give.

1482
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,080
Sam found guilty.

1483
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,920
Promised to never
nobody would know.

1484
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,720
Perhaps forgive me...

1485
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,600
... when you know you did.

1486
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:24,440
If this is true, I
to comply with my duty.

1487
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,160
I am an old soldier of
one religion, the duty.

1488
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,440
The general tax the
as will comply.

1489
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,920
Yes, its excellence is right.

1490
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,800
If ratify his confession
the crime, the more certain...

1491
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,920
... it has to return

1492
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,600
Ireland to be judged.

1493
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,440
It is the truth and I must say

1494
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,320
Sam and I shirk, We A. ..

1495
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,840
Rented a cart for
I bring.

1496
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,640
I no longer see the Charles.

1497
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,480
Believe they can die.

1498
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,240
If you survive, to expel
and forward to Ireland.

1499
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,960
Gives the impression that
prefer to live.

1500
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,520
I saw the governor.

1501
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,440
It was the general tax.

1502
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,160
As is known, correct?

1503
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,080
Yes, correct.

1504
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,880
No one believed
word of what he said.

1505
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,760
It was a nightmare.

1506
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,600
Will send to Ireland.

1507
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,280
They said I killed Dermot.

1508
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,200
I know, Sam.

1509
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,560
I know I have broken my oath,

1510
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,480
but had to do it.

1511
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,000
It was the only way.

1512
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,800
my god.

1513
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,680
take me with you.

1514
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,600
With which Ireland.

1515
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,480
There the linked too.

1516
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,240
It was neat
between you and the governor.

1517
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,120
The Honorable Charles
Adare leaves the house...

1518
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,040
... and the noble lady will later.

1519
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,320
What do I do?

1520
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,640
Taking care of the house while
fun in Dublin?

1521
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,920
They keep
lit the fire until...

1522
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,440
... your friend is tired of you
and return it?

1523
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,360
Is wrong.

1524
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,240
If you think so, see me.

1525
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,120
Go for what?

1526
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,560
To return to be created?

1527
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,000
Swap it for what?

1528
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,800
after that I made there,
want all the leaves.

1529
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,720
Well I will not.

1530
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,560
Shame of years that you paid for.

1531
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,480
was so silly
to tell you.

1532
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,400
Now you pay, not me.

1533
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,240
I got it done for you.
Had imprisoned him.

1534
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,120
Hang it by cheat.

1535
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,040
saw the other night.

1536
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,960
It is very serious.

1537
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,800
Go with this if you like.

1538
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,240
go.

1539
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,640
Sam does not know what to say.

1540
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,440
You are wrong.

1541
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,360
Do not take seriously.

1542
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,280
I would.

1543
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,160
is saying without thinking.

1544
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,000
Looks sick,
should drink.

1545
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,560
I did not know what was left.

1546
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,400
I taão little.

1547
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,280
-A lucky.
-Sorry.

1548
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,200
Forgive.

1549
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,040
Too hot.

1550
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,440
we have a storm.

1551
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,920
The doctor says he is better.

1552
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,800
Insect-bad...
-Yes, I am better.

1553
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,720
Leaving the next week.

1554
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,640
What do we do with you?

1555
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,520
What rights to his father
and aunt Carrie?

1556
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,440
I have to send him over there.

1557
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,800
Sure.

1558
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,480
I think we can take so

1559
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,160
I can not tolerate scandals.

1560
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,560
It is very bad.

1561
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,960
You can go back and lady Henrietta
in the same vessel.

1562
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,840
What do you mean?

1563
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,680
-Left to Ireland?
-There is no other remedy.

1564
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,600
It does not matter,
Correct and is mine.

1565
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,000
What is more
that grape seed without this?

1566
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,400
Comply with its duty,
how even more.

1567
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,200
-For more unpleasant it is.
-What to say?

1568
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,120
What will do with it?

1569
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,000
confessed the crime by
which condemned the Flusky.

1570
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,920
According to her killed her
brother Dermot.

1571
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,840
Confessed.

1572
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,640
I missed that you have made.

1573
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,000
feeling well?

1574
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,400
asks the doctor.

1575
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,280
returned to their old habits.

1576
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,000
I will dispense.
I am glad you are better.

1577
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,520
Good night, Doctor.

1578
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,880
The doctor is gone.

1579
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,800
Then leave the dinner.

1580
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,720
What say?

1581
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,640
Can I sit?

1582
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,800
I could not believe the
bad as it is.

1583
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,240
Some said they see strange things.

1584
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,640
As horrible as before.

1585
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,080
You know, delira.

1586
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,880
Recipes you more
somniferous of the strong.

1587
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,800
5 drops every 4 hours.

1588
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,720
Said that more

1589
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,800
I had no more to ask when

1590
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,560
be able to travel.

1591
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,400
-He said that?
-Very little. Not responding.

1592
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,280
Knows more than he says.

1593
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,440
You are always with the governor.

1594
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,120
Adare said it is better.

1595
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,000
Get me a weight from above.

1596
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,080
The Lord follows mysterious ways

1597
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,720
for his miracles.

1598
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,560
All ends well.

1599
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,320
When you went,
you will live in peace.

1600
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,480
I never had peace.

1601
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,000
I will with it.

1602
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,320
Will?

1603
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,760
We need the state
where you are.

1604
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,520
But the house,
which will make it?

1605
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,440
Sell everything.

1606
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,360
Sank forever.

1607
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,280
Here is someone you,
there is not anyone.

1608
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,080
I know all this.
I do not care.

1609
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,000
She has friends there.

1610
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,920
Will do that by
daughter of an earl.

1611
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,080
Leave it to the noble and

1612
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,760
with Adare. She will feel good.

1613
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,640
Should not go, Mr. Flusky.

1614
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,480
Do not go.

1615
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,240
Stay with me, take care of you.

1616
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:12,080
Work you to death.
Do not go.

1617
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,960
In taking a decision...

1618
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,840
... never go back.

1619
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,280
Milly!

1620
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,720
Milly!

1621
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:20,200
I will.

1622
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,640
May not rise, Mr. Flusky.

1623
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,320
Is not likely that

1624
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,520
see. Close the windows.

1625
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,320
Instructed me to look after it,
leave me.

1626
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,160
Do what I said.

1627
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,080
Hatty.

1628
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,120
Hatty.

1629
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,920
Hatty.

1630
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,760
Sam, come on.

1631
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,640
away from me, I tell you.

1632
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,480
Does that go.

1633
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,400
Please make it go.

1634
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,200
Then in bed.

1635
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,120
Where is there.

1636
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,560
Always the same, looking at me.

1637
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,000
Nothing.

1638
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,920
be calm.

1639
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,840
You have to kill you, Sam.

1640
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,640
Not to see?

1641
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,080
Charles saw her.

1642
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,520
Shot and the mouse was gone.

1643
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,440
Nothing.
I told him to please him.

1644
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,360
They are visions.

1645
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,280
Nothing, assure you that.

1646
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,760
See.

1647
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,920
You can see it yourself.

1648
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,800
Nothing.

1649
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,600
Was dreaming.

1650
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,440
The wind...

1651
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,320
moved and the lights...
moved up the shadows.

1652
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,200
Do not see what you doing?

1653
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,080
Must be strong.

1654
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,920
If you continue,
be crazy.

1655
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,640
Come on, lady Henrietta.

1656
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,520
Not discouraged.

1657
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,440
I brought you something to drink.

1658
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,240
Logo throws and sleeps.

1659
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,160
Drink up.

1660
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,920
Sam!

1661
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,800
Calm down, you will awaken
the whole house.

1662
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,240
Flusky not want to see that.

1663
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,680
-Sam!
-Shut up!

1664
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,000
-Sam!
-What is the scandal?

1665
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,520
-Sam!
-Do you not see how you behave?

1666
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,960
It has nothing to fear.

1667
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,400
-What happens?
-Shut up.

1668
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,240
-Want to kill me.
-What are you saying?

1669
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,680
Do not know what it says.

1670
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,080
tried to give me the drug
this whole cup.

1671
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,000
-I.
-Look what you have done.

1672
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,880
Look in the basket.

1673
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,320
It was this that plot.

1674
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,240
Work for me until death.

1675
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,160
Okay, even death.

1676
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,920
You drove me to do so.

1677
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,840
How would let go?

1678
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,680
If you believe that it would leave
that is sacrificed...

1679
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,520
I know how are these aristocrats.

1680
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,440
Do not understand.

1681
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,360
-Hatty not believe that...
-Of course not.

1682
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,280
why did it?
Believed to my friend.

1683
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:03,720
I am not your friend.

1684
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,160
Sink to you and
was falling to yourself.

1685
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,080
It easier to drink.

1686
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,920
Do not understand.

1687
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,840
You are in love with my husband?

1688
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,680
Do not say that.

1689
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,560
The Lord does not forgive
by saying something.

1690
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,440
All this time...

1691
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,360
... trying to kill me.

1692
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,280
Treated to kill you.

1693
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,200
When I felt hopeless...

1694
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,040
... I brought you a drink.
Each night more.

1695
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,320
-You asked.
-Yes, ask her.

1696
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,760
I wanted to convert
as I convert...

1697
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,680
... to my husband that I hated.

1698
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,600
Today we wanted to finish once.

1699
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,480
Do not mind.
You are crazy.

1700
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,360
It is the drink.

1701
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,640
The doctor said
would therefore be the end.

1702
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,160
The Lord punished him.

1703
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,080
Simply, viper.

1704
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,000
I saw that this was done.

1705
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,840
I know it, Sam.

1706
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,280
I know...

1707
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,960
... that kind of love drives

1708
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,640
to do terrible things.

1709
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,520
I do not understand that kind of love.

1710
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,680
When you and I talk about

1711
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,360
love do differently.

1712
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,280
You know.

1713
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,080
In spite of that we
happened, you know.

1714
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,000
that wanted to kill me?

1715
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:17,400
Believes that love a killer?

1716
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,840
With a married.

1717
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:22,640
No, Mr. Flusky am not enough
for you. I know.

1718
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:27,440
Only serve to work
as employed.

1719
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,320
-Take care of this drunk.
-Shut up!

1720
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,600
Sam, let it
will not hurt us.

1721
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,200
-Let me your covers?
-No.

1722
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,720
It is a little late.

1723
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,960
Yes, believed it would be better
come the night.

1724
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,240
The governor wants to avoid

1725
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,440
the scandal if possible.

1726
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:12,880
What do you want?

1727
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,680
Take-statement.
-Come to my office.

1728
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,160
No, you give legal form
below.

1729
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,280
Know without doubt that his wife is

1730
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,960
confessed to having killed his brother.

1731
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,680
We need
confirm the statement.

1732
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,560
This will shorten the procedure.

1733
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,480
Avoid delays.

1734
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,320
And can be excused.

1735
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,240
I help them to
Hang my wife.

1736
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,120
Hurry to save them work.

1737
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,560
Do not dare to
say that.

1738
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,240
In short, can not

1739
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,920
you do anything without my explanation.

1740
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,760
In a sense, it is.

1741
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,200
The law differently.

1742
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,640
Leave this house now.

1743
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,480
Okay.

1744
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,280
I must notify you that it delivered
mittimus...

1745
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,600
... against you by intent
the murder of Charles Adare.

1746
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,360
If you persist in your attitude, if

1747
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,040
give way to that commandment.

1748
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,480
It was an accident.

1749
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,280
I must remind you that
an ex-convict...

1750
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,840
... and we are in
New South Wales

1751
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,680
It is his second offense.
You know what?

1752
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,560
Yes, I know.

1753
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,480
committed an act of violence.

1754
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,360
You can not hang more.

1755
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,280
Do not believe that.

1756
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,320
We will not do so, return to activities

1757
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,080
I was familiar with.

1758
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,920
Is it easy to get used to
to work again...

1759
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,840
... in jail for inmates.

1760
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,120
I shot against Adare.
What he said?

1761
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:35,640
It was an accident.

1762
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,560
I explained him the situation.

1763
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,480
I was generous with you.

1764
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,160
Offered him the opportunity to not

1765
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,360
be a real ex-convict.

1766
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:45,600
It would be a huge difference.

1767
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,040
I will give you time to
tomorrow to reflect.

1768
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,920
What happens, Sam?

1769
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,800
-What?
-Correct and his assistant.

1770
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,160
What do you want?

1771
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,680
Nothing.

1772
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,600
I do not humor
listen to them.

1773
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,480
-told them walk.
-You can not do anything.

1774
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,400
confessed.

1775
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:07,240
-Yes, confessed.
-What you want?

1776
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,160
I declare.

1777
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,840
Was prepared to
risking his life for me.

1778
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,640
-What else could we do?
-Sacrifice.

1779
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,560
Sacrifice.

1780
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:27,320
Are we sacrificing
always the one by the other.

1781
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,240
This must have an end.

1782
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,040
The law says that there was a death.

1783
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,880
Have you paid for it.

1784
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,720
that following the chase?

1785
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,400
Not dare to touch him.

1786
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,600
Nobody can do you harm.

1787
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,520
I saved you.

1788
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,440
Always be together.

1789
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:49,920
Do not say anything.

1790
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:54,120
Tomorrow we talk about this.

1791
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,840
-Sam.
-No more talk tonight.

1792
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,280
Platoon, turn around.

1793
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,040
Ready to mount, assemble.

1794
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,920
Above you,
Look behind you.

1795
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,840
The head high, not
won us yet.

1796
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,760
Ready? That between now.

1797
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,680
Winter, ask the car.

1798
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,520
I go to Sydney.

1799
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,160
What is talk that way?

1800
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,480
Are you treated as a

1801
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,400
ex-convict and are not entitled.

1802
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:43,880
Mr. Correct gave
an opportunity.

1803
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,800
You just have to say a word.

1804
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,640
I talked to him this morning,
never say that.

1805
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,960
be where you are.

1806
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,480
Sir Richard, I'm desperate.

1807
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,360
What you do?

1808
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,000
confessed that killed the Dermot

1809
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,200
to show that never...

1810
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,080
... should you order.

1811
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,960
He said as such as
Mr. Adare injured.

1812
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,880
Do not count it?

1813
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,120
Mr. Adare is hurt.
We will give your version.

1814
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,640
It is not necessary at this time.

1815
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,480
Listened to those created
discussion and shot.

1816
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,400
I saw her husband a
hours before all this.

1817
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,320
Was capable of something.

1818
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,840
This is intolerable.

1819
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,560
What is here, for
what is raised?

1820
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:25,040
-Hatty, told me that he had been.
-Charles.

1821
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,920
And that is sick.

1822
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,840
What is this a confession?

1823
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:32,680
I am not sick.
How are you?

1824
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:34,600
that come from?

1825
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,520
imprisoned for Sam again.

1826
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,640
Do not understand.
What happened?

1827
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,280
Is quieting their
nerves in prison.

1828
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,200
Should be the last
to regret it.

1829
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,120
You helped me.

1830
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,000
more than anyone knows.

1831
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,840
help me now.

1832
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,720
What to leave Sam in freedom.

1833
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,640
tell them what happened.

1834
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,560
Have to leave you free.

1835
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,160
return it to me Charles.

1836
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,480
They say they tried to kill him.

1837
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,040
they explain it was an accident.

1838
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,960
Best is between 4 walls.

1839
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,760
Best to you, to
me and lady Henrietta.

1840
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,600
-The murderer.
-No, Sir Richard.

1841
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,280
Mr. Adare-know...

1842
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,480
Lady Henrietta, you know what happened.

1843
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:22,920
I know what happened.

1844
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,360
Have something to say?

1845
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,240
If so, say it and
just go to the order.

1846
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,080
Accompanied the lady Henrietta

1847
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,760
your house after the dance.

1848
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:40,600
Flusky came to little time.

1849
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,440
I was furious.

1850
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,360
You know, Richard, you saw.

1851
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,000
No matter the reasons,

1852
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,200
but I played for his home.

1853
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,160
Grabbed his horse to return.

1854
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,920
It was very dark.

1855
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,560
In a shock to some high

1856
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,760
that had not seen...

1857
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,680
... and just in a gutter.

1858
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,360
I was hurt and

1859
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,520
horse broke a leg.

1860
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,600
I came back and told Flusky.

1861
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,200
was seeking a gun.

1862
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,080
Went out and killed the animal.

1863
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:17,920
When I returned...

1864
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,840
... wanted to grab the gun.

1865
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,720
Was double barrel.
I did it meanly e. ..

1866
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,640
... received a shot in the shoulder.
That is all.

1867
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,080
Lady Henrietta said
that discussed.

1868
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,520
This was said?

1869
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,960
Flusky was not very happy by

1870
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:31,320
have lost their favorite horse.

1871
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,240
Do not remember discussing.

1872
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:36,120
I warn you I do not believe it.

1873
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,040
This will be my statement.

1874
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,840
Give me your word of
honor, as gentleman,...

1875
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,760
... that was all that happened?

1876
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,640
Word of honor.

1877
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,560
Correct, you leave in freedom.

1878
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,000
But excellence...

1879
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,440
... is not so easy.

1880
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,360
-Not yet started.
-Do what you say.

1881
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:01,000
Lady Henrietta, I
which could for you.

1882
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,880
Have the goodness to leave.

1883
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,720
I have no time to
talk ladies.

1884
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,560
I mind me, sir,

1885
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,440
... and I am very grateful.

1886
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:20,600
Goodbye, Sam.

1887
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,000
Mr. Adare, is very
what you need.

1888
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:24,720
Goodbye, for now.

1889
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,080
Be the first immigrant to

1890
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:28,760
returns to the homeland without fortune.

1891
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,640
Be the fool of Dublin.

1892
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,520
-Bye, Hatty.
-Bye, Charles.

1893
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,160
I forget.

1894
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,280
I can never forget it.

1895
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:49,800
-Sorry to go.
-I do feel that.

1896
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,680
This place is not bad.
There is a great future.

1897
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,080
It is a great country.

1898
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,480
-that part?
-So.

1899
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,400
Is not large enough.

1900
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,280
Goodbye and good luck.
