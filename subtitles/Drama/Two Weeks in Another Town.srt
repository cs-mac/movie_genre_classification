1
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,467
Mr. Andrus, I have
something for you.

2
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,719
Cablegram, Mr. Andrus.

3
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,500
Thank you.

4
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,350
Want a sleeping pill?

5
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:56,782
I suppose.

6
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,617
1 1/2 grain or 3 grain?

7
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:11,302
Tina, who's on duty tonight?

8
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,171
Dr. "Coldeyes."

9
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:19,812
You going to see him?

10
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,810
No, Tina, I'm going
out by the lilacs

11
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,542
to play shuffleboard
with myself.

12
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:25,547
Well, you don't have
to be so darn rude.

13
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,879
"...laterally.

14
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:29,354
"Multiple fractures
of the nasal bones,

15
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,522
"compound fracture
of the right mandible.

16
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,552
Manic depressive..."

17
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,516
Psychosis, compulsive violence,

18
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:39,255
delusional episodes,
alcoholism, acute and chronic.

19
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,392
Well, you're in a good mood.

20
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,298
Am I?

21
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,430
No.

22
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:47,404
But you're covering well.

23
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,574
What's bothering you?

24
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:52,743
The cable that you
received this morning?

25
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,913
So, you finally opened it?

26
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:57,282
You don't miss much
around here, do you?

27
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,650
What did it say?

28
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,420
Guess you can't afford
to miss much, can you?

29
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,021
Oh, from Rome.

30
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:09,994
"Everybody is here.
Why aren't you?

31
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,593
"And why do I waste my time
looking for an actor

32
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:16,356
"to play 4 great scenes
which you, repeat, you,

33
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:19,266
"could steal with
your eyes shut. Stop.

34
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,169
"Besides, I miss you. Stop.
It's been too long. Stop.

35
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,612
"Have rich part for you. Stop.

36
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,238
"$5,000 for 2 weeks' work. Stop.

37
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:28,584
"Jet to Rome pronto.

38
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:32,949
Don't just stand there.
Get going. Kruger."

39
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
How many pictures did
you two make together?

40
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:35,975
7.

41
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,346
And when was the last?

42
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:38,994
About 6 years ago.

43
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,149
Well, what ended it?

44
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:41,447
Hate.

45
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,558
Well, that's a long association

46
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:46,131
to be based on hate.

47
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:51,062
And love.

48
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:54,428
Mixed together with
lots of ice and an onion.

49
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:55,797
The Kruger way.

50
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,643
First word in 6 years.

51
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:05,706
I've been sick, crazy...

52
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:09,446
Perhaps you feel it's an act
of kindness on his part,

53
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,752
and you resent it.

54
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:17,063
Tell me, from what you
know of Mr. Kruger...

55
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,430
Would you say
he was the kind of man

56
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,259
given to acts of kindness?

57
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,330
Kruger?

58
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:28,595
He wouldn't give you the...

59
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,466
You don't believe
that pitch, do you?

60
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:32,473
Doesn't matter
whether I believe it.

61
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,705
Do you believe it?

62
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,282
Are you ready to go?

63
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:41,923
You tell me.

64
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,779
We believe that you've been well

65
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,617
for the last 3 months.

66
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,286
Why are you keeping it
such a secret?

67
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,856
There's a difference
between being well

68
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:57,555
and being ready to go out.

69
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,667
Now, in our opinion,
you are ready.

70
00:07:01,702 --> 00:07:03,272
What makes you so sure?

71
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:06,643
I didn't say I was sure.
I said it was our opinion.

72
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:08,414
Suppose you're wrong?

73
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:09,911
I hope we're not.

74
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,245
Tell me, doctor,
if I do come back,

75
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:20,491
will my next cure take
longer or shorter or what?

76
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,620
We never promise a cure.

77
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:30,596
Pan-American world airways
announces the departure

78
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,270
of flight 14 to Rome.

79
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:39,712
Passengers will board
the aircraft at gate 24.

80
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,640
All aboard, please.

81
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,409
Hello, Jack.

82
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,693
Oh, hello.

83
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:52,889
Hello, Lou.

84
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,661
I said, hello, Lou.

85
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,389
I heard what you said, Jack.

86
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,185
I hated you
when you were a star.

87
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,497
You were arrogant
and irresponsible.

88
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,099
The most difficult client
I ever had.

89
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:07,702
Now that you're nothing,
I still hate you,

90
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,835
only now I can tell you.

91
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:26,324
That face from the dead.

92
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,177
This way, signor Andrus.

93
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,549
Mr. Andrus?
I'm Ravenski.

94
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:01,687
How do you do?

95
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:02,761
Publicity.

96
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,190
Mr. Kruger's expecting you.

97
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:05,294
Thank you.

98
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:10,861
I am sure it is him!

99
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,568
And I thought he died years ago!

100
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,839
Quiet! Silenzio!

101
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:17,538
Start the wind machine.

102
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:27,916
Turn on the paddle wheel.

103
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:32,348
Roll 'em!

104
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:36,785
Action!

105
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,639
Ta-ke me ho-me.

106
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,368
Later.
First we must talk.

107
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:56,881
I have a-nother li-fe.

108
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,250
A hus-band...
A fami-ly...

109
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,380
And a pro-ud na-me.

110
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,245
There's only one name for you.

111
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,794
On the streets of my village,
they call them--

112
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:12,633
I kill you!
I hate you!

113
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,359
I hate--

114
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,570
Cut!

115
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:25,604
Halt!

116
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:29,575
Print!

117
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,511
Oh--oh, no, signorina!

118
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,845
Signorina Barzelli,
per favore, no, no!

119
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,722
Signorina Barzelli,
per favore, no, no!

120
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,591
What is she doing?

121
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:49,595
That's good.

122
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,959
All right, come on, Barzelli.

123
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,868
Come on. Get up.
Get her out quick.

124
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,000
Here, quick, the towels now.

125
00:10:56,403 --> 00:11:00,743
Barzelli, carissima,
you were superb.

126
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,443
A Lily! Get going.

127
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:04,536
Oh, and, Janet--

128
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,507
any word for me?

129
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:10,416
I've just the word.
"Nauseating."

130
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,320
Any more constructive
suggestions, Mr. Kruger?

131
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,094
Yeah.

132
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,593
Pretend you're a man.

133
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:19,134
When you kiss Barzelli,

134
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,959
try not to kiss her
like she was your mother

135
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,764
or your sister
or your gym teacher.

136
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,366
What other good takes
have we here?

137
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,168
Still giving
your leading man hell.

138
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Still making out with
your leading lady?

139
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:32,037
You dog!

140
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:36,482
You stupid, stubborn,
no-good bum, you--

141
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,709
ha ha ha!

142
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:41,254
Oh, Jack!
Ha ha ha!

143
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,651
This is my friend Andrus.

144
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,122
Mr. Andrus, how are you?

145
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:46,721
He's the only actor
I ever made a friend of.

146
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,593
The only one who ever
told me the truth.

147
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,091
Well, what are you waiting for?

148
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,663
Come on! Next set-up!
Matching over-the-shoulder.

149
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,798
What did you think of it?

150
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:57,799
The scene?

151
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,000
Mm-hmm.

152
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,702
Terribly original.

153
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:05,014
Terribly or terribly terribly?

154
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:07,508
Terribly terribly.

155
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,040
Mmm.
You mean Barzelli?

156
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,846
Well, we don't use her voice,
just her chassis.

157
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:12,247
Here, we dub all the dialogue.

158
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,879
Well, tell me, son,
how does it feel to be crazy?

159
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,884
Oh, I was afraid
you'd never get out.

160
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,016
Oh, wait. You haven't
got a script, have you?

161
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,892
Janet, give Mr. Andrus a script.

162
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:22,891
There you are.

163
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,892
Thank you. I--

164
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:26,364
look, don't expect too much.

165
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:28,433
I--I haven't read
a word of dialogue

166
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,631
in over 4 years.

167
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,232
Oh, Jack, 4 days
after you're buried,

168
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:35,065
you'll be better actor
than this little creep.

169
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:39,643
Jack, drive your Maserati
down to the excelsior.

170
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,582
Clean up, and I'll get you
a suite as fast as I can.

171
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,309
My Maserati?
My suite?

172
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:46,884
Well, you're in a triple-a
picture, triple-a treatment.

173
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,623
You know, you've got
to make these people

174
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:49,818
feel you're important,

175
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,059
otherwise, they'll
walk all over you.

176
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,524
Say, how's Clara these days?

177
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:54,422
Fine. Dying to see you.

178
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,324
Oh, Carlotta's in town.

179
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,526
What a car.

180
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Carlotta's in town.

181
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,034
You just said that.

182
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,898
Is she here by coincidence?

183
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,373
Who, Carlotta?

184
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,101
There is no coincidence.
There never was.

185
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,667
Mr. Kruger?
The cameraman is ready--

186
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:15,214
come on! Come on, will you?
We're losing the sun.

187
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:31,756
Buona sera, signore.
Buona sera.

188
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,091
Hello, George.

189
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,043
Hey, George, a taxi, huh?

190
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,075
Say, Brad?

191
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,580
Oh, Mr. Kruger.

192
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,081
Still in Rome?
Mm-hmm.

193
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,583
Well, how long does it take you

194
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,054
to write a feature story?

195
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,653
Oh, it'll be in the issue
coming out tomorrow.

196
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,745
Why don't you pick up
a copy at the newsstand?

197
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,187
You're on the cover.

198
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:05,362
With my story about
Barzelli and Davie drew?

199
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,492
No.

200
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,886
Why not?

201
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,257
It was a lie.

202
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:12,701
I don't lie to the press.

203
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,472
I never have.

204
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,601
You lie to yourself,
Mr. Kruger. That's worse.

205
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,483
Mr. Kruger,
you are behind schedule.

206
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,916
I need 2 weeks to finish
shooting this picture.

207
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,392
And I need time to dub.

208
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,221
Every word of every actor.

209
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:41,755
May I remind you, Mr. Kruger...

210
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,000
You have 2 weeks
to complete this film,

211
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,973
including the dubbing.

212
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,241
After that... Here...

213
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:56,812
Page 62 of our contract.

214
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:58,513
I control the dubbing.

215
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,217
You?
Me.

216
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,479
Can I get you something,
signor Kruger?

217
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,647
No!

218
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:07,816
Scusi, eh?
Scusi.

219
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:13,527
I've seen movies you've dubbed,
signor Junkman.

220
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,500
You've had your actors
mouthing their words

221
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,128
like mother guppies
gobbling their young.

222
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:19,595
You give me 2 extra weeks,

223
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,442
and I'll give you
a Maurice Kruger picture.

224
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,439
Don't you want
the best movie you can get?

225
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:26,912
No.

226
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,279
Don't you have any pride

227
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:30,508
in what pictures
you put your name on?

228
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:32,313
No.

229
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,245
The films I produce make money.

230
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,852
And you know why?

231
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:39,093
Because I'm
an international peddler.

232
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:45,588
On this film,
I will make 472,000.

233
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,685
Not lira, dollars.

234
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:52,057
Even if this film never
shows in one single theater.

235
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:55,198
Provided, please,
that it does not cost me

236
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:58,865
one lira more than
our contract says.

237
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:00,665
So, dear friend,

238
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:03,577
you get no extra weeks.

239
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,810
You get no extra days.

240
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,815
You get not one minute.

241
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,922
You left the set at 7:20.

242
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:48,724
Where have you been?

243
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,959
With Barzelli?

244
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,962
In her apartment,
or did Tucino lend you

245
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,795
one of his handy hideaways?

246
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:03,967
You and the tramps
you use for stars.

247
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:07,243
"Maurice Kruger,
the great lover."

248
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:09,214
You don't care what they are...

249
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:11,682
Old or young, thin or fat,

250
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:16,351
as long as you get your
grubby hands on them.

251
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:19,223
If you made a movie in
the--in the upper Amazon,

252
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:22,662
you'd have to make out
with the pygmy queen!

253
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,230
You and that big bounce...

254
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:28,759
If I ever catch the two of you
together, I'll--

255
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,768
don't forget!

256
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,569
I've got all the proof
from all the other times!

257
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:38,572
In a box at the California bank!

258
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:44,205
I could have nailed you for
adultery 10 million times!

259
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,883
And next time I will.

260
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:48,722
You're not going to get
away with anything!

261
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:51,748
'Cause I'm going to take you
for every dime you've got!

262
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,024
Every dime, Clara?

263
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,192
You're slipping.
Used to be every dollar.

264
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,861
Now where do you
think you're going?

265
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:57,989
Down the hall to see Jack.

266
00:17:58,024 --> 00:17:59,194
Jack!

267
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,655
Bringing Jack Andrus
here behind my back!

268
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:02,904
To feed your ego,

269
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,099
you fly over an actor
you can't even use.

270
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,102
Now, Clara,
I photographed a lot worse.

271
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:09,604
It's only a little part,
so shut up.

272
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:11,736
Handing out $5,000 to a man

273
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:14,971
who wouldn't even look at
you for the past 7 years.

274
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:18,407
And who could blame him
after what you did to him?

275
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,005
You and Carlotta!

276
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:23,117
6 years.

277
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,249
Thank you, Clara.

278
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:25,793
For what?

279
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:29,388
Well, you've done it again.
You've given me an idea.

280
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:33,392
The fix I'm in, only Jack
could save my neck.

281
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:34,886
Save you? From what?

282
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,397
Oh, he'll scream at first.

283
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:42,029
The way he looked at that camera
today was just pure lust.

284
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:44,968
But I can handle him.

285
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:46,004
Always have.

286
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:53,512
I did have a part for you.

287
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:57,676
4 scenes you could steal
with your eyes shut.

288
00:18:57,717 --> 00:19:03,017
That's why when you came on
my set this afternoon...

289
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,315
I saw you...

290
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,828
Through the eye of a camera.

291
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,927
Killed me.

292
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:24,413
Well, it... It looks
like you're stuck

293
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,684
for one round-trip plane fare.

294
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:33,149
If I could only
dream up something.

295
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:34,545
Something to keep you with me.

296
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:37,857
I'll take the first jet.

297
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,230
I'll have the Porter
make your reservations.

298
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,600
If you need any dough--

299
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:43,629
I don't.

300
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:57,681
Didn't they say it was
ok for you to drink?

301
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:11,722
Here you are, Jack.

302
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,437
You and I made some good ones.

303
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,667
Yes, and a couple of great ones.

304
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,037
Looked like there
was a federal law

305
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:32,746
prohibiting us from
doing anything wrong.

306
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,585
Yeah, it seemed like our
luck would never run out.

307
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:40,848
Only it wasn't luck.

308
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,087
We had the secret. We told
each other the truth.

309
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,766
Jack...

310
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,673
Jack...

311
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:03,536
Now, you could take my cast
into the dubbing room,

312
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,376
just the same as I would,

313
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,681
and you could give this movie

314
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,823
the real Kruger sound.

315
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,590
Let me be absolutely
sure I understand.

316
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:19,393
On this picture of yours,

317
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:22,655
are you proposing that
I supervise the dubbing?

318
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,355
That's right, Jack.

319
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,366
That way we could
be together again.

320
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:28,838
When your cable came,
I couldn't believe it.

321
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:31,038
You were giving me a new start.

322
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,570
A chance to live again.

323
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,905
When I walked on your set
today, I was home.

324
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:37,342
Home.

325
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:40,976
But you flew me 3,000 miles
just to put me on.

326
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:42,383
Why?

327
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:43,954
Why'd you ever send that cable?

328
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,953
Well, just because
your doctor wrote

329
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,915
and asked me to give you
a job, any kind of a job.

330
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,025
I don't want your charity!

331
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,601
If I'm through as an actor,
I'm through!

332
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,400
And to hell with you and
the whole murderous business!

333
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,272
And then what?

334
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:04,841
You stupid, stubborn,
washed-up ham!

335
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:06,411
Without me, you're a nothing!

336
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:08,608
Just a nothing!
Go on!

337
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:12,241
Go back to your crazy
house and stay there!

338
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:13,748
What the hell
do I want with this?

339
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,380
That's all that's left of you.

340
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,284
Ungrateful pup!

341
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:48,052
Operator?

342
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,320
Operator, I'd like to put
in a long-distance call.

343
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,690
F-Fairfield, Connecticut.

344
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,560
The Ridgewood retreat.

345
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:58,659
I-I'd like to speak to Dr.--

346
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,831
Never mind.

347
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,452
Oh, Jack?

348
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:25,753
You're not going to leave

349
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:26,985
without saying good-bye to me?

350
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,819
You'd never forgive yourself.

351
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:32,856
Now, there's plenty
of time for the plane.

352
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,332
Let me buy you a drink.

353
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,590
No, thanks.

354
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:37,858
A coffee, then.
A farewell Espresso.

355
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,027
Now, you can't deny me that.

356
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,676
In Rome, they dub every
word of every picture.

357
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:31,446
Dubbing makes or breaks you.

358
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:34,623
So? You always dub
your own pictures.

359
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,023
I can't.

360
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:38,855
I'm trapped by a fine
Italian contract.

361
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,099
Now, if you don't
do this for me,

362
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:45,099
Tucino will.

363
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:47,928
That's doom.

364
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,967
I need you, Jack.

365
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,666
I need you.

366
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:02,783
Ha! I knew it!

367
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,945
I knew I could count on you.

368
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,494
And you can count on me.

369
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,188
On every picture
I make from now on,

370
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,690
it's the two of us together.
You'll be my right hand.

371
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:13,134
Now, you take tomorrow off.

372
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:14,829
Do some shopping,
take in the sights,

373
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,261
do anything you want,

374
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:17,905
but meet me at the studio
tomorrow at 6:00.

375
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,770
Oh, I've got a surprise for you.

376
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,200
You're back in
the picture business, son.

377
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:24,795
Ha ha ha!

378
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,813
Jack...

379
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:31,582
You're not doing this for me

380
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,210
just because you're sentimental?

381
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:37,576
Just because I sang you
a chorus of auld lang syne?

382
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:40,346
I'm helping you
because you "need" me.

383
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,516
What's the money?

384
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:46,464
Well, what I offered
you in the wire.

385
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:48,902
The agreed price of $5,000.

386
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:51,258
Tucino won't pay that
for a dubbing job.

387
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:52,727
Well, then, I will.

388
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:54,165
I'll pay it out
of my own pocket.

389
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,270
Now, I won't let you
do this for nothing.

390
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:58,703
I know you won't.

391
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:00,707
Because it is
out of your own pocket,

392
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:01,909
because you are in a mess,

393
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,781
I don't want $5,000.

394
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,980
Oh, please--
I want 10,000.

395
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:12,478

396
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:15,088

...Poor player

402
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,040
his hour upon the stage...

403
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:35,212
Turn that off and get out.
I want to get some sleep.

404
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,311
Tucino, you
international peddler!

405
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:39,313
Take a good look
at a movie that was made

406
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:44,515
just because we couldn't
sleep until we made it!

407
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,990
You can't
be a star in a cemetery.

408
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,959
Oh, stop pitching!

409
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:50,888
Can't you get it through
your head I'm one girl

410
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,763
who doesn't want to be a star?

411
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,731
Because he was
a drunk, you're a drunk.

412
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,530
Because he loved women,
you're a tramp.

413
00:26:56,562 --> 00:26:58,502
But you forget one thing.

414
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,600
He did it with style.

415
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:00,931
I said, turn it off!

416
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,307
I don't want to hear it!
I hate him!

417
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,774
Make up your mind.

418
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:04,952
You hate him, and you
build this shrine to him?

419
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,641
He died over 10 years ago,

420
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:09,042
and you've been holding your
own private wake ever since.

421
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:10,435
Well, let me tell you something.

422
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:11,876
The acting isn't good enough.

423
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:13,361
It's a cheap performance
of a bit player.

424
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:15,813
Shh!

425
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:17,358
...Until you can pull
yourself out of this tomb!

426
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,323
Until you can see people
as they really are!

427
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,691
Until you can do this
to your father's picture!

428
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,360
...Poor player that struts...

429
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,289
And laugh! The way
he would have laughed!

430
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:28,294
That's not a god talking,
Georgia! That's only a man!

431
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:30,898
Oh!

432
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,132
You!

433
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,667
Oh!

434
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:39,467
Miss Morrison?

435
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:45,879
It's all right, miss curry.

436
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,446
Kruger...

437
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,981
You're great.

438
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:56,957
I was great.

439
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,575
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

440
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,655
Why'd you do it, Georgia?

441
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:37,964
You know why?

442
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:40,467
Because I--I was afraid I'd...

443
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:42,569
Oh, Jack, when I
think of all the years

444
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,141
we've thrown away.

445
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,670
Maurice, it's getting late.

446
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,835
Such a waste.

447
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,614
And for what?

448
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:53,782
Maurice, we've got a lot
of work to do tonight.

449
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:56,122
Oh, yes, yes, Clara.

450
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:59,148
I'll have to be up
until 3:00 rewriting.

451
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:00,745
Not again!

452
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,486
Georgia, come here.

453
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:05,721
Trying to give tomorrow's
scenes some life.

454
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:08,057
For once, Mr. Kruger,
just for once,

455
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,504
can't you leave a scene alone

456
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:10,698
until you see us play it?

457
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,399
Before you rewrite it into hash?

458
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:19,574
Nauseating little creep!

459
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:23,835
He's crazier loose than
you ever were locked up.

460
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,275
Oh, uh, Jack...

461
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,781
Take the sound of this movie

462
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,152
into the dubbing room tomorrow.

463
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,580
The real Kruger sound.

464
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:31,645
Mr. Andrus,
we'll run the rough cut

465
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:33,953
of all Mr. Kruger's shots
so far at 9:30 A.M.

466
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,646
We'll run it at 10:30, Janet.

467
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,217
But, Mr. Andrus--
10:30.

468
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:39,757
That's too bad.

469
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,231
Why?

470
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,530
Because I'd
make you a good wife.

471
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:46,432
Well, right now,
I don't need a wife,

472
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:47,625
I need a star.

473
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:53,269
It's cold now
sitting on the ground.

474
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:56,335
All right, let's go
in by the fire, shall we?

475
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:24,296
Hey, I thought
everybody had gone.

476
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:25,666
Everybody has.

477
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:29,937
How'd you like it?

478
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,905
Loved it. I thought
I was great.

479
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,784
What did you think of it?

480
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:37,023
I hate films.

481
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,850
Why?

482
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:43,756
Oh, when I have 2 hours,

483
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:46,729
I like to spend them my own way.

484
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,028
Not up there with them.

485
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:53,001
Why are you here with "them"?

486
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:54,471
A friend brought me.

487
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:59,438
He wanted to see your film.

488
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:01,441
He had to leave.

489
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:02,643
Why'd you stay?

490
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:07,708
You made me want to.

491
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,352
No, not me.

492
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,193
That was John Andrus.

493
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:21,764
Not a bad actor when he
had the right director

494
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,033
and a part--

495
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,031
what's the matter with your eye?

496
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:25,932
It's nothing.

497
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:29,474
Oh, do you have a car?

498
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:30,671
Yes.

499
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:33,342
I'd like a ride back to Rome.

500
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:34,412
Ok.

501
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:37,542
What's your name?

502
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:38,536
Veronica.

503
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:39,647
Veronica what?

504
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,847
Veronica
what's-the-difference.

505
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,955
Idiots. They never
look at anything.

506
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,226
Jack!

507
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,150
Jack!

508
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,546
You just said that.

509
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:24,817
They told me you look marvelous,
darling, and you do.

510
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:26,526
You look so healthy.

511
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,558
You look so rich.

512
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:30,725
I am.

513
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:32,732
Married at the moment?

514
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,504
Not exactly.

515
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:41,107
But he's naming an oil tanker
after me. 60,000 tons.

516
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:43,139
How's buster?

517
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:45,305
Poisoned.

518
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,884
Buster was bound to be
poisoned sooner or later.

519
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:50,953
I suppose.

520
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:54,522
I still have the house
on the hill, Jack.

521
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:56,723
I've told you how you
look to me, darling.

522
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,185
How do I look to you?

523
00:32:58,224 --> 00:32:59,864
Carlotta!

524
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,431
Did you get my message?

525
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:05,731
The operator didn't
quite understand it,

526
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:07,874
but you will.

527
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:08,929
Carlotta!

528
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,197
Suite 160.

529
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,944
How do you do?

530
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:29,688
You didn't answer her question.

531
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,191
How did she look to you?

532
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,388
Beautiful.

533
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:40,433
Who's buster?

534
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:41,926
A dog.

535
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,537
What kind of a dog?

536
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,210
Doberman.

537
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:50,779
She made him sleep
in her bedroom.

538
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,139
So?

539
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,347
Only he didn't sleep.

540
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:57,649
He growled, and he snapped.

541
00:33:57,683 --> 00:33:59,553
So?

542
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:02,445
So that's why
somebody poisoned him.

543
00:34:02,488 --> 00:34:03,718
Oh.

544
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:11,827
Was it hard to divorce her?

545
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:18,772
She found ways to make it easy.

546
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:22,836
It was damn hard.

547
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,330
It was about 3:30
in the morning...

548
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:41,728
Pouring rain.

549
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,360
I was drunk...

550
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,070
What are they screaming about?

551
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:53,142
Oh. Ha ha!

552
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,311
About how much
they love each other.

553
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:56,841
Very Roman.

554
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:01,914
So, 3:30 in the morning...

555
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:03,277
Rain...

556
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:05,275
Oh, I drove down the hill

557
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:07,447
from Carlotta's house.

558
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:09,486
When I got to the last curve,

559
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:11,791
I must have been
doing a good 90.

560
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:13,863
How much in kilometers?

561
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,692
Oh, about 140.

562
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:19,427
Uh... 144.

563
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,525
When I hit that wall.

564
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:26,909
Maybe it happened
because I was drunk,

565
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:28,908
maybe I meant to kill myself.

566
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,580
I still don't know which.

567
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,710
Well, I've been
divorced for 3 years.

568
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:37,516
I hadn't seen her
in 8--8 months.

569
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,149
She'd been in Europe,
I stayed in Hollywood,

570
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,445
watching myself crack up,

571
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,287
and then, that afternoon,

572
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:47,992
I saw Carlotta
driving down Wilshire.

573
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:49,426
She--she was wearing

574
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:53,371
that green chiffon scarf.

575
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:59,069
We--we always had
a thing about green.

576
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,074
Would you like
another Espresso--

577
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,366
she pulled up at the curb.

578
00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:04,478
She said, "call me,

579
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,010
or just drop by
any hour of the 24."

580
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,376
She drove away.

581
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,716
I tried getting drunk.

582
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:18,962
Tried calling
the right phone numbers.

583
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,190
There I was...

584
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:24,796
3:00 in the morning...

585
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,500
Driving up the hill
to her house.

586
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:32,204
It used to be our house.

587
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:35,867
I used the gold key

588
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:38,677
she'd given me
our first Christmas.

589
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:43,717
The house was dark.

590
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:48,551
There was only
a light on in her room.

591
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:55,391
The door to her room was open.

592
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,706
I'm glad you weren't killed.

593
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:10,844
I'm glad you're here.

594
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,284
Hey, what's this?

595
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:49,753
Eh, this is interesting. Look.

596
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:54,788
What do you make of this?

597
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,520
Why haven't they got any faces?

598
00:37:56,555 --> 00:37:58,885
He waits for a client
and then draws the face in.

599
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:01,686
Huh?

600
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:03,187
He wants to draw my portrait.

601
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:04,498
Sure. Sure.

602
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,600
Quanto? Quanto?
6,000 lira.

603
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,573
Cheap enough.
Let's go.

604
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,511
Listen, who knows? You might
be hanging in the Louvre.

605
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:12,967
Maybe. Ha ha!

606
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:17,144
Smile pretty.
That's it.

607
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,605
Bene!

608
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:35,463
Do you know what time it is?

609
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:37,263
Uh-huh.

610
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:38,455
So do I.

611
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,566
Hey, when will I see you again?

612
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,170
Will I see you again?

613
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,243
I'll phone.

614
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,271
Oh.

615
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:51,778
I'll drive you home.

616
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,880
No.

617
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:57,922
Oh, you have to get
to the studio early.

618
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,049
I'll take a taxi.

619
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,860
Uh-huh.

620
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:14,869
I said--

621
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,540
I know.
"I'll take a taxi."

622
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:23,944
Good night, Veronica.

623
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:27,905
Good night.

624
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:39,123
Yes?

625
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:46,703
Yes, Carlotta.

626
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,974
Yes, I found it when I came in.

627
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:54,213
Look, Carlotta,
you're the one person

628
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,809
I--I don't want to see.

629
00:39:55,841 --> 00:40:00,411
At least that proves
you've been thinking of me.

630
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,805
And I of you.

631
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:06,948
Every night for
the last 4 years.

632
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:12,485
I know we can't make up
for 4 years in one night,

633
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:14,193
but we might try.

634
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,771
Oh, poor Clara.

635
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,799
Janet, I want to run
the whole thing over again.

636
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,866
Contessa,
it's important. Immediately.

637
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:36,305
Joe, when you get
to the end of this reel,

638
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:38,311
start at the beginning again.

639
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,483
She's so out of
place here in Rome.

640
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:45,154
What other angles have we got?

641
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:48,853
You know Mr. Kruger doesn't
go in for protection shots.

642
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:50,857
All day long,
he's at the studio,

643
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:52,619
and at night, he--

644
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,757
all that rehearsing with
Barzelli and all that.

645
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:57,203
Janet, how long have
you worked with Kruger?

646
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:58,528
12 years.

647
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:00,733
Janet, for 12 years,
you've lived vicariously

648
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,896
as "poor Clara,"
"poor Gail," "poor Madeline,"

649
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,754
and the other 2 "poors"
he was married to before that.

650
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,300
And after 12 years,

651
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,707
you still don't know whether
you love him or you hate him.

652
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,580
Mr. Andrus, you shut up!

653
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:14,748
Why don't we both shut up?

654
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,920
We found him last night
floating in the lake

655
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,578
with a knife in his back.

656
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:28,493
A family...
A husband...

657
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,656
A proud name.

658
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,795
No, Liz, no,
that's not quite it.

659
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,571
Oh, it sure isn't.
I'm lousy today.

660
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,770
No, no, no.

661
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:38,642
Say, Liz?
Yeah?

662
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:41,069
What do you love
most in the world?

663
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:42,836
Um, food.

664
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:45,414
You remember
that ice cream parlor,

665
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:47,113
wheelwright's, on sunset strip?

666
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:49,775
Those huge
luscious banana splits

667
00:42:49,815 --> 00:42:50,775
a dollar a throw?

668
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:52,176
Worth every penny.

669
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:54,987
Well, next time you dub,
you think to yourself,

670
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,930
"we will have
10,000 banana splits.

671
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:04,198
Huge... Luscious...
Banana splits."

672
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:05,359
Got it.

673
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:06,866
Go ahead. Try again.

674
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:16,669
Ha ha ha! Do we?

675
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:19,437
You still have not understood.

676
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,877
I have another life.

677
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:25,453
A family...
A husband...

678
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,553
And a proud name.

679
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,086
Liz, we'll call you tomorrow.

680
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,821
Whoo! I know. Don't
call us, we'll call you.

681
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:33,828
Arrivederci.

682
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:35,129
Arrivederci.

683
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:43,629
Ready, Davie?

684
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:44,898
Let's try one.

685
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,209
Say, Davie...
Why'd you run away

686
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:54,382
in the middle of shooting
your last 2 pictures?

687
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:58,052
I, quote, cost
the studio millions.

688
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,153
Good.

689
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:01,854
But that's not why you ran away.

690
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:03,517
I saw your first movie.

691
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,364
It's beautiful.

692
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,990
You broke their hearts.

693
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:11,226
Look, is this my
10,000 banana splits?

694
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:13,102
One trick to set Liz right,

695
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:15,371
another to straighten
out Davie Drew.

696
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,970
Playing it friendly,
the big brother bit?

697
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:22,673
Well... I guess that
was the idea, Davie.

698
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:24,007
No dice.

699
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
I'll tell you why you ran away.

700
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:32,776
You were scared gutless.

701
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:33,887
You woke up one morning,

702
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,919
and they told you
you were a star.

703
00:44:35,954 --> 00:44:37,264
You didn't believe them.

704
00:44:37,288 --> 00:44:39,258
You knew you were
the same frightened little kid

705
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,890
you were when you went to sleep,

706
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,886
so you ran.

707
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:45,698
And you've been
running ever since.

708
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,870
You were dead in Hollywood
at the age of 22.

709
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:49,769
No studio would hire you,

710
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,100
and that's what
you wanted, wasn't it?

711
00:44:52,137 --> 00:44:54,867
You stupid little creep.

712
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:56,866
You think you
discovered suicide?

713
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:59,738
I pulled all your idiot
tricks and plenty more.

714
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:01,307
Only you still have a chance.

715
00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:03,916
Nobody put a gun to your head
and said you had to be an actor.

716
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,279
You wanted it.

717
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,916
Now do your job.

718
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:09,993
Oh, my job?

719
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,191
Certainly, Mr. Andrus.

720
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,655
And congratulations on
the brilliant performance.

721
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:21,026
But you wasted your time.

722
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:23,796
To Kruger, I'm just
90 feet of film a minute.

723
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,744
He hired me for nothing,

724
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,770
he treats me like nothing,

725
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:30,105
and nothing's what he gets.

726
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:33,081
You're Kruger's stooge...

727
00:45:33,111 --> 00:45:36,281
And you get... Nothing.

728
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:50,997
We'll, uh...

729
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:52,959
We'll get whatever we can.

730
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:55,128
The best thing you can
get is to get packed.

731
00:45:59,704 --> 00:46:02,644
Mr. Kruger gave you this job out
of the goodness of his heart.

732
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:05,843
You'd be saving him money if
you took your pay and got out.

733
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:06,876
Roll it.

734
00:46:08,046 --> 00:46:10,046
Scusi.

735
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:12,951
Someday, you won't be able
to keep that hand from shaking.

736
00:46:12,984 --> 00:46:15,924
What'll you do then,
go back to the asylum?

737
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:17,923
Signor Andrus, telephone.

738
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:20,055
Oh, thank you.

739
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:24,194
Yes?

740
00:46:26,064 --> 00:46:27,304
Oh, Veronica.

741
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:30,973
The girl who
left me her picture,

742
00:46:31,002 --> 00:46:33,602
but not her address
or her phone number

743
00:46:33,638 --> 00:46:35,168
or her last name.

744
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,938
Tonight? I have
to come back here.

745
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:41,577
Work after dinner.

746
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,021
Tomorrow, more work.

747
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,520
Oh, not tomorrow night.

748
00:46:47,552 --> 00:46:49,092
And not Sunday

749
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,660
while only thieves
and policemen work.

750
00:46:53,891 --> 00:46:55,861
You'll pick me up?

751
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:57,563
At my house.

752
00:46:57,595 --> 00:47:04,535
Well, Trestevari,
piazza Santa Maria, 24.

753
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:06,169
9:00.

754
00:47:06,204 --> 00:47:07,314
Ok?

755
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:10,138
I'll be the girl
with the black eye.

756
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:11,935
Hey, why don't you
stop going around

757
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,006
with guys who
give you black eyes?

758
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:24,586
Janet, I'll be here for 2 weeks.

759
00:47:24,622 --> 00:47:27,092
I have a job. Roll it.

760
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:31,395
There!

761
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:34,699
You and your friend Brad Byrd!

762
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:38,372
You had him all wrapped up!

763
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:40,873
I suppose you'll tell me
you haven't seen it!

764
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:42,765
No, I haven't.

765
00:47:42,807 --> 00:47:44,107
Liar!

766
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,951
With your sense of humor,

767
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:51,448
you'll probably
find this amusing.

768
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:53,282
Listen to this.

769
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:56,918
"Prototype of the obsolete
Hollywood talent,

770
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:59,864
"now flourishing in Rome
is Maurice Kruger.

771
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,330
Once imitated by all, now
only Kruger imitates Kruger."

772
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:06,702
I'm not through
this garbage yet, Clara.

773
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:12,341
What does a $200-a-week
hack like Brad Byrd know?

774
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,340
One year I'm a genius,
the next year, I'm--

775
00:48:14,372 --> 00:48:15,842
all right, then,
read it for yourself

776
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:18,483
and see what Brad Byrd knows!

777
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:27,149
"Like the bourbon kings,

778
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:30,915
"Kruger learns nothing,
forgets nothing.

779
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,215
"The set at Cinecitta

780
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:35,827
"is a museum
of directorial clichés,

781
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,330
"including the ritual courtship

"of the leading lady.

Current is pneumatic
Sicilian Barzelli--"

784
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:46,467
there! For
the whole world to see!

785
00:48:46,504 --> 00:48:48,844
You don't even
bother to hide it!

786
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:51,043
Why should I?

787
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:53,435
Why should I?

788
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:56,608
Who in his right mind would
expect me to settle for you,

789
00:48:56,647 --> 00:49:00,917
a worn-out, dried-up,
whining, meddling old hag?

790
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:02,991
My lawful wedded nightmare,

791
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,860
frustrated and stupid,

792
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,459
sticking your fat nose
into everything!

793
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:09,662
Day and night!

794
00:49:09,694 --> 00:49:11,604
Every minute.

795
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:03,847
Clara?

796
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:08,754
Clara?

797
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:12,661
Open the door.
Please, Clara.

798
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:17,927
Clara?

799
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,040
Clara...

800
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:31,612
Don't swallow all
those sleeping pills.

801
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:33,112
The doctor will
just have to come up

802
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:36,413
and pump out your stomach again.

803
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,847
You know how sick that makes me.

804
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:49,388
Clara?

805
00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:52,529
Clara?

806
00:50:54,031 --> 00:50:58,201
I--I look at this film
I'm shooting...

807
00:50:58,235 --> 00:50:59,665
I like it.

808
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:03,369
What if I'm wrong?

809
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:07,108
It's another calamity?

810
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:09,014
Where do I go from here?

811
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:15,019
Took me 2 years to get
this job, and that was a fluke.

812
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:20,887
How can a man go wrong
and not know why?

813
00:51:20,925 --> 00:51:23,755
What's happened to me?

814
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:29,502
Jack looked at my picture.

815
00:51:29,534 --> 00:51:33,344
He hated every foot of it.
I could tell.

816
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,871
What does he know?

817
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:38,936
What did he ever know?

818
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:41,646
He's a Jonah and a jinx.

819
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,579
Get rid of him once and for all.

820
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:49,146
Is it ego?

821
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:53,786
Self-indulgence?

822
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:55,734
Or...

823
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:03,098
Am I just plain afraid?

824
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:05,773
Oh, my poor...

825
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:08,513
I've seen the film
you're shooting,

826
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:10,309
and it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

827
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:37,926
Going to meet me tonight?

828
00:53:37,962 --> 00:53:39,962
After your party?

829
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:42,527
A Roman party?

830
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,367
I'll try to leave early.

831
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:47,442
I'm happy with you.

832
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:50,012
And damn lucky.

833
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,510
You're part of my life
I thought I'd lost forever.

834
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:56,145
Try not to be too late.

835
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:07,091
When you were a star...

836
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:09,464
There in Hollywood...

837
00:54:09,494 --> 00:54:12,134
Before Carlotta...

838
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:13,932
Did you have a lot of girls?

839
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,466
Girls like me?

840
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,713
Not as many as I should have.

841
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:24,069
Certainly not as many
as they said I had.

842
00:54:26,443 --> 00:54:29,283
What were you like then?

843
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:31,553
Lonely.

844
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:34,282
So famous and alone?

845
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,548
Everybody's alone.

846
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:38,717
Actors more so.

847
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:41,386
Then why would anyone
want to be an actor?

848
00:54:41,425 --> 00:54:43,285
That's a good question.

849
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:44,657
Why?

850
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,095
To hide from the world.

851
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:53,001
Everybody likes to hide
once in a while.

852
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:55,737
Sure they do. Look
at any movie theater.

853
00:54:55,773 --> 00:54:57,613
What's the audience doing there?

854
00:54:57,642 --> 00:55:00,082
Hiding in the dark,
trading their problems

855
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,180
for mine on the screen.

856
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,922
Actors... What a job.

857
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:08,589
You know, I used to get up
at 6:00 in the morning,

858
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:10,719
rush through my breakfast,
jump in my car,

859
00:55:10,755 --> 00:55:13,915
race down to the studio,
get into wardrobe, makeup,

860
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:17,228
get up on that stage, and
then at 9:00 in the morning

861
00:55:17,261 --> 00:55:21,601
invent the telephone,
win the west, sway juries,

862
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:24,072
make love to the most
beautiful women in the world

863
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:27,771
hour after hour after hour.

864
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:29,865
I thought I had it made,

865
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,977
then, zoom...

866
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:34,079
I was a star.

867
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,081
Big business.

868
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:37,383
Hide from the world.

869
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,854
They were ramming it
right up my gut.

870
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:43,094
Lawyers, agents,
managers, partners.

871
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,620
All grabbing,
carving up my whole life.

872
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:47,987
One day, I looked at them all,

873
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:50,855
and I asked myself,
"who are these guys?"

874
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:53,755
"What are they doing here?
What do they want from me?"

875
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,070
Then, the second question
you ask is...

876
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,813
Who you really are.

877
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,939
Well, are you the face
on the billboard

878
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:08,784
smeared with lipstick kisses
from shrieking high school kids?

879
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:10,883
The face that barflies
all want to take a poke at

880
00:56:10,915 --> 00:56:13,375
to see if you're as tough as
the roles you play in movies?

881
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,447
Is that you?

882
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:17,955
Or are you the face
you see in the mirror?

883
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:23,227
The face of the guy you've
been hiding all your life.

884
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,195
So, I started running,
living in a crowd,

885
00:56:27,231 --> 00:56:30,101
balling it, lots of laughs,
lots of kicks,

886
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:32,304
through it all, Carlotta.

887
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:36,406
I kept running
faster and faster,

888
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,740
and suddenly...

889
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:41,276
Dead ahead of me...

890
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,751
There was a wall.

891
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:49,621
Is there an answer?

892
00:56:49,654 --> 00:56:51,594
Does any actor find it?

893
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:53,992
Some do.

894
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:56,264
Eh, that I don't have
to worry about anymore.

895
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:57,803
That's for the Davie Drews.

896
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:11,343
What will you do from now on?

897
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,375
Finish this job for Kruger.

898
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,910
And then?

899
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:18,245
Live the future
one day at a time.

900
00:57:18,282 --> 00:57:19,622
See what happens.

901
00:57:21,986 --> 00:57:25,456
"Vin Nobile."

902
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:27,119
From Siena.

903
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:28,287
You like it?

904
00:57:28,325 --> 00:57:31,125
Very much.

905
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:32,701
And I like you very much.

906
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:39,365
I like girls with black eyes...

907
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:41,243
Soft mouth...

908
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:04,759
I'm going to kill you, Andrus.

909
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:07,625
All right, you scared me.
Now, put it away.

910
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,074
Where is she?
Where is who?

911
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,529
Don't kid me.

912
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:11,777
I didn't come here
to have anyone kid me.

913
00:58:11,802 --> 00:58:13,242
What kind of a kick are you on,

914
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,400
weed, goofballs, bennies?

915
00:58:14,438 --> 00:58:15,738
How many girls have you brought

916
00:58:15,773 --> 00:58:18,483
to hotel rooms like this?

917
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:20,038
With her, you must
have made history,

918
00:58:20,077 --> 00:58:21,547
because she couldn't
wait to rush home

919
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:23,348
to tell me she
was through with me!

920
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,920
What did you do, get her drunk?

921
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:27,919
How many rotten, filthy lies
did you tell her?

922
00:58:27,952 --> 00:58:30,092
Say, Jack?
Come on, get dressed.

923
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,760
I hate being late.

924
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:34,289
Oh, wait till you hear my
anniversary toast to Clara.

925
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:35,464
It's a Lily.

926
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:36,992
What would you do?

927
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:38,097
About what?

928
00:58:38,128 --> 00:58:39,898
We're working out
the inner action

929
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,130
how you take a knife
away from a killer.

930
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:47,037
Well, if the man with
a knife isn't a man,

931
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:51,711
just a yellow-bellied
little creep?

932
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:54,782
Well, you look him in the eye,

933
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:57,112
you walk up to him,

934
00:58:57,147 --> 00:59:00,547
and still looking him
in the eye,

935
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:02,794
you grab him by his limp wrist.

936
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:11,263
Don't fight my fights.

937
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,503
I was just going
to break his nose--

938
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:16,231
in how many pieces?

939
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:20,913
The little creep.

940
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,148
Oh, my god.

941
00:59:48,866 --> 00:59:52,436
I've never begged before.

942
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:55,169
I'm begging now.

943
00:59:55,205 --> 00:59:56,435
Give her back to me.

944
00:59:58,442 --> 01:00:01,452
What does she mean to you?

945
01:00:01,478 --> 01:00:03,808
Handy tramp?

946
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:06,978
Two weeks of company
in another town?

947
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:09,187
Studio's crawling
with girls like that.

948
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:10,019
So's the via veneto.

949
01:00:10,054 --> 01:00:12,094
You could pick and choose.

950
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:15,232
Can't you?

951
01:00:15,259 --> 01:00:17,999
No.

952
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:22,668
All the stories about me
over here and in Hollywood...

953
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:26,199
All of the filth...

954
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:29,866
Most of it's... True.

955
01:00:29,907 --> 01:00:31,807
Till Veronica.

956
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:39,221
Look, Davie, you didn't
discover first love.

957
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:42,819
You're not the first one
to foul it up.

958
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:46,992
I can't live without her.

959
01:00:47,024 --> 01:00:49,864
Anybody can live
without anybody.

960
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:54,026
I can't.

961
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:07,436
Is he gone?

962
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:08,977
Yes.

963
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:11,483
You're wasting your time
working with that creep.

964
01:01:11,515 --> 01:01:13,045
Just keep him in his place.

965
01:01:14,651 --> 01:01:16,051
Where is that?

966
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:17,816
At the toe of a boot.

967
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:19,394
Kick him.
Keep on kicking him.

968
01:01:19,423 --> 01:01:22,463
That's the only way
I kept him in his place.

969
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,492
You didn't keep him.

970
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:28,926
The girl kept him here.

971
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,140
Hell of a girl.

972
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:37,444
You know, for a man
who's lived with Carlotta,

973
01:01:37,474 --> 01:01:40,114
how can you be so dumb?
Don't you ever learn?

974
01:01:40,144 --> 01:01:43,754
All women are just pure monster.

975
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,450
Go on. Get dressed.

976
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,650
Creep.

977
01:02:28,258 --> 01:02:29,288
Jack...

978
01:02:29,326 --> 01:02:33,396
Have you ever seen
a billion dollars breathe?

979
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,969
He operates Japanese tankers

980
01:02:38,002 --> 01:02:43,942
with Greek crews
under the flag of Liberia.

981
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:46,514
Why don't you give up
all this movie nonsense

982
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:48,353
once and for all?

983
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:50,978
And do what?

984
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:54,345
Enjoy yourself
traveling with me.

985
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:00,815
Under the flag of Liberia?

986
01:03:00,857 --> 01:03:04,057
He's so busy with
his business, darling.

987
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:07,064
He takes up
so little of my time.

988
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:11,037
He enjoys watching
other men want me.

989
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:13,538
Leave it to me.

990
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:17,710
You need never have
another worry in this world.

991
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:33,761
Come on! Come on!
Everybody, here!

992
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:35,630
Come on in!

993
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:36,929
Quiet!

994
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:40,856
Quiet!
Quiet, everybody!

995
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:42,467
Is it ready?
A beautiful--

996
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:44,279
quiet. Mr. Kruger's going
to make his speech now,

997
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:46,601
so you go ahead and
get it ready, please.

998
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:01,815
Friends...

999
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:04,051
In this day and age...

1000
01:04:04,088 --> 01:04:07,318
When cynicism rules...

1001
01:04:07,357 --> 01:04:09,327
I plead guilty
to being sentimental.

1002
01:04:10,694 --> 01:04:15,374
Is it sentimental to Cherish
wedding anniversaries?

1003
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:17,469
Well, then, I plead guilty.

1004
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:21,311
To enjoy the company of friends?

1005
01:04:21,338 --> 01:04:22,938
Guilty.

1006
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:26,612
To propose a toast
to Clara, my wife?

1007
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:28,813
Guilty.

1008
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:31,475
To Clara...

1009
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:36,485
On this, our eighth
wedding anniversary.

1010
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,990
A tribute from a pen
mightier than my own.

1011
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:46,234
"You are my true
and honorable wife...

1012
01:04:46,263 --> 01:04:49,973
"As dear to me
as are the drops of blood

1013
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:52,939
"that visit my sad heart.

1014
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:56,739
"The hand
that hath made you fair

1015
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:58,743
hath made you good."

1016
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:00,775
Then tell that hand

1017
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,580
to stop working under the table!

1018
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:04,913
Hmm?

1019
01:05:04,948 --> 01:05:07,618
Makin' out with that big bounce

1020
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:10,721
right under my nose.

1021
01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:12,394
Cut it out.

1022
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:14,662
Or I'll walk right out on you!

1023
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:16,231
Now!

1024
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:20,030
And then who'll wipe
your nose and dry your tears

1025
01:05:20,063 --> 01:05:23,933
when those lousy reviews
come out?

1026
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,697
As for you, drop dead!

1027
01:05:25,735 --> 01:05:26,735
Aah!

1028
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,040
No! No, please!

1029
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:29,171
No! No, please!

1030
01:05:29,206 --> 01:05:30,366
No! No! No!

1031
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,610
What are you thinking now?

1032
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:48,323
Let's get to the car.

1033
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:49,792
I want to go home.

1034
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,290
If that's what you want.

1035
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:01,969
It's not what I want.

1036
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:09,211
When you leave Rome,
take me with you.

1037
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:14,239
Let me go with you, please.
Wherever you go.

1038
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:16,708
Don't let it end for us.

1039
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:17,746
Ever.

1040
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:22,346
All right.

1041
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:24,446
We leave in about 10 days.

1042
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:31,704
You think that'll
make Davie disappear?

1043
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:33,128
Or Carlotta?

1044
01:07:33,162 --> 01:07:35,902
Davie?

1045
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,832
How long have you known?

1046
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:40,167
Since this evening.

1047
01:07:40,203 --> 01:07:42,473
Is he the first man
you ever loved?

1048
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:46,684
Yes.

1049
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:49,250
Must have been
a tough guy to love.

1050
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:52,951
Are you still in love with him?

1051
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:12,172
You didn't answer my question.

1052
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:15,171
I would if I knew the answer.

1053
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:17,614
You'll never find it
by running away.

1054
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:22,779
Are you telling me
to go back to Davie?

1055
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:23,952
I didn't say that.

1056
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:31,417
But you won't take me with you.

1057
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:32,955
I didn't say that, either.

1058
01:08:37,494 --> 01:08:39,204
What was the name of that wine?

1059
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:40,498
Vin Nobile.

1060
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,135
Veronica...

1061
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:53,044
Come here.

1062
01:08:53,076 --> 01:08:55,906
There. Don't cry.

1063
01:09:04,354 --> 01:09:06,494
Good evening, Mr. Andrus.

1064
01:09:06,523 --> 01:09:07,293
402.

1065
01:09:07,323 --> 01:09:09,093
Yes, Mr. Andrus.

1066
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:10,555
Thank you.

1067
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:26,378
Up, please.

1068
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:01,605
Come down later. I'll call you.

1069
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:20,859
Look, Carlotta--

1070
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:24,431
oh. Yes, Ravenski.

1071
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:30,206
What?! Heart attack?

1072
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:33,579
Oh, my god.

1073
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,580
Uh--well--how--how
do I get there?

1074
01:10:35,612 --> 01:10:38,012
Well, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Yes? Yes?

1075
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:49,925
Unh...

1076
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:54,596
Unh...

1077
01:10:58,768 --> 01:10:59,768
Unh...

1078
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:07,782
Unh...

1079
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:10,181
Get them out of here, please.

1080
01:11:10,213 --> 01:11:11,213
Get 'em outta here.

1081
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:12,247
Please.

1082
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:22,963
Unh... It hurts.

1083
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:24,262
It's a harpoon.

1084
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:27,403
We can take you
to the hospital soon.

1085
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,670
It had to happen now.

1086
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:34,340
Couldn't wait
another few lousy days.

1087
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:37,910
If I don't finish the picture,
I don't collect my last check.

1088
01:11:37,941 --> 01:11:41,651
Without it...

1089
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:46,518
What will happen to Clara?

1090
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:50,550
We haven't enough
to pay the hotel bill.

1091
01:11:50,587 --> 01:11:53,557
Kruger's last picture...

1092
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:56,430
Unfinished...

1093
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:59,099
Botched by
an international peddler.

1094
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,370
It'll be finished.

1095
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:08,341
Oh, sure, by Tucino.

1096
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:11,811
He'll hire any no-talent hack
who'll finish under budget.

1097
01:12:11,841 --> 01:12:12,881
Not by Tucino.

1098
01:12:12,909 --> 01:12:14,009
Well then, by who?

1099
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,183
By me. The Kruger way.

1100
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:16,581
What do you think I was doing

1101
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:18,553
on our last 7 pictures,
walking in my sleep?

1102
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:21,652
I'll take care of Tucino.
You take care of Kruger.

1103
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:28,357
You know, I've
been faking so long...

1104
01:12:28,391 --> 01:12:30,891
I don't think I can feel
what's real anymore.

1105
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:35,869
If I can...

1106
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:38,739
It's what I feel for you, Jack.

1107
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:42,566
Don't die with a lie.

1108
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:45,836
You never felt
for anybody but Kruger.

1109
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,645
Now that's the way to talk.

1110
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:50,778
You know, as soon
as you start to die,

1111
01:12:50,814 --> 01:12:54,984
everybody's so polite
it's nauseating.

1112
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:03,257
Jack...

1113
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:04,592
Jack, I've got to tell you.

1114
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:09,598
Carlotta...
She wasn't worth it.

1115
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:12,503
It was all over town.
Everybody was talking.

1116
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:16,305
How she was prowling.
So...

1117
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:20,239
I took her to lunch at Romanov's

1118
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:22,046
to read her the riot act,

1119
01:13:22,078 --> 01:13:23,808
and I said to her,

1120
01:13:23,847 --> 01:13:28,317
"now, Carlotta... You don't
do this thing to Jack.

1121
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:32,421
You're to cut it out
right now."

1122
01:13:32,455 --> 01:13:34,455
Carlotta said,
"I'm not cutting it out,

1123
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:36,460
"so why don't you jump
in the pool, Kruger.

1124
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:38,032
The water's warm."

1125
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:43,331
I let her drive me out
to a motel in the valley.

1126
01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:48,439
I never could turn down anything

1127
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:50,311
that was handed me on a platter.

1128
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:02,389
How do you know?
You never tried.

1129
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:09,561
Thank you, Jack.

1130
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:04,509
Jack?

1131
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,670
Mr. Andrus?

1132
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:06,678
Where's Jack?

1133
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:08,479
Here I am.

1134
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:10,251
Ok.

1135
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:14,619
Call Clara. Ask her
to come to the hospital.

1136
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,590
Tell her I'm on my knees.

1137
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:19,389
You'll never be on your knees.

1138
01:16:19,422 --> 01:16:21,662
Heh. I know.

1139
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:24,290
Tell her just the same.

1140
01:16:24,327 --> 01:16:25,527
Let's go.

1141
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:40,314
Direct my picture, you?

1142
01:16:40,343 --> 01:16:41,513
Me.

1143
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:48,545
You're insane!

1144
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:50,024
Matto!

1145
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:54,822
Traveler's checks.

1146
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,825
All I have, my last cent.

1147
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:02,332
If I finish one minute
behind schedule,

1148
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:04,225
one penny over budget...

1149
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,510
Cash 'em in.

1150
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:11,008
The money's yours.

1151
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:39,166
No word from the police.

1152
01:17:39,202 --> 01:17:41,042
He was seen coming out
of the excelsior

1153
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,770
last night,
but since then, nothing.

1154
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:44,866
And the airlines?

1155
01:17:44,908 --> 01:17:47,478
Nor the buses or the trains.

1156
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,750
There's a body in the morgue
about Davie's age,

1157
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:52,978
but it's been there 2 weeks.

1158
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:54,216
I've covered everything

1159
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:57,250
from the dog races
to the Vatican library.

1160
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:17,374
Carlo, dismiss the company.

1161
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:19,836
Si. Until when?

1162
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,905
Until we find him--
if we find him.

1163
01:18:21,945 --> 01:18:24,045
Take his stand-in,

1164
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,080
shoot the rest of the film

1165
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:27,715
of the back of his neck.

1166
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,750
I couldn't do that
to Kruger's picture.

1167
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:34,686
Tomorrow morning
at 9:00 precisely,

1168
01:18:34,723 --> 01:18:37,033
somebody shoots my picture.

1169
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:40,500
If not you, somebody.

1170
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:41,599
Tucino!

1171
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,181
David Drew?

1172
01:19:30,213 --> 01:19:33,683
Ah, David Drew,
actor, Americano.

1173
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:17,725
Davie.

1174
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,760
Davie!

1175
01:20:28,671 --> 01:20:30,311
Hey, what is this?

1176
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:55,923
What about the press release?

1177
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,328
We'll figure it out.
Come on up.

1178
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,460
We've got to find out a way

1179
01:21:58,494 --> 01:22:00,504
to keep Kruger from hearing.

1180
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:01,499
402, please.

1181
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,370
Yes, Mr. Andrus.

1182
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,249
Well, it's about time.

1183
01:22:54,383 --> 01:22:57,353
Where the hell have you been?

1184
01:22:57,386 --> 01:22:59,046
What time is it, anyway?

1185
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:00,157
Where were you?

1186
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:01,619
Right here waiting for you.

1187
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:03,537
You know how many people
we've had hunting for you,

1188
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:04,959
combing this town?

1189
01:23:04,993 --> 01:23:06,863
What for? Why?

1190
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:11,174
Grab a shower and let's move.

1191
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,240
We've got 40 minutes.

1192
01:23:13,269 --> 01:23:14,999
Here, you might as well shave

1193
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:16,767
while you're at it.

1194
01:23:16,805 --> 01:23:18,165
40 minutes for what?

1195
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:20,237
Mr. Kruger had a heart attack.

1196
01:23:20,276 --> 01:23:21,476
Mr. Andrus will finish

1197
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:23,650
directing the picture.

1198
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,309
You?

1199
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:26,418
Me.

1200
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:36,533
Hello.

1201
01:23:36,559 --> 01:23:37,559
Hello.

1202
01:23:38,627 --> 01:23:39,627
Pronto.

1203
01:23:39,662 --> 01:23:41,062
Do you know how?

1204
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:42,126
Well, we'll find out.

1205
01:23:42,164 --> 01:23:43,374
Hello.

1206
01:23:43,399 --> 01:23:44,539
Look, can I have some breakfast?

1207
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,097
Some orange juice and coffee.

1208
01:23:46,134 --> 01:23:48,574
Cinecitta studios, please.

1209
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:54,841
So I started thinking.

1210
01:23:54,877 --> 01:23:56,137
Congratulations.

1211
01:23:56,178 --> 01:23:58,278
It finally hit me.

1212
01:23:58,314 --> 01:24:00,584
One more runaway,
and I'd be finished.

1213
01:24:00,616 --> 01:24:03,246
Not just in movies.
I'm not talking about that.

1214
01:24:03,286 --> 01:24:05,846
Me, I'd be finished--

1215
01:24:05,888 --> 01:24:07,918
what's left of me.

1216
01:24:07,956 --> 01:24:10,686
That's why I went to your place.

1217
01:24:10,726 --> 01:24:14,326
But I didn't expect to wait
all day and all night.

1218
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:15,903
What did you expect?

1219
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:17,201
The answer neatly wrapped?

1220
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:19,072
The riddle of life
and love revealed

1221
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:20,301
in one painless session?

1222
01:24:20,336 --> 01:24:24,036
I asked myself who,
of everybody around,

1223
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:27,142
fouled--fouled up
his life the most?

1224
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:29,645
So you came to my place.

1225
01:24:29,678 --> 01:24:33,348
I said to myself,
"he's not completely stupid.

1226
01:24:33,382 --> 01:24:35,852
Must have taught him something."

1227
01:24:35,884 --> 01:24:36,754
Did it?

1228
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,645
Not much.

1229
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:39,757
Oh.

1230
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,188
I did learn some.

1231
01:24:41,223 --> 01:24:43,163
Like what?

1232
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:44,861
Shuffleboard,

1233
01:24:44,893 --> 01:24:47,763
the most comfortable
position on a couch,

1234
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:52,126
a few 12-letter words
like "transference,"

1235
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:54,637
"sublimation,"

1236
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:56,440
the look on the face of somebody

1237
01:24:56,472 --> 01:24:58,812
who's taken the first step.

1238
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:10,947
Why'd you bring me here?

1239
01:25:13,055 --> 01:25:15,985
You've got just 3 minutes
with her.

1240
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:18,462
Why?

1241
01:25:18,494 --> 01:25:20,404
Why?

1242
01:25:20,429 --> 01:25:23,129
Well, for one thing, you can't
entirely dislike a man

1243
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:25,365
who's tried to kill you.

1244
01:25:25,401 --> 01:25:28,201
For another thing,

1245
01:25:28,236 --> 01:25:31,466
now you've got
just 2 1/2 minutes.

1246
01:26:10,145 --> 01:26:11,345
Cut!

1247
01:26:12,815 --> 01:26:13,645
And print.

1248
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:19,222
Janet!

1249
01:26:19,254 --> 01:26:20,994
Janet!

1250
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:27,126
Well, did you--
did you call the hospital?

1251
01:26:27,162 --> 01:26:28,962
Mr. Kruger's on the danger list.

1252
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:31,197
No visitors.

1253
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:32,513
Are--are you sure
about that take?

1254
01:26:32,535 --> 01:26:33,795
Oh, it couldn't be better.

1255
01:26:33,836 --> 01:26:35,296
Oh, Carlo!

1256
01:26:35,337 --> 01:26:37,237
Carlo!

1257
01:27:07,603 --> 01:27:08,873
Davie, would you mind

1258
01:27:08,904 --> 01:27:10,714
holding the chips
a little higher?

1259
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,109
Mr. Andrus.

1260
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,210
Mr. Andrus!

1261
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:21,517
Let's try to play this scene
entirely different.

1262
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:25,390
Play it calm and cool.
Oh, Mario, listen.

1263
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,620
I think we can get
a kind of effect

1264
01:27:27,656 --> 01:27:29,386
by dimming down the lights

1265
01:27:29,424 --> 01:27:31,134
so at the end he's in
complete silhouette.

1266
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:32,159
Mr. Andrus.

1267
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:40,439
She says that Mr. Kruger
promised to rewrite the scene.

1268
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:56,418
Mr. Andrus, she does not
understand English.

1269
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:58,191
Not even one word.

1270
01:28:27,415 --> 01:28:29,645
Now you get dressed.

1271
01:28:56,712 --> 01:28:58,752
Quiet!

1272
01:28:58,781 --> 01:28:59,821
Quiet!

1273
01:28:59,848 --> 01:29:01,648
Silenzio!

1274
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:03,891
Mario.

1275
01:29:03,919 --> 01:29:05,419
Mario!

1276
01:29:05,453 --> 01:29:06,493
Yes, Mr. Andrus.

1277
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:07,631
Oh, Mario, this setup I picked

1278
01:29:07,656 --> 01:29:08,756
is terribly original.

1279
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:10,661
Can you do something better?

1280
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:12,663
I have worked for many
American directors.

1281
01:29:12,695 --> 01:29:14,695
No one ever asked me
for a suggestion.

1282
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:16,730
Suggestion? I'm
begging you for help.

1283
01:29:16,765 --> 01:29:18,425
Ah, well, in this case...

1284
01:29:35,317 --> 01:29:36,947
Hands a little higher.

1285
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:38,890
How's that?

1286
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:39,721
Julio, ok?

1287
01:29:40,956 --> 01:29:42,156
He say he can see the shoulder.

1288
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:43,490
Oh, very important.

1289
01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:45,655
You must keep your shoulders
back at all times.

1290
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:49,562
Well, get to the hospital?

1291
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:51,598
Yes. They wouldn't
let me speak to him.

1292
01:29:51,634 --> 01:29:53,504
No phone calls, no visitors.

1293
01:29:53,535 --> 01:29:55,665
Mr. Kruger's had
a restless evening.

1294
01:29:55,704 --> 01:29:58,574
Mmm, thank you.

1295
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,238
Now, then, hands in position.

1296
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,410
Shoulders back.

1297
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:04,745
Ah, mama, Mia.

1298
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,210
Reaching for the jewelry.

1299
01:30:06,248 --> 01:30:08,418
Put the jewelry in the dish.

1300
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,990
Now reach in
for the poison ring.

1301
01:30:11,019 --> 01:30:12,349
Shoulders back.

1302
01:30:13,989 --> 01:30:15,729
She says can't you use
somebody else's hands?

1303
01:30:15,758 --> 01:30:18,888
Absolutely not.
Now bring out the ring.

1304
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:19,797
Open the ring.

1305
01:30:19,828 --> 01:30:22,198
Reach for the poison.

1306
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,000
Now pour in the poison.

1307
01:30:24,032 --> 01:30:25,132
Shoulders back!

1308
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:58,772
Reach for the ring.

1309
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:01,398
Open the ring.

1310
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:02,806
Reach for the poison.

1311
01:31:02,838 --> 01:31:04,838
Pour in the poison.

1312
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:20,185
Stop.
Turn it backwards.

1313
01:31:20,222 --> 01:31:21,662
Hey, Davie.

1314
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:23,090
Yeah?

1315
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:26,125
Stop. Forward.

1316
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:27,401
Now look, see.

1317
01:31:27,429 --> 01:31:28,609
See, when she glances
over to you,

1318
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,600
she smiles at you.

1319
01:31:29,631 --> 01:31:31,631
Yeah, yeah.
What about after that?

1320
01:31:31,666 --> 01:31:34,236
Supposing I walk around
in front of her,

1321
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:35,569
pick up the parasol.

1322
01:31:35,603 --> 01:31:36,913
Very good.

1323
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:51,945
That's it!

1324
01:31:53,021 --> 01:31:55,591
Barzelli, you're wonderful.

1325
01:31:55,623 --> 01:31:57,063
Davie, you're right.

1326
01:31:57,092 --> 01:31:59,062
That was the way to play it.

1327
01:31:59,094 --> 01:32:01,104
Mario, get me some lighting.

1328
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:02,899
We've gotta get this today.

1329
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:05,731
Mario, this has got
to be a Lily,

1330
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:06,938
your masterpiece.

1331
01:32:06,969 --> 01:32:08,509
Now how long is it gonna
take you to light it?

1332
01:32:08,536 --> 01:32:10,406
Well, an hour, maybe less.

1333
01:32:10,438 --> 01:32:11,808
Do the best you can.

1334
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,080
Mr. Andrus, excuse me.

1335
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:15,378
This is the way I lined up
the list of the retakes.

1336
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:16,610
Will you check it, please?

1337
01:32:16,644 --> 01:32:18,214
So, Jack, how do you do it?

1338
01:32:18,246 --> 01:32:21,676
You shoot all day.
You cut and dub all night.

1339
01:32:21,716 --> 01:32:23,016
When do you sleep?

1340
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:25,321
While I eat.
Look, reverse 4 and 9,

1341
01:32:25,353 --> 01:32:26,963
ah, 4 and 9.

1342
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:33,998
How the hell did
Lou Jordan get on this set?

1343
01:32:34,029 --> 01:32:37,669
The voice of the vulture
is heard in the land.

1344
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:39,629
True blue Lou.

1345
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:42,037
So it begins, huh?

1346
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:45,510
They sniff the scent of gold,
the new Davie Drew.

1347
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,280
Didn't take them long.

1348
01:32:47,309 --> 01:32:48,479
Long?

1349
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:51,580
In 10 minutes, everybody
on the via veneto'll know.

1350
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:53,983
In an hour, it'll be
all over Hollywood.

1351
01:32:54,016 --> 01:32:55,476
Mr. Andrus, telephone.

1352
01:32:55,517 --> 01:32:57,287
Not now, Janet.
Look, Mario--

1353
01:32:57,319 --> 01:32:59,019
it's the hospital.

1354
01:33:02,424 --> 01:33:04,464
Uh, hospital?

1355
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:06,332
Oh, Clara, uh--

1356
01:33:08,463 --> 01:33:10,233
of course.
I'll be right over.

1357
01:33:10,265 --> 01:33:12,325
How is he?
Is he--

1358
01:33:12,367 --> 01:33:13,797
Clara?

1359
01:33:16,338 --> 01:33:17,408
Carlo!

1360
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:20,137
Mr. Andrus.

1361
01:33:20,175 --> 01:33:22,875
I'll be back before
they light up.

1362
01:33:26,614 --> 01:33:27,884
Jack, got a minute?

1363
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:29,046
I'm in a hurry.

1364
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:30,854
Too much of a hurry
to make a lot of money?

1365
01:33:30,886 --> 01:33:32,956
Lou, some other time.
I'm rushing to the hospital.

1366
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:34,888
Well, I'll walk you to the door.

1367
01:33:34,923 --> 01:33:37,063
How long before
you finish this job?

1368
01:33:37,092 --> 01:33:38,132
It's already finished

1369
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,430
except for 2 days of retakes.

1370
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:42,061
Good. You're available.
I can close the deal now.

1371
01:33:42,097 --> 01:33:45,067
You know how much finishing
this picture means to Davie.

1372
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,500
Yesterday he was poison.
Today we can pick and choose.

1373
01:33:50,372 --> 01:33:52,112
We?

1374
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,940
Yeah.

1375
01:33:53,976 --> 01:33:55,476
Didn't you know?

1376
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,510
Davie made it clear.

1377
01:33:57,545 --> 01:33:59,745
On his next picture, you direct.

1378
01:33:59,781 --> 01:34:01,851
I've got just the package.

1379
01:34:01,884 --> 01:34:05,394
Davie, the number
one best seller,

1380
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:06,420
you.

1381
01:34:08,657 --> 01:34:10,447
What about Kruger?

1382
01:34:12,952 --> 01:34:14,392
What about him?

1383
01:34:40,655 --> 01:34:42,785
You look tired, son.

1384
01:34:42,824 --> 01:34:45,334
Oh, I suppose I am.

1385
01:34:47,428 --> 01:34:50,568
Maurice, you--
you look great.

1386
01:34:50,598 --> 01:34:53,498
You had me so worried,
I was crazy.

1387
01:34:53,534 --> 01:34:55,004
They wouldn't let me see you

1388
01:34:55,036 --> 01:34:57,406
or even talk to you
on the phone.

1389
01:34:57,438 --> 01:34:59,008
Finished under, hmm?

1390
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,510
Oh, 2 days ahead of schedule.

1391
01:35:02,543 --> 01:35:05,283
When can you run the film?

1392
01:35:05,313 --> 01:35:07,323
It's great.

1393
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:10,148
It's just the way you
wanted it, the Kruger way.

1394
01:35:10,185 --> 01:35:13,685
Well, then you're
all wrapped up.

1395
01:35:13,721 --> 01:35:15,291
Company dismissed?

1396
01:35:15,323 --> 01:35:16,293
Not quite.

1397
01:35:16,324 --> 01:35:17,094
Why not?

1398
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,285
You're not gonna believe this.

1399
01:35:19,327 --> 01:35:22,657
I persuaded Tucino to give us
2 extra days for retakes.

1400
01:35:22,697 --> 01:35:25,467
Oh, you should have
heard him scream.

1401
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,200
Retakes?

1402
01:35:27,235 --> 01:35:29,365
On my picture?

1403
01:35:29,404 --> 01:35:33,514
Well, what are you
waiting for, Maurice?

1404
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:35,341
You dirty, lying, ungrateful,

1405
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:37,146
double-crossing crook!

1406
01:35:37,178 --> 01:35:39,048
You, that he dragged
out of a Broadway gutter

1407
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,520
and saved from the nut house,

1408
01:35:40,548 --> 01:35:42,178
trying to steal his picture!

1409
01:35:42,217 --> 01:35:43,017
Shut up.

1410
01:35:43,051 --> 01:35:44,131
What, do you think we're stupid

1411
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:45,462
and we don't know
what's going on?

1412
01:35:45,486 --> 01:35:49,816
Janet told us every sneaky,
slippery trick you pulled.

1413
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:51,787
I tried to reach you
every day this week.

1414
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:53,326
Retakes, you call them!

1415
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:56,701
Ha, throwing out
Kruger's best work!

1416
01:35:56,731 --> 01:35:58,771
The scenes he wrote
with his blood.

1417
01:35:58,799 --> 01:36:01,699
Knifing him in the back
on his deathbed.

1418
01:36:01,736 --> 01:36:03,636
Maurice, you can't believe that.

1419
01:36:03,671 --> 01:36:05,371
So you finally did it,
didn't you?

1420
01:36:05,406 --> 01:36:07,076
It took you 7 years,

1421
01:36:07,108 --> 01:36:10,308
but you finally got even
with him for Carlotta!

1422
01:36:10,345 --> 01:36:11,345
Shut up, Clara.

1423
01:36:13,513 --> 01:36:15,283
Maurice, I want to talk
to you alone.

1424
01:36:15,323 --> 01:36:17,093
Never! Never again!

1425
01:36:17,352 --> 01:36:20,592
From now on, whoever talks
to Kruger talks to me first.

1426
01:36:20,621 --> 01:36:21,761
Maurice, for god's sake--

1427
01:36:21,789 --> 01:36:23,489
get off my set

1428
01:36:23,524 --> 01:36:25,334
and stay off.

1429
01:36:26,935 --> 01:36:29,295
You're washed up.

1430
01:36:30,025 --> 01:36:31,835
Maurice, I...

1431
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,640
Tried to help,

1432
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:36,739
not steal your picture. I--

1433
01:36:37,935 --> 01:36:39,805
Maurice, this may be
the last chance I have

1434
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,840
to talk with you.

1435
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:41,975
That's true!

1436
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:43,490
The last chance anyone has
to talk with you.

1437
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:45,481
Don't you see what she's
trying to do to you?

1438
01:36:45,513 --> 01:36:46,653
You dirty, lying thief!

1439
01:36:46,681 --> 01:36:47,781
Clara!

1440
01:36:47,815 --> 01:36:52,285
Take a look at
tomorrow's trade papers.

1441
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,820
They've already got the story--

1442
01:36:53,854 --> 01:36:56,524
how I had to close
down my picture

1443
01:36:56,557 --> 01:36:57,827
and throw you out.

1444
01:36:57,858 --> 01:36:59,128
It was too much for you.

1445
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:00,330
You couldn't do the job.

1446
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:02,331
Because you were drunk
and unreliable!

1447
01:37:02,363 --> 01:37:04,873
Because you're still
nuts and always will be!

1448
01:37:04,899 --> 01:37:07,369
Go back! Go back
to your crazy house!

1449
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:10,542
That's where you belong,
in a nut house!

1450
01:37:11,965 --> 01:37:17,395
Well, that is the end
of Mr. Jack Andrus.

1451
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,140
Just one moment.

1452
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:25,377
Mr. Andrus.

1453
01:37:27,314 --> 01:37:29,884
Mr. Andrus, there's
a telephone call

1454
01:37:29,917 --> 01:37:32,117
from the Cinecitta studios.

1455
01:37:32,152 --> 01:37:33,422
They say it's very important.

1456
01:37:33,453 --> 01:37:35,293
Mr. Andrus.

1457
01:37:36,656 --> 01:37:38,186
Tucino's hysterical, Carlotta.

1458
01:37:38,225 --> 01:37:40,325
He wants Jack to come back

1459
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,830
and finish shooting the picture

1460
01:37:41,861 --> 01:37:44,101
the way Jack wants to shoot it,

1461
01:37:44,131 --> 01:37:46,531
but I guess the Krugers
pushed the button.

1462
01:37:46,566 --> 01:37:47,526
I see.

1463
01:37:47,567 --> 01:37:50,367
Look, Carlotta, I know
how you feel about the guy,

1464
01:37:50,403 --> 01:37:52,413
but for once in your life,
try and behave yourself,

1465
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:53,439
will you, huh?

1466
01:38:01,448 --> 01:38:03,178
Come in...

1467
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:04,316
Jack.

Jack!

1488
01:42:38,391 --> 01:42:40,861
Racing down your hill!

1489
01:42:40,893 --> 01:42:44,733
Seeing that wall dead ahead!

1490
01:42:44,764 --> 01:42:47,804
Jack, Jack, we're in Rome!

1491
01:42:47,834 --> 01:42:49,874
Not the house on the hill!

1492
01:42:49,902 --> 01:42:51,342
Jack!

1493
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:52,641
Aah!

1494
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,442
Aah!

1495
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,690
Aah!

1496
01:43:05,718 --> 01:43:07,948
Aah!

1497
01:43:10,857 --> 01:43:12,727
Aah!

1498
01:43:12,759 --> 01:43:13,929
Aah!

1499
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,860
Did I aim at that wall

1500
01:43:15,895 --> 01:43:17,595
and try to kill myself,

1501
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:20,270
or was I just too drunk
to miss it?

1502
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,870
3 years I've seen that wall.

1503
01:43:22,902 --> 01:43:25,512
I still don't know.

1504
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,880
Aah!

1505
01:43:28,908 --> 01:43:31,838
Jack, Jack!

1506
01:43:31,878 --> 01:43:33,948
Aah!

1507
01:43:35,081 --> 01:43:36,781
What a wall!

1508
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:41,790
Aah!

1509
01:44:07,213 --> 01:44:10,953
Well, now we know.

1510
01:44:58,164 --> 01:44:59,734
Porter.

1511
01:45:01,968 --> 01:45:03,238
Alitalia, flight 288.

1512
01:45:03,269 --> 01:45:04,669
Where the hell have you been?

1513
01:45:04,704 --> 01:45:06,184
They've been calling you
every 2 minutes.

1514
01:45:06,205 --> 01:45:07,205
Where's Veronica?

1515
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:08,779
At the plane on the runway.

1516
01:45:08,808 --> 01:45:11,938
Lou Jordan says
you turned me down.

1517
01:45:11,978 --> 01:45:13,878
You won't direct
my next picture.

1518
01:45:13,913 --> 01:45:14,913
Why?

1519
01:45:16,215 --> 01:45:18,275
Tell me why.

1520
01:45:18,317 --> 01:45:20,947
Here is your ticket,
Mr. Andrus.

1521
01:45:20,987 --> 01:45:22,957
Don't you like working with me?

1522
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:26,159
Very much,
and we'll do it again.

1523
01:45:26,192 --> 01:45:28,032
But why not now?

1524
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:30,000
I need you.

1525
01:45:30,029 --> 01:45:33,399
Don't you ever say that again.

1526
01:45:33,433 --> 01:45:35,803
The plane is waiting for you.

1527
01:45:38,471 --> 01:45:41,041
You don't need me.
You don't need anybody.

1528
01:45:41,073 --> 01:45:42,613
Get that through your head.

1529
01:45:42,642 --> 01:45:43,712
I thought I needed Kruger

1530
01:45:43,743 --> 01:45:45,883
and I could never work
without him,

1531
01:45:45,912 --> 01:45:47,252
but I could, I did.

1532
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:48,849
I thought I needed Carlotta,

1533
01:45:48,881 --> 01:45:50,351
that she spoiled
all women for me,

1534
01:45:50,383 --> 01:45:51,463
that I couldn't live
without her,

1535
01:45:51,484 --> 01:45:52,824
but I could, I did.

1536
01:45:52,852 --> 01:45:54,852
I came here
looking for the past.

1537
01:45:54,887 --> 01:45:56,957
I found it,
and that hell with it.

1538
01:45:59,626 --> 01:46:01,326
I know I'm not off my rocker,

1539
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,560
but I've gotta go
back home to prove it.

1540
01:46:03,596 --> 01:46:05,166
Now I've gotta prove
that the job we did together

1541
01:46:05,197 --> 01:46:06,327
was no flash in the pan.

1542
01:46:06,365 --> 01:46:07,705
Look, you know when we're
gonna work together?

1543
01:46:07,734 --> 01:46:09,904
When it's right for both of us.

1544
01:46:09,936 --> 01:46:11,036
Mr. Andrus, please,

1545
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:12,610
we've got our flight orders.

1546
01:46:16,042 --> 01:46:17,412
Veronica.

1547
01:46:19,912 --> 01:46:21,282
Cheer up, Davie.

1548
01:46:21,313 --> 01:46:24,083
This has gotta last
me a lifetime.

1549
01:46:24,116 --> 01:46:26,016
Mr. Andrus, we must take off

1550
01:46:26,052 --> 01:46:27,792
or we'll lose our clearance.
