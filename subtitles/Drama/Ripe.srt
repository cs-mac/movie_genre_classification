1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,092
Patricia...

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,297
Patricia, where are you?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,135
The plane is leaving in an hour

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,608
Patricia...

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,273
It's almost 20 past 12

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,408
I'm due for the meeting at 12:40 to go

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,249
I'm already late for the hair-dresser

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,050
Patricia...

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,816
Today is holiday

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,154
She should try not to be late
for a while

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,887
But why must send her out today?

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,461
Vacation starts with entry

13
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,894
She must go back to college in Munich

14
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,397
Patricia

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,461
Patricia...

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,802
She isn't anywhere

17
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,200
I don't know where she is

18
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,033
Go look for her

19
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,171
Patricia, you got to be late

20
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,682
Will you hurry?

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,320
Patricia, hurry up

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,926
Good morning, everybody

23
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,799
Oh, Patricia

24
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,328
Something wrong?

25
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,401
Hi, father

26
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,705
Hello, mother

27
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,211
You should be ashamed

28
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,609
Of what?

29
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,879
I hope you'll excuse us

30
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,781
Oh, no... I think she's charming

31
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,046
This is ticket to Munich,

32
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,520
First Class... darling

33
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,089
And there's little something

34
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,159
as posture to morale

35
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,824
I wouldn't tell your mother

36
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,724
I'll keep it our secret

37
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,228
Thank you, Dad

38
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,589
You'll work hard and enjoy yourself

39
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,131
I'm sorry I can't go with you

40
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,225
But Miss Kito will drive you
to the airport

41
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,897
Se you soon and have a good trip

42
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,050
Patricia

43
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:00,983
Hm?

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,453
Patricia

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,882
I'm only going to Munich

46
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,356
But you're going alone... I'm worried

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,757
Surely you'll send us telegram

48
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,657
As soon as I arrive

49
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,057
You need this money, my darling

50
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,425
But I won't tell your father

51
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,828
Yes, indeed

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,728
But Patricia...

53
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,232
You know I trust you, my dear

54
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,370
I know you'll be a good girl

55
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:19,633
Oh, my God...

56
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,934
I'll be late for the hair-dresser

57
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,531
and write to your father

58
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,933
Sure

59
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,586
Passengers to Munich Luthansa Flight 317

60
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,627
immediate boarding at Gate Nº6

61
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:22,125
Oh, I'll miss you, darling

62
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,066
I don't want to live without you...
my dear

63
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:24,931
I come to Munich

64
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,063
As soon as I raise the money, I...

65
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,740
What's your name?

66
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,842
Why do you want to know?

67
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,968
Just tell me

68
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,806
Sol Dosloman, so what?

69
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,005
Sol Dosloman?

70
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:34,943
Yes

71
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,071
Okay

72
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,348
Would you put this ticket

73
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,578
in Sol Dolsoman's name please?

74
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,924
So you two like to go to Munich?

75
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:51,986
Yeah, sure...

76
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,794
but I'm broke to bring her

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,524
Okay, you're in business

78
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,659
Yeah, but why?

79
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,169
Just do me a favor

80
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,602
Send out this cable from Munich...

81
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,900
make sure to my folks

82
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,071
Yeah, certainly

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,681
Passengers to Munich Luthansa Flight 317

84
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,016
immediate boarding at Gate Nº6...

85
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,335
Hello, can I do something for you?

86
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,094
No, thanks

87
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,259
Oh, you're American

88
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,395
No, I'm Chinese

89
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,507
I suppose you're just waiting
for the bus

90
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,574
No

91
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,506
I'm on my way back to Abbey

92
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,377
Where are you heading?

93
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,741
Wherever you are

94
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,475
Have you seen my company?

95
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,447
Who hasn't?

96
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,551
But I find it really boring

97
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,643
Would you like to stop at my place
for a drink then?

98
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,620
That sounds superb

99
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,128
I'll have the whole afte3rnoon off

100
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,969
By chance I just saw my boss off
to Munich

101
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,642
How convenient

102
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,264
I'll be right with you

103
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,291
What's in it?

104
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,492
The red is Campari... the rest is secret

105
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,796
Secret?

106
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,498
Nothing worse than poison

107
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,540
Cheers

108
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,076
Cheers

109
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,114
My name is Dimus Roberts... what's yours?

110
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,316
Elizabeth... Elizabeth Baker

111
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,983
from New York

112
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,652
But friends call me Elly

113
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,024
Elly?

114
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,934
You're a model, I imagine

115
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,262
What makes you think I'm a model?

116
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,599
Well... your body

117
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,935
If you like... if you need a job...

118
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,202
I mean work... I have many contacts

119
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,300
Helping people?

120
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,845
Well, why not?

121
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,582
Can you hear my heart pound?

122
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,015
Pounding like crazy, come and feel it

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,729
It beats for you

124
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,063
Could it beat like that for hours?

125
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,000
Caress me

126
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,719
Kiss me, Dimus

127
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,863
Are you married?

128
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,162
Oh, yes... you might say so

129
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,668
in open-minded country

130
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,237
That's nice

131
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,865
Neither of you are jealous?

132
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,067
You're looking at an elderly swinger

133
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,337
I'm 58 years old

134
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,039
I'm free as a bird, darling... okay?

135
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,375
How do you like to kiss my tonic?

136
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,824
She missed the plane, you know?

137
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,822
Who?

138
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:48,858
Your wife

139
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,389
What?

140
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,288
She missed the plane

141
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,397
She missed her plane?

142
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,192
You saw her?

143
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,159
She was running after us

144
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,031
Then she must be on her way home

145
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,537
I thought you said you're free
as a bird

146
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,263
Hurry...

147
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,635
You don't mean she's jealous?

148
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,332
Jealous?

149
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,273
If she finds you here,

150
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,310
she'll chop me into pieces

151
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,969
Hurry... please

152
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:12,274
Dimus...

153
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,860
Where's she?

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,222
I saw her boarding your car

155
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,724
You must have brought her home

156
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,989
Don't try to cheat me like a fool

157
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,291
How dare you do this to me

158
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,026
immediately after I'm away?

159
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,903
Chou, swinger

160
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,680
Please listen to me

161
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,045
I don't want to hear any of your
explanation

162
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,708
I'll never forgive what you've done...

163
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,185
Taxi...

164
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,627
(In Greek)Damn it...

165
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,234
see what you've done to me

166
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,230
I've made up my mind

167
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,527
Whether right or wrong, I've done it

168
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,432
I want to learn things in my own way

169
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,170
I don't need Munich for that

170
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,332
At the airport, I gave my ticket to

171
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,737
a couple of love-sick kids

172
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,572
Here I'm still in Greece

173
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,168
I'm still loving it

174
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,145
This afternoon, I had a bump trial with
a middle-aged man

175
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,182
What an artic piece...

176
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,378
crazy to see what they got to

177
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,988
You may guess I'll have my first night
alone

178
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,354
I want to go to sleep...
just near de Polem

179
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,387
Hello

180
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,526
(In Greek)Do you mind giving me a ride?

181
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,721
It's great to me

182
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,230
Give the bag to me... no sweat

183
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,469
Please don't speak Greek, dear

184
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,080
Speaking English?

185
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,016
Huh?

186
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,416
Do you speak English?

187
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,750
(In Greek)What's your origin?

188
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,186
Arlenika

189
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,587
What's Arlenika?

190
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,658
She's Arlenika

191
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,628
You only speak Greek?

192
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,322
You... Arlenika

193
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,693
Me... Hard Rock

194
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,822
He's very good Cocksman

195
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:48,763
Hark Rock?

196
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,527
Right

197
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,463
I've got a hot whisky... she's ready

198
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,697
She's quite a pretty, huh?

199
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,273
You know it

200
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,539
Hey, you like to make love at Max?

201
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,375
Arlenika and Hard Rock?

202
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,244
Hard Rock and you babe right on

203
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,146
That's good

204
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,274
That's heaven, kid

205
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,477
She'll do?

206
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,279
She's ready

207
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,184
Shall we try?

208
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,414
We can get a shot for trying

209
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,922
Why don't you ask her first?

210
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:12,922
How is it for a bitch?

211
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,323
Okay, you may tear off a piss

212
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:15,984
A piss?

213
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,959
Hard Rock's piss?

214
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:17,995
What did I tell you?

215
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:18,722
She's ready

216
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,231
Let's not keep the lady waiting

217
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,776
Okay, you win... okay

218
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,374
Let go of me

219
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,882
You guys should me a good time

220
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,816
She's speaking English

221
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,466
James, what's the matter?

222
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,744
Nothing, dear... absolutely nothing

223
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,404
What are you gazing like that?

224
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,846
You look ill

225
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:59,423
Good heaven... James, close your eyes

226
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,385
Put your clothes

227
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,926
on your shameless husky body

228
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,030
You've never seen a pair of bulls?

229
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,658
What language... hippies?

230
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
She got to be a hippie

231
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,928
Give me a break, Sir

232
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,596
James, I've told you to close your eyes

233
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,040
Jamie, look...

234
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,144
Look...

235
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,713
See heaven

236
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,646
Young lady, you go away from here...

237
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,081
or I'll call the police

238
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,744
Bye, honey... bye

239
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,589
Bye...

240
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,859
I hope the son of a bitch will show up

241
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:13,796
I'll kill her

242
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,232
Oh, what I want to do is to find
the damn car

243
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,503
Hey, look... here's the car

244
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,438
She has left the key in it

245
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,509
Gentlemen...

246
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,049
You should know you can't park here

247
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,311
What does this jerk want?

248
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,616
The jerk says you park at where says
'No Parking' and

249
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,919
will cost you 1,000 ranus

250
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,052
And for the jerk, that'll cost another
1,000 ranus

251
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,597
That's 2,000 ranus altogether

252
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,893
2,000 ranus?

253
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,027
Oh, as for your insolence,

254
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,500
there's a special charge which brings to

255
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,071
3,000 ranus

256
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,334
The more we talk, the more it costs...
great

257
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,171
Your friend has a great fortune

258
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,676
If I lay my hand on that bitch...

259
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,040
I'll get this all back and

260
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,545
I'll take it out in kind

261
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,518
And so, on this second day of this odyssey

262
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,454
in which I bumped into
in the same old way

263
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,821
Except for the gorgeous scenery...

264
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,926
otherwise I encountered an attempted

265
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,930
rape by a couple of guerillas
who kept yelling

266
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,160
after getting kick from my boot

267
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,628
Poor fellows

268
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,771
Why everyone is so hung up sexually?

269
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,965
Why they always go bananas?

270
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,174
Does it have to be such a big thing?

271
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,437
Why can't it be natural?

272
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,658
Hello

273
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,656
I was hungry, so I help myself

274
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,765
It's good soup

275
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:09,595
What do you do?

276
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:10,293
You drop by the sky?

277
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,333
Out of space

278
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,768
I hope you've got a nice fall

279
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:13,667
I'm sorry

280
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,762
I don't mean to disturb you

281
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,205
But you're really into it beautifully

282
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,242
You two really have a ball together

283
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,570
I should hope so

284
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,806
What would you do in our case
by watching?

285
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,005
What are you saying?

286
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,173
It seems so funny

287
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:24,975
What?

288
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,607
I always thought watching people make love

289
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,548
would turn me on

290
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,618
I guess I was wrong

291
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,585
You want to try it?

292
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,414
No

293
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,216
You might learn a few tricks

294
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,599
You have a place to hold on tonight?

295
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,002
I thought if I could stay here

296
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:49,706
Okay with you?

297
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,538
Sure if you don't mind

298
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,291
Do you love her?

299
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:51,994
Sure...

300
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,935
If I didn't, I wouldn't make love
with her

301
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,835
I don't know

302
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,635
Have you known her very long?

303
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,004
Three whole days

304
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,274
You don't think other girls
in love with?

305
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,881
I love them all

306
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,177
Oh...

307
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,296
Baby, I want you now

308
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,239
Let me go... baby, go away

309
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,607
Keep hard for the little boy's room

310
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,311
I'll join you

311
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,830
Did you say you had to go too?

312
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,234
I intend to

313
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,869
Hey, you're not timid, are you?

314
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,135
Me?

315
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,038
No point being shy what comes natural?

316
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,774
You got your hang-up... I got mine

317
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,925
After you, my lady

318
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,552
Thank you, my lord

319
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,371
Sure you don't mind what I do, sweetie?

320
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,410
No... I'm sorry

321
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,469
Hello

322
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,138
What are you doing here?

323
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,109
I'm lying down... who are you?

324
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,905
What's the idea?

325
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,777
You got any good idea?

326
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,578
I'm fresh out... what do you want?

327
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,311
Come in... I entertain your visit

328
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,547
You want a cigarette?

329
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,749
They're mine

330
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:21,915
So?

331
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,430
Mind to take me on this cruise?

332
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,026
I don't eat much...
though I don't bump on the right side

333
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,139
And suppose I don't need a female
aboard?

334
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,865
No problem...

335
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:43,175
If you're not hurry...
I look for another boat

336
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,283
You want to bet he'll have me aboard?

337
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,547
I warn you... Joe is a bastard

338
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,716
But you're nobody at all

339
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,295
Okay, a good cruise is hard to find

340
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,691
Can you cook?

341
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,059
No

342
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,598
Don't you ask silly questions?

343
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,780
I suppose you got a name

344
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,016
Barbara... it's just a trial

345
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,023
I was supposed to work in Munich

346
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,924
Who wants to work at 19?

347
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,029
I caught out

348
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,496
My old man then pulled the poor banana...

349
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,498
so I grew up broken crazy

350
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,370
Tell me about yourself

351
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,838
Here... drink up

352
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,008
So, what's the story of your life?

353
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,420
The name is Tom... the age is 28

354
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,250
I'm living in a friend's place in Purais

355
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,719
I'm a foreign correspondent
for a news agency

356
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,795
I spend as much time on my boat

357
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,887
doing nothing as I can manage

358
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,331
My father is in the best of his health

359
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,595
My mother is hardly normal

360
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,129
How many girlfriends you've got?

361
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,763
None at present

362
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,468
How many you've known?

363
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,679
I'm no good in statistics

364
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,748
Approximately

365
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,008
Why would you want to know?

366
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,051
I always want to know what's that

367
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,019
Are you saying you never took a girl
to bed?

368
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,679
I must be frank you mean?

369
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:52,983
Yeah

370
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,822
I'm sorry it's not true

371
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,256
You make jacker?

372
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,385
Hm...

373
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,962
You got to be a jack then

374
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,189
You got to be a dice

375
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,696
Don't be so sure... I'm not

376
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,962
I'm not so sure what I really am

377
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,559
I'm not so sure what's a dice worth

378
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,659
and I don't care a damn

379
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,170
So far what you're doing,

380
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,068
the smell is what I've found

381
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,198
Thanks

382
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,243
It's so far false, don't you flatter?

383
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,277
How about a trial?

384
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,286
Don't you sometimes

385
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,228
feel so lonely all by yourself?

386
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,424
I'm not alone now

387
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,524
You're not... right

388
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,312
Be careful, the deck is slippery

389
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,784
Barbara...

390
00:35:57,122 --> 00:36:00,683
Barbara, I'm talking to you

391
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,489
Are you talking to me?

392
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,323
Of course, who else?

393
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,920
Who said my name is Barbara?

394
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,293
Barbara was the name you said

395
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,660
Oh, yes... it's the one

396
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,702
You won't say I'm stoned, will you?

397
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,600
No... just not

398
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,899
You think I'm gonna crazy?

399
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,994
A little

400
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,109
Question...
can a hermit and fruit make together?

401
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,272
Do you think I'm nude?

402
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,871
You're really superb

403
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,946
You're even better on your own yacht

404
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,446
And I got a lovely girl in the cabin

405
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,416
What do you plan to do tonight?

406
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,613
Do you really think I can fall asleep?

407
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,756
You keep mosquito here

408
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,152
No...

409
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,586
You won't go to help

410
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,197
Are you coming over to kiss me
goodnight?

411
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:15,833
You're supposed to do that

412
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,696
I never have to do that

413
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,600
Women are supposed experts for
such a thing

414
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,968
I guess you should

415
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,524
You know I think I'm in love

416
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,896
You mean you're not sure

417
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,697
How can I be sure?

418
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,430
Sometimes it just happened that way

419
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:32,593
On a Greek island,

420
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,237
I met a wonderful man

421
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:37,102
His name is Tom... handsome and gentle

422
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,233
And I feel good when I'm with him

423
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,174
I still don't know...

424
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,506
is it because I'm in love or

425
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,773
because he makes love so well

426
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,506
But after all, what makes the difference

427
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,482
if I'm in love and great?

428
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,143
If I'm not, so what?

429
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:53,086
But counted I'm happy like everyday

430
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,714
I can use new discovery

431
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,986
as nothing after the foam

432
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,824
Not a single buddy I should look at
twice

433
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:11,691
It must be kidding us

434
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,024
about all the actions in Greece

435
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,394
It got to be some asshole around

436
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,294
like our girl friend is

437
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,264
You call that asshole...

438
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,198
As a matter of fact, she's a bitch
I call it

439
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,395
I' d still rather be a poor fellow

440
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,370
than a bishop every night

441
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,870
Yeah, maybe... time's up

442
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:25,833
You know what I need?

443
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:26,967
Nothing... you have me

444
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,136
I need sunglasses

445
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,280
Well, you can a pair anywhere

446
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,404
There...

447
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:31,947
Where?

448
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:32,505
Al Trimond

449
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,140
I'll wait for you

450
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:33,944
Take all these

451
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:34,575
I'll try...

452
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,051
Hey, you'll break the camel's back

453
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:43,126
Hey... I need a pair of sunglasses

454
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,491
You shouldn't hide some videos

455
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,096
Thank you

456
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,827
No... they're not my style

457
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,458
How about the white one?

458
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,797
Not too big for me?

459
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,496
That's perfect

460
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:57,838
Now, look...

461
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,636
Yeah... how much are they?

462
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:01,711
For you, they're free

463
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,211
I got something else you like too

464
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,210
It's for you

465
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:06,908
No...

466
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:07,711
Please, you must

467
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:08,546
Please, you must

468
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:09,210
I couldn't

469
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,948
Yes, you could... you'll please me

470
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,360
Greeks like to push you sometimes

471
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,189
Do they?

472
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,125
He was nice

473
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,822
He gave me the shawl

474
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,125
He refused to receive anything

475
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,598
for the sunglasses either

476
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,160
Hey...

477
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:26,934
Chou...

478
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:27,696
Chou...

479
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:29,432
You're coming to the party tonight?

480
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,370
I don't know yet

481
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,965
Come on... I'll teach you to dance Sasaki

482
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,475
We'll think about it

483
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,947
I don't think you'll push for tonight...

484
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,214
do you?

485
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:51,552
What about if I turn on

486
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,391
and like the guy, can I?

487
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,000
Let's put more tomorrow than

488
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,730
what we get today

489
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,479
What you do you'll make yourself

490
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,053
a table each guy you get off with

491
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,213
Hm?

492
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,885
Let me hear one

493
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,550
...they all get crazy as they get...

494
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,419
Your mind so crazy...

495
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,197
No... I don't really say you're

496
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,457
May I really get confused...

497
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:30,898
I think you're just nuts

498
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,263
Huh?

499
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,107
You plan on wearing this shawl

500
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,403
for the Greek tonight?

501
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,171
If it's good, why not?

502
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,118
Tom...

503
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,913
Tom, come here... quick

504
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:55,116
Oh...

505
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,394
Look, one hand...

506
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,224
you've got yourself a sailor

507
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,176
Hey, come and dance

508
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:55,114
Oh, sure

509
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,947
Come on... let's try it

510
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,384
No... I'm not up to it

511
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,784
In that case, you just have a look

512
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,967
Huh, what do you know?

513
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,469
Hey, man... you look

514
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,170
Son of a bitch... it's her

515
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,205
We'll give that bitch a lesson

516
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,471
Later on

517
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,956
You had enough of that stuff

518
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,755
Is it? I'll have it all

519
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,298
Oh, come on... I'm bored

520
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,091
Let's dance

521
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,633
I'm none of this... so, let's split, okay?

522
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:19,463
Let's dance

523
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,433
I'll cut it out

524
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,595
Alright, we have 2 ways

525
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,768
So I see... she gave you the finger too

526
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,740
So what?

527
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:01,867
She really gets it, doesn't she?

528
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,240
She has the life gun

529
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,471
Her body drives you against the wall...
right?

530
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,743
You can't say she's worth 3,000 ranus
that much...

531
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:08,852
a little thief

532
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:09,917
Yeah...

533
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,146
Still it all depends

534
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,482
It's not much that gets from the pro

535
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,022
A hot lass can supply

536
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,682
Get under... she knows the angles...

537
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,285
just like pilling

538
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,887
Excuse me

539
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:35,945
She left

540
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,942
Where did she go?

541
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:37,843
They told me the activity

542
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:39,573
They went to love together

543
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,048
You know what that means

544
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:42,277
No... thanks

545
00:53:58,202 --> 00:53:59,294
All life is love...

546
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,437
all life is to be loved

547
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,265
Without love, that's death

548
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,930
We must take love when it's here

549
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:04,937
No

550
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:05,906
Love is all

551
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,203
No

552
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,345
Here... get hold of this to your pals

553
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,575
What do you mean?

554
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:50,779
3,000 ranus is too much for one

555
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,149
What's this 3,000 ranus?

556
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:53,484
Don't play damn with me

557
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,556
You know what I mean, baby

558
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,057
That's what you call the butcher...
right?

559
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,922
That's it

560
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,780
Hi

561
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,317
Won't you drink one more?

562
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:05,460
Why not?

563
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:46,918
I'm glad you come back

564
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,858
I haven't stopped thinking of you

565
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,996
Why you keep staring at me?

566
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,998
Tom... kiss me

567
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,027
Don't you want to?

568
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,630
Let's go

569
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,972
What kind a game you play with me?

570
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,674
It's not a game... I'm in love with you

571
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:15,512
But I don't want you to get the wrong
idea of me

572
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,778
Do you understand?

573
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,682
No

574
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:20,187
Tom... I have problems

575
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:21,382
Such as?

576
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,354
Myself

577
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:23,618
I figure that

578
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,962
You really don't understand, do you?

579
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,826
You don't understand anything about me

580
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:29,863
No

581
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,297
I'm not what you think

582
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,169
You went to bed with the Greek...
didn't you?

583
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,065
Yes... yes, I did

584
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:40,901
Why did you come back?

585
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,473
I don't know

586
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,637
Why can't you accept me the way I am?

587
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,680
I don't even know who you are

588
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,545
Neither do I

589
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,050
I'm trying to find that out

590
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:53,020
But, in any case, I'm not
what you're thinking, Tom

591
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,790
You still haven't kissed me...
don't you want to?

592
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,088
What I got to lose?

593
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,163
Tom, what do you want?

594
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,509
I'm telling you the truth

595
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:24,779
You know I'm supposed to be in Munich

596
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,821
But I'm here in the beach as my world

597
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,788
How does a Greek beach get to be
a world?

598
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,688
I'm with you as a world

599
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,687
What's so interesting in me?

600
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,024
I like how you think... your body...

601
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,065
your action

602
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,260
And you're crazy when you get mad

603
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,632
that makes me look so miserable

604
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:42,795
Was I wrong to leave?

605
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:43,837
Well, you should

606
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,133
Something is growing to love?

607
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,468
Maybe not

608
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:52,078
Take your blouse off

609
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,147
What?

610
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,715
Take it off

611
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:15,165
Anything wrong?

612
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,636
You won't rather do it for me?

613
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,376
Now what?

614
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,570
Touch your breasts

615
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:25,544
But why?

616
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,910
Because I ask you

617
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,817
You mean like this?

618
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:31,614
Caress them

619
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,086
It's your first time, isn't it?

620
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,420
I should not... why?

621
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,860
Now tell me how you feel

622
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,329
Warm... good

623
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,366
Take the nipples in your fingers

624
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:50,898
That exacts you?

625
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:51,871
Yes

626
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,369
I suppose you often get up like that

627
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,105
Yes, sometimes

628
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:15,896
Tom... kiss me

629
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:16,929
No... not yet

630
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:18,260
Why?

631
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:19,426
That'll turn you on?

632
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,676
You do this for others too?

633
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:36,911
What others?

634
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,247
The ones you sleep with

635
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,718
What do you mean?

636
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,784
The trick you toured with the Greek
dancer

637
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,486
I'm a whore you think?

638
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,192
I go for August

639
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:47,387
Why you buck me?

640
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,429
I don't have to do this thing

641
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,192
So ask me... I don't have any secrets

642
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,164
So mind your own business

643
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,893
You can treat yourself like a hocker

644
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,367
if you need a pro and get one

645
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,333
Get dressed... I'm taking you back

646
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:58,464
Oh, don't go into trouble...
you're so busy

647
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:03,076
Tom, what's your telephone number?

648
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,942
You'll find me in the phone book

649
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,382
Tom, you're a fool

650
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,747
It's finished... Tom is gone

651
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:13,613
Goodbye, my heart

652
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:15,520
It's too good to that

653
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:18,093
So, here I'm on my own again

654
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:21,527
Hurt so much doesn't help the pride

655
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:25,124
The day I stayed with Tom was like
a dream...

656
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,826
on the island... on the boat

657
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,871
He was so kind... so gentle

658
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,341
No man ever gave me so much pleasure

659
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,738
I'm a fool

660
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,210
I should go and find him...
and ask for his forgiveness

661
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:44,014
But I have my pride... bastard

662
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,558
Why did he do it?

663
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:52,923
It's hard to believe

664
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,856
I shouldn't let him hear this tape
I made

665
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,297
...this is the most sacred shrine
in Greece...

666
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,765
ancient zero...

667
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,861
I think he' d have understood me better

668
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:05,269
It now turns out to be that I set him
in my trap

669
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,875
...the ancient theatre of liberty...

670
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,533
Here on my left is Yagora architecture

671
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,270
remarkably well preserved...

672
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:11,846
one of the warmest ancient

673
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,950
Greek life before Christ...

674
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:14,947
Come on...

675
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,644
Well, few days and nights I'll be okay

676
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,379
Over 3,000 years everywhere

677
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,784
you've seen the whole island were...

678
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:22,482
Good, face this way please

679
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:26,889
...the love story inevitably turns out

680
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,292
to be 'Never On Sunday'...

681
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,296
At least it was fun on the last day

682
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,833
None would go banana in that regard

683
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,266
Once more... flat... wider...

684
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:35,735
that's your profile

685
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,570
There we got it... hold it... just like that

686
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,746
Once more... yeah... that's great

687
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:50,214
Would I buck you if I watch?

688
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,687
Huh?

689
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,022
My name is Beatrice

690
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,555
Hi... Bernie

691
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,128
Hey, what's the matter with you?

692
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,026
I thought we were here for work

693
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,394
You shut up... it's finished

694
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,058
Roy, tell her...
change her clothes please

695
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,839
I get trouble... you know that

696
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:16,843
No shit

697
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,674
I've been dumped by a guy I love

698
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:19,804
I'm looking for a good way out

699
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,141
He's practically a straight guy...

700
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:23,252
but now I hate him

701
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,045
Why?

702
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:24,915
What did you do?

703
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:26,654
Who with?

704
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:29,724
With a Greek guy... I made love to him

705
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,451
But it's to prove that Tom wasn't real

706
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:32,560
and I wasn't wrong

707
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,591
Did I shock you?

708
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,231
Oh, no... surely

709
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,765
And you... never been in love with you?

710
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,237
How would you like to work with me?

711
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,703
Sure, I might like that

712
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,072
Will you present nude?

713
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:48,939
Huh?

714
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,545
You're shy, aren't you?

715
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,410
I'm not shy at all

716
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,458
You like it?

717
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,560
Do you mind if I stay with you...

718
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:11,929
I work for free

719
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,399
Tom took all the money when he left and
I'm broke

720
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,469
Do as you like

721
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:16,833
But I'm warning... it's a hard day

722
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,098
That'll be okay

723
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,368
He has got a sister

724
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,671
His sister works on the states
of the hotel

725
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,438
That means we won't get pay expenses

726
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,979
What you're doing is already overpaid

727
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,241
Thanks a lot

728
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,808
That's good... only relax... relax a little

729
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,147
Okay, Beatrice

730
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,755
You too, Amanda...
try and lie on your thigh

731
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,882
Good... now move closer together

732
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,654
Yeah, just like that, right... very good

733
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,954
Now, I'll get some close-ups

734
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:41,155
Oh...

735
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,095
Hold it...

736
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,425
Get your hair up, Amanda...

737
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,764
get up... good

738
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,735
Play the pose... good

739
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,401
You know it's marvelous

740
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:54,339
with the photographer

741
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,443
You think so?

742
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,671
He's a little too topsy with almighty

743
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:58,745
You think so?

744
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,075
Good... not that all

745
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,081
We'll get few more shots in the water...
come on

746
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,219
You don't like cameraman, is that it's?

747
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,548
I do really, I mean it

748
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,656
And I'll follow you

749
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,583
He's pathetic

750
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,526
Okay now... Amanda, turn to the side

751
01:07:12,662 --> 01:07:14,391
and Beatrice, you turn to a full profile

752
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,065
You mean a real flap?

753
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,294
He's as quick as a treat of a duck

754
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,393
He should get it up as it should

755
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,438
Beatrice, return your back to me... right

756
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:26,236
Alright... that's it for the day

757
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,673
Take a swim or something

758
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,368
You can get sick of the damn sun

759
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,241
Save your expenses... you don't need soap

760
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,842
No man can complete for a second

761
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,780
You want to turn him on?

762
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:36,715
If you're willing...

763
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,809
So am I

764
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:51,691
Do you think he's watching us?

765
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,720
Hm...

766
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:00,160
Come on

767
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,946
I got the impression he's ready

768
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,813
I won't be surprised

769
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,516
I won't really think she can make it

770
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,991
Hold me tight

771
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,752
No way she'll make it

772
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:08,955
No way

773
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,032
You know what you really want?

774
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,037
First is this Tom... then is the Greek

775
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,441
Could be a lesbian

776
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,477
I'm disappointed it's normal

777
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,482
What I want is love

778
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:30,574
However, I can make it

779
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,584
You really think you can make it
with her, don't you?

780
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:34,985
Why not?

781
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,059
You seem available by now

782
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:39,361
May I?

783
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,749
What?

784
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,611
Let me go

785
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:14,484
Good...

786
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,614
Good fight...

787
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:21,663
Stop it...

788
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,827
Lousy creep...

789
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,472
The only way he gets it up is by the
flash light

790
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,236
Tom was straight... I'm a real bummer

791
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:36,975
Where is Tom?

792
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,443
He shouldn't have gone

793
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,775
You're the only one

794
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,008
Who does it for me?

795
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:44,945
What I do is this stupid thing
like that to be stolen

796
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,314
But I guess I have to

797
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:52,321
Why I just call this island off?

798
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,806
Thank you

799
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:24,655
Good morning

800
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,421
I need a room with secret bath

801
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,223
or a large suite

802
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,396
Does it say anything?

803
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,440
It does to me, Miss

804
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,374
I send the room boy immediately

805
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,675
Don't bother... I have just one bag

806
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:37,094
Good morning

807
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:37,925
Good morning

808
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,022
Is this free?

809
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,966
Yes, have a seat

810
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:43,336
A Teguila please

811
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,803
I believe we've met... Martin Muler

812
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,942
Can I buy you a drink?

813
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,609
Buy what you want with I included...
of course

814
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,819
You're on vacation?

815
01:15:58,988 --> 01:15:59,920
Yes

816
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,046
May I ask where you're from?

817
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:01,984
Surek.

818
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:04,551
Where are you from?

819
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,524
Constanibal

820
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:06,390
Constanibal?

821
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:07,496
You mean Istanbul?

822
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,186
Istanbul is in Turkey

823
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:11,424
which is for the crusade

824
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,402
$6? 09

825
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:39,252
You alone?

826
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:42,694
Yes... I'm here on my vacation

827
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,130
I like foreign surprises

828
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:48,095
You must be roasted with this shoot up

829
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,798
How do you like this dress?

830
01:16:58,147 --> 01:16:59,739
Yes, it's very sexy

831
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:01,942
Of course, you like it...
shoot up my boot, right?

832
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,848
It's beautiful...

833
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,420
obviously your busts
covered inside like that

834
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:08,217
Round and full... you want to try them?

835
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,654
What?

836
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:10,588
You mean here?

837
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,887
The bartender doesn't mind, does he?

838
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:17,823
But...

839
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,366
How about your room then?

840
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,868
You really got balls

841
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,259
Help me...

842
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:45,251
Help me please

843
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,019
What's the matter?

844
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,390
Shut the door... quick

845
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:48,627
He's a criminal

846
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,026
The creep is a criminal?

847
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,224
Rapist or anything... he's a monster

848
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:53,868
I'll take care of that son of a bitch

849
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:54,764
Lady, you just watch this

850
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:55,636
What?

851
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:56,769
She's my girl

852
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,241
You've made him just good

853
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:16,650
Come on, baby

854
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:17,622
Let me deal with you

855
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,990
Nobody will help you get away with it

856
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:21,186
Get in there

857
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:28,897
Strip it off

858
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,448
Let's dance first

859
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,018
Hurray...

860
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,019
What's this?

861
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,181
Don't expect the last tango

862
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:23,280
can play me trick

863
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,987
Take it off

864
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,535
Any visitor?

865
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:42,877
You ask room service?

866
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:45,036
Yes, bring us some champagne...
3 bottles please

867
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,010
Very well

868
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,208
Enjoy yourself, Martin

869
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,248
Goddamn bitch

870
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:54,479
Ask for Muler

871
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:59,788
if you want a good fuck

872
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:29,750
Excuse me...

873
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:32,292
Can you tell me what room
Mr? Muler resides?

874
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,053
Room 112

875
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,096
Thank you very much

876
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:43,529
Keep the change... bye

877
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,334
I didn't order 3 bottles

878
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,340
But you were here when ordered
by the lady

879
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:50,105
Let her pay for them...
and get out of here

880
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,371
Oh, no...

881
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:52,741
We're going to need the champagne

882
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,008
Leave them here, my dear...
and go along

883
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,550
Go along... what's it?

884
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:02,822
So you're Mr? Muler

885
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:08,554
Oh, I've been waiting so long for you

886
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:27,380
Hi, there

887
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,047
Hello, princess...

888
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:30,575
How have you been?

889
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,414
Not bad... nice to see you

890
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:33,977
Where's your love life?

891
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,123
Which love life?

892
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:36,286
Mousie

893
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:37,153
Oh, Mousie...

894
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,452
She got picked up an hour ago

895
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:39,492
by a Rolls Royce

896
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:40,458
Are you sad?

897
01:21:40,596 --> 01:21:41,221
Sad?

898
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,830
We had a moment... no complaint

899
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:44,855
How about yourself?

900
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,601
Have you met the man you like?

901
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,262
Love turned out to be a bummer

902
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:58,202
Why aren't you with him?

903
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,979
He's a jerk

904
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:00,877
So what?

905
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:01,879
You love a jerk?

906
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:03,375
Yes, I do

907
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:04,645
What are you waiting for then?

908
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,413
Go find him and be happy

909
01:22:06,822 --> 01:22:07,686
It makes sense

910
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,750
Let's jump in

911
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,187
You won't be here forever

912
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:12,817
I'll show you how it's done

913
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,195
Chou

914
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:30,905
Chou

915
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:43,619
Hello... just call me Pat

916
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,062
Don't mind me... finish what you're doing

917
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:54,960
You really know

918
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,298
how to make yourself at home, don't you?

919
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:57,403
I don't really mind

920
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:58,563
Why don't you fill me in?

921
01:22:58,941 --> 01:22:59,737
I told you when I'm in...

922
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:00,671
my name is Patricia

923
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:01,935
Where is Tom?

924
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,135
You're a friend?

925
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,643
I mean he knows you?

926
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,543
I'm his fiance... he should know me

927
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:07,580
Fiance?

928
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:10,711
His room mate is in the back there...

929
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:12,480
but he's tied up right now

930
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:14,317
I'll see to that... no problem

931
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:45,781
Go right ahead

932
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:47,647
You know her?

933
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,723
I'm not interrupting anything, I hope

934
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,291
Do you mind waiting me outside?

935
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:52,417
I love to...

936
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,687
just call me until you finish

937
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:07,665
Are you Sakia?

938
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:08,868
Call me Manico

939
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,740
So, did you find what you want?

940
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:12,071
And more...

941
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:13,681
Can I take a bath?

942
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:14,782
Sure, why not?

943
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,247
There's a bathroom upstairs

944
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,444
Don't put too much oil, Manico

945
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,514
Anything else?

946
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:22,089
For the moment that'll be all

947
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,756
Hi, there...

948
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,960
Do I know you?

949
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,759
Why you ask silly question?

950
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,530
Did you hear me ask who you're?

951
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:37,570
No, but...

952
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:39,334
Is it okay if I share the water?

953
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:40,167
What?

954
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:41,036
Do you mind?

955
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:42,868
No

956
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,652
Who is the girl?

957
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:53,378
Huh?

958
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,247
The girl in his bed

959
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,186
What girl in what bed?

960
01:24:56,325 --> 01:24:57,451
The bitch with Tom

961
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,993
His girl friend... you know Tom?

962
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:01,222
I should... I do

963
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:03,024
I'm his fiance

964
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:16,077
It's good

965
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,546
Will you pass me the soap?

966
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:23,043
Thanks

967
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:26,245
Have been together very long?

968
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,149
Who?

969
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:29,153
Tom and the girl he had in bed

970
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:31,121
Half a month, I guess

971
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,658
It's not real then

972
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,261
I understand how you feel

973
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:35,863
I don't think that matters much

974
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:37,295
Don't you care him with other girl?

975
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,360
You want to wash my back?

976
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,696
Okay

977
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,604
Be careful when you wash my bottom...

978
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,007
it's fragile

979
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:55,247
Oh, come on...

980
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,748
Wash... I don't feel a thing

981
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:00,018
I hope...

982
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,020
Let me show you... turn around

983
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:10,327
The bottom... now how do you feel?

984
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:11,564
Nice

985
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:13,325
Next of kin turns on, right?

986
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,491
Shall I do the front?

987
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:15,364
Really?

988
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,630
You think I play you off?

989
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:18,899
Turn around... you're not afraid?

990
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,736
Gosh, no... allow me... only not used to

991
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,471
Oh, so tiny...

992
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,771
Is this something you always laugh at?

993
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,779
No, we can fix that

994
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:31,847
Why should I have to leave
for that bitch?

995
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:33,852
Don't give me a hard time

996
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,653
We haven't finished...

997
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:36,849
What are you doing?

998
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:38,556
Don't go away

999
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:43,359
Is that all it is?

1000
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,056
We have a problem now

1001
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:46,393
You got to hang on with it...

1002
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,901
or try it yourself... bye

1003
01:26:54,109 --> 01:26:56,168
Did Tom split too?

1004
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,545
Answer me... did Tom split it gone?

1005
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,182
Well, what's the marvel...
you've been funny

1006
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,253
Why you ask a silly question?

1007
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:13,154
I hope she didn't go mad

1008
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,155
She surely did

1009
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,560
Would you console her?

1010
01:27:17,766 --> 01:27:19,165
Huh?

1011
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,674
Glad to see me?

1012
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:33,741
What do you think?

1013
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,578
Why did you leave me alone so long?

1014
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,152
You were not exactly alone

1015
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,653
Getting company is nothing to me...

1016
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,883
only one time... like you

1017
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:46,187
Is one girl enough for you?

1018
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:48,193
It depends who she is

1019
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:49,930
Stupid

1020
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,904
Man, why didn't you pick her up?

1021
01:27:57,839 --> 01:27:58,931
Either

1022
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:00,768
Oh, I need a drink

1023
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,536
I doubt if you need more than that

1024
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,334
Why you return?

1025
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:31,938
Well, maybe I felt like you

1026
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,740
If I were in love,

1027
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,172
I' d send roses

1028
01:28:35,377 --> 01:28:36,867
I have a lot to learn

1029
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:38,072
Start now

1030
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:39,043
There's a rose on the table

1031
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,477
That's for you

1032
01:28:45,387 --> 01:28:48,151
For you is white... it tells you something

1033
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,087
It tells me I've been stupid

1034
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:55,087
You're right... only no more than I

1035
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,997
So, what now?

1036
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,330
So, you don't know?

1037
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:07,634
You're all that I want

1038
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,147
I'm so happy back with you, Tom

1039
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,187
We can do it another time

1040
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:30,060
We should be together, right?

1041
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
