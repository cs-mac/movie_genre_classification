1
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:39,641
- Hey, you. Keep moving.
- Which way, officer?

2
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:42,544
- I should worry which way, keep moving.
- But which way?

3
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:45,481
You figure that out for
yourself, just keep moving.

4
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,781
"Just keep moving." Hospitality
at the end of a nightstick.

5
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:52,551
In or out, come or go. Who cares? Nobody.

6
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:55,161
There's no welcome sign out in New York.

7
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,629
You get off a freight train and the railroad
bulls slap you around just for the exercise.

8
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,100
Every day, the big parade
comes in, shaking their fists...

9
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,863
...but nobody gives them a welcome.

10
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,098
All you get is a stop signal at every corner.

11
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:10,335
Hey, daffy, didn't I just
tell you to keep moving?

12
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,775
Officer, I'm city-struck.

13
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:15,478
This is my breakfast,
talking up to the big town.

14
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:19,947
Look at it. Seven million people,
fighting, biting, clawing away...

15
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:23,056
...to get one foot on a ladder
that'll take them to a penthouse.

16
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:26,284
Yes, siree. They come by the
thousands, every which way.

17
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,453
<i>By water, by wheel, by foot,
by ferry, by tunnel, by tube.</i>

18
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,292
<i>Over, across and under the river.</i>

19
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,832
<i>They come like locusts,
from all over the nation.</i>

20
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:38,369
<i>From every nation on the
globe. Seven million people.</i>

21
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,097
<i>New York is like a snake.</i>

22
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:43,471
<i>Strike the head in Queens and
the tail waves in Staten Island.</i>

23
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:47,205
<i>Rattle a milk can in the Bronx and
a corpse turns over in Brooklyn.</i>

24
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,748
Seven million people, divided
by a river and joined by bridges.

25
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:53,819
Go from the subway to the
sky in 10 seconds flat.

26
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,889
Make a million. Make a
penny. That's New York.

27
00:02:57,058 --> 00:03:00,459
And I know this town, brother.
Because I got clothes on my back.

28
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,119
But before I turn you
in, you better get moving.

29
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:05,458
I heard you, officer,
and I wanna keep moving.

30
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,966
- I still can't figure out which way.
- You better figure out which way...

31
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:11,297
...or I'll give you a
taste of this. Now, go on.

32
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:12,564
You coming with me?

33
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:37,030
Hey. Just a minute, young fella.

34
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:40,031
- I didn't do nothing.
- Well, we'll discuss that later.

35
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,692
- What's your name?
- Googi, Googi Sabatini.

36
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,134
Well, Googi, you mustn't steal bread.

37
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:48,503
You can steal boats, you can snitch
nickels or shake down trousers...

38
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,234
...but you mustn't steal bread.

39
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,878
But I'm hungry.

40
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:54,173
Who isn't in this town?
Come on, give it to me.

41
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:57,044
Hand it over. Come on, come on. Hurry up.

42
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:03,757
And remember, Googi, if you must steal
bread in New York, don't get caught.

43
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,730
Only one cent, two cent, three cent.

44
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,511
What a town. Right out of
the asphalt flower's grove.

45
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:31,481
That's Peggy, Danny's girl.

46
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:33,779
- And who's Danny?
- That's me.

47
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,188
Attaboy, Danny.

48
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,995
Use your right, Danny! Hit him in the discus!

49
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,833
- Don't get so excited, son. He'll win.
- You're doggone right, he'll win.

50
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:59,041
- Attaboy, Danny!
- Scram!

51
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,781
The winner.

52
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:05,618
Danny, I now dub you
knight of the Round Table.

53
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:08,346
King Arthur was no braver
in defense of his fair lady.

54
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:12,925
Sure, I'm taking Peggy's part and
I always will because she's my girl.

55
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,990
- Peggy couldn't have a better protector.
- You said it.

56
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:19,997
- You hurting much, Peggy?
- No, it's nothing. Thanks, Danny.

57
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,032
- You know what, Peggy?
- Yes, Danny?

58
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,330
- You dance good.
- You fight good.

59
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,170
Come on, Danny, let's
finish this game. Hurry up.

60
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:33,939
Eddie, your brother wants you to come
on over. We're gonna play Kick the Can.

61
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,811
- Tell Danny I can't. I gotta practice.
- You give me a pain.

62
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:39,350
Every time we need you,
why, you gotta practice.

63
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,613
Well, I can't give it
up. I'm teaching myself.

64
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,882
You know, someday I'm gonna get a piano.

65
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,047
Heck, a piano!

66
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:51,389
Yes, siree, brother. The air
of New York smells of ambition.

67
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:53,795
Blessed is he who goes after what he wants.

68
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:57,995
Every man climbs over the backs of
the others, swinging his spiked club.

69
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:03,132
Fighting, dancing, playing away.
Up from the gutters, into the sun.

70
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:07,607
And yet, if you look close,
there's love in the city.

71
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:09,306
And there's hope in the city too.

72
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:11,974
The pavements may be hard
and the tenements high...

73
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:15,748
...but that won't stop these children.
Googi may steal his way through life.

74
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:20,326
Peggy, well, you've seen her dance. Her
nimble feet will carry her to the heights.

75
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:24,157
And Danny will fight his way
through with his bare fists.

76
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,530
- Lay off those peanuts.
- They're good for your nerves.

77
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,041
- They're bad for the figure.
- I never worried about me figure. Want one?

78
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:41,813
Get through with that bag,
Danny. Callahan's here.

79
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:44,212
- That Kid Callahan?
- Yeah. Up from the West Side.

80
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,410
Just knocked out Tony Mazzini. Remember Tony?

81
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:50,216
- When he busted his thumb on your head?
- Tony was tough. This guy must be good.

82
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:53,758
Yeah. You could be good
too, only you don't wanna.

83
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,361
Hey, look out there, will you?

84
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,023
- Hi, Kid. You sure gave Tony the flatiron.
- He was a pushover. He ain't seen nothing.

85
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,601
- Hey, Kid, when's your next settle?
- Don't ask me.

86
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,433
- Just sit tight, boys. Leave it to Goldie.
- Hurry up. Get through with the bag.

87
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:10,008
- I'll be through when you're dressed.
- You'll be through when I'm dressed?

88
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,838
You're through right now. Scram.

89
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,946
You big lug. You think you own the joint?

90
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,345
Danny could knock your
block off with one hand.

91
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:18,849
- Beat it, dope, beat it.
- Keep your mitts off him.

92
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,249
A wise, guy, huh?

93
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:26,490
- What's the big idea, you jerk?
- He started it. He slapped him with the bag.

94
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,890
Let me at that guy. Let
me at him. Let me at him.

95
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,861
Break it up. This ain't the
ring. What's eating you guys?

96
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:35,160
Listen, jerk. The next time I see
you, you're gonna wish you hadn't.

97
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:36,564
Save it for the ring, Kid.

98
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,501
Look, Goldie, cool off that
buzz saw of yours, will you?

99
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,164
Say, Kenny, stick around.
I wanna talk to you.

100
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:44,504
Don't worry, Pinky. We'll be there.

101
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:48,576
Listen, Samson. It's a chance in a million.
A main prelim, and you ain't taking...

102
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:50,842
Skip it, Pinky. You're wasting your time.

103
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:54,476
I come down here for a little exercise
and you try to pull me into a fight.

104
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,749
Danny, 100 bucks. A hundred.
And I can handle your corner.

105
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:59,984
Better handle that truck back to the garage.

106
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,459
- Look, Danny...
- Stop hopping me up, you ringworm.

107
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,224
Danny, you can knock most of
these guys around here cold.

108
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,629
- Why would I do that?
- A hundred bucks, Danny.

109
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:12,261
Lemonade, chocolate! Five cents! Five cents!

110
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,567
Get out of here. Get out of
here. Get out of here. Five cents!

111
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:19,144
<i>Going into the third round, Primo
Carnera, world's heavyweight champion...</i>

112
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:20,780
<i>... and challenger Maxie Baer.</i>

113
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:23,143
<i>California jabs with his left. One, two.</i>

114
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:26,047
<i>Now a right hook. Carnera
staggers. He's going down.</i>

115
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:30,121
- Looks like it's in the bag for Maxie.
- That's the cold packs for that big baloney.

116
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:35,919
<i>His share of the gate tonight is
estimated at a minimum of $ 100,000 cash.</i>

117
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,065
You hear that, Danny, $
100,000. That's for one fight.

118
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,564
What are you crying about now?

119
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:44,761
I won't be a truck driver's assistant forever.
I got ambitions. I'm gonna be somebody.

120
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,339
<i>Baer stabs two to the jaw,
a hard right to the heart.</i>

121
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,170
<i>Carnera tries to hold on,
a desperately groggy champ.</i>

122
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,244
I got four bits bet and I'm gonna collect.

123
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,175
He's my boy. I don't care
what you think of him.

124
00:08:55,349 --> 00:09:00,412
He's all right, and I still have
3-1 to bet on Jess Willard to win.

125
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,178
Hey, Danny, there's Peggy.

126
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,585
- Hello, Peg.
- Hello, Danny.

127
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,851
I'll walk you over, huh?

128
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,393
- Don't you want to listen?
- I heard enough.

129
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:13,226
- Where you been, dancing again?
- Learned a lot of new steps today.

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,164
You'll wear yourself out if
you keep dancing without supper.

131
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:19,966
- I'd much rather dance than eat any day.
- I know that.

132
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,807
Boy, was it crowded tonight on the subway.

133
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:26,811
Talk about sardines. They got it easy.
At least they're floating in olive oil.

134
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,279
Look, Peggy, I'm making 27.50 a week now.

135
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,418
This time next year, we could be all set...

136
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:34,611
Always whispering, you two.
Carrying on. Sneaking in the hallway.

137
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:37,985
I won't stand for it, Danny Kenny.
We're a respectable family, we are.

138
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:40,626
If you wanna marry my Peggy,
you come into the parlor.

139
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:43,661
- Who's talking about marrying, Ma?
- Don't give me that sass.

140
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:46,391
My daughter talking to me
like that after all I've done.

141
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,263
Mrs. Nash, we're just sitting
here talking like always.

142
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:52,701
Talking. Whispering behind my back.
Afraid I'll hear you in the parlor.

143
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:56,468
There is no parlor. Just a kitchen and
a bedroom, if you wanna call them that.

144
00:09:56,644 --> 00:10:00,410
What's the use? See you later, Danny.
Come on in, Ma, and please stop worrying.

145
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:03,049
I swore my daughter would
never go through what I did.

146
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:06,846
Skimping and saving, penny by penny, and
losing it all and starving ever since.

147
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:18,826
All right, Sydney, that'll be all. Practice
those scales an hour a day at least.

148
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:22,025
Here's a dollar. Mama said you
should give me change. Fifty cents.

149
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,170
What about the two dollars from last month?

150
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,603
- Mama said it should be just on account.
- Say, Danny, got any change?

151
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,743
- How much you need?
- Half a buck.

152
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,605
There it is.

153
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,680
- Give this to Mama with my compliments.
- Okay.

154
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:37,840
Oh, yeah. And Mama says when you
gonna give me a piece to learn?

155
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,418
She says to tell you she
likes "The Blue Danube."

156
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,315
So do I. That's why you're
not gonna play it yet, Sydney.

157
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:46,120
Okay.

158
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:50,627
I don't know why I keep giving that kid
lessons. He throws the piano out of tune.

159
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:53,323
You get it from Sydney. I
get it from the traffic cops.

160
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,697
- How's your music
coming, Eddie? - So-so.

161
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,299
Look, Danny.

162
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:01,805
I wanted to ask you if there's a
chance of getting a job with your boss.

163
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,602
- For who?
- Me.

164
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,142
- You?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:07,906
- Driving a truck?
- Or a helper, till I got a license.

166
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:10,778
Are you nuts? Another year,
you'll be through music school.

167
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:14,249
- I'm through right now.
- What?

168
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:17,185
- What about your scholarship?
- Yeah, they cut it in half.

169
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,622
- Gotta pay the rest in cash.
- What happened?

170
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:23,854
Like everything else, donations
slowing up, so they cut expenses.

171
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:28,199
It's no use, Danny. I've got
to start making my own way.

172
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,894
But when will you find time
to work on your own music?

173
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,632
- I'll find it sometime at night.
- You'll be all worn out.

174
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:38,608
Besides, you might even hurt your hands
shoving those cases around on the truck.

175
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,481
- How much you gonna need for that school?
- Hundred and fifty bucks.

176
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,677
- And it might just as well be 150,000.
- Look here, Eddie.

177
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,016
I don't wanna hear any more talk like that.

178
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,750
- You're gonna finish up.
- Well, I wanna finish, Danny...

179
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,723
...and I wanna finish my own music too.

180
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,988
You know I've been
working on it every minute.

181
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,600
Here, look. I've even
got a new idea on it now.

182
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,831
To make it into a symphony of New York.

183
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:05,801
The song of the magic
isle, a city for conquest.

184
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:09,033
A full symphony of it, with all
its proud, passionate beauty...

185
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,406
...and all of its sordid ugliness
and of its great wealth and power...

186
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:13,944
...and its everlasting hunger.

187
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,878
And of its teeming seven millions
and its barren loneliness.

188
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,713
Here, listen, Danny. It starts
with that part that you like.

189
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,683
That part that I call "The East River"...

190
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:27,725
...with the rumbling el over Allen
Street with its crowded gutters and slums.

191
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:32,958
With all of its mounting, shrieking jungle
- cries for life and sun.

192
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:36,796
And then carrying on the theme
up to the towering skyscrapers...

193
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,235
...and the story of all those who
tried to scale their dizzy heights...

194
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:45,709
...but crash, frustrated and
broken, to the concrete pavements.

195
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,975
And then of those few who
finally reach the top...

196
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,554
...only to find out that above them
are still the unattainable stars.

197
00:12:56,824 --> 00:13:01,887
Gee, Eddie, you have ideas like that
and you're talking about driving a truck?

198
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:04,928
Play me that first part
again. The part I like.

199
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:06,497
Sure.

200
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:12,872
- Maxie knocked him out in the 11 th.
- Quiet.

201
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,009
- What's the matter?
- Tell Pinky that fight with Callahan is okay.

202
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:18,508
- No kidding, Danny?
- Have you got no ear for music?

203
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,011
- Sure, I can hear it.
- All right.

204
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:37,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
next bout of the evening.

205
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:43,966
At 146 pounds, the West
Side Terror, Kid Callahan.

206
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:50,104
And in this corner, at
144 and a half pounds...

207
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:53,542
...the former Golden Gloves
winner, Danny Kenny...

208
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:57,514
...entering the professional
ring as "Young Samson."

209
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,117
Take a bow, Danny.

210
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:03,188
- Where'd you get that moniker, Samson?
- The Bible. Wanna make something of it?

211
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:04,984
Hey, Danny, it's a cinch!

212
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,256
- Looks like a West Side turnout.
- Yeah.

213
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:08,951
Keep your left in his schnozzola.

214
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,962
When you see an opening, give
him the old one-two. Good luck.

215
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,726
Folks, I just wanna say that
these boys better be good...

216
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:18,861
...as we're honored to have with us tonight
no less than manager Scotty MacPherson...

217
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,338
...down from Madison
Bowl. Take a bow, Scotty.

218
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:25,905
Who's the new lad, Pinky?

219
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,741
From the East Side. Won the
Golden Gloves five years back.

220
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,781
First fight since. Nothing much, Scotty.

221
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:41,622
Tell you what I'll do, Scotty, I'll
lay you 20-10 that Callahan wins.

222
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:45,128
I'll tell you what, Bill. Make it a
real bet and I'll lay 2-1 on Samson.

223
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:46,891
- For how much?
- I'll bet 200 to 100.

224
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,796
- You've got a bet.
- Let me in on that.

225
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:51,437
- Okay. Same bet with you.
- Goldie. Goldie.

226
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:55,063
Ain't you even gonna back up your own
champ? Scotty's laying 2-1 on Samson.

227
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,336
It's a pleasure to oblige. Scotty,
I'll take 100 of that easy jack.

228
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:00,002
You're on. Anybody else?

229
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,173
If you're gonna be that generous, I'll
double it. And I don't mind telling you...

230
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:06,615
Hey, what's going on? What's happened?

231
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:08,880
Two, three...

232
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:12,355
...four, five, six...

233
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:16,189
- What's happened?...seven, eight, nine...

234
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,024
...ten.

235
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,993
- You got me into this. I lose a fortune.
- Accident.

236
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,569
Holy smoke. A welterweight
with a sock like Dempsey.

237
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,605
- Who's his manager, Scotty?
- I don't know, but I'll find out.

238
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,835
Listen. I don't usually go after a lad,
but I'd a hunch on you the minute I saw you.

239
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:34,412
I believe I can manage you
right up to the top rung.

240
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:37,379
That's very good to hear, but
I guess I just can't see it.

241
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:39,644
You'd sooner stick to
that truck-driving job?

242
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,380
- Sure. I like it.
- You're very hard to figure out.

243
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:45,491
You've got the makings of a
fighter but you don't like to fight.

244
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,151
I guess that's just it. I don't like
it. I don't know how to explain it...

245
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,263
...but I need a good reason to sock a guy.

246
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,194
A reason? I'll give you a good reason.

247
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,302
I'll guarantee you $500 on
your next card. How's that?

248
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,028
Skip it, Pinky. It's no go.

249
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,106
I've seen pugs who figured they
had it licked. Where are they?

250
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:04,505
Walking around on their heels,
punchy, all before their time.

251
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:08,444
Here. See that guy back there? Remember him?

252
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,154
Yes, I believe I do. Mickey Miller, isn't it?

253
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,156
- Nobody else. Great fighter, wasn't he?
- He certainly was.

254
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,556
- Mickey, come here.
- Me?

255
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,389
Yeah, you. Come here.

256
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,556
- You got that picture with you?
- Picture? Sure, sure.

257
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:31,966
Sure, I've got my picture.
That's me. That's my picture.

258
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,597
- Remember? Mickey Miller, that's me.
- Very nice, very nice.

259
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,677
- Thanks very much.
- That's all right. A good picture, isn't it?

260
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:41,109
- Yeah.
- I can get in shape again. I can fight.

261
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:44,409
There you are. Mickey
Miller, before and after.

262
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,449
You were right. One chance in a million.

263
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,384
One guy makes the grade. The
rest fall like flies in winter.

264
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:51,581
A million to one odds? That's pretty heavy.

265
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,727
I think I'll stick to driving a
truck. How about some soap, Mutt?

266
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:56,988
Listen. Let me know when
you change your mind.

267
00:16:57,164 --> 00:16:59,997
- My office hours are noon till midnight.
- Thanks very much.

268
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,432
Don't be mad if I don't
show up. How about that soap?

269
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:12,969
- Good music, huh?
- It's beautiful.

270
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,706
I've always wanted to come
here. You like it, don't you?

271
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:18,076
- Sure.
- Danny, why don't you dance faster?

272
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:20,583
- You won't have to do any road work.
- How we doing?

273
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:23,314
She's doing all right, but
you're better in the ring.

274
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,425
Danny. I ought to congratulate
you on the fight. I forgot.

275
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:29,426
- The fight? Sure, the fight.
- It must have been thrilling.

276
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:33,191
All the lights and thousands of people.
I was so excited, I could hardly talk.

277
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:34,628
Yeah, I couldn't hear you.

278
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:37,361
Murray, I'm awfully sorry
about the contest last week...

279
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,937
...but I just couldn't get
out of bed, I was so sick.

280
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,200
I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings, you know.

281
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,276
- You know I wouldn't let you down.
- Let's dance, Lilly.

282
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,413
Gee, I'd love to. Thanks.

283
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,414
Murray, if you'll let me dance
the contest with you tonight...

284
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,142
...you won't be sorry, I promise.

285
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,982
Just give me this one last
chance. Won't you, Murray?

286
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:01,391
- All right, break it up.
- It's all right. She's my girl. We're together.

287
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,892
Don't be so much together.

288
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:05,395
Oh, how's this?

289
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:19,068
- Happy?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

290
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:24,376
Better watch your step, big shot.
That boy with her is Young Samson.

291
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,745
Who's the dame? You know her?

292
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,353
I met them one night at
the dance at the Forsyth.

293
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:31,889
Say, the kid's got something.
I think I'll try her out.

294
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,657
- It's hot.
- Sit down, have a gin freezola and cool off.

295
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:39,196
Peggy, your dancing was awful swell.
She beat everybody else in the hall.

296
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,698
Hello, Peggy. I saw you dancing by.

297
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:44,928
I'd like to introduce Mr. Murray
Burns. Peggy Nash and Danny Kenny.

298
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,232
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Burns.
- Likewise.

299
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,432
I guess you boys have heard about each other.

300
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,942
- Murray's the best this side of 14th St.
- The other side too.

301
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,479
Yes, I know. I've heard a
lot about you, Mr. Burns.

302
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:59,312
Thanks. Say, how about this dance? I
guess you could follow me all right, huh?

303
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,250
- Do you mind, Danny?
- No, go ahead. Enjoy yourself.

304
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,618
Don't worry. I'll see she does.

305
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,589
Thanks, Danny. Just this dance.

306
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:10,229
If you fellas don't mind,
I'll sit this dance out.

307
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:11,830
Sure. Sit down. That's a chair.

308
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:15,490
I certainly can use it. Murray
just about danced my feet off.

309
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:18,365
Here. Knock yourself out.

310
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,440
I don't mind saying, kid, you're
a natural. You sure can spiel.

311
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:25,338
Believe me, I've tripped the
light fantastic with the best.

312
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,605
Thank you, Mr. Burns. I'm nervous now.

313
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:30,807
- I've never before had a partner like you.
- Sure, but that's okay.

314
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,214
You'll get over that nervous feeling.

315
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,447
That's the idea. You'll
follow me like a ghost, kid.

316
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,660
And now, folks, for the
regular Rose Garden contest.

317
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:45,662
To the winners, this beautiful silver loving
- cup.

318
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:49,165
The judges will conduct eliminations
from the bandstand. Please come up.

319
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,928
Will all the palookas and clucks...

320
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:56,064
...kindly save their shoe leather and our
time by sitting this one out? Let's go.

321
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,741
How about it? Wanna try? We'll
show them some real stepping.

322
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,313
That'd be wonderful, but
I ought to ask Danny first.

323
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,279
What's that mug got, a mortgage on you?

324
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:06,578
Just relax, kid, and that cup's in the bag.

325
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:39,514
- Thanks.
- Looks like that snake's got a monopoly.

326
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:42,587
- You gonna let him get away with it?
- She's having a good time.

327
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:45,121
- I don't worry about Peggy.
- You ain't never worry.

328
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,318
Like with MacPherson. You could
be champion, only you don't wanna.

329
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:51,020
- Just to show me.
- I got nothing else to do.

330
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,215
Listen, we're gonna cop this cup, now, see?

331
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:12,146
We'll shake these clucks
off on the next number.

332
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,816
- We're dancing alone.
- We've won?

333
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:21,044
Sure, what'd I tell you? Now
we'll give them some fancy stuff.

334
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,370
- Who's the dame?
- I don't know.

335
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,371
- Some newcomer.
- Not bad.

336
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,238
You got the class, kid.
You got what it takes.

337
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,710
- Do you mean it, Mr. Burns?
- Sure.

338
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:50,008
And I'm the guy that
knows how to bring it out.

339
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,357
Gee, Danny, ain't she great?
I'm certainly proud of her.

340
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,733
I guess I'd better be going.

341
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,568
Murray doesn't like me to sit
out dances with strange men.

342
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,902
- Scram then.
- Danny, look.

343
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,908
- You were great.
- Isn't it beautiful?

344
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,876
Are you sure you want me to keep this?

345
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:23,072
I got a flock of them, one every other night.

346
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,740
Last weekend in a tournament
at Hunts Point Casino.

347
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,979
- I danced that one with Murray.
- Yeah? I thought he danced it alone.

348
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:31,919
I don't believe I can eat
any of this. I'm too excited.

349
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:34,925
Danny, Mr. Burns told me that
I could be a professional.

350
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,423
No reason why not.

351
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:41,090
With a little training, I might be able to
break her in, after I polish the rough spots.

352
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:43,064
She didn't do so bad just now.

353
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,566
Wouldn't you like to join the table?

354
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:50,140
Well, it ain't exactly
my kind of crowd, baby.

355
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,540
Yeah? Too much of a crowd, see?

356
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:54,942
Mutt. Don't let him talk
to Mr. Burns like that.

357
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:56,582
Don't worry, I was going anyway.

358
00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:00,310
Any time you want to drop these mugs,
slip over. I'll give you another spiel.

359
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:03,456
I don't mind you dancing with my
girl. I don't like those cracks.

360
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,648
- Your girl? You let me dance with her?
- Yeah.

361
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:08,123
That's right. You wanna
make something out of it?

362
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,956
What's going on here? Are you
having some trouble, Murray?

363
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:14,430
- I stepped on some personal property here...
- You stepped on something.

364
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:16,026
Danny, stop!

365
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:18,693
- Hey, cut it out.
- Yeah, this place respectable joint.

366
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,308
- Beat it, Danny. Beat it.
- Come on, Peggy. Let's get out of here.

367
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,466
Stand back, everybody. That was an accident.

368
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:28,910
Stand back, now. Come on, Peggy. Get out.
It was an accident, everybody. An accident.

369
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:30,805
I hope you ain't sore.

370
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:34,385
I didn't mind you dancing, but he
tried to make you look like two cents.

371
00:24:34,554 --> 00:24:36,112
I guess he was pretty fresh.

372
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,120
But, Danny, the cup, it's all broken.

373
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,488
- Mutt figured it was your cup or my bean.
- I had a swell time anyway.

374
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,095
- You ain't sore at me, huh?
- Of course not, Danny.

375
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:47,529
That's better. I'll see you tomorrow.

376
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,123
Hello. Hotel Halifax?
Mr. Murray Burns, please.

377
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:17,488
Hello, Mr. Burns? Peggy Nash.

378
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:20,633
No, no, I didn't lose your
number. I kept it in my purse.

379
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,268
I just wanted to tell you
I'm sorry for what happened.

380
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,370
I hope you weren't hurt.

381
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:29,503
Tomorrow night? Why, yes, I think I could.

382
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:33,703
The Irving Place Casino, 10:30. All right.

383
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:50,793
For crying out loud, Danny, take it easy.

384
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:53,364
- Kenny, you're 20 minutes late.
- So what?

385
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,262
- You're holding up the works.
- Sue me.

386
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:58,461
- Okay, Kenny. I'll talk to you later.
- We'll make it up next trip.

387
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:01,334
You know us. I don't know, Danny.

388
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:04,704
I don't know what's the matter
with you lately. You're so nervous.

389
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:06,538
If I sound nervous, I'm nervous.

390
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:09,682
All right. Peggy stands you
up and I get the grief of it.

391
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:12,977
What do you take it for? I wouldn't
take it from the Queen of Sheba.

392
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:14,676
You'd take it and like it.

393
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:17,789
Hey, fellas, do a hurry-up job,
will you? We're 25 minutes late.

394
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:19,857
Hurry it up, will you, guys? Be good guys.

395
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:23,393
- Hey, wise guy. You almost scraped me.
- Cool off, fella.

396
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:26,892
- Danny.
- Mutt, look who's here. Googi.

397
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,466
Gee, and if it ain't the
old mutt face. How are you?

398
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:31,126
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

399
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:33,135
- It's been a long time.
- How you doing?

400
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:35,501
- I just checked in.
- You been away someplace?

401
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:38,439
Yeah, I been a lot of places and no place.

402
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:40,909
Tell you the truth, Danny,
I've been sightseeing.

403
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,538
I spent a year and a day on that sweet
little island they call Blackwells.

404
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,708
Then I took a little trip up the Hudson too.

405
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:48,786
There's a beautiful view up there.

406
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:51,048
I ought to know. I looked
at it for 36 months.

407
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:54,091
- I heard you were doing a stretch.
- I had it coming to me.

408
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,591
I was playing for peanuts.

409
00:26:55,762 --> 00:27:00,062
But from now on I play for high stakes
and with nothing in my pocket either, see?

410
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,792
And I'll chop off the hand of the
first guy that tries to stop me.

411
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,932
Hey, look, Danny. Gee, I hate to
ask this, but could you stake me?

412
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,737
I could use a shave and a haircut and
a pair of shoes with soles on them.

413
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:16,075
I'll give you a stake. French
fried potatoes too. Come on, get in.

414
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:18,274
Get in that limousine, Googi. Okay, fellas?

415
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:21,045
- Okay!
- Give her the gas, Danny. Let her go.

416
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,280
Gee, it's good to see you guys.
What a break bumping into you.

417
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:33,188
It's funny, Danny, the old
bunch, every one of them.

418
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:37,268
They keep turning up like bad
pennies. First Pete, now Googi.

419
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:40,838
The other day, I heard that Mushy
Kelly finished his stretch for burglary.

420
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,100
What a bunch.

421
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,711
It must be pretty late.
You gotta get some sleep.

422
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:58,751
No, that's all right.
Keep on playing, will you?

423
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,257
Play that part you just played.

424
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:03,689
What? This?

425
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:12,869
Now I know something's
wrong. Who is it, Peggy?

426
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:17,337
I thought so.

427
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:22,874
Peggy's old lady nailed me on the stairs
tonight and lit into me like a bantam.

428
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,950
Where was Peggy, and what did I
mean keeping her out all night?

429
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,485
- Your fault, huh?
- Yeah, how do you like that?

430
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:31,316
Peggy chasing around with that
sharpie from 65th Street...

431
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,322
...and I gotta take the schlack.

432
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:37,087
Danny. You're still pretty
set on that kid, aren't you?

433
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:41,723
You ought to know. She's part
of me by now. Like my right arm.

434
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:44,369
Everything was going good
until that sharpie came...

435
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:46,334
...and gave her a fancy line of gab.

436
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:49,703
Danny, I don't know this guy
Burns, but I think I know the type.

437
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,537
And he's not the one to worry about.

438
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:54,009
You got a lot more
competition than that spieler.

439
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,410
What do you mean? I don't get you, Ed.

440
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,750
Danny, I know Peggy,
and I certainly know you.

441
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,682
I can't exactly explain this to you...

442
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:04,584
...but call it applause,
ambition, call it what you like.

443
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:07,692
But it'd take a lot more than
a man to come between you two.

444
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:10,495
You see, when she rubs her
eyes open in the morning...

445
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:13,791
...she sees her name up in bright
lights: "Peggy Nash, dancer."

446
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:18,335
All day long, keeps moving those lights
around different theaters, different cities.

447
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:20,995
At night, she goes to sleep
with applause in her ears.

448
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,836
Danny, she can't see you
and she can't hear you...

449
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,275
...because she's blinded by those
lights and deafened by that applause.

450
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,207
It looks like you nailed it, Ed.

451
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,611
But whatever it is, I'm not gonna
let it take her away from me.

452
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:15,985
Come in.

453
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:21,158
I waited downstairs since 10:00.

454
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:24,363
You didn't show up. I thought
I'd see what was the matter.

455
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:26,528
What are you trying to pull on me?

456
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:29,573
Why, I thought we had a date for today.

457
00:30:29,742 --> 00:30:32,768
- It's Sunday, isn't it? - So
you're getting big-hearted, huh?

458
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:36,637
Why, don't you want to, Danny? Or
are you trying to give me a stand up?

459
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:40,650
Stand up? That's what I've been getting
since that creepy cake-eater horned in.

460
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:45,123
- You got soap in your ears.
- So I got soap in my ears.

461
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,815
- You needn't yell.
- Who's yelling?

462
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:48,585
Not me.

463
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:55,130
- What are you trying to do, cut my throat?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

464
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,269
- You didn't mean it.
- Here, let me wash it.

465
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:58,767
Honestly, I was only fooling.

466
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:02,271
- First you cut me, then say "only fooling."
- You got a right to be sore.

467
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,841
I thought since it was
Sunday and so nice and warm...

468
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:08,139
...maybe you'd take me to the beach.
We could have the day together.

469
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:10,805
- Why didn't you say so?
- You jumped down my throat.

470
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,515
- You know what I ought to do to you?
- What?

471
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:19,190
I certainly missed you, Peggy.

472
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:21,622
We had a swell time last
week and the week before.

473
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:25,059
We won't have a swell time today
unless we get started, so...

474
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:44,714
You know, Danny, someday I'd
love to take a long ocean trip.

475
00:31:44,884 --> 00:31:48,342
We could do that on our honeymoon. We
could take a cruise to Atlantic City.

476
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,989
I think I can get my boss
to give me a week off.

477
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:55,719
No, I mean far away. Europe, South America.

478
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:59,160
Traveling on big ships, seeing
the world from a front seat.

479
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,926
Danny, if I'm successful, I can go anywhere.

480
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:04,535
Get off that express and take a local.

481
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:07,605
- Still dreaming about being a star, huh?
- Why not?

482
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:09,934
Danny, I just know I could be a great dancer.

483
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:13,840
Maybe even up there someday,
up on Broadway, in a big show.

484
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:16,481
- My name in bright lights.
- What do you want that for?

485
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:19,243
We could be happy together
without all that noise.

486
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,716
- Together?
- Yeah, sure. Married. Why not?

487
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:25,516
Well, I wasn't exactly
thinking about that yet.

488
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:28,285
- No?
- Don't you see, Danny?

489
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:32,022
We're hurting each other if we let
ourselves into the lives our families had.

490
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:36,601
Always struggling, trying to make a dime do
for a dollar. I want out of Forsyth Street.

491
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:40,034
We don't have to live down there.
We can move up to the Bronx.

492
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,732
Danny, sometimes I don't understand you.

493
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:48,243
Everybody in New York wants to do
something, be somebody, except you.

494
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:51,508
- I just wanna be happy.
- But you've got to have ambition.

495
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:53,675
You can't drag around this town on one foot.

496
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:56,651
You've got to run like the
rest, or you'll be left behind.

497
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:59,488
I didn't know you wanted me to, Peggy.

498
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:02,992
I'd do anything if you'd
tell me you wanted me to.

499
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,096
Danny, I guess we want different things.

500
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:09,560
Yeah, maybe you're right.

501
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:12,761
I'll tell you what. We go over
to Chinatown, have some chop suey.

502
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:15,065
Then we go over to
Settlement and have a dance.

503
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:20,110
I'd love to, but, well, I wanted to tell
you this before, only I didn't know how.

504
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,076
You see, I can't tonight.

505
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,011
I promised to go to Palace Gardens.

506
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:26,242
There's a contest there, a big city contest.

507
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,115
There's going to be a booking
agent. Maybe I can get a job.

508
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:34,023
Yeah, I guess we are talking
about different things.

509
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:35,820
That sharpshooter gonna be there?

510
00:33:35,995 --> 00:33:39,123
Oh, I don't know, Danny.
I don't care about him.

511
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,198
- We'd better go.
- Look, Peggy.

512
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,564
Suppose I do stop dragging one foot?

513
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:48,138
Suppose I do join up with
the pack and run with them?

514
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:50,639
I can do something besides
juggling a packing case.

515
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,005
I got two fists to beat
the way for both of us.

516
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,012
All you gotta do is say
the word and I'll get going.

517
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:59,447
But, Danny, I don't want you to do it for me.

518
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:01,984
I want you to be somebody for yourself.

519
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:06,250
All right. Any way you want it, Peggy.

520
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:10,225
But tell me one thing so I won't
always be worrying about you.

521
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:15,891
Promise me that you'll always
be my girl, no matter what.

522
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:22,138
I promise, Danny.

523
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:25,471
Always. No matter what.

524
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,373
Okay, but do I have to start the show?

525
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,941
The house is as cold as a
corpse. They'll freeze us.

526
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,577
Can't you make it three or four?

527
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:02,714
Wait a minute. You're breaking
in. You can't pick your spots now.

528
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:05,646
I might fix it for you so you'd
have number two. That's all.

529
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:09,345
- All right, skip it. What's the route?
- We open in Baltimore...

530
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:13,720
...play the last half in Philly, jump to Akron,
lay off last half, play Cleveland a week...

531
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:17,090
...pick up the Delahanty time in
Buffalo, finish that, then Brooklyn.

532
00:35:17,263 --> 00:35:19,128
You call that a route. If you can't do...

533
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:22,790
Listen. The woods are full of dancers
who'd break their neck for a booking.

534
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:25,960
- Well, if you don't like it...
- Okay, okay. Sold.

535
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:28,265
That's the way. You got
nothing to worry about.

536
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,932
All you gotta do is knock them dead.
What about the billing? Burns and Nash?

537
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:34,705
- You bill it Burns and Company.
- What about the 80 bucks?

538
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,178
- Make it payable to me.
- Okay with you, Peggy?

539
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:41,276
Of course. I leave everything to Murray.

540
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:43,478
Blank check, huh? Well, it's okay by me.

541
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:45,920
You'll have to sign too,
Peggy, by this cross.

542
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:49,552
Gee, this is the first time
I ever signed a contract.

543
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:51,525
I'm so nervous I can hardly write.

544
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:52,925
Attagirl.

545
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:54,725
Don't forget, you leave Thursday.

546
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,336
Train pulls out for Baltimore at
8:15. Grand Central. Don't be late.

547
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,529
I'll have two tickets for you on Wednesday.

548
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:03,436
Goodbye and lots of luck.
You'll need it in Akron.

549
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:06,339
- You said it. See you Wednesday.
- Okay.

550
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,007
How'd you like it, baby?

551
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,278
Boy, oh, boy. Am I
dreaming, or am I dreaming?

552
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,248
What did I tell you? Did
I sell him a bill of goods.

553
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,218
I can't believe it. I won't
believe it until we really open.

554
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,118
Don't worry about that. It's a cinch.

555
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,191
I know I can get a gown at Klein's...

556
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,726
...but I should have a
real pair of dance slippers.

557
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:26,922
Murray, I'll be able to send Ma
a few dollars every week, won't I?

558
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:28,623
That'll be all right, won't it?

559
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:32,737
Sure, baby, sure. Everything's gonna
be all right with us from now on.

560
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,606
It's getting late. I'd better go.

561
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,538
I want my shoe, Murray.

562
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:40,576
Please let me go, Murray. My shoe.

563
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:41,974
Don't worry about that.

564
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:46,311
Please let me go, Murray. Murray, please
let me go. Please let me go. Let me go!

565
00:36:49,722 --> 00:36:51,212
You may come in now, Mr. Kenny.

566
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:53,989
Remember what you said. I'm depending on you.

567
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,855
- Don't worry.
- I won't. I got my fingers crossed.

568
00:36:57,897 --> 00:36:59,091
Hello, Kenny.

569
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:01,165
Took you a long time. I was expecting you.

570
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:04,063
- Got an empty stall in your stable?
- Is it money or a dame?

571
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,296
Both. Now look, Scotty, I don't
wanna waste your time or my own.

572
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:09,873
I'll take a few fights.
I've gotta get real dough.

573
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:13,443
I think you've got the wrong number.
I don't know what reasons you've got.

574
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:16,740
I've only got one. I want a
champion. So get this straight.

575
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,749
If you're gonna fight for
me, you're gonna fight my way.

576
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:21,909
All right. When do I start?

577
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:25,250
As soon as we get you in shape.
Right now, you're all musclebound.

578
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:27,756
We'll start working out
those truck-driver's bumps.

579
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,589
In the meantime, I'll line up
an out-of-town card for you.

580
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:33,027
There's another thing you
might as well know now.

581
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:37,328
You'll get no setups. If my boys haven't
got what it takes, I'm just not interested.

582
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:40,700
- I don't want any setups, Scotty.
- Well, that's fine. Now let me see.

583
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:43,899
You can open in Detroit and then
I'll run you up into Cleveland...

584
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:46,874
...and then we'll go to Toledo.
That ought to get us Chicago.

585
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:50,538
Scotty, I was wondering there might be
a bout in Pittsburgh about Christmas.

586
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:52,183
What's in Pittsburgh? Who is she?

587
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,911
Now, the way I understand
it, you take care of business.

588
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:57,180
All I asked was, could
you arrange Pittsburgh?

589
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,085
All right, I'll see if I can.

590
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:01,283
- By the way, do you need any money?
- Not yet.

591
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,520
All right, I'll see you at Stillwell's
to see what shape you're in.

592
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:07,632
- Remind me to pick a second.
- You got one here. Can't shake him.

593
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,826
I'll second him. I'll even third
him. Let me tell you, I can...

594
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:12,163
Tell it to him.

595
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:15,236
- No kidding. Is it all set?
- Yeah. You can relax.

596
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:18,501
Danny, Danny, you can't imagine
what you've done for my career.

597
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:22,174
Yes, Mr. MacPherson?

598
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:24,839
We're lining up an out-of-town
card on Young Samson.

599
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:28,544
But remember, no fights near
Pittsburgh. That's one town we detour.

600
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:28,977
- It's a massacre.
- Looks like you guessed it right.

601
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,708
I always guess it right. I
never have to look no more.

602
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,580
I can it tell from the yelling.
That was the blood yell.

603
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:38,154
It's a cold pack! He's in the canvas.
It's over. Give me that four bits.

604
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,621
- Who won?
- I never know till they come through.

605
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:42,260
I can tell you who won.

606
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:43,895
- Yeah? Who?
- Young Samson.

607
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,963
- He's got to win.
- Why?

608
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:48,258
Because he doesn't care
whether he wins or not.

609
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:49,662
You mean...

610
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:52,736
...if he wanted to win, he'd lose?
- Maybe.

611
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,377
What did I tell you?

612
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:06,211
And I knew because I got clothes on my back.

613
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:11,454
What's the secret behind that sleep-making
left-right? Those curls, maybe?

614
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,488
Danny, watch out for a gal named Delilah.

615
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,684
Are you in shape. You sure put that guy away.

616
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:18,261
- Yeah, don't take a haircut.
- Put your hand in there.

617
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,830
- It's cold.
- Not half as cold as Hanson is right now.

618
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,796
- You said it.
- How about another?

619
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,129
What's the matter with
you guys? Go on. Get out.

620
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:29,832
All right, fellas. Let him get his clothes
on. I'll give you all the smoke-up stuff later.

621
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:32,203
- Get up to my office.
- Danny, it was terrific.

622
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:34,208
- He didn't even hit you once.
- See that?

623
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:35,368
What's the matter?

624
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:37,208
Nothing. He sprained his thumb.

625
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:39,145
I put the wrong hand in the ice water.

626
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:42,287
- Danny, someone here to see you.
- Who is it?

627
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:46,117
Remember me? This is Googi under these duds.

628
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:48,659
Well, Googi. Where did you come from?

629
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:51,455
The same place you come
from, Forsyth and Delancey.

630
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,291
- How are you?
- Well, get Googi.

631
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:57,329
Hundred-and-fifty-dollar suit, monogrammed
shirt and buttons good enough to eat.

632
00:40:57,503 --> 00:40:59,994
- Kid, you look like a success.
- You're not doing bad.

633
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:03,039
As a matter of fact, I won on
you. I brought you a present.

634
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,768
- I want you to meet some pals. Let them in.
- Hey, girls.

635
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:09,072
Come on in, girls. This
is Sally, Irene and Mary.

636
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:11,910
Come right down out of the
scandals just to see you fight.

637
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:14,245
You were wonderful. You
stopped the show cold.

638
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:16,284
He sure did and he won me ten grand too.

639
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,913
Now, look, Danny. I got a big blowout
waiting for you. Everybody's invited.

640
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:22,686
- You're full of surprises.
- There's a big party arranged.

641
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:25,295
- Come on. Get dressed. Let's all go.
- Sure.

642
00:41:46,118 --> 00:41:47,779
Okay, now.

643
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:51,319
We got a real snappy treat here.

644
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,187
I want you all to meet Samson's kid
brother, a great musician, Eddie Kenny.

645
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:01,355
He's gonna give us some real classy
music, so I want a little quiet, see?

646
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:02,898
Come on, Danny let's have him.

647
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:05,866
Come on, Eddie boy, give.

648
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,573
- Gee, Danny, this is no time, no...
- They'll love it. Play the part I like.

649
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,902
All right.

650
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,672
If you ask me, this stuff is too ritzy.

651
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:47,311
What happened to Dorothy?

652
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:50,312
She's so dumb, she didn't even
know what he was talking about.

653
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:54,012
Hello, Max. Where you been?

654
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:57,349
Wouldn't you like to know, huh?
Where's Danny? Oh, there he is.

655
00:42:57,522 --> 00:43:00,923
Samson, that fight was a real honey.
I collected two grand on you tonight.

656
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:04,119
Max, this is Danny's kid brother,
Eddie, a composer of real class.

657
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:07,459
Eddie, meet the biggest producer
on Broadway, Max Leonard in person.

658
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:10,065
How are you, young fella?
Say, Danny, is that true?

659
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:12,999
That Cannonball Wales is hiding out from you?

660
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,036
Say, where's that gossip hound Mulligan?

661
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:17,334
He's got me stepping
out with Cutie d'Amour...

662
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:18,806
...breaking up my home life.

663
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:21,411
I think we'll find him
right there in the corner.

664
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,208
Don't worry, kid. They just
like to hear themselves talk.

665
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:26,851
I knew they wouldn't listen.
I could've told you that.

666
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:29,078
We don't care. We'll show them.

667
00:43:29,254 --> 00:43:31,085
I'll show them right now.

668
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,434
Hey, Max. Listen to that swing.
That kid's got something new.

669
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:58,081
Say, that's not so bad.

670
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:06,754
Danny, if he can give me a score for my
next show, he can write his own ticket.

671
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:17,264
Say, Eddie sure can swing it, can't he?

672
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:19,734
Hey, what about some
caviar? Come on. Just try.

673
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:21,532
Chef, fix him up a nice plate.

674
00:44:26,078 --> 00:44:30,208
Caviar. Remember what we used to do for
a frankfurter and a swig of lemonade?

675
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:34,580
I never forget that. Hey, listen, what's
new about Peggy? You seen her lately?

676
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:37,619
- No.
- I heard she's dancing in vaudeville.

677
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:40,019
- I know she's doing a lot of traveling.
- Yeah?

678
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:42,660
Hey, boss, them show cuties
just blew in. They wanna...

679
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:44,557
- Okay, I'll be right over.
- All right.

680
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,755
Sorry, Danny. I'll see you later.

681
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:15,189
Next time on that waltz,
don't lean all over me.

682
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,419
Don't get up out of your curtsy till I bow.

683
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:19,928
- Remember that, Pavlova.
- All right, I'll remember.

684
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,930
- Just a minute.
- Say, if that's Art Baron, tell him to wait.

685
00:45:24,102 --> 00:45:26,502
How long does he think that
club deal is gonna hang?

686
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:29,765
All right, I'll tell him. Just a second, Art.

687
00:45:32,811 --> 00:45:34,176
- Danny.
- Hello, Peggy.

688
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:35,904
Oh, Danny!

689
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:40,548
Come in and let's look at you.
Gee, I didn't know you were in town.

690
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:43,187
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, Danny.

691
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:45,516
What's all the noise? Who you got there?

692
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,214
Oh, it's just a friend, Murray.

693
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:51,826
Oh, just a friend.

694
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:53,362
Excuse me for butting in.

695
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:55,659
- Danny, you remember my partner, Murray.
- Yeah.

696
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,096
So how's the little champ?

697
00:45:58,203 --> 00:46:01,434
- Peggy, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Giving me the brushoff, huh?

698
00:46:01,606 --> 00:46:05,201
- Danny, I've read about you in the paper.
- I've been keeping track of you too.

699
00:46:05,377 --> 00:46:06,969
<i>I've seen your bill in the Variety.</i>

700
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:10,546
What are you doing here? This ain't
no third-rate gym for palookas.

701
00:46:10,715 --> 00:46:13,115
- You're asking for it, Burns.
- Come on, sock me.

702
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:17,278
- That's the only thing you got any head for.
- Murray, Danny and I are old friends.

703
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:21,984
All right. I'll let you make a date
with your old friend, sure. Next year.

704
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:24,791
I'll see Peggy now or any time I wanna, see?

705
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:28,421
- Get wise to yourself. Three's a crowd.
- You can't talk to Danny like that.

706
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,194
Since when you giving orders?
Shut your trap or I'll...

707
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:33,837
- Strong arm stuff, huh?
- Sorry, Peggy. Did I hurt you?

708
00:46:34,005 --> 00:46:35,597
You probably broke her shoulder.

709
00:46:35,774 --> 00:46:37,605
- Get that mug out of here.
- Peggy.

710
00:46:37,776 --> 00:46:41,473
No. It doesn't matter. Please leave
me alone. Why'd you have to come here?

711
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:45,241
Because I was crazy to see you. I wouldn't
hurt you. I'd cut my arm off first.

712
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:47,078
Danny, don't talk like that.

713
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:52,019
I can't see you. You've got to go. Don't
you see, you've gotta leave me alone.

714
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,488
You heard what she said. Scram.

715
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:07,036
Now you see what happens when
you give a mug like that a break.

716
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:10,003
You should have thrown him out
the minute he opened the door.

717
00:47:10,575 --> 00:47:14,011
I don't mind telling you, baby, that
means a lot, you standing up for me.

718
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:17,148
- Let's see what that gorilla did to you.
- Keep your hands off me.

719
00:47:17,315 --> 00:47:20,045
- Why, what's the matter? Come on.
- Just remember that.

720
00:47:20,218 --> 00:47:24,154
Don't ever put your hands on me again.
Get out of here. This is my dressing room.

721
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:28,190
Okay. But you keep your mind on your
routine or I'll find me somebody who will.

722
00:47:39,638 --> 00:47:41,970
Danny! Danny, wait.

723
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,541
- I wanna talk to you. Give me a chance.
- Yeah, sure, Peggy, sure.

724
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,940
Danny, I didn't wanna be
mean. Please understand.

725
00:47:48,113 --> 00:47:51,879
I was afraid they'd cancel if you cut his
face. I know you had a right to hit him.

726
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,382
- You even had a...
- That's all right. Don't worry.

727
00:47:54,553 --> 00:47:55,918
Does your shoulder still hurt?

728
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:57,076
You sure?

729
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:59,815
You should've let that guy
take it. He had it coming.

730
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:01,481
- You sure it don't hurt?
- No.

731
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,491
I know I've hurt you worse than that.

732
00:48:03,662 --> 00:48:07,257
You know, I meant to write you many
times. I was scared you'd be angry.

733
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:11,266
I couldn't be sore at you, Peggy. I certainly
missed you every minute you was away.

734
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:15,769
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

735
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:17,169
- I haven't?
- No.

736
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:20,004
- Are you sure, Danny?
- You're still the same little Peggy.

737
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:23,837
- Still my girl, ain't you?
- Yes, Danny. Always.

738
00:48:24,015 --> 00:48:25,573
Oh, I love you so much.

739
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:29,913
Hey, what is this?

740
00:48:30,088 --> 00:48:32,921
Come on, break it up. Hire a
hall. What do you think this is?

741
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:35,525
- You wanna make something out of it?
- Go on. Get out.

742
00:48:36,428 --> 00:48:38,555
- How long you gonna be in town?
- Till tomorrow.

743
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,324
- Only tomorrow?
- Then Hartford and Providence.

744
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:42,830
And after that?

745
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:46,266
That's the end of the contract. After that...

746
00:48:46,438 --> 00:48:47,871
After that I'll be free again.

747
00:48:48,506 --> 00:48:50,599
Does that mean you're
not gonna leave anymore?

748
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:53,033
If that's what you want, Danny.

749
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:57,444
- You mean that, Peg?
- Yes, Danny.

750
00:48:57,616 --> 00:48:59,709
- For sure?
- For sure.

751
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:02,444
- For keeps?
- For keeps.

752
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:06,455
Well. Two weeks. Why, that's
nothing. That's nothing at all.

753
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,957
That'll just give me time
to get everything ready.

754
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:12,756
- You know, Peg...
- Yes, Danny?

755
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:15,297
Well, what do you know about that?

756
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,663
Hey, didn't I just tell...?

757
00:49:18,837 --> 00:49:21,772
Holy smokes. Some people in
this town is just plain nuts.

758
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:28,737
Here you are, Manchester Hotel.

759
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:31,177
Wait here a few minutes, will you, bub?

760
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:34,746
- Then it's a date for tomorrow?
- Paddy's Tavern. I'll meet you there.

761
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:38,286
I want you to meet Scotty and Mutt
too. He's gonna fall all over himself.

762
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:41,948
- After that, what do you wanna do?
- I don't care, as long as we're together.

763
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:46,689
We'll go and visit the East Side. We'll
go to Moscowitz's Romanian restaurant.

764
00:49:46,865 --> 00:49:49,197
After that, we'll go to
Forsyth Street Settlement.

765
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:52,097
- There's always something there.
- That'd be wonderful.

766
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,669
Danny, I'm so happy.

767
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:56,033
It's just like running
through a dark alley...

768
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,675
...and suddenly finding your
way out in warm sunlight.

769
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:04,280
Come on, come on. You gotta
get some shuteye. On your feet.

770
00:50:05,984 --> 00:50:08,714
You can't do your kind of work
with only eight hours sleep.

771
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,014
- Still looking after me, aren't you?
- Right.

772
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:13,157
I started a long time ago. Can't quit now.

773
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:15,918
It's awfully nice to find
somebody you can depend on.

774
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:19,029
That's what I'm here for. Any
trouble, I'll be standing by.

775
00:50:19,197 --> 00:50:20,596
Now, go on, get to bed.

776
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:23,029
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah.

777
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:28,230
I'm not trying to butt in, but you're
acting like a kid with his first crush.

778
00:50:28,406 --> 00:50:29,839
You guessed it, jockey. She is.

779
00:50:31,643 --> 00:50:34,339
- Good night, Miss Nash.
- Good night.

780
00:50:41,286 --> 00:50:44,483
So you showed up, huh? I thought
you took a powder for good.

781
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:46,920
- What are you doing?
- Since when are you asking...?

782
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:49,720
Murray, haven't I got enough headaches?

783
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:52,419
- What's the trouble?
- There's no trouble. You're in.

784
00:50:52,597 --> 00:50:55,191
I've landed you in the
circuit. Read it and collapse.

785
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:57,357
Club Madrid, Chicago, Club Paree, Philly...

786
00:50:57,535 --> 00:51:00,333
...the Deauville, St. Louis,
Paradise, Casablanca, Ritz Roof.

787
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:03,167
Ain't that sweet music, baby?
The big time, the big money.

788
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:04,740
Well, when does all this...?

789
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:08,037
- AI, have you really got that?
- I've got it in the bag and sewed up.

790
00:51:08,213 --> 00:51:11,080
Eight-fifty a week, 40 weeks.
Start in Chicago in two weeks.

791
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:14,741
We've got to do some tussling in them
two weeks to get those routines down.

792
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:16,887
Got your tongue tied? You leave it to Al.

793
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:20,252
- I told you I'd put you on top.
- Top or no, we've gotta buckle down.

794
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:22,416
I've got a slant for a new kind of number.

795
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:26,690
But, Al. Al, I thought maybe after these
next two weeks I'd take a little vacation.

796
00:51:26,865 --> 00:51:30,767
- A vacation at $850 a week? Are you nuts?
- We start off with eight bars of bolero.

797
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:34,234
Then the spins we did in the tango.
It's something you've never seen.

798
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:36,498
- That's what they want.
- Then do an open step.

799
00:51:36,674 --> 00:51:38,141
From that, slip into the rumba.

800
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:40,402
Al, get busy on that music. Don't hold me up.

801
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:42,045
Now, how about a flashy name?

802
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:44,044
How about Maurice and Margalo?

803
00:51:44,215 --> 00:51:45,978
That's your new billing. You like it?

804
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:47,982
Maurice and Margalo: Club Madrid.

805
00:51:48,153 --> 00:51:49,381
Maurice and Margalo?

806
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:52,614
Yeah. Margalo spelled right out in lights.

807
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:55,252
"Maurice and Margalo."

808
00:52:08,606 --> 00:52:10,437
You know who just went in? Danny Kenny.

809
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:11,836
- Young Samson.
- No kidding?

810
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,035
Let's go around the back. We can see better.

811
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:15,543
Okay, come on. Let's go.

812
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:17,476
Wasn't that Danny Kenny that came in?

813
00:52:17,649 --> 00:52:20,277
Yeah. Young Samson. They always come back.

814
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:23,249
- Say, you better go tip off Walter.
- Okay.

815
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:45,738
There he is, Young Samson.
What did I tell you?

816
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,707
What do you say, Peg? How about a dance?

817
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:49,471
Later, Danny. Let's watch a while.

818
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:53,048
- Anything you say. This is your night.
- No, Danny. It's your night.

819
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:54,879
Well, then let's say it's our night.

820
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,888
Attention, please! Attention!

821
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:01,923
We've got with us tonight...

822
00:53:02,093 --> 00:53:03,993
...one of our own Forsyth boys...

823
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:07,689
...who has socked his way right up
from Essex Street to Essex House.

824
00:53:07,866 --> 00:53:13,896
I mean, the next welterweight
champion of the world, Danny Kenny.

825
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,810
It looks like orchids for Danny and Peggy.

826
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:22,947
I'll be back in a flash with a flash.

827
00:53:23,114 --> 00:53:25,412
- Did you tell him, Danny?
- I didn't say a word.

828
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,245
- How'd they find out then?
- I guess we just look that way.

829
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:32,412
Okay, you truckers and shaggers, on with
the jitters, and let joy be unrefined.

830
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,581
Now, come on, let's see some real stepping.

831
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:37,250
Danny and Peggy are elected honorary judges.

832
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:38,827
Let's go!

833
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:17,764
Boy, keep it hot!

834
00:54:22,173 --> 00:54:24,801
- Happy, Danny?
- Very.

835
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:27,376
It's a real celebration, ain't it?

836
00:54:36,788 --> 00:54:41,953
And now, by special request, folks, a
little number by the judges themselves.

837
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:45,327
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

838
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:47,555
I don't know about dancing. Ask the champ.

839
00:54:47,732 --> 00:54:49,290
Come on, Peggy, be a sport.

840
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:52,231
- All right, but Danny's got to do it with me.
- Come on, Dan.

841
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:55,463
- Can't refuse a lady.
- Attaboy.

842
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:04,638
- Go on, do this by yourself.
- No, I'd much rather not.

843
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:07,979
Go on, you're among
friends. Give them a treat.

844
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,970
- Good evening. What train, sir?
- 11:15, Hartford.

845
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:33,804
Track 14. Would you like your
luggage in the car with you?

846
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:36,913
Yes, thanks. Danny, please
don't see me down to the train.

847
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:39,174
- He'll be there and it'll cause...
- All right.

848
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,977
Well, it's two weeks from tonight?

849
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:44,815
- You're gonna wire me which train to meet?
- Yes. Yes, Danny, I'll wire you.

850
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:47,014
Tell me, were you really happy tonight?

851
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,659
The biggest day of my
whole life. Don't I look it?

852
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:52,255
Hold me close.

853
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:56,060
Train would be leaving.

854
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:04,367
- What are you bawling about?
- It's just that I don't want it to end.

855
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:05,907
There's gonna be lots more.

856
00:56:06,077 --> 00:56:08,409
This way, please.

857
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,124
Good afternoon. I represent
the Bluepoint Vacuum Cleaner.

858
00:56:28,332 --> 00:56:31,165
- Sorry.
- lf you let me demonstrate, you'll say...

859
00:56:31,335 --> 00:56:35,032
..."I don't see how I got along without it."
- Hello. Got a telegram for me?

860
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,470
- No. Look, we're bachelors...
- Not for long.

861
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:41,100
What are you selling? Vacuum cleaners?
Come on in. We can use one of those.

862
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:42,644
- Looks like a sale.
- Thanks.

863
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:46,749
Waited for two hours to get a license.
Looks like everybody's getting married.

864
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:48,510
- You getting married?
- You said it.

865
00:56:48,686 --> 00:56:50,551
Your wife will appreciate the Bluepoint.

866
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:52,780
Now, allow me to demonstrate its efficiency.

867
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:54,322
- Go right ahead, son.
- Thanks.

868
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:57,757
So I gets to the window and I
discover there's a new law in New York.

869
00:56:57,929 --> 00:57:00,591
- You gotta wait three days to get married.
- As you see...

870
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:04,030
...you can protect and clean the
most expensive rugs with no effort.

871
00:57:04,202 --> 00:57:05,635
Are you sure there was no wire?

872
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:08,169
Nope, only some mail and
photos to autograph there.

873
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,536
You'll find that our cleaner sucks
up every bit of grit and dirt...

874
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:13,904
...and adds years of
wear and life to your rug.

875
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:15,978
And preserves the sanitation of your home.

876
00:57:16,147 --> 00:57:18,672
What's the matter with you?
Here's a letter from Peggy.

877
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,478
I didn't look for a letter.
You asked if there's a wire.

878
00:57:21,652 --> 00:57:24,485
Now, for your upholsteries,
drapes, curtains or hanging...

879
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:28,056
...you simply attach this gadget.
It's simple. A child can operate it.

880
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:31,286
You attach this end, push this button and...

881
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:39,260
- Say, Pinky. Danny's here.
- Hey, you're late.

882
00:57:39,435 --> 00:57:41,869
Where you been? Scotty's
been raising the deuce.

883
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:43,505
We're waiting an hour already.

884
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:46,971
- What's the matter? Can't you talk?
- Pipe down, Pinky. Pipe down.

885
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:49,077
- You're in his hair.
- Another prima donna.

886
00:57:49,245 --> 00:57:51,042
You can't say nothing around here.

887
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:54,979
Okay, Sailor, hop in for a couple
rounds. Guy's getting hard to handle.

888
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:57,483
Danny just blew in. I don't
know what's the matter.

889
00:57:57,653 --> 00:57:59,587
- Where is he?
- He's in the ring.

890
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,484
- Hi, Danny. Hi, Mutt.
- Hi, Sailor.

891
00:58:01,657 --> 00:58:04,182
<i>You sure look in the pink.
Did you see the Telegram?</i>

892
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,158
- Boy, Sullivan sure went to town on you.
- Let's get started.

893
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:10,389
Why, what's the matter,
Danny? What are you sore about?

894
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:13,763
Sure, I know Cannonball. I don't
trust him. He's mean and dangerous.

895
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:15,961
- Danny'll stop him.
- He might stop Danny.

896
00:58:16,138 --> 00:58:19,437
- I'm taking no chances.
- Danny will throw a right in his breadbasket.

897
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:22,668
By the time he pulls his glove
out, he'll be champ. Look at him.

898
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:27,505
Danny, wait a minute, will you?

899
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:30,345
- This ain't for keeps.
- Come on, stop crying.

900
00:58:36,325 --> 00:58:38,225
Say, what's going on there?

901
00:58:39,495 --> 00:58:40,985
Just a second, Danny, will you?

902
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:44,826
- Say, Mutt. Call him off me, will you?
- Take it easy, Danny. Take it easy.

903
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,127
What do you want him to do, break his hands?

904
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:49,567
What are you slugging
him for? What is the idea?

905
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,536
- I'm sorry, Sailor. You all right?
- Sure, sure, it's okay.

906
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:56,303
- I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing.
- All right, get yourself a shower.

907
00:58:56,779 --> 00:58:58,508
Wait. What's going on? Spill it.

908
00:58:58,681 --> 00:59:00,114
I don't know. Honest I don't.

909
00:59:00,282 --> 00:59:03,012
He just come in like that,
sore, like somebody crossed him.

910
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:06,746
You mean double-crossed him.
And I think I can name her.

911
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:10,187
All right, what's use eating your
heart out? That won't bring her back.

912
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:12,759
I know something about human
nature, including women.

913
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,123
You've got to pull yourself together.

914
00:59:15,297 --> 00:59:18,130
Once you got the crown, you'll
find that gal on your doorstep.

915
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,632
They all like the limelight.
Peggy ain't different.

916
00:59:20,803 --> 00:59:22,964
Once you're on top,
she'll die to be with you.

917
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:25,937
Look, I can book the southpaw.
Then later, Cannonball Wales.

918
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,201
- How about Cannonball now?
- He's too tough.

919
00:59:28,377 --> 00:59:29,776
You're not ready for him. Look.

920
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:32,937
- First the southpaw, then later...
- Quit stalling me, Scotty.

921
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:36,949
You said the crown would mean something.
Well, get me Wales. I can whip him.

922
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,088
Sure, Scotty. Danny'll bring
that Cannonball down to buckshot.

923
00:59:40,256 --> 00:59:43,282
- Get the match and I'll bet 50 grand on him.
- What will Danny get?

924
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:45,689
Wales' manager's cagey. We get peanuts.

925
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:47,726
So? Once we get the crown, we get cagey.

926
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:49,626
Till then, you can call me banker.

927
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,390
Sure, go ahead, Scotty, do it!

928
00:59:51,567 --> 00:59:53,034
All right, you've got the match.

929
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:55,193
That's a good fella.

930
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:57,168
We can beat him. We can beat him, Danny.

931
00:59:57,907 --> 01:00:00,933
Samson battles Wales for
welterweight crown tonight!

932
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,044
Read all about the New York fight!

933
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,703
Samson battles Wales for
welterweight crown tonight.

934
01:00:12,254 --> 01:00:13,687
Come in.

935
01:00:14,423 --> 01:00:16,687
Miss Margalo, Mr. Maurice, on stage, please.

936
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:18,053
Yes, yes, coming.

937
01:00:18,227 --> 01:00:19,888
<i>... one of the toughest to out-punch.</i>

938
01:00:20,062 --> 01:00:22,121
<i>It is said Samson packs a terrific right.</i>

939
01:00:22,298 --> 01:00:25,062
<i>If Wales isn't on the
watch, Samson may floor him.</i>

940
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:28,664
If you don't mind my saying,
Samson's gotta put up a fight to win.

941
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:31,863
- Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- He better. I bet two bucks on him.

942
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,975
Will you stop bothering about that radio?

943
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:35,906
I'm ready, Murray.

944
01:00:36,078 --> 01:00:39,104
- You mind if we use your radio, Peggy?
- Of course not. Go ahead.

945
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:40,908
- Thanks, Peggy.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

946
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,881
Murray, let's hurry our first
number. I want to listen in.

947
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:47,022
What for? That palooka of yours
won't last two rounds anyway.

948
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:49,953
Danny, this fellow Wales is
bad. Don't fall for his fight.

949
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,559
He knows tricks. Watch when
he backs into the ropes.

950
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:53,956
I'll watch, don't worry.

951
01:00:54,129 --> 01:00:56,324
Look, when he acts
groggy, that's just a pose.

952
01:00:56,498 --> 01:00:59,558
I got it down. I always fight the
way you tell me. Quit worrying.

953
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:01,896
You always tell me that
and do the same thing.

954
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:04,699
- All right, kid. Go in there and beat him.
- All right.

955
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:07,239
- Good luck to you, Mutt.
- Thanks, Danny.

956
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:09,274
Scotty.

957
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:15,744
It's a funny thing, Mutt.

958
01:01:15,918 --> 01:01:19,854
Here I am, fighting for the championship
of the world, and didn't wanna be a fighter.

959
01:01:27,663 --> 01:01:31,622
This is Sam Hayes, all set to give a
description of this widely publicized fight.

960
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,793
<i>Both fighters have entered the ring,
the referee is giving them instructions.</i>

961
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:39,099
<i>There's the warning whistle. In
just a moment, the fight will be on.</i>

962
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:41,869
- Has it started?
- You're in time. It's the first round.

963
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:44,602
<i>That's the bell. The fight's
on. They start sparring.</i>

964
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,943
<i>Samson leads his left to Wales'
nose. So fast you can just see it.</i>

965
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:50,347
<i>Wales rips a right jab
for the face but misses.</i>

966
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:09,537
- Danny's in fine shape, isn't he?
- Sure is.

967
01:02:17,146 --> 01:02:21,344
Hey, Dutch, don't forget that big
blowout I'm giving later to celebrate.

968
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:24,281
I got the whole club reserved
for all my friendly enemies.

969
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:27,388
How you gonna pay the bill after
you get through paying me off?

970
01:02:32,561 --> 01:02:34,188
You look fine. Settle down.

971
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:41,897
- One...
- Come on, Walesie!

972
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:46,371
...three, four, five...
- Take a count.

973
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:48,203
...seven.

974
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:58,614
- Close in on him. Tie him in knots.
- This guy ain't so easy. He hits like a mule.

975
01:02:58,787 --> 01:03:00,687
Dutch, what do you say instead of cash...

976
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:03,120
...you give me 50 percent
of your uptown take?

977
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,722
Now, don't forget, close in on him.

978
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,066
Steady, Danny, steady.

979
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:22,667
Come on, Danny. Keep it in there.

980
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:45,930
See that? See that foul?
That dirty heel, Wales.

981
01:03:46,101 --> 01:03:49,195
You can take it easy, brother.
That don't worry Young Samson.

982
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:51,635
Fouls ain't nothing to him. This is a cinch.

983
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,670
- Champion!
- Three...

984
01:03:59,848 --> 01:04:01,679
...four, five...

985
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,215
- Stay down!...six...

986
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:05,046
- Stay down!...seven, eight!

987
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:15,497
- The last count sure helped.
- You need it.

988
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:21,702
Hey, what's your hurry? Take
your time. You got plenty of time.

989
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,963
That's right. Get cagey,
like we talked about.

990
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:26,471
- We gotta work fast.
- What do you want me to do?

991
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:28,439
What do I want you to do?

992
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,578
Here, let me fix your gloves.

993
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:35,306
If they can't see you, they can't hit you.

994
01:04:40,022 --> 01:04:42,013
He'll try for a knockout. Don't clinch.

995
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:45,217
Keep him off with your left lead.
Just keep jabbing at his lamps.

996
01:04:53,335 --> 01:04:54,324
Give it to him!

997
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,838
Danny! Cover.

998
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,348
Watch it, Danny. Watch.
Now, keep them up. Keep...

999
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:15,953
Cover up!

1000
01:05:30,772 --> 01:05:34,674
- Come on, Walesie!
- Danny, watch his left! Box him!

1001
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:39,773
- What's the matter? He don't listen.
- Danny oughtn't lead him around the eyes.

1002
01:05:39,948 --> 01:05:42,883
- Box him, Danny!
- Come on, Danny! Like we talked about!

1003
01:05:46,455 --> 01:05:51,290
Referee, can't you see he's fouling my
man? Watch your eyes, Danny! Your eyes!

1004
01:05:53,962 --> 01:05:55,827
This is a great comeback Wales is making.

1005
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:58,694
Wales keeps stabbing Samson's
face, one, two, one, two.

1006
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,357
<i>Samson seems a little confused.</i>

1007
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:03,037
<i>Wales now leads quick
rights to Samson's face.</i>

1008
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:04,837
<i>He left himself open for that.</i>

1009
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:07,942
<i>Danny caught him a hard right,
but he came back with two jabs...</i>

1010
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,578
...to Danny's other eye.
That right one is bad enough.

1011
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:20,278
Danny's trying too hard. He ought
to watch that left on his eye.

1012
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:22,855
Yeah, it's red and swollen.
You can see it from here.

1013
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:28,962
Can't you hear the bell?

1014
01:06:29,131 --> 01:06:30,894
What's the matter, thumb in the eye?

1015
01:06:31,066 --> 01:06:32,397
- Both eyes.
- Both eyes.

1016
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:34,900
Why don't you listen? I
told you to watch his left.

1017
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:37,732
That's what I been doing but
he stuck his thumb in my eye.

1018
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:40,841
- I can hardly see him.
- Crowd your man and fight to the body.

1019
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:44,740
Now, come on. Fight to the body now.

1020
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:46,574
- You're looking fine.
- Come on, boy.

1021
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:49,308
Keep belting him right in
the body, Danny, all the time.

1022
01:06:57,859 --> 01:06:59,087
Watch it, Danny.

1023
01:07:03,832 --> 01:07:05,060
Come on.

1024
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:28,453
Both of Samson's eyes are nearly closed.

1025
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:31,855
Wales throws caution to the winds,
and punches the body and the head.

1026
01:07:32,027 --> 01:07:34,120
Come on, Danny. Come on!

1027
01:07:40,669 --> 01:07:43,832
Come on, hit him, Danny. Come on, Danny.

1028
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:50,307
Danny, come on!

1029
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:57,575
...three, four, five, six, seven.
- Danny, get up!

1030
01:07:57,753 --> 01:07:59,618
Come on, Danny!

1031
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:15,335
- How are your eyes?
- I can hardly see him.

1032
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:17,096
You can't see? Do you want to stop?

1033
01:08:17,272 --> 01:08:20,901
No. They're coming along. They're
clearing up. Keep throwing water on them.

1034
01:08:21,076 --> 01:08:22,668
- Is he hurting you much?
- He can't.

1035
01:08:22,844 --> 01:08:25,506
Danny, keep circling and
keep your guard up. All right?

1036
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:27,080
All right, I'll nail him.

1037
01:08:27,249 --> 01:08:29,911
What's the matter, Googi?
Looking for a miracle?

1038
01:08:35,257 --> 01:08:37,725
Keep your guard up now. Your guard up, Danny.

1039
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:52,497
Samson misses with a wild swing.

1040
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:54,107
<i>Danny's eyes are almost closed.</i>

1041
01:08:54,276 --> 01:08:57,609
<i>How he stands up to this this torture
is a miracle of will and courage.</i>

1042
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:59,269
Wales tears in with a hard left.

1043
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:06,153
Don't let him get you up against the
ropes. Come on, get away from them ropes!

1044
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:19,022
Three, four, five...

1045
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:22,500
...six, seven.

1046
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:37,545
- How's that feel?
- That's good, Mutt.

1047
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,483
- I can see better already.
- Danny, I'm gonna stop the fight.

1048
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:44,216
- I never should have let you in for this.
- No, Scotty, don't do that to me.

1049
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:47,361
All I need is one shot at this
guy. Scotty, promise me something.

1050
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,759
Promise you won't throw
the towel in. Promise me.

1051
01:09:49,931 --> 01:09:51,592
I gotta win. I gotta beat this guy.

1052
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,132
All right, Danny, all right.

1053
01:09:54,469 --> 01:09:57,165
You'll win. You're gonna beat
him. Just keep that guard up.

1054
01:09:57,339 --> 01:09:59,739
When you feel him near
you, keep pounding the body.

1055
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:02,468
It isn't worth it, Danny.
Scotty, stop it, stop it!

1056
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:06,136
Let me through. He'll murder
him. Scotty, you gotta stop it.

1057
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:08,305
Danny. Danny!

1058
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:11,213
Wales comes back with a hard
right, right on the button...

1059
01:10:11,386 --> 01:10:13,013
...but Samson refuses to go down.

1060
01:10:13,188 --> 01:10:15,986
<i>Miraculously on his feet after
three rounds of punishment.</i>

1061
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,150
<i>His eyes just narrow slits. I
doubt if he can see a thing now...</i>

1062
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:21,591
<i>... but he's game as ever,
standing right up there.</i>

1063
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:25,665
<i>Wales crowds Kenny, slugging him to the
head and face with savage lefts and rights.</i>

1064
01:10:25,834 --> 01:10:27,267
<i>Now a stiff right to the heart.</i>

1065
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:29,630
Ain't that too bad. Mind if I listen in?

1066
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:32,672
Not that I wanna hang around
you, I just want all the details.

1067
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:34,069
Lock the door, Della.

1068
01:10:34,242 --> 01:10:37,143
Yes, ma'am. Excuse me, Mr. Burns.
She'll be ready in a minute.

1069
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:38,472
Okay, but hurry up.

1070
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:41,582
<i>There's the referee trying to
talk to him. Samson waves him off.</i>

1071
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,014
<i>Referee steps back and
Wales comes charging in.</i>

1072
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:48,054
<i>You can bet the referee wanted to call a
technical knockout. Danny wouldn't have it.</i>

1073
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:51,420
<i>Wales jabs three stiff lefts to
Danny's face, looking for an opening...</i>

1074
01:10:51,593 --> 01:10:52,992
<i>And there's the final bell.</i>

1075
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:55,129
<i>With this fight over, with Young Samson...</i>

1076
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:58,266
<i>... like his ancient namesake,
blind as a bat, but still game...</i>

1077
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:00,958
<i>... a human punching bag, beaten to a pulp...</i>

1078
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:04,162
Miss Peggy, it's time for your next number.

1079
01:11:04,339 --> 01:11:06,739
Miss Peggy, you just got to hurry.

1080
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:09,570
Come on, come on, step on it.
You're holding up the works.

1081
01:11:09,744 --> 01:11:11,109
Ain't you coming, Miss Peggy?

1082
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:12,473
I can't, Della. I can't.

1083
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:15,480
Well, what will I tell the folks?
What will I tell Mr. Murray?

1084
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:19,609
I don't know. I don't know. Tell him
anything you like, but leave me alone.

1085
01:11:29,531 --> 01:11:33,058
Just another moment and I'll
be all through, Mr. Kenny.

1086
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,032
There. Feels better, doesn't it?

1087
01:11:35,203 --> 01:11:37,728
Yeah. It don't sting as much now, doc.

1088
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,568
Prepare a sedative, please.

1089
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:43,040
- Three grains dissolved in a glass of water.
- Yes, doctor.

1090
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,915
This is entirely my fault. I
never should have let him in this.

1091
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,516
Scotty.

1092
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:51,646
Scotty.

1093
01:11:54,055 --> 01:11:55,420
Yes, Danny?

1094
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,114
You ain't sore at me, are you?

1095
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,817
I did the best I could,
but I just couldn't see him.

1096
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:02,486
- Couldn't find him.
- Sure you did, Danny. We know.

1097
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:04,996
Now, take it easy and
everything'll be all right.

1098
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:06,793
Excuse me, please.

1099
01:12:08,103 --> 01:12:09,900
Now, drink this.

1100
01:12:10,538 --> 01:12:12,199
- Is he hurt badly?
- He's taken a lot.

1101
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:13,841
His excellent condition helps.

1102
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:16,000
Look, how about his eyes? Are they okay?

1103
01:12:16,177 --> 01:12:17,701
Well, that's of more consequence.

1104
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:20,814
The conjunctival membranes are
seriously injured in both eyes.

1105
01:12:20,982 --> 01:12:22,745
Some infection has already set in.

1106
01:12:22,918 --> 01:12:26,354
I found, too, evidence of gritty
substances. Granular material.

1107
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:29,888
- Probably rubbed in every time he was hit.
- Look, doc...

1108
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:33,118
...could it be something like rosin dust?
- Very likely.

1109
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:35,160
I don't know how he ever stood the pain.

1110
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:39,824
If we're to save his sight, I advise getting
him to the hospital at once. Excuse me.

1111
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:46,874
Rosin rubbed in his eyes
with the tip of their gloves.

1112
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:48,907
The dirty, low-down rats.

1113
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:50,408
Wait a minute, Scotty.

1114
01:12:50,578 --> 01:12:54,014
You take care of Danny. That's
your job. This is my department.

1115
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:57,481
Please send an ambulance right away.
Connect me with the chief of staff.

1116
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,585
Find out where the car is and
take care of it like I told you.

1117
01:13:01,756 --> 01:13:04,190
Okay, boss. I'll be ready for you.

1118
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:06,827
Say, Dutch, how long will
it take to get him in shape?

1119
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:08,895
- About 30 days.
- Dutch.

1120
01:13:10,365 --> 01:13:12,833
Relax. Still giving that blowout, Googi?

1121
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:15,367
Sure. The party's still
on. Why not? I never welch.

1122
01:13:15,537 --> 01:13:17,903
You had tough luck, Googi.
We gave up hope already.

1123
01:13:18,073 --> 01:13:19,836
It was one of them surprise comebacks.

1124
01:13:20,008 --> 01:13:21,771
- Sure. That happens.
- No hard feelings?

1125
01:13:21,943 --> 01:13:23,570
What for, 50 grand?

1126
01:13:23,745 --> 01:13:27,545
Listen. I got my limousine downstairs.
What do you say we drive over together?

1127
01:13:27,716 --> 01:13:31,277
Just a second. I don't wanna disappoint
you, but I'd rather go in my own car.

1128
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,853
See, I get kind of nervous
driving in strange cars.

1129
01:13:34,022 --> 01:13:36,115
Sure. Anything you say. What's the diff?

1130
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,282
Come on, boys, let's go. We're wasting time.

1131
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,724
Okay, fellas. I'll see you later.

1132
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:45,256
Googi, tell you the truth, if you
need the 50 G's bad, I can wait.

1133
01:13:45,433 --> 01:13:46,661
Say, a couple of months.

1134
01:13:46,835 --> 01:13:49,599
No, I'm paying off. I don't
like to have nothing on my mind.

1135
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:53,298
Well, Googi, if it was just between
me and you, I'd say call it off.

1136
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:56,273
- But there's Wales. I gotta pay him off.
- Sure. I understand.

1137
01:13:56,444 --> 01:13:59,811
Well, that reminds me. I meant to ask
Cannonball for one of his gloves...

1138
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:02,347
...you know, like a souvenir to show around.

1139
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:06,077
Hey, we're going the wrong way.
Archie, where are you heading?

1140
01:14:06,254 --> 01:14:07,881
Say, what's the idea?

1141
01:14:08,056 --> 01:14:09,785
- Who's that guy?
- Take it easy, Dutch.

1142
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:11,983
Don't get nervous. Happy's a swell driver.

1143
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,993
Now, like I was saying, if I
had one of Cannonball's gloves...

1144
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:17,825
...I might like to take it to
the state boxing commission.

1145
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,466
They might like to look it over.

1146
01:14:19,634 --> 01:14:23,365
Especially after they get the
doctor's report about Samson's eyes.

1147
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,768
You're going screwy. What
have you been sniffing?

1148
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:28,033
Just a little rosin dust.

1149
01:14:30,178 --> 01:14:32,237
- Let me out of here.
- Shut up!

1150
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:35,076
Let that be a lesson to you, Cobb.

1151
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,514
When you're carrying a
gat on your left side...

1152
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:41,246
...you wanna sit on to the right of the
guy you mean to bump off, like I did.

1153
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:43,220
And as for you, you don't have a gat.

1154
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:45,291
I made sure of that with my shoulder.

1155
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,984
Look, Googi, it was all his idea.

1156
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:50,495
I was against it. You don't owe
me a cent. I'll take care of Wales.

1157
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:54,624
Listen, rat. You and Wales are gonna have
to take care of a lot of other things...

1158
01:14:54,803 --> 01:14:57,169
...if Danny's lamps go out.
- Stop the car!

1159
01:14:57,338 --> 01:14:59,431
Pipe down. Quit yapping.

1160
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:10,908
Now, wait here. Monkey around as
though you're fixing the engine.

1161
01:15:11,086 --> 01:15:13,486
And no tricks. Do you understand me?

1162
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:16,590
- All right, boss, grab his feet.
- Okay, Hap. Let's make it fast.

1163
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:19,625
- Sure, boss.
- Now, right around this way.

1164
01:15:24,299 --> 01:15:27,393
There's no use stripping those
labels. They got his mug and prints.

1165
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:29,969
- Okay, boss.
- That reminds me, I better ditch this.

1166
01:15:30,138 --> 01:15:31,867
When they fish him up, all we say is:

1167
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,201
"He didn't have to go
swimming with his hat on."

1168
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,809
- Hey, that's a good one, boss.
- Okay, now...

1169
01:15:36,978 --> 01:15:38,536
Hey.

1170
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:40,305
Hey, boss, what hap...

1171
01:15:41,616 --> 01:15:43,243
Hey, Hap.

1172
01:15:44,886 --> 01:15:47,946
Gee, never figured on that at all.

1173
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,563
How you think they're gonna be?

1174
01:15:56,731 --> 01:16:00,064
You certainly are in a hurry, young
fellow. This is only a checkup.

1175
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:03,500
Nurse, you better draw those
blinds. The light's too strong.

1176
01:16:07,008 --> 01:16:09,340
- Gee, you ought to seen the papers.
- They got Cobb.

1177
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:11,877
No, I mean about the swell
notices the fight got.

1178
01:16:12,046 --> 01:16:14,708
Best fighter since Bob
Fitzsimmons. That's what they said.

1179
01:16:14,883 --> 01:16:16,783
That's fine, Mutt. Thanks.

1180
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:20,250
No kidding. They really went to town
about the great fight you put up.

1181
01:16:20,788 --> 01:16:22,085
What do you think, doc?

1182
01:16:22,257 --> 01:16:25,715
Think they're gonna be all right?
Will I be laid up here long?

1183
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:30,091
Well, it's difficult to say just
now. Possibly a few weeks or so.

1184
01:16:30,265 --> 01:16:33,564
Nurse, continue with the drops
and compresses as ordered.

1185
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:36,966
- I'll see you again tomorrow, son.
- Yeah, sure. Thanks, doc.

1186
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:44,473
You hear that, Eddie?

1187
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:46,307
Three weeks. I'll go daffy in here.

1188
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,382
But Danny, you need rest.
You took a lot of punishment.

1189
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:53,647
Yeah, I guess I did. Can't figure
out how it happened so quick.

1190
01:16:53,821 --> 01:16:57,086
Had him on the run, and all of a
sudden the lights went out on me.

1191
01:16:57,258 --> 01:17:00,022
Excuse me, doctor. You must do something.

1192
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:02,595
Anything at all. I don't
mind the expense, any cost.

1193
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:06,666
It isn't a matter of expense. As I
said, it's only a question of time.

1194
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:09,667
Now, perhaps in a year or two
we may chance another operation.

1195
01:17:09,837 --> 01:17:13,295
A year or two? Why, that means
Danny's finished, he's through.

1196
01:17:13,474 --> 01:17:15,169
As a fighter, I'm afraid he is.

1197
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:19,336
He'll be able to see differences of
light, and make out shapes and forms.

1198
01:17:20,014 --> 01:17:22,414
So that's the sweet wind-up.

1199
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:24,017
That's Danny's finish.

1200
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:25,846
I'm sorry.

1201
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:30,752
Scotty.

1202
01:17:30,925 --> 01:17:33,189
Scotty, where's Danny? Is he all right?

1203
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:35,022
- Yes, he's all right.
- Can I see him?

1204
01:17:35,196 --> 01:17:37,130
He's in there, isn't he?

1205
01:17:37,298 --> 01:17:40,096
He's in there, flat on his
back. And you put him there.

1206
01:17:40,268 --> 01:17:43,669
Only you, not Cannonball Wales. Danny
never would have fought this fight.

1207
01:17:43,838 --> 01:17:46,432
He took a worse licking from
you than he took from Wales.

1208
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:48,633
I've got to see him. You've got to let me in.

1209
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,072
Now, just a minute, Peggy.

1210
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:52,839
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm not gonna pull punches.

1211
01:17:53,014 --> 01:17:57,644
I've seen you give that boy the rawest deal
ever and I'm not gonna let you do it again.

1212
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:02,051
I'm not gonna let you go in there and say
hello for a while and then break his heart.

1213
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:06,387
No, no, I'm all through with that. Please
let me in. I wouldn't do anything to hurt him.

1214
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:08,688
You bet. You've done all you're going to do.

1215
01:18:08,863 --> 01:18:11,661
- Scotty, you don't understand.
- You're no good for him...

1216
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,630
...and he's no good for you, because...

1217
01:18:13,801 --> 01:18:16,167
...well, never mind, he's no good for you.

1218
01:18:16,337 --> 01:18:20,330
- Now try to get that through your head.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

1219
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:23,477
Danny's through with you and
wants you to stay away from here.

1220
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:27,479
- Nurse?
- Yes?

1221
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,378
Who was that, Eddie? Who came in?

1222
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:32,110
Why, just another nurse, Danny.

1223
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,982
- I thought maybe it was...
- What?

1224
01:18:34,155 --> 01:18:35,383
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

1225
01:18:37,892 --> 01:18:39,621
You know... You know, Eddie...

1226
01:18:39,794 --> 01:18:43,423
...I can't hardly see you at all.
You're just like kind of a shadow.

1227
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:46,590
Well, the room's pretty dark
with the blinds down, Danny.

1228
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:49,396
- Yeah, but you can see me good, can't you?
- Well...

1229
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:53,573
Danny, you'd better put those bandages back.

1230
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:56,907
You know, Ed, I figured
that where we came from...

1231
01:18:57,078 --> 01:18:59,569
...we were born with our back to the wall...

1232
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:02,807
...and nothing more could happen
to us and nobody could hurt us.

1233
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:05,316
Then along comes something like this, and...

1234
01:19:05,486 --> 01:19:08,284
Eddie, it's got me scared.

1235
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:10,788
- Really scared.
- What are you talking about, Danny?

1236
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,892
Don't be foolish.

1237
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:15,052
Scotty. Scotty, tell him he'll be all right.

1238
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:16,753
- What? Oh, yes.
- Go ahead, Scotty.

1239
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:18,262
Tell him he'll be better.

1240
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:21,668
Why, sure. Sure, Danny,
everything'll be all right.

1241
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:24,396
- Look, the doctor says...
- The doctor didn't say nothing.

1242
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:25,800
Just routine talk.

1243
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:27,338
What are you trying to do?

1244
01:19:27,508 --> 01:19:31,308
Why don't you tell the truth? I know it
and you know it. I'm as blind as a bat.

1245
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:33,447
Take it easy, Danny. Don't lose your head.

1246
01:19:33,614 --> 01:19:36,447
This is the first round. You
got a long fight in front of you.

1247
01:19:36,617 --> 01:19:41,316
Yeah, I know. Left hand out and keep moving.

1248
01:20:22,764 --> 01:20:26,097
Great stuff. That's two sure-fire
hit numbers so far. We can't miss.

1249
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:29,430
- Terrific. Wait till you hear the second act.
- Eddie, it's swell.

1250
01:20:29,604 --> 01:20:33,131
- One thing you've got is rhythm.
- Come on. I've got to see a hundred people.

1251
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:35,207
- I'll telephone you later.
- Okay, fellas.

1252
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:37,344
Goodbye, Eddie. Good luck.

1253
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:40,845
Don't worry, honey. If there's
anything to sell, I'll sell it.

1254
01:20:41,015 --> 01:20:42,414
- Bye.
- Thanks, bye.

1255
01:21:04,472 --> 01:21:06,463
What's the matter, Ed? Ed, anything wrong?

1256
01:21:06,641 --> 01:21:08,541
Oh, no, nothing, Danny.

1257
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:10,540
How'd it sound to you? Did you listen?

1258
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:13,908
Oh, all good. Those are really nice tunes.

1259
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:16,015
Nice tunes?

1260
01:21:16,184 --> 01:21:20,177
Yeah, it sounded like they ate them
up. All sure-fire, every one of them.

1261
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:22,879
Look, Danny. Danny, I want
you to tell me the truth.

1262
01:21:23,057 --> 01:21:25,491
I want you to tell me what
you're really thinking.

1263
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:29,255
Ed, I don't know anything about
music. What can I tell you?

1264
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:31,125
Listen, Danny, somehow you do know.

1265
01:21:31,299 --> 01:21:33,893
Maybe it's because music is
something you feel down deep.

1266
01:21:34,068 --> 01:21:35,729
Something you feel as much as I do.

1267
01:21:35,903 --> 01:21:38,736
Well, that's all I can do,
just tell you what I feel.

1268
01:21:38,906 --> 01:21:40,305
I don't know nothing about it.

1269
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:41,840
Ed, do me a favor, will you?

1270
01:21:42,009 --> 01:21:44,341
Keep moving around so I
can see you better, huh?

1271
01:21:44,512 --> 01:21:46,412
Sure, sure, Danny.

1272
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:48,840
Would you like the shade pulled up?

1273
01:21:49,016 --> 01:21:52,713
No, no. The lights all
right, Ed, thanks. It's okay.

1274
01:21:52,887 --> 01:21:55,014
Well, look, kid.

1275
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:56,816
Here's the way I feel about it.

1276
01:21:56,991 --> 01:21:59,687
Your business is like any other business.

1277
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:01,385
You either do it or you don't.

1278
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:05,623
You're either a main eventer
or a four-round preliminary boy.

1279
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,165
Down on Forsyth Street...

1280
01:22:07,335 --> 01:22:09,599
...you used to play by
the hour, and I'd listen.

1281
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:11,897
You'd tell me about those
big shot composers...

1282
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:14,701
...who took it on the chin
and went through the mill.

1283
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:18,243
Beethoven, who got the toughest
break of all. Lost his hearing.

1284
01:22:18,412 --> 01:22:20,937
He didn't quit, he didn't
lay down. He just moved in...

1285
01:22:21,115 --> 01:22:23,208
...and kept on punching.
- Yes, but then what?

1286
01:22:23,384 --> 01:22:26,717
You work, you tear your heart out,
and in the end, nobody's interested.

1287
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:28,480
Nobody wants to hear it.

1288
01:22:28,656 --> 01:22:31,318
They're only interested after
you're dead a hundred years.

1289
01:22:31,492 --> 01:22:32,982
Ed, that's an alibi.

1290
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,594
That's an alibi used by
guys who can't deliver.

1291
01:22:35,763 --> 01:22:38,891
But you can do it, and if it's
good, they listen. They gotta listen.

1292
01:22:40,268 --> 01:22:41,929
Well, maybe you're right.

1293
01:22:42,103 --> 01:22:45,937
You know, Danny, you can see
things a lot clearer than I can.

1294
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:50,510
I can see things now that
I could never see before.

1295
01:22:50,678 --> 01:22:54,114
Come on, kid. Do it for
us. Do it for both of us.

1296
01:22:54,282 --> 01:22:57,217
You used to talk about the music
that you heard in the subway...

1297
01:22:57,385 --> 01:22:58,977
...and in the streetcar tracks.

1298
01:22:59,153 --> 01:23:02,088
Music in the 101 different
languages you heard on all sides.

1299
01:23:02,256 --> 01:23:05,851
Music that everybody can hear,
all part of one great big song.

1300
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:08,757
Yeah, the song of the city.

1301
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:13,332
The symphony of New York.

1302
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:17,935
The symphony of its seven millions with
all its color of a hundred different races.

1303
01:23:18,105 --> 01:23:20,573
And the harmony of its thousand discords.

1304
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:22,641
Like the dizzy mad howl of an ambulance...

1305
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,608
...screaming across Forsyth and Delancey.

1306
01:23:51,305 --> 01:23:52,829
Good evening, Mr. Gaul.

1307
01:24:00,548 --> 01:24:02,345
Where could I find Mr. Gaul?

1308
01:24:02,516 --> 01:24:05,815
- Right over there.
- Oh, yes. I see. Thank you.

1309
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:09,115
Mr. Gaul, I tried you at the office,
but they told me you were here.

1310
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:11,451
- I thought maybe...
- I'm busy. See me later.

1311
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:14,094
How many times have I told
you not to dim those foots?

1312
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:16,661
But I've tried to see you
all week. You remember me.

1313
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:18,492
Peggy Nash from Burns and Company.

1314
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,190
Burns and Company? Yeah, sure.

1315
01:24:20,368 --> 01:24:22,768
So, what happened? I thought
you were in the big time.

1316
01:24:22,937 --> 01:24:25,030
Yes I was. Maurice and Margalo. But I left...

1317
01:24:25,206 --> 01:24:27,868
Don't tell me. I know. You got a bum break.

1318
01:24:28,042 --> 01:24:31,409
You were good, but the show
stunk. So what? So you want a job.

1319
01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:32,910
Oh, I'd be so grateful.

1320
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,379
Would you? Swell. Maybe my next show.

1321
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,916
- Thank you. Thank you.
- That's okay, that's okay.

1322
01:24:39,086 --> 01:24:41,316
But, say, you'll have to
put on a little weight.

1323
01:24:41,489 --> 01:24:43,650
The customers down here
don't know from nothing.

1324
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:45,792
Mr. Gaul, I thought maybe I could ask for...

1325
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,929
A little advance? Sure.
Step up to the office.

1326
01:24:49,096 --> 01:24:50,324
I'll give you five bucks...

1327
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:53,023
- Oh, thanks.
- Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

1328
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,732
You won't have to mention that
advance, baby. He will soon enough.

1329
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:10,116
Say, looks like you're
really gonna need that fin.

1330
01:25:10,284 --> 01:25:11,911
No. No, it's just a headache.

1331
01:25:12,086 --> 01:25:15,647
Yeah. Strictly from hunger. You're
telling me. Here, have a drink.

1332
01:25:15,823 --> 01:25:18,121
- Thank you.
- Anybody looking after you, kid?

1333
01:25:18,292 --> 01:25:20,783
- No, but...
- I don't care particularly about sharing...

1334
01:25:20,961 --> 01:25:23,259
...but maybe you better move in with me.

1335
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:25,023
That's awfully nice of you but l...

1336
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,292
I'll do the worrying.
I'll get you an aspirin.

1337
01:25:27,468 --> 01:25:30,904
Once I lived a whole week on them.
A lot cheaper than sandwiches.

1338
01:25:34,742 --> 01:25:37,609
- Anything new?
- Mr. Kenny is here. He's waiting inside.

1339
01:25:37,778 --> 01:25:39,370
Danny?

1340
01:25:41,348 --> 01:25:42,576
Hello, Danny.

1341
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:46,242
What are you doing here alone? Trying
to get a little whiff of old Broadway?

1342
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,149
I came down to hear the traffic.

1343
01:25:48,322 --> 01:25:51,052
Don't get much of it uptown.
It's like a graveyard there.

1344
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:54,353
Danny, you didn't have to come
downtown. I'd come to your apartment.

1345
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:57,497
No, I wanted to come. Glad
for the chance to get out.

1346
01:25:58,933 --> 01:26:02,232
There it is. I wouldn't know it was
you without that bow tie, Scotty.

1347
01:26:02,403 --> 01:26:04,701
Yeah, that's right. Let's sit down, huh?

1348
01:26:04,872 --> 01:26:06,806
No, I'd rather move around. Do you mind?

1349
01:26:06,974 --> 01:26:10,034
Not at all, Danny. What's on your mind?

1350
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:13,578
I sort of figured you
could help me out, Scotty.

1351
01:26:13,748 --> 01:26:15,909
Why, Danny, just name
it. Do you need some cash?

1352
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:19,484
No, no. Not this time. I've taken
plenty of that from you already.

1353
01:26:19,653 --> 01:26:22,087
Danny, how do you mean?
It's your money. You made it.

1354
01:26:22,256 --> 01:26:24,656
I've known all along you've
been carrying me, Scotty.

1355
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:26,725
I'm gonna pay you back, every penny of it.

1356
01:26:26,927 --> 01:26:29,521
Danny, everything I've got
is yours. Don't you know that?

1357
01:26:29,697 --> 01:26:33,326
I know. It's just that I can't stand
sitting around in that room any more.

1358
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:36,163
Well, that's simple. We'll
just get you a better place.

1359
01:26:36,337 --> 01:26:37,565
No, the place is all right.

1360
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:41,196
It's just that I gotta get something
to do. The whole world doing things...

1361
01:26:41,375 --> 01:26:43,775
...and me stumbling
around in a 2-by-4 grave.

1362
01:26:43,944 --> 01:26:46,071
No morning, no sun, no nothing.

1363
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:48,215
I can't take it, Scotty. Can't take it.

1364
01:26:48,382 --> 01:26:52,011
I keep talking to myself by the hour
and I got too much time to think.

1365
01:26:52,987 --> 01:26:54,420
About Peggy?

1366
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:58,289
Scotty, get me something to do
where I can be around people...

1367
01:26:58,459 --> 01:26:59,756
...and feel life going on.

1368
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:02,623
Where everything isn't just a
cold, gray fog smothering me.

1369
01:27:02,797 --> 01:27:05,197
I'll do anything. I don't
care what it is, anything.

1370
01:27:05,366 --> 01:27:08,893
Coming up here, I heard a
newsboy yelling and I remembered.

1371
01:27:09,069 --> 01:27:12,561
I used to do that. I used to sell
papers and I'd like to do it again.

1372
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:15,231
Well, that's a fine idea,
Danny. Sure, why not?

1373
01:27:15,409 --> 01:27:18,606
Just to get something to do. I don't
care what. Just something to do.

1374
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:21,009
Look, rest assured.
Whatever it is, we'll do it.

1375
01:27:21,182 --> 01:27:23,275
If we have to comb the whole town.

1376
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:26,977
Just look at that. They guaranteed
me it was gonna be a permanent wave.

1377
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:31,056
Ain't permanent, ain't a wave, ain't
nothing. It's just hair. But it's all my own.

1378
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:33,587
You know, Gladys, it's funny.

1379
01:27:33,761 --> 01:27:36,958
After all the places I've
been, things I've done...

1380
01:27:37,131 --> 01:27:39,497
...l've just moved across town, that's all.

1381
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:41,567
From East Side to West Side.

1382
01:27:41,735 --> 01:27:43,726
You look out and see the same back alleys...

1383
01:27:43,904 --> 01:27:46,134
...the same fire escapes,
the same clotheslines.

1384
01:27:46,307 --> 01:27:47,774
I'm back just where I started.

1385
01:27:47,942 --> 01:27:49,671
Wished I was back where I started...

1386
01:27:49,844 --> 01:27:52,779
...with a guy named Jake Smith
right over in Jersey City.

1387
01:27:52,947 --> 01:27:55,279
He was just a grease
monkey in a junkyard garage.

1388
01:27:55,449 --> 01:27:58,816
He only made 20 bucks a week, but he
was great on this thing called love.

1389
01:27:59,486 --> 01:28:02,922
I was a dizzy dope. I was
gonna burn up the world.

1390
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:06,253
I got burned myself. Ever
watch a moth fly in the flame?

1391
01:28:06,427 --> 01:28:08,554
Can't stop them till their wings burn off.

1392
01:28:08,729 --> 01:28:10,788
Believe me, if Jake would take me back now...

1393
01:28:10,965 --> 01:28:13,957
...l'd crawl on my knees right
over to Jersey City, so help me.

1394
01:28:18,505 --> 01:28:22,134
We girls never get wise until it's too late.

1395
01:28:24,411 --> 01:28:26,174
Let me tell you...

1396
01:28:27,715 --> 01:28:30,946
What's the matter, Peggy,
got hay fever or something?

1397
01:28:31,118 --> 01:28:32,847
Peggy.

1398
01:28:33,687 --> 01:28:36,747
I'm sorry, Peggy. I really didn't mean to...

1399
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:41,322
Well, I didn't care for that routine
that Gaul put in the show today either.

1400
01:28:41,495 --> 01:28:43,895
Nowadays the public wants class.

1401
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:47,431
Give them their money's worth, that's
what I say. Here, have a cigarette.

1402
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:50,370
Let's see what's fit to print today.

1403
01:28:50,537 --> 01:28:53,404
"Blond beauty marries her fifth."

1404
01:28:53,574 --> 01:28:57,533
She gets five and I don't
get one. Call that democracy?

1405
01:28:58,078 --> 01:29:00,911
"Fifty more millionaires reported last year."

1406
01:29:01,081 --> 01:29:05,711
Reported for what? Wish one
of them would report to me.

1407
01:29:07,388 --> 01:29:11,381
Say, here's a guy with the same
name as that pug you told me about.

1408
01:29:11,558 --> 01:29:14,288
"Edward Kenny, who will
conduct his own symphony...

1409
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:17,487
...with the Philharmonic at
Carnegie Hall this Thursday night.

1410
01:29:17,665 --> 01:29:21,965
<i>This will be the world premiere of
Mr. Kenny's symphony, An American..."</i>

1411
01:29:22,136 --> 01:29:25,902
Kenny. Could he maybe be a relative
of that old heartache of yours?

1412
01:29:26,073 --> 01:29:27,904
Let me see.

1413
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:35,507
Doing all right, Mutt?

1414
01:29:35,683 --> 01:29:39,380
We'll paste these clippings in a scrapbook.
Tomorrow we'll put the write-ups in.

1415
01:29:39,553 --> 01:29:41,851
Sure. This is gonna be
a very fancy scrapbook.

1416
01:29:42,022 --> 01:29:43,614
I'll put them together with yours.

1417
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:46,089
Keep away from mine. I
don't wanna jinx the kid.

1418
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,728
<i>- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Mr. Sinclair. Evening Post up yet?</i>

1419
01:29:48,896 --> 01:29:51,865
<i>- Right here. Late final.
- Final Variety hot off the press, Danny.</i>

1420
01:29:52,032 --> 01:29:53,090
Okay, Smitty.

1421
01:29:53,267 --> 01:29:56,464
<i>Oh, Mutt? Will you look in that
Variety and see if there's anything...</i>

1422
01:29:56,637 --> 01:29:58,332
...about Peg this week?
- Sure.

1423
01:29:58,505 --> 01:29:59,597
How are you, Danny?

1424
01:29:59,773 --> 01:30:02,571
Well, did you see my scrib in
the column yesterday about you?

1425
01:30:02,743 --> 01:30:05,541
Yeah, Mutt read it to me. I didn't like it.

1426
01:30:05,713 --> 01:30:08,477
Why? What's the matter?
I only wanted to be nice.

1427
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:10,674
Don't like that tear-jerking sob stuff.

1428
01:30:10,851 --> 01:30:14,082
"One of life's little tragedies."
I don't want nobody crying over me.

1429
01:30:14,254 --> 01:30:16,051
I don't want no benefits. I'm on my own.

1430
01:30:16,223 --> 01:30:19,124
- I got no complaints.
- All right, Danny. I just didn't know.

1431
01:30:19,293 --> 01:30:21,124
All right, Pep. So now you know, huh?

1432
01:30:21,295 --> 01:30:23,354
Okay. Well, I'll be seeing you, Danny.

1433
01:30:25,032 --> 01:30:26,397
- Find anything, Mutt?
- No.

1434
01:30:26,567 --> 01:30:28,467
Maybe I missed it. I'll start over again.

1435
01:30:28,635 --> 01:30:31,399
Look in the vaudeville gossip
column. Maybe something there.

1436
01:30:34,608 --> 01:30:36,235
Wait for me. Hello, Danny. Mutt.

1437
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:39,470
What are you doing? You ought to
be at Carnegie. What's the matter?

1438
01:30:39,646 --> 01:30:41,910
Nothing, just skipped out
a minute to shake hands.

1439
01:30:42,082 --> 01:30:43,606
Getting kind of jumpy, huh, kid?

1440
01:30:43,784 --> 01:30:46,184
The nearer it gets to 9:00,
the faster my heart goes.

1441
01:30:46,353 --> 01:30:49,652
Well, hold that ticker down, it'll
hurt your timing. We're not worried.

1442
01:30:49,823 --> 01:30:51,984
We know it's good, don't we, huh?

1443
01:30:52,326 --> 01:30:54,726
Hey, what am I, a French
general getting a medal?

1444
01:30:54,895 --> 01:30:57,159
- See you later, Danny. So long, Mutt.
- Good luck.

1445
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:59,856
- Well...
- Good luck, kid. Hold that ticker down.

1446
01:31:00,034 --> 01:31:03,401
I will. Carnegie Hall, and hurry.

1447
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,432
We're gonna be proud of him, Danny.

1448
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:11,476
I'm proud of him right
now. Well, come on, Mutt...

1449
01:31:11,645 --> 01:31:14,808
...you run home quick and get
yourself all dolled up, see?

1450
01:31:14,982 --> 01:31:17,473
And I think you better get a shave too.

1451
01:31:17,651 --> 01:31:19,482
Why? I'm staying right here, ain't I?

1452
01:31:19,653 --> 01:31:22,622
Oh, no. You're going up to that
concert. Here's the pasteboards.

1453
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:24,917
That ain't right. This
is your brother's show.

1454
01:31:25,092 --> 01:31:26,889
I'm staying here. This is your night.

1455
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:29,393
I don't want to go up there
and jinx the kid. Here.

1456
01:31:29,563 --> 01:31:30,894
What Are you talking about?

1457
01:31:31,065 --> 01:31:33,056
If it wasn't for you, he wouldn't be there.

1458
01:31:33,233 --> 01:31:35,997
I don't wanna be no skeleton
in the closet. Now, take these.

1459
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:38,070
Danny, why don't you go up and see it all.

1460
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:40,138
Go ahead. Hear everything for yourself.

1461
01:31:40,307 --> 01:31:43,003
I know all that music backwards.
Backwards and forwards.

1462
01:31:43,177 --> 01:31:46,112
Besides, I got it all right
here. Will you take these ducats?

1463
01:31:48,148 --> 01:31:50,616
Thanks, Danny. As soon as
it's over, I'll come back...

1464
01:31:50,784 --> 01:31:52,979
...and tell you all about it.
- I'll be here.

1465
01:31:53,153 --> 01:31:56,088
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- No, no. You go ahead. Go on.

1466
01:31:56,256 --> 01:31:58,315
- So long, Danny.
- Good night, Mutt.

1467
01:37:51,044 --> 01:37:52,636
Speech!

1468
01:37:52,813 --> 01:37:54,440
Speech!

1469
01:37:55,348 --> 01:37:57,680
Ladies and gentlemen...

1470
01:37:58,552 --> 01:38:01,419
...once in each man's lifetime...

1471
01:38:01,588 --> 01:38:04,113
...there comes a supreme moment.

1472
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:07,783
For me, here and now, this is it.

1473
01:38:07,961 --> 01:38:09,758
Not only because of the generous way...

1474
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:12,125
...in which you have received my symphony...

1475
01:38:13,733 --> 01:38:18,636
...but because I can share this moment
with one whose contribution to this music...

1476
01:38:18,805 --> 01:38:22,297
...is far greater than
any that I could have made.

1477
01:38:22,476 --> 01:38:25,877
I am speaking of and to my brother.

1478
01:38:26,046 --> 01:38:29,607
He truly inspired the music
that you have heard tonight.

1479
01:38:29,783 --> 01:38:31,273
For in his life story...

1480
01:38:31,451 --> 01:38:34,852
...was a story of the great city
as I felt it in terms of music.

1481
01:38:35,021 --> 01:38:36,750
No, he's not a musician.

1482
01:38:36,923 --> 01:38:39,221
He couldn't read a single note...

1483
01:38:39,392 --> 01:38:41,656
...but in his heart and soul...

1484
01:38:41,828 --> 01:38:45,457
...there was such wealth
of music. Music of the city.

1485
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:51,502
The music that led him on to glory,
to conquest, to tragedy and defeat.

1486
01:38:51,671 --> 01:38:54,367
But in that very defeat, he conquered.

1487
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:58,739
For of all the men that I have come
to know, who have loved and lost...

1488
01:38:58,945 --> 01:39:01,573
...this boy retained a great nobility...

1489
01:39:01,748 --> 01:39:05,047
...that far surpassed any possible conquest.

1490
01:39:05,218 --> 01:39:07,846
Yes, my brother made music with his fists...

1491
01:39:08,021 --> 01:39:10,114
...so that I might make a gentler music...

1492
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:12,383
...the symphony that you have heard tonight.

1493
01:39:12,559 --> 01:39:15,153
It is his as much as mine.

1494
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:19,025
And so, with deep pride and gratitude...

1495
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,657
...I dedicate this music to my brother...

1496
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:25,736
...known to most or you...

1497
01:39:25,906 --> 01:39:27,237
...as Young Samson.

1498
01:39:37,284 --> 01:39:40,185
Mutt. Mutt.

1499
01:39:42,389 --> 01:39:43,617
Hello, Danny.

1500
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:46,020
Hello, Mr. Cahn. I wondered
what happened to you.

1501
01:39:46,192 --> 01:39:49,593
- Kept you working late tonight?
- Why aren't you at your brother's concert?

1502
01:39:49,763 --> 01:39:53,324
I heard over the radio. Judging from
applause there must've been 5000 people.

1503
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,865
- It was a success.
- I'll say.

1504
01:39:55,035 --> 01:39:58,061
They're crazy about Eddie's
music. Kept cheering and hollering.

1505
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:01,105
Begging him to make a speech.
Imagine that brother of mine...

1506
01:40:01,274 --> 01:40:03,435
...talking to all those people.
- What'd he say?

1507
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:05,737
Oh, nothing much. Just
thanks and appreciation.

1508
01:40:05,912 --> 01:40:07,937
It must be wonderful to click that way.

1509
01:40:08,114 --> 01:40:09,877
- You should be proud.
- I certainly am.

1510
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,814
I'll bet. Well, that's fine,
Danny. See you tomorrow.

1511
01:40:12,986 --> 01:40:15,921
- Yeah, thanks, and good night.
- Good night.

1512
01:40:24,097 --> 01:40:26,031
What paper, please?

1513
01:40:30,637 --> 01:40:32,366
What do you read?

1514
01:40:48,922 --> 01:40:50,947
Hello, Peg.

1515
01:40:53,059 --> 01:40:55,118
Hello, Danny.

1516
01:40:56,529 --> 01:40:58,156
Well.

1517
01:40:58,732 --> 01:41:00,791
Hey, this is all right.

1518
01:41:00,967 --> 01:41:03,265
This is really a night for the books.

1519
01:41:03,436 --> 01:41:06,769
I just finished listening to
Eddie's concert on the radio...

1520
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,669
...and it's a big success.

1521
01:41:08,842 --> 01:41:10,707
And now Peg's here.

1522
01:41:10,877 --> 01:41:14,040
That's all right for one night. Did you...?

1523
01:41:14,214 --> 01:41:15,681
Did you hear about the concert?

1524
01:41:16,316 --> 01:41:18,181
Yes, Danny. I was there.

1525
01:41:18,351 --> 01:41:21,650
You were? Well, great, wasn't it?

1526
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:24,221
Can you imagine that
skinny-legged, redheaded kid...

1527
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:26,655
...used to practice out on the fire escape...

1528
01:41:26,826 --> 01:41:30,057
...writes a symphony that
sets a whole town on its ear.

1529
01:41:30,463 --> 01:41:33,557
Well, I guess we ain't got no squawk coming.

1530
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,465
Looks like everybody from
Forsyth Street's doing all right.

1531
01:41:37,637 --> 01:41:38,899
Oh, Danny.

1532
01:41:40,407 --> 01:41:42,341
What's the matter, Peg?

1533
01:41:42,509 --> 01:41:44,306
What are you crying for?

1534
01:41:44,477 --> 01:41:47,037
You just came to visit an old pal.

1535
01:41:47,213 --> 01:41:49,147
Aren't you glad to see me?

1536
01:41:49,315 --> 01:41:51,112
I can't tell you how much, Danny.

1537
01:41:51,284 --> 01:41:53,081
Are you all right?

1538
01:41:53,253 --> 01:41:56,814
Sure, I'm better than that.
I got a soft touch here.

1539
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:59,151
Keeps me out in the air.

1540
01:41:59,325 --> 01:42:01,122
I sell a hundred papers and make a buck.

1541
01:42:01,294 --> 01:42:04,092
Besides, I got a lot of good
customers and they keep me busy.

1542
01:42:04,264 --> 01:42:06,824
I don't get much time for moping.

1543
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,230
Then you are all right.

1544
01:42:09,402 --> 01:42:10,630
Oh, sure, I'm fine.

1545
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:13,898
I still got my two eyes and
they're getting better all the time.

1546
01:42:14,074 --> 01:42:16,975
That's what the doctor said. A
year, maybe a little bit longer.

1547
01:42:17,143 --> 01:42:19,077
I can wait. Used to waiting.

1548
01:42:19,245 --> 01:42:23,705
Besides, I can always
see anything I wanna see.

1549
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:26,082
I saw you, Peg.

1550
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:30,856
Danny, if I could help now, I'd do anything.

1551
01:42:31,024 --> 01:42:33,219
Well, you have.

1552
01:42:33,393 --> 01:42:36,590
Look, I never told nobody this...

1553
01:42:37,297 --> 01:42:38,525
...but...

1554
01:42:38,698 --> 01:42:42,395
...I always knew that
someday you'd pass by here...

1555
01:42:42,936 --> 01:42:44,198
...and you'd see me.

1556
01:42:44,537 --> 01:42:46,334
Always knew that...

1557
01:42:46,873 --> 01:42:49,273
...because...
- Yes, Danny?

1558
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:54,076
Because you were always my girl.
That's right, ain't it, Peg?

1559
01:42:54,247 --> 01:42:56,613
Always, Danny. Always.

1560
01:43:01,454 --> 01:43:04,014
Yes, brother, it's beautiful.

1561
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:06,818
Didn't I tell you there was
a heart beating in the city?

1562
01:43:06,993 --> 01:43:10,156
I've been all over. East Side, West Side...

1563
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:12,423
...down in the subways,
up in the elevators...

1564
01:43:12,599 --> 01:43:15,090
...flat with the river. And I report success.

1565
01:43:15,268 --> 01:43:17,065
There's a heart beating in the city.

1566
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:20,502
You wont find it in the timetables,
and you'll never see it advertised.

1567
01:43:20,673 --> 01:43:22,231
But take it from me, brother...

1568
01:43:22,408 --> 01:43:23,807
...there's love in New York.

1569
01:43:23,977 --> 01:43:25,535
And I know...

1570
01:43:25,712 --> 01:43:27,976
...because I got clothes on my back.

1571
01:44:13,259 --> 01:44:15,250
