Have you ever forgotten...

4
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,740
the commandment
of your Qin ancestors...

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,940
to unite all under heaven?

6
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,980
No, never.

7
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,740
Ying Zheng wouldn't dare!

8
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,660
King Ying Zheng.

9
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,500
Have you ever forgotten

of your ancestors
to unify all under heaven?

11
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,220
No, Ying Zheng has never forgotten,
not for a moment.

Chapter One: The King Of Qin

38
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,100
The Queen Mother's Quarters

39
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,540
Prime Minister Lu Buwei
at the Queen Mother's service.

40
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,740
If I am not mistaken...

41
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,700
it has been almost seven years
since we last met.

42
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,020
The Queen Mother has a fine memory.

43
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,660
That was when he first entered
into your service.

44
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,340
And look at his achievement.

45
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,820
Today he bears the title
of Marquis.

46
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,140
It's not the fault
of the Marquis.

47
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,780
After all, he used to be
your retainer.

48
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,420
Where would he be today if you had not
given him the opportunity to serve me?

49
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,140
Marquis or not...

50
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,700
he is still your servant.

51
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,700
How true.

52
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,740
However...

53
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,460
I do enjoy his company
a great deal.

54
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,300
It is time my son
should get married.

55
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,700
The Marquis has found
a lady for him.

56
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,300
She is a princess
from the Kingdom of Han.

57
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,420
The princess calls me
her uncle.

58
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,460
Are you aware...

59
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,420
that your son
is going to eliminate Han?

60
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,540
Really?

61
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,460
If Han is eliminated,
won't my homeland of Zhao be next?

62
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,940
What will happen to my position
if Zhao is eliminated?

63
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,940
I have no interest except
the well-being of the Queen Mother.

64
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,140
But if Qin eliminates
the other six kingdoms...

65
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,300
who will pay tribute
to Her Majesty?

66
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,860
Clever, aren't you?

67
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,060
Take good care
of the Queen Mother for me.

68
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,340
Trust me...

69
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,300
I have no interest
in politics.

70
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
But I must ask...

71
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,140
once the six kingdoms
are eliminated...

72
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,060
what use will the king
have for you...

73
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,700
the prime minister?

74
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,620
Then allow me to congratulate you
on your son's marriage.

75
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,460
The King's War Council

76
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,020
All of Han is in our hands,
except for the capital.

77
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,540
The city has been under siege
by our troops for almost 30 days.

78
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,580
The Han people have lost
their will to defend.

79
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,340
But our provisions
can only last for seven days.

80
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,300
Therefore, I beg you to make
a final decision as to war or peace.

81
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,540
If we destroy Han,
the whole world will be shocked.

82
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,380
What if all six kingdoms
join forces against us?

83
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,820
It's in our best interest
to preserve Han.

84
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,580
I disagree.

85
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,620
We have amassed enough troops
to take the Han capital with ease.

86
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,940
There's no reason
to accept a stalemate...

87
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,260
when you can have victory.

88
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,620
Li Si, you are not
the prime minister yet.

89
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,540
- Han Ambassador.
- Present.

90
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,860
You are free to return to Han.

91
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,500
Yes, Your Highness.

92
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,580
The king and the nobles of Han
will be eternally grateful to you...

93
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,300
for preserving Han.

94
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,460
That's fine.

95
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,860
Prime Minister,
I want a drink.

96
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,780
Bring me some wine.

97
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,220
This is not a toast...

98
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,300
this is a punishment.

99
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,420
Why am I punishing myself...

100
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,020
when I should be celebrating?

101
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,460
Because...

102
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,540
we have 250,000 troops ready...

103
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,380
to attack the Han capital!

104
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,780
But instead...

105
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,220
I have been advised
not to destroy Han.

106
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,820
That it is in our best interest
to preserve Han.

107
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,660
I should be punished
for keeping my silence.

108
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,860
Li Si, repeat what you have said!

109
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,260
Your Majesty...

110
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,020
are you also punishing me
with this drink?

111
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
No, I'm punishing myself...

112
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,460
for allowing you to remain
prime minister until today.

113
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,820
It doesn't matter who is king.

114
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,020
I will always be...

115
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,580
the prime minister.

116
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,460
In the name of Qin,
kill Lu Buwei!

117
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,460
I dare you.

118
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,860
Prime Minister.

119
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Please!

120
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,420
I have no choice but to dismiss
Prime Minister Lu.

121
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,140
Li Si...

122
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,020
issue the following decree:

123
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,060
Remove Mr. Lu's title...

124
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,980
but give him 5,000 tons of grain...

125
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,780
100 pounds of gold,
10 good horses.

126
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,420
Your Majesty, I ask to be dismissed
as the commanding officer.

128
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,420
I'll stay at home
and await my punishment.

129
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,060
You're going to take the Han capital
in seven days.

130
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,180
But if you fail,
how should I punish you?

131
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,740
Cut off my head!

132
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,340
But Your Majesty, I hear that
you will marry a Han princess.

133
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,940
I don't want your head...

134
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,980
I want your horse.

135
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,540
You have a wonderful steed.

136
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,060
How do you judge a good horse?

137
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,460
By his teeth.

138
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,140
Wrong.

139
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,860
By his eyes.

140
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,980
You can tell everything
about an animal...

141
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,820
from his eyes.

142
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,540
Marquis?

143
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,700
Yes, Your Majesty?

144
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,380
I understand that
you'll be my uncle?

145
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,340
This is the Queen Mother
and the prime minister's idea.

146
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,620
You're always so busy.

147
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,060
Please come riding
with me today.

148
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm afraid of heights.
I can't ride.

149
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,660
Afraid of heights, are you?

150
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,420
Even on a horse's back?

151
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,660
Your Majesty, it tickles.

152
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,660
General Fan.

153
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,700
His Majesty asks the Marquis,
is it high or not?

154
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,940
As high as high can be.

155
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,420
Cross!

156
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,380
Cross!

157
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,620
Remove your robe.

158
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,500
How much is two times three?

159
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,140
Two times three is six.

160
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,140
How much is three times three?

161
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,500
Whatever His Majesty
wishes it to be!

162
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Marquis, what's wrong?

163
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,460
The Queen Mother is worried.

164
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,820
I've just been entertaining
His Majesty.

165
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,260
That way he'll trust me.

166
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,460
Lady Zhao has arrived.

167
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
- Good morning, Lady Zhao.
- Good morning.

168
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,740
Good morning, My Lady.

169
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,340
When you think of it...

170
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,620
my son's marriage
is quite unfair to Lady Zhao.

171
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,300
When we were hostages
in Zhao...

172
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,660
Ying Zheng's father
could not do housework.

173
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,460
Nor could I.

174
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,740
So we hired her to help out.

175
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,380
She was only this high.

176
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,980
When she had free time,
she would help Ying Zheng herd horses.

177
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,500
She was such a nice girl
and beautiful.

178
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,300
No wonder my son
loved her so much.

179
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,740
She possesses a strong will
and a somewhat wild personality.

180
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,900
It might be hard to reign her in.

181
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,820
Do you think she has
changed her ways?

182
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,900
No.

183
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,420
When we were allowed
to return to Qin...

184
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,900
she had no intention
of coming with us.

185
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,420
Ying Zheng started to cry.

186
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
She laughed and said...

187
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,460
''What are you crying about?
I'll go with you.''

188
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,220
So she joined us.

189
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,260
Your Majesty...

190
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,140
I've come to say farewell.

191
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,340
Where are you going?

192
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,100
I'm going home to Zhao.

193
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,020
Why are you leaving me?
Why?

194
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,980
Your daily visits seem
more like an obligation.

195
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,300
Is this what our love
has become?

196
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,460
Do you still know what I want?

197
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,780
How I want to live?

198
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,820
You don't.

199
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,660
I must smile all the time...

200
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,260
speak softly and walk gently
with my head down.

201
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,100
I feel like an object
on display in your palace!

202
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,060
I want to speak in a loud voice.

203
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,100
Cry when I feel like crying.

204
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,420
I don't want to be nice
to everybody.

205
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,820
I can't live like this...

206
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,300
but I have for so long.

207
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,580
I'm leaving.

208
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,660
Do you remember
when we were young?

209
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,820
When it snowed in the winter...

210
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,580
we frolicked in the hay.

211
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,180
We were cold and hungry,
but we were happy.

212
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,820
We would fall into the hay.

213
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,620
It was so warm...

214
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,780
we would fall asleep...

215
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,420
in each other's arms.

216
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,980
You used to be an innocent boy
from Zhao.

217
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,220
Now you are a king.

218
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,140
You are no longer
the person I once knew.

219
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,700
You are right.

220
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,820
Now I understand
why you want to leave.

221
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,820
I was only waiting
for the day when...

222
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,980
I would be king of all
under heaven...

223
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,860
then I would marry you
and make you my queen.

224
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,260
I thought that this
was what you wanted.

225
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,260
Let's go back to Zhao.

226
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,300
Then we can be together again.

227
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,060
The way it was before.

228
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,860
I know this is only a dream.

229
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Day is breaking.

230
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,820
Please accompany me
to the Imperial Map Hall.

231
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,700
Then you may go.

232
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,700
Unfurl the map.

233
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,420
Your Majesty, this is the map
of the unified empire.

234
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,460
You painted this map?

235
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,700
Yes, Your Majesty,
it is their work.

236
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,620
You've done a fine job.

237
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,980
Are you from Qin?

238
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,860
Your Majesty,
they are from Han.

239
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,740
I see.

240
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,620
Yes, Han will soon be eliminated.

241
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,580
You are crying for your kingdom.

242
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,900
You are loyal subjects of Han.

243
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,340
All the people of Han
are crying now...

244
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,420
because your king orders gifts
to be presented to Qin--

245
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,780
1,000 horses,
10,000 pounds of gold...

246
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,700
1 million sheaves of silk.

247
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,740
I don't want these gifts.

248
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,060
They belong to the people of Han.

249
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,940
Han will cease to exist.

250
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,300
But...

251
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,580
a greater empire will emerge.

252
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,380
Qin and the other six kingdoms...

253
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,660
as far as the eye can see
will be unified.

254
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,580
All people under heaven
will be its subjects.

255
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,820
The empire will have
only one ruler...

256
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,940
one benevolent ruler.

257
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,900
Once unification is achieved...

258
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,860
he will protect...

259
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,340
all his subjects.

260
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,180
The empire will be divided
into provinces...

261
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,660
under the administration
of good officials.

262
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,460
Grain will grow everywhere.

263
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,580
There will be peace
and prosperity for all.

264
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,860
Roads will extend
to the remote border areas...

265
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,500
and the Great Wall will stretch
across the northern border...

266
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,380
to keep the barbarians out.

267
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,260
And to commemorate
the unification...

268
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,820
stone tablets will be erected
by the sea.

269
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,420
Lady Zhao, please stay with us!

270
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,620
Your Majesty!

271
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,940
Our army has commenced the final attack
on the Han capital.

272
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,100
Your Majesty!

273
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,060
Let me go!

274
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,060
Ying Zheng!

275
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,340
How dare you!

276
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,660
Let him come to me.

277
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,060
Kneel before His Majesty!

278
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,980
I am the Prince of Yan.
I won't kneel before the king.

279
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,500
Carry on.

280
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,940
Lady Zhao, don't leave.

281
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,060
I request that Your Majesty stop
the Qin invasion of Han...

282
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,060
and leave the six kingdoms
in peace.

283
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,340
Otherwise--

284
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,980
Then what?

285
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,700
Within five steps...

286
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,500
blood will be shed,
yours and mine.

287
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,660
Even if you kill me...

288
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,500
someone will complete
the unification.

289
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,380
If not me...

290
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
then maybe you.

291
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,860
After 550 years...

292
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,980
what has become
of the hundreds of kingdoms?

293
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,420
Today there are only seven left.

294
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Small kingdoms
want to become bigger...

295
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,260
the bigger ones want to annex
the smaller.

296
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,820
This war has lasted
for 550 years.

297
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,740
The people have been living...

298
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,740
in hell.

299
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,700
As long as
the six kingdoms remain...

300
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,940
the world will never know peace.

301
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,780
The six kingdoms must be eliminated.
Nobody can stop the unification.

302
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,180
Nobody.

303
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,300
Nobody.

304
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,980
The truth is as long
as Qin remains...

305
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,900
the world will not know peace.

306
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,500
Don't come near me!

307
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,540
Don't move!

308
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,740
I know you are unhappy
as my hostage here in Qin.

309
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,780
I could let you go back
to Yan...

310
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,460
but the King of Yan will simply
send you back here again.

311
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,420
He will do this
until Yan is eliminated.

312
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,700
Why break your father's heart?

313
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,820
I have raised my sword
before Your Majesty.

314
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Why don't you kill me?

315
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,260
You are my brother.

316
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,860
Your Majesty, bowl!

317
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,780
Your Majesty, bowl again!

318
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,700
Qin Eliminates Han

319
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,220
A great feast for our soldiers!

320
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,740
Now it's time to consider...

321
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,500
how to take Yan.

322
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,620
Once Yan is eliminated...

323
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,420
the northern territories
will be united.

324
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,380
Once we control the north,
unification will be close at hand.

325
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,020
But I must have a reason
to attack Yan.

326
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,020
Otherwise,
the southern kingdoms...

327
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,020
unite against us.

328
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,980
Why don't you let
the Prince of Yan go back?

329
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,700
Go back.

330
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,980
Where to?

331
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,540
Back to Yan.

332
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,220
If you let him return to Yan,
he'll send an assassin to kill you.

333
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,780
As soon as the assassin makes
an attempt, everyone will know...

334
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,340
and you'll have your reason.

335
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,820
Yan may even surrender
without bloodshed.

336
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,860
How can we make him
send an assassin?

337
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,820
Find someone he trusts.

338
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,380
Who?

339
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,740
Who?

340
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,500
Do I have a beautiful face?

341
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,220
Most beautiful.

342
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,460
What if it is branded?

343
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,420
My Lady must be joking.

344
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,620
Prison warden
at your service, My Lady.

345
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,580
Please rise.

346
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,100
Warden.

347
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,700
Present.

348
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,700
Who are those prisoners?

349
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,980
Common criminals, war prisoners.

350
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,460
- Is branding difficult?
- No.

351
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,300
Is there someone you want released?

352
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,700
I can take care of it.

353
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,060
I want you to brand my face.

354
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,260
What did My Lady say?

355
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,900
I said, I want you
to brand my face.

356
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,940
My Lady has scared me to death.

357
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,420
I never d-a-r-e
do such a thing!

358
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,340
You dare to disobey me?

359
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,700
My clothes, do they look nice?

360
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,980
Yes, they do.

361
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,300
Don't get them dirty.

362
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,820
No, I won't.

363
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,580
Do you have a heavy hand?

364
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,860
No, I don't.

365
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,140
Does it hurt?

366
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,740
No.

367
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,740
Even if it hurts...

368
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,540
don't scream.

369
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,220
I won't scream.

370
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,980
I won't.

371
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,140
What have you done?

372
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,220
Let me look.

373
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,900
I'm going to kill that warden!

374
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,780
Don't punish them.
It was my idea.

375
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,620
What?

376
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,180
If I didn't do it,
Prince Yan wouldn't trust me.

377
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,380
So you are the one
who will go to Yan with him?

378
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,860
That way I can make him
send an assassin.

379
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,700
Once I succeed, there will be
no need for bloodshed.

380
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,300
Do you think
this is child's play?

381
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,820
War is everywhere.

382
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,500
Dead bodies are piled
as high as mountains...

383
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,420
<i>blood flows like the rivers.</i>

384
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,620
Didn't you say that you would
protect the people of all kingdoms?

385
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,860
Didn't you promise to let them
live in peace?

386
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,700
You said that and I believed you.

387
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,260
As long as you see this mark on my face,
you will never forget your promise.

388
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,900
My face...

389
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,860
is it ugly?

390
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,900
It's beautiful.

391
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,940
For the past few years...

392
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,500
we've been drifting apart.

393
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,380
You are the King of Qin.

394
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,780
I didn't know what
I could do for you.

395
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,420
That was why I wanted
to return home to Zhao.

396
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,540
Now I know that you are...

397
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,660
different from other kings.

398
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,580
You have a great cause.

399
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,540
Finally, I've found a way
to help you.

400
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,060
Sorry to keep you waiting,
my lord.

401
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,340
Where's the king?

402
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,300
The king is otherwise occupied.

403
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,740
His Majesty has asked me
to drink with you.

404
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,300
- Ridiculous.
- Just a moment.

405
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,100
His Majesty has something
to show you.

406
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,180
If you don't have a look,
you will regret it.

407
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,100
This way, please.

408
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,940
Turn around.

409
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,380
This is the unification map.

410
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,140
Han is part of the unified country.

411
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,620
So is Yan.

412
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,300
So are all six kingdoms!

413
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,260
His Majesty has asked me
to tell Your Highness...

414
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,460
Yan is sure to be eliminated.

415
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,140
Your Highness is welcome
to stay here in Qin.

416
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,500
You can no longer be
the Prince of Yan...

417
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,620
but my king will grant you...

418
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,740
a position as a Qin official.

419
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,980
Also, His Majesty
has a message for you.

420
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,740
Your friend, Lady Zhao's face
has been branded...

421
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,500
because she repeatedly asked
to return home.

422
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,900
The brand cannot be removed.

423
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,780
Please think it over.

424
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,580
Please tell the king...

425
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,540
Yan will never surrender.

426
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,980
I want to receive
the Yan assassin...

427
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,940
right here in the Unification Hall.

428
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,500
I want you to find me
a real assassin.

429
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,740
I'll order the guards
to stay away.

430
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,420
Nobody will be armed...

431
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,220
except the assassin.

432
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,780
Who would have thought...

433
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,980
I'm going to Yan...

434
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,300
to find someone to kill you.

435
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,220
I'm invincible.

436
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,180
No one can kill me.

437
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,660
The assassin will know
it is wrong to even try.

438
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,900
Keep this to protect yourself.

439
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,580
Good-bye.

440
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,100
My amulet...

441
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,180
please take it too.

442
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,740
Wait.

443
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,660
Now you may go.

444
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,020
Please, don't look at me.

445
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,700
What does this bridge...

446
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,620
remind you of?

447
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,820
Remember when we were children...

448
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,100
and you would make me cross
that narrow bridge?

449
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,660
I have made a replica
of that bridge here...

450
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,180
so that we can always
remember our times together.

451
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,100
I am the Prince of Yan!

452
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,460
I am the Prince of Yan!

453
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,740
If you want to kill me,
then do it right here.

454
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,460
Goddamn Ying Zheng!

455
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,540
Shepherd!

456
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,820
Is this the Kingdom of Yan?

457
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,500
This is Yan.

458
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Goddamn Ying Zheng!

459
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,900
I'm going to kill you.

460
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,100
Goddamn you!

461
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,260
I must kill you!

462
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,340
Chapter II: The Assassin

463
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,620
Jing Ke...

464
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,940
I have someone I want you to kill.

465
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,660
Who is it?

466
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,100
A sword maker...

467
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,660
who owes me.

468
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,860
Just him?

469
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,700
Kill his whole family.

470
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,300
How much?

471
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,660
Five thousand.

472
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,260
I want ten thousand.

473
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,940
Mommy.

474
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,460
Daddy.

475
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,300
You've killed my whole family,
haven't you?

476
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,620
Then kill me too.

477
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,100
You can't see.

478
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,620
I won't kill you.

479
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,180
Kill me.

480
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,340
If you don't...

481
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,660
I'll be begging
for the rest of my life.

482
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,580
There's no dignity in that.

483
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,820
That's true...

484
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,500
but I won't kill you.

485
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,620
The Homecoming Of Prince Yan

486
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,660
Gentlemen...

487
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,340
Yan may soon be eliminated
by Qin.

488
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,740
I must find an assassin
to kill the King of Qin.

489
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,060
If you are afraid
to accept this task...

490
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,180
you may take your leave.

491
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,260
Leave? We would rather die!

492
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,900
All right then, cheers.

493
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,420
Jing Ke! You madman.

494
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,980
The buns are ready.

495
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,860
Got you! You little bastard!

496
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,220
How many times did you steal?

497
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,180
Many.

498
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,020
Many?

499
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,700
Then there is nothing to say.

500
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,260
Water.

501
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,740
Water.

502
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,300
I need water.

503
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,740
Give him some water.

504
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,700
Give him some water.

505
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,660
What?

506
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,620
You pay up for him...

507
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,660
and he'll get his water.

508
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,860
Get out, you scum!

509
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,900
Give him some water.

510
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,900
Are you looking for trouble?

511
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,620
We've got water.

512
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,260
Get down and beg
and he'll get his water.

513
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,260
If you let him go, I will.

514
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,540
Fine. On your knees
and I'll let him go.

515
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,500
Crawl through my legs
and I'll let him go.

516
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,980
Let him go.

517
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,460
That's not enough.

518
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,220
I can let him down...

519
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,580
but that's my decision...

520
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,900
not yours.

521
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,340
You have to kill me.

522
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,980
Kill me and the boy goes free.

523
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,220
I won't kill you.

524
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,820
Come on!

525
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,740
Kill me! Come on!

526
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,500
I won't.

527
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,500
You have no choice.
Kill me!

528
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,220
Come on! Kill me!

529
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,500
- Did you kill that man?
- No.

530
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,820
If you didn't kill him,
then why are you here?

531
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:23,020
This is your last day alive.

532
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,780
Do you have anything
you want to say?

533
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,900
Fine. You're a tough man,
aren't you?

534
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,100
Get him ready.
Get him ready.

535
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,420
Scared?
Then scream.

536
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,060
Come on! Scream!

537
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,100
Scream, scream!

538
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,820
All right.

539
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,740
Let's play for a while.

540
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,740
Lady Zhao has arrived.

541
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,380
Hold it.

542
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,780
Your Ladyship.

543
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,860
Release him.

544
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,100
Hurry, release the prisoner.

545
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,180
Faster!

546
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,140
This man has no fear of death.

547
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,820
Everyone cries for mercy
on the torture log, but he didn't.

548
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,540
I should have gone over to the jail
to welcome you myself.

549
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,460
Sorry you had to suffer.

550
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,220
Please sit.

551
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,020
So, the two of you have met before.

552
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,340
So you're the great assassin,Jing Ke.
The prince has been searching for you.

553
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,860
Who would imagine?

554
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,820
The great assassin
has become a sandal peddler.

555
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,580
Lady Zhao and I need your help.

556
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,660
I'll let the lady tell you.

557
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,340
We want you to kill someone for us.

558
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,820
Do you know who we want you to kill?

559
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,140
The King of Qin.

560
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,940
Otherwise, Yan is finished.

561
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,820
All six kingdoms will be eliminated.

562
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,780
I don't kill people.

563
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:38,580
You're an assassin!
You've killed many people!

564
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,700
Not anymore.

565
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,620
You will be rewarded.

566
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,900
Tell me what you want
and it's yours.

567
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,540
If you kill the King of Qin...

568
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,380
you're assured a place
in Yan's ancestral temple.

569
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,220
I won't kill.

570
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,540
Then go back to the prison and die.

571
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,660
This beautiful woman has been branded
by the King of Qin.

572
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,980
She saved your life.

573
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,300
You owe her.

574
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,860
I won't kill.

575
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,660
Guards!

576
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,580
Take him back to prison.

577
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,940
That's the man I want.

578
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:11,380
No matter what, you must make him go
to Qin within three months.

579
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,340
He must kill the King of Qin.

580
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,140
I can't force him.
He doesn't even fear death.

581
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,460
You'd better find someone else.

582
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:27,460
He has three months to live.
So do you.

583
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,060
Don't forget, you're my hostage.

584
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,340
Jing Ke...

585
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,860
I know what you are thinking.

586
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,780
You think I saved you
to make you kill someone?

587
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,700
You are wrong.

588
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,180
I was told that
you were a cruel assassin.

589
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,340
I don't believe it.

590
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,580
I saw you save that child.

591
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,260
I don't know about our past...

592
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,740
but now you can go.

593
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,260
Please go home.

594
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,940
Scream if you can't take it.

595
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,820
Scream.

596
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,020
Hey! Trying to kill someone?
That's not a sword!

597
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,260
I'm sorry.

598
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,380
You don't know me.

599
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,860
But I do.

600
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,940
You don't know me.

601
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,620
Nobody does.

602
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,100
And I don't know you either.

603
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,860
I come from the Kingdom of Zhao.

604
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,300
I was born and brought up in Zhao.

605
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,140
Then I followed some people to Qin...

606
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,940
and finally I came to Yan.

607
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,140
Why is your face branded?

608
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,820
What crime have you committed?

609
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,020
I wanted to return to Zhao.

610
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,100
Was it really that important?

611
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,340
Zhao is my home.

612
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,740
You are not a criminal. Wanting to
return to Zhao is not a crime at all.

613
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,140
But killing is.

614
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,420
I've killed many people.

615
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,060
I am the criminal.

616
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,500
I once killed a girl.

617
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,740
She was from a family
of sword makers.

618
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,900
<i>The girl was young,
still in her early teens.</i>

619
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,300
<i>She was pretty and pure.</i>

620
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,220
<i>But she was blind.</i>

621
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,980
You've killed my whole family,
haven't you?

622
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,340
Then kill me too.

623
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,860
You can't see.

624
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,380
I won't kill you.

625
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,580
<i>She kept asking me to kill her.</i>

626
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,620
<i>But I didn't want to.</i>

627
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,620
At dawn, I hear my mother...

628
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,020
making breakfast.

629
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,660
When the sun comes up...

630
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,580
I hear my father making swords.

631
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,940
After sunset, my brother sings
as he brings in the cows.

632
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:55,460
<i>He always brings me a flower.</i>

633
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:05,180
If I can't hear
these sounds tomorrow...

634
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,100
I would rather die.

635
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,180
I couldn't kill her.

636
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,700
Who are you?

637
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,660
Even a killer...

638
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,220
has a name.

639
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,700
I've lost my strength.

640
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,340
Help me remove the dagger.

641
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,940
<i>Actually, she wanted revenge.</i>

642
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,820
<i>She had a sword hidden
behind her back.</i>

643
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,460
She couldn't live without love.

644
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,340
She was right.

645
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,980
She was right.

646
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,260
Oh, no!
You're left-handed.

647
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,700
My name is Jing Ke.

648
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,140
You should tear down this house...

649
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,140
build a new one.

650
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,260
Plant some trees.

651
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,020
If I can come to see you, I will.

652
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,300
If I can't...

653
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,260
don't blame me.

654
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,060
Try to start a new life.

655
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,380
I want you to have this.

656
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:16,260
The King of Qin
has started troop movements.

657
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,700
There are 400,000 soldiers
at the Han Zhao border.

658
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:24,660
The people of Zhao are terrified.

659
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:29,180
The Marquis says that
when Zhao is eliminated...

660
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,380
the next target will be Yan.

661
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,580
Your medicine, my lord.

662
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,620
Qin Palace

663
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,060
This battle-ax...

664
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,820
should only be used by the king.

665
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,660
Of course,
the Prince of Yan knows...

666
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:58,300
that this gift
might cost me my head.

667
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,060
But I can't refuse
such a fine gift.

668
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,740
Please thank him.

669
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:16,340
My lord, the king is waiting
to see the Queen Mother.

670
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,660
No.

671
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,500
Tell him that
Queen Mother is sleeping.

672
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,020
Wrong.

673
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,220
Let's try again.

674
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,820
Daddy.

675
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,180
Our poor children.

676
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:51,260
Must they hide away here
in the palace all their lives?

677
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,100
Chapter III: The Children

678
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,180
Ying Zheng has a good appetite.

679
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:10,660
You've always loved meat.

680
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,900
But we didn't always have meat.

681
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:21,300
My queen, are you criticizing
the king for eating too much?

682
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,980
His Majesty is the master
of all under heaven.

683
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,980
He can have whatever he wants.

684
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:50,660
Daddy.

685
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,180
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

686
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,140
This is my nephew.

687
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:17,100
The queen adores him and has allowed
him a short stay in the palace.

688
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:22,860
Like all small boys,
he likes to run about.

689
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,900
Come here.

690
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,620
Come. The king is calling you.

691
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,660
What a fine boy.

692
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:07,380
I see why the Queen Mother
adores him.

693
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,060
Open your mouth.

694
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,860
Go on.

695
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,620
It was a nice dinner.

696
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,180
I have something to take care of.

697
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,620
Good-bye, Mother.

698
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,780
Good-bye, Your Majesty.

699
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,220
Your Majesty!

700
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:28,020
The Marquis' rebels were armed.
They could have killed you.

701
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,700
Your Majesty's wisdom
prevented this.

702
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,860
The Marquis is staging a coup.
I must deploy the royal guards!

703
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:44,540
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
I will--

704
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:49,100
General Fan, let go of my hand.

705
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,980
You think that I am scared.

706
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,100
Marquis.

707
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,740
I want the Queen Mother's seal.

708
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:12,060
The order must come
from the Queen Mother.

709
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,100
The Residence Of Former
Prime Minister Lu Buwei

710
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,340
The seal is real.

711
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,260
The Queen Mother has declared...

712
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:52,500
as soon as we succeed, you will be
reinstated as prime minister.

713
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,660
So I will be the prime minister?

714
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:02,060
Then who will be the king?

715
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,380
The King of Qin?

716
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,260
You...

717
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,300
or your son?

718
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,020
Marquis...

719
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,780
you used to be my servant.

720
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:28,060
I am advising you
to give yourself up.

721
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:33,140
With the support of the Queen Mother,
your life may be spared.

722
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,900
Otherwise...

723
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,700
I don't mean to boast...

724
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,940
but who can overthrow the king
except me?

725
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,460
I understand.

726
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:06,220
We will see who will be king...

727
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,940
my son or yours?

728
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,340
What do you mean?

729
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:24,340
A disgraced prime minister...

730
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,220
has the nerve to kill me?

731
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,380
I don't think so.

732
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:39,060
Get me my chariot.
I am going to the palace.

733
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,340
Marquis!

734
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,840
The Queen Mother has declared...

735
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,760
Ying Zheng is no longer
the King of Qin!

736
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,320
Whoever captures him...

737
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,280
will be rewarded.

738
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,960
Charge!

739
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,480
Retreat!

740
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,960
Retreat to the west!

741
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,600
Marquis, do you surrender?

742
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,520
Do you surrender?

743
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,120
- No!
- No!

744
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,360
- Charge!
- Charge!

745
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,080
I surrender...

746
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,640
only if you promise...

747
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,880
not to kill my men!

748
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,600
I have failed all of you.

749
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,480
Obey their orders.

750
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,400
Do not resist.

751
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,800
The king will spare you.

752
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,120
Lay down your weapons.

753
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,240
Stand up!

754
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,320
Ying Zheng, you murderer!

755
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,800
You murderer!

756
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,520
Mother, hand those children over.

757
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,360
They are my sons.

758
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,720
I'll never give them up.

759
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,440
So be it.

760
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,440
I'm not mistaken...

761
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,200
am I?

762
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,880
Mommy! Mommy!

763
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,160
Ying Zheng.

764
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,240
Who did you have in mind
to replace me...

765
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,000
the older one or the younger?

766
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,280
Ying Zheng, listen to me!

767
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,160
Mommy, Mommy!

768
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,240
I'm begging you!

769
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,480
I'm begging you!

770
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:36,200
They are your brothers.

771
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,920
Goddamn you!

772
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,520
I hate you!

773
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,840
You've murdered my sons!

774
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,080
You animal!

775
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,800
I'm so sorry.

776
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,360
But our children...

777
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,360
are dead.

778
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,560
So they're gone.

779
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,000
Then there's nothing more
to worry about.

780
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,880
I've failed you.

781
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,480
No, it is I who failed you.

782
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,520
And failed our sons.

783
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,960
All our efforts
have come to nothing.

784
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,480
People will say
it's my lust for power...

785
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,800
that brings me to my death.

786
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,640
But what I wanted most...

787
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,920
was to share my life with you.

788
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,920
That could have been...

789
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,480
were you not...

790
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,840
the Queen Mother.

791
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,440
As it is...

792
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,160
we will have to wait
until our next life.

793
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,120
Don't cry.

794
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,760
We've done nothing wrong.

795
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,960
Farewell.

796
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,680
Are you guilty?

797
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,400
I'm innocent!

798
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,160
You committed adultery
and fathered illegitimate children!

799
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:54,000
You plotted against Qin
with foreign kingdoms.

800
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,840
You deserve no mercy!

801
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,160
It's true.

802
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,840
I had children with your mother.

803
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,880
You claim to be a filial son...

804
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,800
but how could you know the loneliness
of the Queen Mother?

805
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,400
I plotted with foreign kingdoms?

806
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,160
Were you not raised on the milk
of the Kingdom of Zhao?

807
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,440
Treason?

808
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,560
Am I the traitor?

809
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,120
No, it's you who are the traitor.

810
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:41,800
When the Qin Prince
was a hostage in Zhao...

811
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,840
Lu Buwei gave him a woman.

812
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:52,240
But the woman was already pregnant
by Lu Buwei.

813
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,440
She gave birth to a boy.

814
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,560
Later...

815
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:03,160
the Qin Prince became king.

816
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:08,320
When the king died, the little boy
inherited the Qin throne.

817
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,800
Do you have to ask me
who your real father is?

818
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,720
What a pity. You have been
the King of Qin for such a long time...

819
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,080
but you don't even know
who your real parents are!

820
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,600
What a joke!

821
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:33,880
The King of Qin is not even
a descendant of Qin?

822
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,880
You are the son of Lu Buwei
from Zhao.

823
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,800
Who's the traitor here?

824
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,000
Nonsense!

825
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,760
Nonsense!

826
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,840
You're crazy!

827
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,320
Ying Zheng...

828
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,760
you're a bastard from Zhao!

829
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,080
Go and ask your father!

830
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,320
You may take your leave.

831
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,320
Master of Rites.

832
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,600
Present.

833
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,760
Who is my father?

834
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,560
Your Majesty's father
was the King of Qin.

835
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:32,520
Your Majesty has no other father.

836
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,440
I see.

837
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,800
Thank you.

838
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,200
Qin Ancestral Temple

839
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,920
Lu Buwei, are you guilty?

840
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,160
Of course I am guilty.

841
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,160
If the King of Qin, Ying Zheng,
is my son...

842
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,120
then he could not be
the King of Qin.

843
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,800
That's why I am guilty?

844
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,040
Right?

845
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,960
The King of Qin is not your son.

846
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,040
His father was the King of Qin.

847
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,960
If that is true...

848
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,520
and the king is not my son...

849
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,080
then why do you want to kill me?

850
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,360
Right here in
the Qin Ancestral Temple?

851
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,280
- Prime Minister!
- Stop!

852
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,000
Say no more.

853
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,480
Just go ahead and kill me.

854
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,720
Your Majesty...

855
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:10,800
the prime minister had made
great contributions to Qin.

856
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,040
I beg you to show mercy on him.

857
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,640
Prime Minister...

858
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,120
just tell the world...

859
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,040
that I am not your son.

860
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:23,840
Kill me, and the world will know...

861
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,800
that you are not my son.

862
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:31,840
And only by killing me
can you make people believe...

863
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,560
that you are not my son.

864
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,360
Because...

865
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,400
a son would never kill
his own father.

866
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,160
No!

867
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,760
No.

868
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,000
I will not kill you.

869
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,520
I just want to tell the world...

870
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,880
that I'm not your son.

871
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,720
- And when unification is achieved--
- No matter what happens...

872
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,280
don't you have a father?

873
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

874
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,280
Because I wanted you to be king.

875
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,920
King of all under heaven.

876
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,240
I cannot kill you.

877
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,880
I want to see you grow old.

878
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,840
I want you to help me unite
all under heaven.

879
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:05,400
I want you to finish your book
'' Lu's Spring and Autumn.''

880
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,640
'' Lu's Spring and Autumn.''

881
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:13,520
I want everything under heaven...

882
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,000
to know and remember your name.

883
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,880
Remember your name.

884
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,160
King Ying Zheng...

885
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,080
have you forgotten the commandment
of your Qin ancestors to unite...

886
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,040
all under heaven?

887
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,960
I have not forgotten!

888
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,280
Have I forgotten?

889
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,920
From the moment I was born,
I was a hostage, who supported me?

890
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,320
The people of Zhao spat
in the king's face and whipped me!

891
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,760
Where were the Qin people
at that time?

892
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,880
Where were my Qin ancestors?

893
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,960
I had no food, no clothes.

894
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,600
What did the Qin people give me?

895
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,240
This man...

896
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:17,760
he raised me
and took care of the king.

897
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,000
He brought our family back to Qin.

898
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,200
I was sitting on his knees...

899
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,040
when he taught me my first word.

900
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,400
That first word was ''king.''

901
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,920
He who taught me
how to be a king!

902
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,520
I cannot kill him.

903
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,080
No one can kill him!

904
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:49,000
Your Majesty, then kill me.

905
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:53,040
But even if I die,
people will ask the same question.

906
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,480
I cannot kill him.

907
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,920
I can't.

908
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,840
Please don't make me.

909
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,880
King Ying Zheng...

910
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,960
have you really forgotten
your commandment?

911
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,880
Your Majesty!

912
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,400
Father.

913
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,040
Issue the following decree.

914
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,240
Lu Buwei is a traitor.

915
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,320
He is to be stripped
of all his titles.

916
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,320
Kill his entire family.

917
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,560
What's going on with Jing Ke?

918
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,640
I can't wait anymore.
He must go to Qin now.

919
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,080
He is not the man he used to be.

920
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:21,920
He'll never go.

921
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,240
He listens to you.

922
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,560
If you ask him to go, he will.

923
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,080
But I won't do that.

924
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,400
If Jing Ke won't go to Qin...

925
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,000
I'll have to imprison you...

926
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,200
and wait for Ying Zheng
to save you.

927
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,120
All right, then.

928
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,280
Imprison me.

929
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,600
As you wish.

930
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,200
Release her.

931
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,440
You stay and she goes free.

932
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,840
You should see our new house.

933
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,160
Get him! Come on!

934
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,840
Go home, boy.

935
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,120
Pick up your sword.

936
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,520
If he won't kill you, kill him!

937
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,760
Go home.

938
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,560
Kill him!

939
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,720
Kill!

940
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:27,000
<i>Your Majesty, General Fan fled
last night. His whereabouts are unknown.</i>

941
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,400
Issue the following decree
to the other kingdoms.

942
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:39,160
Any state that harbors General Fan
is the enemy of Qin.

943
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:45,240
Whoever turns him in is our ally.

944
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:54,760
Kill his entire family.

945
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:02,240
General Fan,
I'd like you to meet Jing Ke.

946
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,840
Yes.

947
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,920
You are from Qin.

948
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,800
You know the King of Qin.

949
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,840
What kind of man is he?

950
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,360
He truly is a king...

951
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,080
but he has killed so many people.

952
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,600
Is that the reason you left him?

953
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,280
Yes.

954
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,400
Long live the king!

955
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,760
Long live the king!

956
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:21,840
General Wang.

957
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,440
Present.

958
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:28,000
I want revenge.

959
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,800
Yes.

960
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,120
Destroy Zhao!

961
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,120
Zhao Ambassador!

962
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,720
Your Highness, My Lady,
I beg you to save Zhao!

963
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,280
What's the situation
in the Zhao capital?

964
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:56,600
The King of Qin
is leading the attack.

965
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:00,200
The Qin army has already reached
the city wall.

966
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,120
They've taken all the provisions.

967
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,760
Without food...

968
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,200
the people are desperate!

969
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,880
They eat...

970
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:14,440
meat off the dead bodies.

971
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,920
The King of Zhao has ordered that
we die before surrendering.

972
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,880
I am afraid we can't hold
very long, and--

973
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,720
What?

974
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:26,920
The King of Zhao is holding
all the city's children...

975
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,040
boys and girls...

976
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,560
captive in the ancestral temple.

977
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,280
On the day Qin troops
take the city...

978
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,360
all of them will be led
to the city wall...

979
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,080
and sacrificed.

980
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,640
The Zhao king will destroy
the future generations of Zhao.

981
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,680
My Lady...

982
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,240
in a few dozen years...

983
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,160
there will be
no more Zhao people.

984
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:04,840
We're finished!

985
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,840
The world is finished!

986
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,680
Goddamn Ying Zheng!

987
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,240
I said he was evil!

988
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,800
General Fan!

989
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,400
Present.

990
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:25,360
The prince has promised
to try and save Zhao.

991
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,800
I am leaving now
to see the King of Zhao.

992
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,440
I will beg him
to spare the children of Zhao.

993
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,120
I also want to see
the King of Qin.

994
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,000
He's changed completely...

995
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,520
since you left.

996
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,760
Our king will listen to me.

997
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:55,960
Chapter IV: Lady Zhao

998
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,240
Jing Ke.

999
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,560
I'm going to Zhao.

1000
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,320
You're going to Zhao?

1001
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:14,760
Is there nothing you wish
to say to me?

1002
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:18,040
You don't want to bid me farewell?

1003
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:21,040
I won't send you off...

1004
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,200
because I don't want to lie to you.

1005
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,560
You can't save
the Kingdom of Zhao.

1006
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,160
But I know you must go...

1007
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,040
because you are from Zhao.

1008
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,840
Zhao...

1009
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,760
is your homeland.

1010
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,640
Do your best.

1011
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:33,000
Zhao Outpost - Twenty Miles
From The Capital

1012
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,000
My Lady!

1013
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:26,640
The Qin troops have surrounded
the Zhao capital.

1014
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,480
The roads have been cut off.

1015
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,200
It's impossible for us
to enter the city.

1016
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,520
Where is the Prince of Yan?
Where is he?

1017
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,280
Zhao is finished.

1018
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,480
We must retreat.

1019
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,960
Prince, it's getting dark.

1020
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,680
We could launch a surprise attack.

1021
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,120
Outside The Zhao Capital

1022
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,360
I've conquered almost all of Zhao!

1023
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:39,320
We are preparing to attack the capital.
Tomorrow that capital will be ours!

1024
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,480
What about the assassin from Yan?

1025
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:48,160
I am so naive.

1026
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,280
I thought because of you...

1027
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,680
there would be no more bloodshed.

1028
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:01,400
But what did I find
when I arrived in Zhao?

1029
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:04,040
Dead bodies everywhere!

1030
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:06,160
Your army had done nothing
but kill.

1031
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:09,200
The villages have been destroyed,
the towns ruined.

1032
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,960
You did all of this! How are you
different from other kings?

1033
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,760
But this is Zhao.

1034
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,760
Zhao is a different case.

1035
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,400
You promised me...

1036
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,360
that you would protect
all people under heaven.

1037
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,120
Look at my face.

1038
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,480
Do you remember now?

1039
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,880
Zhao is different!

1040
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,480
The Zhao people bullied my father
and insulted my mother.

1041
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:51,240
They made me herd horses.

1042
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:54,400
But your mother is from Zhao.

1043
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:00,640
So many Zhao people
have helped you through hard times.

1044
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:09,400
Your own name used to be
Zhao Zheng.

1045
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,080
Your Majesty...

1046
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,240
you cannot be the ruler
of all under heaven...

1047
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,000
as long as you have hate
in your heart.

1048
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:31,120
The ruler of all under heaven
should love all people under heaven.

1049
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,040
No matter which kingdom
they are from...

1050
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,880
they are your subjects.

1051
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:42,960
The King of Zhao has given orders
to kill all the children of Zhao.

1052
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,160
Go save the children of Zhao.

1053
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,760
If you save them...

1054
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:51,720
you will win the love
of the Zhao people...

1055
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,360
and the love of all people
under the heaven.

1056
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,080
Can you promise me?

1057
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,720
I promise you.

1058
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,000
I promise you.

1059
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,920
Lady Zhao, I won't let you go.

1060
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,840
I'll never let you go again.

1061
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:31,120
I am from Zhao.

1062
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:36,440
I can't bear to watch Qin troops
destroy my homeland.

1063
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:45,760
My Lady, this
is a military campsite...

1064
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,240
but the prince didn't take
this route when he came.

1065
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,440
The prince must have retreated.

1066
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,680
We must go directly to the capital.

1067
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,880
Children...

1068
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,760
the time has come.

1069
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:38,160
Children!Jump!

1070
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,520
Jump!

1071
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:50,040
My child, go quickly!
Go quickly!

1072
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,800
Zhao will never surrender!

1073
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,560
- General Wang.
- Present.

1074
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,480
Are these the last
of the Zhao children?

1075
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,080
Yes.

1076
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,160
Let them go.

1077
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,440
Yes.

1078
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:18,160
Take this.

1079
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,040
- General Wang.
- Present.

1080
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:51,440
When my father and I
returned to Qin...

1081
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:55,200
the King of Zhao
sent soldiers after us.

1082
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,520
He was afraid I would take revenge.

1083
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,640
Right now, I'm also afraid.

1084
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:13,360
I understand.

1085
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,840
Wake up, wake up!

1086
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:31,480
My Lady, over here!

1087
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,160
- More dead bodies!
- No!

1088
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:42,440
It was Qin soldiers.

1089
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,480
They buried
all these children alive.

1090
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:52,160
My Lady, are you all right?

1091
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,560
Goddamn Ying Zheng.

1092
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,920
Goddamn you, Ying Zheng!

1093
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,480
You are sick.

1094
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,200
You've been sleeping
for five days.

1095
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,880
So long?

1096
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:13,760
You died, but then
you came back to life.

1097
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:26,600
But I do not want to live.

1098
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,440
I want to go back to Zhao.

1099
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,680
I want to be with those children.

1100
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:45,280
I know.

1101
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,120
Your Majesty, General Fan
has been found in Yan.

1102
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:06,280
Order Yan to deliver
the traitor's head.

1103
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:08,680
- Your Majesty--
- Shut up!

1104
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:15,720
The Queen Mother is dying.

1105
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,240
Mother.

1106
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,280
Mother.

1107
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:03,440
You've finally come.

1108
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:09,200
I've just returned from Zhao.

1109
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:15,080
I've killed all our enemies.

1110
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,640
We have been avenged.

1111
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:35,800
Goddamn you!

1112
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:11,880
I must tell you.

1113
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,880
The King of Qin and I
created this whole plot...

1114
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:18,880
to send an assassin to Qin.

1115
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,800
At that time...

1116
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,880
I was his lover--
we grew up together.

1117
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:33,680
When we were young...

1118
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:36,520
my father was always drunk.

1119
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:40,480
Often Ying Zheng
would carry him home.

1120
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:45,160
It was a big burden
for a small boy.

1121
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:49,640
He took good care
of his mother too.

1122
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,960
Everybody liked him.

1123
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,480
He used to be such
a good person.

1124
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,160
Now...

1125
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:02,320
he's a ruthless killer.

1126
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,000
Ying Zheng knows everything.

1127
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,760
He will be prepared.
If you go--

1128
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:22,120
I won't let him kill
any more children.

1129
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,080
Never again.

1130
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:50,600
Do you think I can stand up
to the King of Qin?

1131
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:53,920
Yes, but you still need
one more thing for your journey.

1132
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,960
Without it,
you won't get to see him.

1133
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:02,040
I've come here to borrow it
from you.

1134
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:03,720
You don't need to borrow it.

1135
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,800
I'm giving it to you.

1136
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:15,760
It's a gift for a worthy friend.

1137
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,720
Because...

1138
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:25,720
you will never come back.

1139
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:27,520
You don't think I know that?

1140
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:29,280
You know that.

1141
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:30,800
Of course I know.

1142
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:40,240
Do you know why the King of Qin
wants my head?

1143
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:46,280
Because I alone know the secret
that can destroy him.

1144
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:51,520
But I can't tell you
what it is.

1145
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,800
If you see him...

1146
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:58,120
I want you to tell him that...

1147
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:04,520
I've not told a soul
about his secret...

1148
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:11,480
and that his secret
will die with me.

1149
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:50,400
I am going to get more wine.

1150
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,520
Jing Ke...

1151
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,960
do you know which direction...

1152
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
my door faces?

1153
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,240
It faces Qin.

1154
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:25,560
Correct.

1155
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:59,520
Your Majesty...

1156
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:03,040
the Prince of Yan has sent
this map.

1157
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,800
This the richest area...

1158
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:13,400
of Yan.

1159
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:15,320
The land is so fertile--

1160
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:20,200
We succeeded.

1161
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:21,920
No.

1162
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:28,600
The King of Qin will react
as you have.

1163
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:33,760
He will focus
all his attention on me.

1164
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,200
Therefore, my assistant should make
the first move.

1165
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:37,960
Not me.

1166
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:43,600
But I will not have a weapon.

1167
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,040
Try again.

1168
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,200
Your Majesty.

1169
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:27,200
The Prince of Yan
has sent this map.

1170
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,840
This is the richest area of Yan.

1171
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:37,280
The land is so fertile.

1172
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:04,840
<i>The wind is whistling</i>

1173
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,200
<i>Over the cold Yi River</i>

1174
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:18,600
<i>The brave hero leaves</i>

1175
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:27,600
<i>He'll never return</i>

1176
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:38,160
Chapter V:
The Emperor and the Assassin

1177
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:39,760
His Majesty!

1178
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:00,720
Come closer.

1179
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:09,600
Sit with me for a while.

1180
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,640
How old are you?

1181
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,160
I'm talking to you.

1182
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,600
Your Majesty, I'm 15.

1183
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:36,080
Already an adult.

1184
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:41,400
Old enough to do great things.

1185
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:47,560
I was younger than you...

1186
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:49,720
when I was in Zhao.

1187
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:54,960
Those were the good old days.

1188
02:15:56,680 --> 02:16:01,200
I never had enough to eat
or enough to wear.

1189
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:03,960
But I was determined
to become a king.

1190
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,280
My girlfriend told me that...

1191
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:17,240
one day I would surely
be a king.

1192
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:31,720
Indeed, those were
the best times.

1193
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:40,200
Your Majesty, the envoy
from Yan has arrived.

1194
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:42,840
Will you receive him tomorrow?

1195
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:47,000
Yes.

1196
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:50,560
Who is the envoy?

1197
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:53,320
His name is Jing Ke.

1198
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:57,720
Our spies in Yan would say
that he is a great swordsman.

1199
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,200
Let him come with his sword.

1200
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:06,440
But be prepared.

1201
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,040
Yes.

1202
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:58,360
Yan envoys, please halt.

1203
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,840
The swords of the envoys
need to be inspected.

1204
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:06,040
Your assistant cannot
carry his sword.

1205
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,680
Please.

1206
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:18,400
Your sword will be returned.

1207
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:23,000
Long live the king!

1208
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:27,960
Long live the king!

1209
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,760
<i>It was a fly.</i>

1210
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:00,560
Is this the map
you will present to the king?

1211
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:02,040
Yes.

1212
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,880
The box...

1213
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:12,320
contains the head
of the traitor.

1214
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,080
The king summons
the Yan envoy.

1215
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:32,720
The king grants you permission
to carry your sword.

1216
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:34,720
Here is your sword...

1217
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:36,800
please.

1218
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:40,200
The king summons the envoys!

1219
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:48,520
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

1220
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:55,720
What's wrong with your assistant?

1221
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:12,160
We are from a small country,
isolated and unsophisticated.

1222
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:15,200
I said he would be scared.

1223
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,680
You see he really is.

1224
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:24,080
Don't be afraid.

1225
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:27,720
We'll go home after
we pay homage to the king.

1226
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,800
The king will only receive
one envoy.

1227
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:53,160
Now you've done it.

1228
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:56,280
Jing Ke.

1229
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:25,040
Your Majesty!

1230
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,160
What's your name?

1231
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:29,720
Jing Ke.

1232
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:32,480
Jing Ke.

1233
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,480
- Raise your head.
- I dare not.

1234
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:38,520
Raise your head!

1235
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,400
Why are you crying?

1236
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:50,440
My secret is scared,
and I am scared too.

1237
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:53,880
I'd like to go home.

1238
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:57,400
Have you brought me
General Fan's head?

1239
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:58,920
Yes.

1240
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:13,480
Come up here.

1241
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,160
Please forgive me,
Your Majesty!

1242
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:57,000
I don't want to carry a sword,
but they forced me to.

1243
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:01,560
They sent me here to kill you!

1244
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:17,600
Did you hear what he said?

1245
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:19,800
The King of Yan...

1246
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:22,680
intends to kill me.

1247
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:25,720
Destroy Yan! Destroy Yan!

1248
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:39,880
The map...

1249
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:43,400
is it fake as well?

1250
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:48,440
Fake?

1251
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:06,960
The map is real.

1252
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:14,960
Your Majesty,
the Prince of Yan has sent this map.

1253
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:18,520
This is the richest area
of Yan.

1254
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:21,400
This can be yours.

1255
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:26,000
The land is so fertile--

1256
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:43,800
Stand back!

1257
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:10,120
Draw your sword!

1258
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:14,920
My king!

1259
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:55,920
Not even a single one of you...

1260
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:59,760
tried to stop him!

1261
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:01,720
Get out of here!

1262
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:04,880
Goddamn you!

1263
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:08,920
Get out of here!

1264
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:36,440
Why are you laughing?

1265
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:40,400
Why are you laughing?

1266
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,760
Why did you want to kill me?

1267
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:47,800
Do you know what I want to do?

1268
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:50,720
I want to establish
a great empire.

1269
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:56,120
Qin and the other six kingdoms
will become one great empire.

1270
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:05,800
General Fan asked me
to deliver a message to you.

1271
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:08,680
Your secret--

1272
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Your secret--

1273
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:20,040
He has not told a soul.
He's not like you.

1274
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:29,040
He kept his promise.

1275
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,120
Don't die.

1276
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:44,360
I haven't won yet.

1277
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:32,360
You've come back to me.

1278
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:35,800
I've come back...

1279
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,800
only to take Jing Ke's body
back to Yan.

1280
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:46,360
If you don't allow me...

1281
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,600
then you can kill me too.

1282
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:56,600
Take him back to Yan.

1283
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:01,800
Give him a proper burial.

1284
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:09,040
My love!

1285
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:45,800
King of Qin...

1286
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:58,120
have you forgotten the commandment
of your ancestors to unify...

1287
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:00,360
all under heaven?

1288
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:14,680
In 221 B.C., the King of Qin conquered
all six kingdoms by military force...

1289
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:17,360
to become the First Emperor
of unified China.

1290
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:19,760
His success was short-lived...

1291
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:22,640
as the Qin Dynasty lasted only for 15
years and was overthrown by the Han.

1292
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:25,960
His tomb remains in Xian, guarded by
thousands of terra-cotta warriors.

1293
