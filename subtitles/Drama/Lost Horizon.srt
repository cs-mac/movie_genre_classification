1
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,168
Conway!

2
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,734
We can't take more than seven.

3
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,978
All right. I'm sorry.
Another plane in a minute.

4
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,808
All right.

5
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,452
Wait, everybody.

6
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,531
Plenty of planes are coming.
Have patience, we'll be all right.

7
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,291
-It won't be long!
-Don't worry.

8
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,971
Leave everything to my brother.

9
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:14,857
-Yes, sir, 10 passengers aboard.
-10 passengers. Good.

10
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,531
Say, get me Shanghai.

11
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,697
-Is Colonel Marsh there?
-Right here, Conway. Go ahead.

12
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,577
I need more planes.
I've still about 30 people to get out.

13
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,617
-Where are the planes you promised?
-We sent all we could find.

14
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,054
They better get here,
or I can't be responsible...

15
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,449
-I think I hear motors.
-Wait a minute, they may be here now.

16
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,258
George, get down on the field
and guide those planes in.

17
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,136
Be sure none of the natives get in.

18
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:39,811
-Hello, Colonel?
-Hello, Conway.

19
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,618
-Thanks, and take care of your liver.
-My word!

20
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,849
Get ready, everyone. Planes are here.
One at a time. Children first.

21
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,658
Where are they? Come stand over here.
Where's the mother?

22
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,936
-They're orphans.
-I see. You come here, and you...

23
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:59,569
-What about us, Mr. Conway?
-Wait your turn. Come on, you.

24
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:02,014
Take some of those squealing men
with you first.

25
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,249
They might faint on you. I'll wait.

26
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,531
Just as you say. You, madam.
Come through here. Wait on one side.

27
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:15,537
-Don't lose your heads!
-What was that explosion?

28
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,089
They've blown up the powerhouse!
The planes can't land without lights.

29
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,691
We'll burn the hangar.
That will make light for them.

30
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,775
There's going to be a big fire.

31
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,331
All right. Go ahead!

32
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:26,369
We go on the next plane.
Bring out any people that are left.

33
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,811
-Hello, Fenner.
-Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble?

34
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,094
Never mind me.
Get this gadget off the ground.

35
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,568
-Bob, these are all that are left.
-Quick.

36
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:56,929
You can't leave me here, you blighter!
I'm a British subject.

37
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,732
Look out, Bob!

38
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,169
All right, Fenner. Go ahead!

39
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:17,648
Down on the floor!

40
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,292
Go ahead, Fenner!

41
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:25,894
Let's go!

42
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,291
I guess we're out of range.

43
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,610
-Everybody all right?
-That was close.

44
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:49,652
I've never been in a situation like this
in my life.

45
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:52,458
-Where do you come from?
-I'm Alexander P. Lovett.

46
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,736
-Why aren't you registered?
-It'd serve you right to be left behind.

47
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,652
How could I know a war
was going to break out over my head?

48
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:02,254
Right over my head. My word!
Those Chinese were pouncing on me.

49
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,297
I had to get into these ridiculous clothes
in order to escape.

50
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,370
-Where were you hiding?
-Hiding? No.

51
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,893
Hunting. I was in the interior
hunting fossils.

52
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,767
-This morning I looked up suddenly...
-And a war broke out right over your head!

53
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,693
Next time you're in wild country like this,
keep in touch with the British consul.

54
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,212
Very good, Freshie.

55
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,418
Put his name on the list
and make out a report later.

56
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,978
I beg your pardon, brother.

57
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,892
-What did you say you were hunting?
-Fossils.

58
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,013
-Fossils?
-I'm a palaeontologist.

59
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,409
-A what?
-A palaeontologist.

60
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:36,769
I see.

61
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:43,011
I have here a discovery
that will startle the world.

62
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,893
It's the vertebra from the lumbar
of a Megatherium, found in Asia.

63
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,216
-What do you know about that?
-Found in Asia.

64
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,614
When I get home,
I'll probably be knighted for it.

65
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,337
You don't say!

66
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:57,418
-Do you mind if I take a look at it?
-Not at all.

67
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:01,814
Sorry.

68
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:06,258
This is the only thing I was able to save
when those heathens surrounded me.

69
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,933
From this vertebra,
I'll be able to reconstruct...

70
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,453
...the entire skeleton...

71
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:18,811
You expect to be knighted
for finding that soup bone?

72
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,016
This is the vertebra of a Megatherium
found in Asia.

73
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,017
I remember. You said that before.

74
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,455
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted.
He never got beyond the Mesozoic era.

75
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,689
-Poor fellow!
-Yes, it just shows...

76
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,853
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Who are you?

77
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,248
-Okay, brother.
-Don't call me "brother."

78
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:38,738
Okay, sister.

79
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,174
No offence.

80
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,254
Cigarette?

81
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,454
-I say, will you have a cigarette?
-No.

82
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,772
You're an American, aren't you?

83
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,851
Go and annoy the rest of your playmates.
Let me alone.

84
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:06,731
Look what I found.
Just what I needed, too.

85
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:07,935
You.

86
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:11,253
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating.

87
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,178
Think of it. A cruiser sent to Shanghai
just to take you back to England.

88
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,013
You know what it means? Here you are.

89
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:25,410
Don't bother about those cables now.
I want you to drink with me.

90
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:30,369
Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway,
England's new Foreign Secretary.

91
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,129
Hooray!

92
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:39,337
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory.
People will point to me and say:

93
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,377
"There goes George Conway,
brother of the Foreign Secretary."

94
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,213
-Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
-That's why they're sending for you.

95
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:49,609
With all these foreign entanglements,
it was bound to happen.

96
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,338
You can laugh if you want to.
But whom else can they get?

97
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,377
Who else in England
is half the fighter and half the diplomat...

98
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,093
...who has half your knowledge
of the foreign situation?

99
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,135
They can't stop you now.

100
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,892
Hello, Freshie.

101
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,899
-Did you make that report out yet?
-Yes, Bob.

102
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:19,299
-Did you say we saved 90 white people?
-Yes.

103
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:22,688
Hooray for us.

104
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:28,337
Did you say that we left 10,000 natives
down there to be annihilated?

105
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,655
No, you wouldn't say that.
They don't count.

106
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:38,848
You'd better try to get some sleep.

107
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:43,373
Just you wait until I'm foreign secretary.

108
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,457
Can't you just see me with all those
other shrewd little foreign secretaries?

109
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,932
The trick is to see
who can outtalk the other.

110
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,534
Everybody wants something for nothing.

111
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,293
If you can't get it with smooth talk,
you send your army in.

112
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,896
I'm going to fool them.
I'm not going to have an army.

113
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:12,337
I am going to disband mine.
I'm going to sink my battleships.

114
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,052
I'm going to destroy
every piece of warcraft.

115
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:19,528
When the enemy approaches, we'll say:

116
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,179
"Come in, gentlemen.
What can we do for you?"

117
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,731
So then the poor enemy soldiers
will stop and think.

118
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,089
And what will they think?

119
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,253
They'll say, "Something's wrong here,
we've been duped!

120
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,450
"This is not according to form.

121
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,895
"These people seem quite friendly.
Why should we shoot them?"

122
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,015
Then they'll lay down their arms.

123
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:45,774
You see how simple the whole thing is?

124
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,008
Centuries of tradition
kicked right in the pants.

125
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:58,049
And I'll be slapped straight
into the nearest insane asylum.

126
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,656
You'd better not drink anymore.
You're not talking sense.

127
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,293
Don't worry, George,
nothing's going to happen.

128
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:07,611
I'll fall right into line.

129
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,975
I'll be the good little boy
that everybody wants me to be.

130
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:15,536
I'll be the best little foreign secretary
we've ever had.

131
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:20,293
Just because I haven't the nerve
to be anything else.

132
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:28,294
-Do try to sleep, Bob.
-Yes. Good thing, sleep.

133
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,493
Ever notice the sunrise in China?

134
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:35,815
You should. It's beautiful.

135
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,138
Good morning, Lovey.

136
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:31,572
-I beg your pardon?
-I say, "Good morning, Lovey."

137
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,854
Good morning. Look here, young man.

138
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:37,688
I didn't care for "sister" last night,
and I don't like "Lovey" this morning.

139
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,168
-My name is Lovett, Alexander P.
-I see.

140
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,693
-It's a good morning, anyway.
-I'm never conversational before coffee.

141
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:46,128
Wait a minute.

142
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,369
Is it a good morning?

143
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,772
We're supposed to be travelling east,
aren't we?

144
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,650
-Of course.
-It looks to me as if we're travelling west.

145
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:57,092
-That's ridiculous.
-Is it?

146
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,453
It certainly is.

147
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,049
Any child knows how to tell direction.

148
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,529
I don't care where the child is,
in the air, on the earth, or in the sea.

149
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,373
If you face the rising sun, your right hand
is north, your left hand is south.

150
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,450
I get it twisted because I'm left-handed.

151
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:11,733
-Really?
-Yes.

152
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,094
Just reverse it. Your left hand is...

153
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:18,577
What difference does it make?
The north is the north.

154
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,652
All I know is the sun rises in the east,
and we're going away from it.

155
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,809
Now you're irritating and absurd.

156
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:39,535
Of course. Boy!
We're travelling in the wrong direction.

157
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,009
-We're going in the wrong direction.
-Couldn't you make less noise?

158
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,613
We're going west,
and Shanghai is way east of here.

159
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,008
Quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China.

160
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,010
-It's Fenner.
-He may have lost his way.

161
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:53,136
That's what I told him.
You can't expect him to sail in the dark.

162
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,414
Calm yourself. I'll speak to Fenner.

163
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:00,370
Fenner! I say...

164
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,934
-Bob, it isn't Fenner in the cockpit!
-Stop it.

165
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:10,214
The bloke up there looks Chinese
or Mongolian.

166
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,894
We're nowhere near Shanghai.
We're going in the opposite direction.

167
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:17,569
We're over the desert. That's funny.

168
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:40,928
Charming chap.

169
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,089
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.

170
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,088
-That's that.
-I wonder what happened to Fenner.

171
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,771
Who is he? How'd he get there?

172
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,419
Do you think we stopped last night
and changed pilots?

173
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:54,411
That's not possible.
If we'd landed, we would've awakened.

174
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,571
We never left the air.
I didn't sleep the whole night long.

175
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:00,378
-That fellow got on at Baskul.
-Where's he taking us?

176
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,529
He may be a maniac for all we know.

177
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,252
What are you going to do?

178
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,058
-I'll make him tell us his game.
-What if he refuses?

179
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,016
-We'll smash his face in.
-Brilliant!

180
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,535
Can anyone here fly a plane?
That's no good.

181
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,169
-I guess we're in for it.
-In for what?

182
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:18,934
I don't know. He must have had
some purpose in taking the plane.

183
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,375
-When he lands, we'll find out.
-You won't do anything till we land?

184
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,927
-What do you suggest?
-Why, you...

185
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,008
-He may dash us to pieces.
-It might afford you a great deal of relief.

186
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,694
I am going back to sleep.
I was having such a peaceful dream.

187
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,897
As soon as he lands, let me know.

188
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,415
We're heading down! We're going to land.

189
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,775
We're coming to a village.

190
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:34,294
-What are these people?
-I don't know. I can't get their dialect.

191
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,018
They're loading up with gasoline.

192
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:33,338
Imagine having that fuel there,
waiting for us!

193
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,056
Something tells me our journey
is just beginning.

194
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,052
Where are we going?

195
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,496
If you ask me, we're heading straight
for those mountains.

196
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,932
Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway
and four others aboard still missing.

197
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,737
Unreported between here and Baskul.

198
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,732
Make it very emphatic
that His Majesty's government...

199
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,812
...will hold the Chinese government
and all governors of Chinese provinces...

200
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,697
...responsible for the complete safety
of Robert Conway.

201
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,258
Good morning, gentlemen.

202
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,250
-No news yet, sir?
-It's fantastic.

203
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,890
The plane couldn't disappear into thin air.
Cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai.

204
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,648
Leave no stone unturned to find Conway.

205
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:37,973
-Robertson?
-Yes, sir.

206
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,369
Postpone the Far East conference.
We can't meet those nations...

207
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,858
...without Conway.

208
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,411
This can't be kidnapping.

209
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:09,128
They wouldn't be taking us so far
on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it.

210
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,779
What do you make of it, Bob?
You must have some idea.

211
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,008
I give it up.

212
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,697
Not knowing where you're going
is exciting anyway.

213
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,739
Mr. Conway, for a man who's supposed
to be a leader...

214
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,379
...your do-nothing attitude
is very disappointing.

215
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,529
-What do you want him to do?
-I don't know.

216
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,213
I'm a palaeontologist,
not a foreign secretary.

217
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,094
-George, come on.
-It's not knowing that's so awful.

218
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:19,927
Not knowing where you're going, why,
or what's waiting when you get there.

219
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:33,571
We got above that storm.

220
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,287
I can't stand it any longer! Take us down!

221
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:55,418
I can't stand the pain any longer.

222
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:58,049
Let me out of here!

223
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:02,849
I can't stand it any longer!
Let me out of here!

224
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,408
It's oxygen.

225
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,773
-Take this in your teeth.
-Let me alone.

226
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:33,408
Come on. That's right. Bite on that.

227
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,695
What's that?

228
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,894
-What's happening?
-He must have run out of fuel.

229
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,975
Look! Look down there!

230
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:29,168
George! Everybody!
Better get back towards the tail.

231
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,375
He may nose her over. Into the corner!

232
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:38,730
Quick, George! Cushions! Blankets!
Take that behind you.

233
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,851
-Everybody all right?
-Yeah.

234
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,491
-He's fainted?
-Looks like it. You smell those fumes?

235
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,728
Here, George, take the gun.

236
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,767
Hold the light.
I'll search him before he comes to.

237
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,009
We might find something interesting.

238
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,132
There's a map.

239
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,893
-He's dead.
-Dead?

240
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,094
It must have happened
when he hit the ground.

241
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,090
Let's take a look at this map.

242
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:29,814
What is it?

243
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:31,298
-See that spot?
-Yes.

244
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:34,054
That's where we were this morning.
He had it marked.

245
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,970
Right on the border of Tibet.

246
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,251
Here's where civilisation ends.
We must be 1,000 miles beyond it.

247
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,977
Just a blank on the map.

248
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:46,175
-What does it mean?
-It means we're in unexplored country.

249
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,090
Country nobody ever reached.

250
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,815
Conway! What's happening?

251
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:54,818
Our chances of getting out of this are slim,
but it's up to us.

252
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:57,772
We can't have three hysterical people
on our hands.

253
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,898
-What do you say?
-Everything's all right.

254
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:06,653
The pilot won't trouble us anymore.
He's dead.

255
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:09,014
-Dead?
-Probably a heart attack.

256
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,177
What are we going to do?

257
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:18,095
Nothing until the morning. The storm
will probably die down before then.

258
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:23,488
My suggestion is that we better all try
and get a good night's rest.

259
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,128
Why not tell them the truth.
We're a million miles from civilisation...

260
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:29,449
...without a chance
of getting out of here alive?

261
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:32,292
It's slow starvation.
It's slow horrible death.

262
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:45,892
That's perfect. Just perfect.

263
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,213
What a kick I'm going to get out of this.

264
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,168
A year ago, a doctor gave me six months
to live. That was a year ago.

265
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,616
I'm already six months to the good.
I'm on velvet. I haven't got a thing to lose.

266
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,409
But, you, the noble animals
of the human race...

267
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,055
...what a kick I'll get out of watching you
squirm for a change.

268
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,288
What a kick!

269
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,730
They've been gone for hours.

270
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,288
Left us here to rot.
That's what they've done.

271
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:30,850
-Heroes of the newspapers.
-All right. Keep quiet.

272
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,693
Here they come.

273
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,009
Hello, everybody. We found some food.
No chance of starving now.

274
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,738
-What is that?
-Mountain grass. It's good. Have some.

275
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:51,652
I've read of people lasting 30 days
on this stuff.

276
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:55,854
My brother and I have worked out a plan.

277
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:59,090
If we use our heads we'll keep alive
for weeks, till he gets back.

278
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:00,692
-Gets back?
-Where's he gone?

279
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,373
He's starting out right away
in the direction of India.

280
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:06,815
Sooner or later, he's bound
to run into a tribe or something.

281
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:09,578
Here's the idea.
We found a cave over that small hill.

282
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,696
As soon as we bury the pilot,
we'll move in. We can have a fire.

283
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,373
I shouldn't be surprised
to see Bob back within a week.

284
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:19,452
You haven't a Chinaman's chance
of getting out of here alive. You know it.

285
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:22,372
-Cave? Where?
-Over by that hill.

286
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,934
Hey, look! Look, Bob!

287
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:40,288
-Where are they? Do you see them?
-Yes.

288
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,335
Do you think they're cannibals?

289
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:09,048
I am from the nearby lamasery.
My name is Chang.

290
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,971
He's speaking English.

291
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,614
-And mine's Conway.
-How do you do?

292
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:17,338
You've no idea how unexpected
and very welcome you are.

293
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:20,092
My friends and l,
and the lady in the plane...

294
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,568
...left Baskul the night before last
for Shanghai.

295
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:25,014
But we were travelling
in the opposite direction.

296
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:26,930
At the mercy of a mad pilot.

297
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:31,132
-We'd be eternally grateful if you...
-Where is your "mad" pilot?

298
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,972
He must have had a heart attack,
or perhaps the fumes.

299
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:35,777
When the plane landed he was dead.

300
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:38,089
We were going to bury him
when you came along.

301
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,248
Pardon me.

302
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,251
If you will be good enough
to direct us to your lamasery...

303
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,137
It is an honour to accompany you
and your friends.

304
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:56,179
You'll need suitable clothes for the journey.

305
00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:01,368
-It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
-Thank you.

306
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,497
Welcome to Shangri-La.

307
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:31,697
You see we are sheltered
by mountains on every side.

308
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:34,737
A strange phenomenon
for which we are very grateful.

309
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,493
It's magical.

310
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,647
-I definitely do not like this place.
-Will you quit squawking?

311
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:05,049
-Look at what they gave me to wear.
-You never looked better.

312
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:09,018
As soon as our clothes are cleaned,
they'll give them back to us, Lovey.

313
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:15,775
Something tells me this means food.
Come on.

314
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:29,095
I just feel as though I'm being made ready
for the executioner.

315
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,536
If this be execution, lead me to it.

316
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:38,288
That's what they do with cattle
just before the slaughter. Fatten them.

317
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:42,452
-You're a scream, Lovey.
-Please don't call me "Lovey."

318
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,098
That was refreshing.

319
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:48,849
The food looks good.
Some layout they got here.

320
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:51,407
You see the rooms?
Couldn't do better at the Ritz.

321
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,649
All the conveniences for the condemned.

322
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:58,369
-Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
-I don't like this place. It's too mysterious.

323
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:02,051
It's better than freezing to death
down below, isn't it?

324
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,649
Is there something I can do for you?

325
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:19,572
-What do you want?
-I've ordered you some warm broth.

326
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,490
-I thought perhaps...
-Get out of here!

327
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,139
If any of you men think
you can come busting in here...

328
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,174
Please.

329
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:29,731
Please calm yourself.
You'll soon be well if you do.

330
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,533
I don't need any advice from you.
Get me a doctor.

331
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,452
-I'm sorry, we have no doctors here.
-No doctors.

332
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,848
Well, that's just fine.

333
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,291
-Please let me help you.
-You can help me jump over that cliff.

334
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,847
I've been looking at the bottom
of that mountain...

335
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:45,930
...but I haven't got the nerve to jump.

336
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,211
You shouldn't be looking
at the bottom of the mountain.

337
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:52,217
Why don't you try looking up
at the top sometime?

338
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:58,538
Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff
to me.

339
00:37:58,659 --> 00:37:59,887
Go on, beat it!

340
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:02,608
Beat it!

341
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:06,210
Peace be with you, my child.

342
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,734
Good evening, my friends.

343
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,855
Please sit down.

344
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:25,412
-I hope you found everything satisfactory.
-Swell.

345
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:26,568
Excellent.

346
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,135
-You shouldn't have waited for me.
-Where's the girl? Miss Stone.

347
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:34,052
She's remaining in her room.
She isn't feeling very well.

348
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,812
Please go on without me. I eat very little.

349
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,688
There's certainly nothing wrong
with that meal.

350
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:57,848
Thank you.

351
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:00,937
-And the wine is excellent.
-I'm glad you like it.

352
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,175
It's made right here in the valley.

353
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,898
Now that dinner is over,
we're very anxious...

354
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:08,971
...to discuss ways and means
of getting back home.

355
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:13,371
First, we want to cable the Foreign Office.
England's waiting for news of my brother.

356
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:16,098
There's a cruiser at Shanghai
to take him back.

357
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,253
Really?

358
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,174
As regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help.

359
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:25,368
Unfortunately we have no wireless here.

360
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,777
As a matter of fact, we have no means
of communication with the outside world.

361
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:33,209
-Not even a radio?
-It's been a source of deep regret...

362
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:37,207
...but the mountains surrounding us
have made reception almost impossible.

363
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:40,211
We'd better make arrangements
to get some porters immediately.

364
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:42,369
Some means to get us back to civilisation.

365
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:46,532
-Are you so certain you are away from it?
-As far away as I ever want to be.

366
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,448
The porters will be very well paid.
That is, within reason.

367
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:54,576
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
We have no porters here.

368
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:55,768
No porters here?

369
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,929
What about those men
we met this morning?

370
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,737
Those are our own people.

371
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,057
They never venture beyond
where you were met this morning.

372
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,652
It's much too hazardous.

373
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:08,129
How do you account for all this?
Who brought it in?

374
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:14,211
There is a tribe of porters
some 500 miles from here.

375
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,417
That is our only contact
with the outside world.

376
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:23,054
Every now and again, depending upon
favourable weather, they make the journey.

377
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:28,010
-How can we get in touch with them?
-In that respect you are very fortunate.

378
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:31,694
We are expecting a shipment from them
almost any time now.

379
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:34,174
What do you mean
by "almost any time now"?

380
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:40,418
We've been expecting this particular
shipment for the past two years.

381
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:42,298
-Two years?
-Yes.

382
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:46,488
Well...

383
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,734
But I assure you, gentlemen,
if there is a prolonged delay...

384
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:58,093
...Shangri-La will endeavour
to make your stay as pleasant as possible.

385
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:04,215
And now, if you will excuse me,
it is getting late.

386
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:07,130
I do hope you all sleep well.

387
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,288
Good night.

388
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,777
Good night, Mr. Conway.

389
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:20,578
Good night, sir.

390
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:29,737
That's what I mean, mysterious.
I don't like that man. He's too vague.

391
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:33,092
We didn't get much information
out of him, did we?

392
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:37,013
It seems we should be grateful.
We were in a bad mess this morning.

393
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:39,090
After all, this is quite pleasant.

394
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:42,216
Why not make ourselves comfortable
until the porters do arrive?

395
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,527
That's what I say.

396
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,337
What do you say to a rubber of bridge?

397
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,809
-I saw some cards in the other room.
-Not for me, thanks. I'm too weary.

398
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:50,935
How about you, Lovey? Come on.

399
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:54,895
Let's you and I play a game
of honeymoon bridge.

400
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,257
-I'm thinking.
-Thinking?

401
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:01,775
-What about some double solitaire?
-In fact, I'm very good at it.

402
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,087
-No kidding?
-Yes.

403
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:05,295
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.

404
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:31,172
-Hello, George. Cigarette?
-Thanks.

405
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:37,011
I suppose all this comes
under the heading of adventure.

406
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:40,178
There's been plenty of it
in the last few days.

407
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,848
It's far from over from what I can see.

408
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,655
This place gives me the creeps.

409
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:51,617
Hidden away like this,
no contact with civilisation.

410
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:54,929
You don't seem concerned at all.

411
00:42:55,299 --> 00:42:58,609
I'm feeling far too peaceful
to be concerned about anything.

412
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:01,209
I think I'm going to like it here.

413
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:04,329
You talk as if you intend on staying.

414
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,453
Something happened to me
when we arrived here that...

415
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:13,973
Did you ever go to a strange place
and feel sure you'd been there before?

416
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:17,256
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know.

417
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:19,777
You're a strange bird.

418
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,137
No wonder Gainsford calls you:

419
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:25,131
"The man who always wanted to see
the other side of the hill."

420
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,653
Do you ever want to see
what's on the other side?

421
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:30,089
What else could there be,
except another hill?

422
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:32,090
In any event, I'm not curious.

423
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:36,616
It seems to me we should be concerned
about getting home.

424
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:41,494
-I'd give anything to be in London now.
-Of course you would.

425
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:46,332
If ever we get out of this place, you should
take that job with Helen's father.

426
00:43:46,419 --> 00:43:47,738
What do you mean, "lf"?

427
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,889
-Did I say, "lf"?
-That's what you said.

428
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:50,968
Well, I mean...

429
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:54,813
You talk as though we're going
to have trouble getting out of here.

430
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:56,931
I've been putting things together.

431
00:43:57,019 --> 00:44:00,773
Do you notice the resemblance
between those natives and the pilot?

432
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:04,454
Why did those clothes materialise
so conveniently when they met us?

433
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:08,088
Chang himself just said
that they never venture beyond that point.

434
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:10,688
What brought them there,
unless it was to meet us?

435
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:13,293
Chang's first question was about the pilot.

436
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:17,170
There must be some connection
between the plane and this place.

437
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:19,693
They must have deliberately
brought us here.

438
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:23,328
What reason could they have
for doing a thing like that?

439
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:25,979
That's what's on the other side of the hill.

440
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:39,367
It's 3,000 feet practically straight down
to the floor of the valley.

441
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:43,094
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it.

442
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:47,138
There are over 2,000 people in the valley
besides those here in Shangri-La.

443
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:49,779
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?

444
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:51,653
Goodness, no.

445
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:53,092
-So there are others?
-Yes.

446
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:56,091
-Who, for instance?
-In time you will meet them all.

447
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:00,768
For a man who talks a lot, it's amazing
how unenlightening you can be.

448
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:04,647
There are some things, my dear Conway,
I deeply regret I may not discuss.

449
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:07,776
That's the fourth time you've said that.
You should record it.

450
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:10,737
Let's go inside.
I'd like to show you our rare treasures.

451
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:38,249
-Good afternoon.
-Excuse me, l...

452
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,575
Please, don't go.

453
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,016
Tea will be served any moment.

454
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:45,892
Won't you come in?

455
00:45:49,939 --> 00:45:51,531
My name is Maria.

456
00:45:52,899 --> 00:45:54,298
Won't you sit down?

457
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,899
By the way,
what religion do you follow here?

458
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:15,938
To put it simply, I should say
that our general belief was in moderation.

459
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:20,014
We preach the virtue
of avoiding excesses of every kind.

460
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,772
Even including excess of virtue itself.

461
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:24,974
That's intelligent.

462
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:28,051
In the valley, it makes for better happiness
among the natives.

463
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:30,607
We rule with moderate strictness...

464
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:33,776
...and in return, we are satisfied
with moderate obedience.

465
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:38,815
As a result, our people are
moderately honest, moderately chaste...

466
00:46:39,419 --> 00:46:42,058
...and somewhat more
than moderately happy.

467
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:46,448
How about law and order?
You have no soldiers or police?

468
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:48,054
Good heavens, no!

469
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,778
How do you deal
with incorrigibles, criminals?

470
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:52,531
We have no crime here.

471
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:55,057
What makes a criminal?

472
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:59,333
Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy.

473
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:03,728
The desire to possess
something owned by another.

474
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,209
There can be no crime
when there is a sufficiency of everything.

475
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:11,010
You have no disputes over women?

476
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:13,812
Only very rarely.

477
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:19,091
It wouldn't be considered good manners
to take a woman that another man wanted.

478
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,770
Suppose he wanted her so badly
that he didn't give a hang...

479
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,929
...if it was good manners or not.

480
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:29,288
In that event, it would be good manners
on the part of the other man...

481
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,017
...to let him have her.

482
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:34,813
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.

483
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:37,777
You'd be surprised
how a little courtesy all around...

484
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,817
...helps to smooth out
the most complicated problems.

485
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:03,733
At some time in the future
you will have the pleasure of meeting her.

486
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:11,330
Some man had better get ready
to be very courteous to me.

487
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,529
Mr. Chang, all these things,
books, instruments, sculpture...

488
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:26,970
...were they all brought in
over those mountains by porters?

489
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:28,094
They were.

490
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:30,170
-That must have taken...
-Centuries.

491
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:32,368
Centuries.

492
00:48:33,499 --> 00:48:36,536
Where did you get the money
to pay for all these treasures?

493
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:39,533
We have no money as you know it.

494
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:43,407
We do not buy or sell
or seek personal fortunes...

495
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,498
...because there is no uncertain future here
for which to accumulate it.

496
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:50,938
That would suit me perfectly.
I'm always broke.

497
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,891
How did you pay for them?

498
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:57,055
Our valley is very rich
in a metal called gold...

499
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:01,294
...which, fortunately for us,
is valued very highly in the outside world.

500
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:04,889
-So, we merely...
-Buy and sell.

501
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:06,287
Buy and sell...

502
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:09,098
Pardon me. Exchange.

503
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,651
I see. Gold for ideas.

504
00:49:13,899 --> 00:49:17,414
There's something so simple
and naive about all this...

505
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:20,889
...that I suspect there's been
a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere.

506
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:23,777
Whose idea was it? How did it all start?

507
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:29,096
That, my dear Conway,
is the story of a remarkable man.

508
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:30,814
Who?

509
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:36,051
A Belgian priest
by the name of Father Perrault.

510
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:42,092
The first European to find this place
and a very great man indeed.

511
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,849
He is responsible
for everything you see here.

512
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:47,578
He built Shangri-La, taught the natives...

513
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,333
...and began our collection of art.

514
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:53,813
In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.

515
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,092
When was all this?

516
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:02,498
Way back in 1 713, I think it was...

517
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:07,007
...that Father Perrault stumbled
into the valley, half-frozen to death.

518
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,933
It was typical of the man
that one leg being frozen...

519
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:14,534
...and there being no doctors here,
he amputated the leg himself.

520
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,170
He amputated his own leg?

521
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:22,775
Oddly enough, when he had learned
to understand their language...

522
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:25,657
...the natives told him
he could have saved his leg.

523
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,730
It would've healed without amputation.

524
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:32,256
-They didn't actually mean that?
-Yes. They were very sincere about it, too.

525
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:35,257
You see, a perfect body in perfect health
was the rule here.

526
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:37,250
They've never known anything different.

527
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:41,298
What was true for them, they thought
would be true for anyone else living here.

528
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:42,778
Well, is it?

529
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:45,809
Rather astonishingly so, yes.

530
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:49,210
Particularly in the case
of Father Perrault himself.

531
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:52,132
When he and the natives
had finished building Shangri-La...

532
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,528
...he was 108 years old
and still very active...

533
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,610
...in spite of having only one leg.

534
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:59,015
108 and still active?

535
00:50:59,979 --> 00:51:01,173
You're startled.

536
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,251
No, I'm just a little bowled over, that's all.

537
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:05,454
Forgive me.

538
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:10,010
I should've told you it's quite common here
to live to a very ripe old age.

539
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:13,136
Climate, diet, mountain water,
you might say.

540
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:18,257
But we like to believe it is
the absence of struggle in the way we live.

541
00:51:18,939 --> 00:51:23,012
In your countries, on the other hand,
how often do you hear the expression:

542
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,689
"He worried himself to death,"
or, "This thing or that killed him"?

543
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,690
-Very often.
-And very true.

544
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:31,373
Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter.

545
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:35,611
Not so much by natural death,
as by indirect suicide.

546
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:38,654
That's all very fine if it works out.

547
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:40,331
A little amazing, of course.

548
00:51:40,419 --> 00:51:42,455
You surprise me.

549
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:45,128
I surprise you! Now, that's news.

550
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:47,654
I mean your amazement.

551
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:50,697
I could've understood it
in any of your companions, but you...

552
00:51:50,779 --> 00:51:54,328
...who have dreamed
and written so much about better worlds.

553
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:58,612
Or is it that you fail to recognise
one of your own dreams when you see it?

554
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:04,728
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go on being amazed...

555
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:08,654
-...in moderation, of course.
-Then everything's quite all right?

556
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:17,373
It's terrific!

557
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:20,898
I just saw something
that'd make your hair stand on end.

558
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:25,655
You see those hills over there? Gold.
Popping right out of them. Tons of it.

559
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:27,732
You keep this under your hat.

560
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:30,777
If the others hear about it,
they'll declare themselves in.

561
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:34,488
But if I can mine that stuff,
I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street.

562
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:37,047
Now look, I've got a plan and if l...

563
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:40,737
Say, honey...

564
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:43,969
...you ain't feeling so well, are you?

565
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:48,818
Don't pay attention
to what those doctors tell you.

566
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,810
I've seen a lot of people fool 'em.

567
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:54,812
And I've got a hunch this place
is gonna be good for you. Honest I have.

568
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:58,014
Come on, you be a good kid
and snap out of it.

569
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:59,930
And I'll cut you in on the gold deal.

570
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:02,931
I'm going up and make a deal
with Chang right now.

571
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:02,817
Oh, my!

572
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:21,734
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Conway.

573
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:24,333
-You speak English?
-Yes, sir.

574
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:29,018
-Would you like to take a ride?
-No, thanks. Not just now.

575
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:57,649
Well, I think I'll take that ride.

576
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:38,255
Fossils! Why? What for?

577
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:40,569
Running around digging up
a lot of old bones.

578
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:43,810
You didn't dig yourself
out of one of those holes by any chance?

579
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,490
You seem gay. Did you find out anything?

580
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:56,254
I heard that if you want a man's wife,
she's yours if he's got any manners.

581
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,375
-Nothing about the porters yet?
-Porters?

582
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:01,337
We've been here two weeks
and we haven't found out a thing.

583
00:59:01,419 --> 00:59:04,331
Well, we haven't been murdered
in our beds yet, have we?

584
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,649
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.

585
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:10,209
Guess we'll never know why we're here
or how long we'll be held prisoners.

586
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,968
Hurry up, you slowpokes. I'm starved.

587
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:15,653
"Please, do not wait for me.

588
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:17,737
"I eat so very little."

589
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:23,571
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

590
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:26,014
I'm glad to see us all finally organised.

591
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,818
Okay, handsome.
Dish it out and make it snappy.

592
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,574
-What's happened to you?
-Nothing. Why?

593
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:33,894
You look beautiful.

594
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:36,368
That's unkind.
Miss Stone always looks beautiful.

595
00:59:36,459 --> 00:59:39,053
I got it. It's your make-up.
You've got none on.

596
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:42,051
Honey, you look a million percent better.

597
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:43,811
Wholesome, kind of, and clean.

598
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:47,050
Take a tip from me,
don't ever put that stuff on your face again.

599
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:49,289
It's like hiding behind a mask.

600
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,929
Who're you to talk about a mask?
What do you mean?

601
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:54,374
You've been wearing a mask
ever since we met you.

602
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:55,529
Have I?

603
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:58,179
Strange, you've never told us anything
about yourself.

604
00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:01,092
Who are you, anyway?
Why not take your mask off for once?

605
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:03,170
Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.

606
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:05,458
All right, I will.

607
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:08,697
I'll let my hair down.

608
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:10,254
Why not?

609
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:12,614
It can't make any real difference now.

610
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,134
Lovey...

611
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:18,377
-...were you ever chased by the police?
-Certainly not!

612
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:19,858
Believe me, it's no fun.

613
01:00:19,939 --> 01:00:22,976
When you picked me up at Baskul,
they were on my tail for a year.

614
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:24,128
The police?

615
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,531
Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?

616
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:31,608
Chalmers Bryant?

617
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:35,009
Bryant Utilities. That's me.

618
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:36,538
I knew it.

619
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:40,336
I knew I had a reason for hating you.
Sir, you're a thief!

620
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:42,216
He never stole from you, did he?

621
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:45,211
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities
I bought with money...

622
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:49,656
...l'd saved for 20 years, teaching school.
Now, I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.

623
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:51,934
That's too bad. I got a half million shares.

624
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:54,294
My whole foundation. Now look at me.

625
01:00:54,379 --> 01:00:57,337
The nerve you have sitting there,
talking about it so calmly.

626
01:00:57,419 --> 01:00:59,649
The swindler of thousands of people.

627
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:02,487
That's what makes
the whole thing so funny.

628
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:05,572
A guy like me,
starts out in life as a plumber.

629
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:08,168
An ordinary, everyday
slew-footed plumber.

630
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:11,615
And by the use of a little brains,
he builds up a gigantic institution.

631
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:14,896
Employs thousands of people.
Becomes a great civic leader.

632
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,532
Then the crash comes.

633
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,531
Overnight, he's the biggest crook
the country ever had.

634
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:21,291
You're a thief and a swindler...

635
01:01:21,379 --> 01:01:24,689
...and I'll be glad to turn you over
to the police when we get back.

636
01:01:24,779 --> 01:01:25,894
"When we get back! "

637
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,049
What makes you think we'll ever get back?

638
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:29,458
You're all prisoners here.

639
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:32,337
We were kidnapped and brought here
and nobody knows why.

640
01:01:32,419 --> 01:01:35,855
I don't want to be a prisoner.
I'm finding out when we're leaving here.

641
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:38,658
I'll make that Chinese talk
if it's the last thing I do.

642
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,571
Where's Chang?

643
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,775
Where's Chang or I'll blow your brains out?

644
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:49,532
-What do you think you're doing?
-Let me go.

645
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:51,018
Come here!

646
01:01:53,739 --> 01:01:55,969
Come here, you!

647
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:00,417
You idiot!

648
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:08,172
Had to sock him?

649
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:24,531
-Let me up.
-You all right?

650
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:26,578
Sorry.

651
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:30,692
Is it true about us being kidnapped?

652
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:35,617
I say, is it true about us being kidnapped?

653
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:42,413
Mr. Chang!

654
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:46,613
Do you mind stepping in here
for a moment?

655
01:02:55,699 --> 01:02:57,371
Won't you sit down?

656
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:05,770
You have been very kind to us
and we appreciate it.

657
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:08,419
But for some reason
we're being held prisoners here...

658
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:10,057
...and we want to know why.

659
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:13,449
Personally, I don't mind at all.
I'm enjoying every minute of it.

660
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,929
But my brother is not of the same opinion,
nor are the others.

661
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:19,727
It's time we were told what it's all about.

662
01:03:19,979 --> 01:03:23,369
We want to know why we were kidnapped,
why we're being kept here...

663
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:26,929
...but most important of all,
do we get the porters and when?

664
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,653
Until we get this information...

665
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:35,694
...l'm very much afraid
we cannot permit you to leave this room.

666
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:38,932
You know, it's very strange...

667
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:43,849
...but when you saw me in the corridor,
I was actually on my way to you.

668
01:03:44,459 --> 01:03:46,689
I bring the most amazing news.

669
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:55,099
The High Lama wishes to see you.

670
01:03:55,259 --> 01:03:58,729
-The High Lama? Who in blazes is he?
-I thought you ran this joint.

671
01:03:58,819 --> 01:04:01,891
High lamas or low lamas,
do we get the porters?

672
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:05,528
The High Lama is the only one
from whom any information can come.

673
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:08,577
-Don't believe him.
-Sounds like a stall to me.

674
01:04:08,659 --> 01:04:10,377
-Better have him talk...
-One moment.

675
01:04:10,459 --> 01:04:13,690
You say the High Lama's the only one
who can give us information?

676
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:14,973
The only one.

677
01:04:15,379 --> 01:04:18,018
And he can arrange
for the porters to take us back?

678
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:20,693
The High Lama arranges everything.

679
01:04:20,779 --> 01:04:23,816
Then he's the man I want to see.
Will you come along?

680
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:32,814
Better wait here until I get back.
We'll soon know where we stand.

681
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:05,570
Good evening.

682
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:08,138
Please, come in.

683
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,051
Sit here, near me.

684
01:05:27,259 --> 01:05:30,057
I'm an old man
and can do no one any harm.

685
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:32,217
Are you the High Lama?

686
01:05:32,419 --> 01:05:33,488
Yes.

687
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:37,854
I trust you've been comfortable
at Shangri-La, since your arrival.

688
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:40,817
Personally, I've enjoyed
your community very much.

689
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:43,448
But my friends do not care
for this mystery.

690
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,212
They are determined to leave as soon as...

691
01:05:56,979 --> 01:05:59,413
It's astonishing and incredible, but...

692
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:01,411
What is it, my son?

693
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:02,933
You're the man.

694
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,848
Chang told me. You're the first who...

695
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,929
Two hundred years ago.

696
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:13,693
You're still alive, Father Perrault.

697
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:24,775
Sit down, my son.

698
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:36,767
You may not know it,
but I've been an admirer of yours...

699
01:06:37,419 --> 01:06:39,489
...for a great many years.

700
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:43,375
Not of Conway,
the empire builder and public hero.

701
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:49,054
I wanted to meet the Conway
who in one of his books said:

702
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:56,054
"There are moments in every man's life
when he glimpses the eternal."

703
01:06:58,899 --> 01:07:02,175
That Conway seemed to belong here.

704
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:07,254
In fact, it was suggested
that someone be sent to bring him here.

705
01:07:07,939 --> 01:07:10,817
That I be brought here?
Who had that brilliant idea?

706
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:12,532
Sondra Bizet.

707
01:07:13,539 --> 01:07:15,336
The girl at the piano?

708
01:07:15,819 --> 01:07:21,576
Yes. She has read your books
and has a profound admiration for you.

709
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:24,252
As have we all.

710
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:28,055
Of course, I've suspected
that our being here was no accident.

711
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:31,657
Furthermore, I have a feeling
we're never supposed to leave.

712
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:34,207
But that, for the moment,
doesn't concern me greatly.

713
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:36,176
I'll meet that when it comes.

714
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,254
What particularly interests me at present
is why was I brought here?

715
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:44,014
What possible use can I be
to an already thriving community?

716
01:07:44,499 --> 01:07:46,376
We need men like you here...

717
01:07:46,459 --> 01:07:49,815
...to be sure that our community
will continue to thrive.

718
01:07:50,659 --> 01:07:55,050
In return for which
Shangri-La has much to give you.

719
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:59,971
You are still, by the world's standards,
a youngish man.

720
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:03,288
Yet in the normal course of existence...

721
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:07,777
...you can expect 20 or 30 years...

722
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:11,888
...of gradually diminishing activity.

723
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:16,658
Here, however, in Shangri-La...

724
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:22,811
...by our standards,
your life has just begun.

725
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:26,816
And may go on and on.

726
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:36,135
To be candid, Father,
a prolonged future doesn't excite me.

727
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:38,297
It would have to have a point.

728
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:41,052
I sometimes doubted
whether life itself has any.

729
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:45,254
If that is so,
then long life must be even more pointless.

730
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:50,135
I'd need a much more definite reason
for going on and on.

731
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:52,612
We have reason.

732
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:57,610
It is the entire meaning
and purpose of Shangri-La.

733
01:08:58,219 --> 01:09:00,733
It came to me in a vision...

734
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,856
...long ago.

735
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:08,896
I saw all the nations strengthening...

736
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:14,168
...not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions
and the will to destroy.

737
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:17,774
I saw their machine power multiplying...

738
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:23,612
...until a single-weaponed man
might match a whole army.

739
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:30,335
I foresaw a time when man,
exulting in the technique of murder...

740
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:33,419
...would rage so hotly over the world...

741
01:09:34,099 --> 01:09:40,777
...that every book, every treasure
would be doomed to destruction.

742
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:46,298
This vision was so vivid and so moving...

743
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:51,851
...that I determined to gather together
all things of beauty...

744
01:09:52,139 --> 01:09:56,576
...and culture that I could
and preserve them here...

745
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:01,652
...against the doom
toward which the world is rushing.

746
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:04,735
Look at the world today.

747
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:07,894
Is there anything more pitiful?

748
01:10:09,059 --> 01:10:14,179
What madness there is, what blindness,
what unintelligent leadership.

749
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:20,528
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity
crashing headlong against each other...

750
01:10:21,339 --> 01:10:26,971
...compelled by an orgy
of greed and brutality.

751
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:33,573
The time must come, my friend...

752
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:37,452
...when this orgy will spend itself.

753
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:40,897
When brutality and the lust for power...

754
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:45,569
...must perish by its own sword.

755
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:54,737
Against that time is why I avoided death
and am here...

756
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:58,809
...and why you were brought here.

757
01:11:00,819 --> 01:11:07,657
For when that day comes,
the world must begin to look for a new life.

758
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:13,618
And it is our hope
that they may find it here.

759
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:18,488
For here, we shall be with their books...

760
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:23,851
...and their music and the way of life...

761
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:29,495
...based on one simple rule:

762
01:11:31,179 --> 01:11:32,771
Be kind.

763
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:37,891
When that day comes...

764
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:42,975
...it is our hope
that the brotherly love of Shangri-La...

765
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:47,374
...will spread throughout the world.

766
01:11:52,939 --> 01:11:58,650
Yes, my son, when the strong
have devoured each other...

767
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:04,650
...the Christian ethic
may at last be fulfilled...

768
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:10,410
...and the meek shall inherit the earth.

769
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:15,530
I understand you, Father.

770
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,289
You must come again, my son.

771
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,332
Good night.

772
01:12:58,819 --> 01:12:59,649
Well?

773
01:13:16,619 --> 01:13:19,611
-What did you find out?
-We thought you were never coming back.

774
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:21,769
-When do we leave?
-What about the porters?

775
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:22,609
Porters?

776
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:26,294
-Didn't you find out about the porters?
-Why, I'm sorry, but l...

777
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:28,449
What were you doing all this time?

778
01:13:28,539 --> 01:13:30,689
What's the matter with you?
You went there...

779
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:34,334
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.

780
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:12,528
Hello.

781
01:14:43,019 --> 01:14:44,213
Good morning.

782
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:50,055
"Lay thee down now, and rest

783
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:54,256
"May thy slumber be blessed

784
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:58,574
"Lullaby, and good night

785
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:03,212
"Thy mother's delight

786
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:06,769
"Bright angels around

787
01:15:06,859 --> 01:15:10,329
"My darling shall sound

788
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:13,889
"They will guard thee from harm"

789
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:15,894
Do you mind?

790
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:22,489
"They will guard thee from harm

791
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:26,254
"Thou shall wake in my arms"

792
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:31,217
This is Mr. Conway, children.

793
01:15:31,299 --> 01:15:33,290
Good morning, Mr. Conway.

794
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:38,379
-How do you do?
-Very well, thank you.

795
01:16:19,059 --> 01:16:21,971
Children, Teacher is going to be very busy
this afternoon.

796
01:16:22,059 --> 01:16:23,856
So, school's dismissed.

797
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:55,888
Please.

798
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:58,334
I hope you're not going
to run away this time.

799
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:01,498
My name's Sondra.

800
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,411
I hope you'll forgive me for...

801
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:08,171
You know, each time I see you,
I hear that music.

802
01:17:08,259 --> 01:17:09,374
What is it?

803
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,251
You mean my pigeons.

804
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:24,210
It's these little flutes
that I attached to their tails. See?

805
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:29,177
Come along with me
and I'll show you how I put them on.

806
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:43,410
This is how we tie them on.

807
01:17:44,099 --> 01:17:47,216
By varying the size of the flutes,
I can get any notes I wish.

808
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:48,812
The wind does the rest.

809
01:17:49,779 --> 01:17:52,532
Here's a little fellow who has lost his.

810
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:56,254
-Was this your idea?
-Yes.

811
01:17:56,379 --> 01:17:58,017
Hold this pigeon.

812
01:18:00,219 --> 01:18:02,528
You suggested my being brought here,
didn't you?

813
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:04,655
What gave you the idea I'd fit in?

814
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:08,129
-That was easy. I'd read your books.
-You've read my books?

815
01:18:09,219 --> 01:18:10,618
You do more things.

816
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:12,690
What have my books got to do with it?

817
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:14,770
I saw a man whose life was empty.

818
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:16,691
"A man whose life was empty."

819
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:21,375
I know, it was full of this and full of that.
But you were accomplishing nothing.

820
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:23,415
You were going nowhere and you knew it.

821
01:18:23,539 --> 01:18:26,849
As a matter of fact, all I saw
was a little boy whistling in the dark.

822
01:18:27,059 --> 01:18:29,050
"A little boy whistling..."

823
01:18:31,459 --> 01:18:34,849
Do you realise that there was
a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai...

824
01:18:34,939 --> 01:18:38,011
...smoke pouring out of its funnels,
tugging at its moorings...

825
01:18:38,099 --> 01:18:40,454
...waiting to take Mr. Conway
back to London.

826
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:43,531
Do you know right now
there are headlines shrieking the news...

827
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:47,373
...that Conway's missing? Does that look
like a man who's life was empty?

828
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:49,248
Yes.

829
01:18:50,179 --> 01:18:51,692
You're absolutely right.

830
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,728
I had to come to a pigeon house in
Shangri-La to find the only other person...

831
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:58,811
...who knew it. May I congratulate you?

832
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:02,329
I only brought you here
to show you my pigeons.

833
01:19:02,419 --> 01:19:03,738
Don't worry about them.

834
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:06,777
Now you can put flutes on my tail
and bells on my feet.

835
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,935
I've so many questions I'd like to ask,
I don't know where to begin.

836
01:19:11,019 --> 01:19:14,807
I'll help you. To begin with,
you'd like to know what I'm doing here.

837
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:17,015
-That I was born here.
-Thank you.

838
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:19,051
Well, I was almost born here.

839
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,973
It took place in that wild country
beyond the pass.

840
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:26,855
My parents were in a party of explorers
who got lost and wandered for a year.

841
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:29,659
When Chang found us
only father and I were alive.

842
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,772
He was too weak to climb the pass.
He died on the way.

843
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:35,856
I was brought up by Father Perrault.

844
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:38,407
I envy you.

845
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:42,293
-I talked to him last night.
-I know.

846
01:19:43,699 --> 01:19:46,372
I can't quite get used to this age thing.

847
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,572
I'm 30.

848
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:55,609
You're going to make life very simple.

849
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:01,138
It's inconceivable.

850
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:03,217
-What?
-All of it.

851
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:05,894
Father Perrault and his magnificent history.

852
01:20:06,299 --> 01:20:09,052
This place, hidden away
from the rest of the world...

853
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:11,929
...with its glorious concepts.

854
01:20:13,219 --> 01:20:16,017
And now you come along
and confuse me entirely.

855
01:20:16,139 --> 01:20:19,017
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light.

856
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:23,610
Why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?

857
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,255
On the contrary, you're not strange.
And that in itself is confusing.

858
01:20:27,339 --> 01:20:29,933
I had the same idea about Shangri-La.

859
01:20:30,019 --> 01:20:32,692
The sense I've been here before,
that I belonged here.

860
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:33,973
I'm so glad.

861
01:20:34,499 --> 01:20:37,889
I can't quite explain it,
but everything is somehow...

862
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:39,488
...familiar.

863
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:43,009
The very air that I breathe. The lamasery...

864
01:20:43,779 --> 01:20:47,089
...with its feet rooted in the good earth
of this fertile valley...

865
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:50,374
...while its head explores the eternal.

866
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:55,052
All the beautiful things I see,
these cherry blossoms, you...

867
01:20:55,819 --> 01:20:57,411
...all somehow are familiar.

868
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:01,213
I've been kidnapped
and brought here against my will.

869
01:21:01,299 --> 01:21:04,609
A crime, a great crime,
yet I accept it amiably.

870
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:09,531
With the same amiability one tolerates
only from a very dear and close friend.

871
01:21:10,339 --> 01:21:12,295
Why? Can you tell me why?

872
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,929
Maybe 'cause you've always been part
of Shangri-La without knowing it.

873
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:19,978
-I wonder.
-I'm sure of it.

874
01:21:20,299 --> 01:21:23,575
Just as I am sure there's a wish
for Shangri-La in everyone's heart.

875
01:21:24,019 --> 01:21:27,648
I've never seen the outside world,
but I understand there are many people...

876
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:30,048
...who are supposed
to be mean and greedy.

877
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,575
I just know that secretly
they are all hoping to find a garden spot...

878
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:36,652
...where there is peace and security.

879
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:38,611
Where there's beauty and comfort.

880
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:41,213
Where they wouldn't have
to be mean and greedy.

881
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:44,737
I just wish the whole world
might come to this valley.

882
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:48,337
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.

883
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:57,053
I don't know why I associate with you,
Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant...

884
01:21:57,139 --> 01:21:59,733
...or Mr. Embezzler,
or whatever your name may be.

885
01:22:00,419 --> 01:22:03,297
-Just call me Barney.
-Barney? Why should I?

886
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,216
Never, we have nothing in common.

887
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:07,138
What effrontery!

888
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:09,138
Okay, Lovey.

889
01:22:10,699 --> 01:22:14,055
And this trip to the valley.
Why did I allow you to drag me here?

890
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:16,573
You don't know anything
about these people.

891
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:18,778
We're not even armed.

892
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:22,012
They're very nice people,
except that they've got horns.

893
01:22:22,299 --> 01:22:24,255
-Horns?
-You know.

894
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:25,808
Horns.

895
01:22:27,019 --> 01:22:28,452
What kind of horns?

896
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:37,767
Come on. They won't hurt you.

897
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:40,377
All I want is a glass of wine.

898
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:41,608
-Thanks.
-Sit down.

899
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:43,769
Now this is fine. This is swell.

900
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:47,818
No, thanks, just a drink.
I've been walking and I'm a little thirsty.

901
01:22:47,899 --> 01:22:51,448
That's all right.
I just don't happen to be very hungry.

902
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:56,569
All I asked for was a glass of wine.

903
01:22:57,379 --> 01:22:59,734
Look here, I've got
to have some help with this.

904
01:23:01,019 --> 01:23:02,498
Where is Lovey?

905
01:23:03,259 --> 01:23:04,328
Look!

906
01:23:04,499 --> 01:23:05,898
Mr. Barnard!

907
01:23:09,579 --> 01:23:10,614
Come here!

908
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:24,694
I asked for a glass of wine, look what I got.

909
01:23:24,859 --> 01:23:26,451
Come on, sit down.

910
01:23:27,459 --> 01:23:29,575
This is where you are.
I might have known.

911
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:32,776
-No wonder you couldn't hear me.
-Relax and have a glass of wine.

912
01:23:32,979 --> 01:23:35,732
-Sit down!
-And be poisoned out here in the open?

913
01:23:44,339 --> 01:23:49,049
-Won't you please have a glass of wine?
-I never drink wine, in the daytime.

914
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:55,454
-There you are.
-This doesn't obligate me in any way.

915
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:56,694
No.

916
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:05,895
The bears came right into the bedroom
and the little baby bear said:

917
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:08,852
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed."

918
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:13,130
And then the mama bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed."

919
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,255
And then the big papa bear, he roared:

920
01:24:15,339 --> 01:24:17,773
"And somebody's been sleeping
in my bed."

921
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:22,969
You have to admit,
the poor little bears were in a quandary.

922
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:25,527
Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed.
Come on, Lovey.

923
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:27,655
-They were in a quandary.
-Come on, Lovey.

924
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:29,411
Why, "Come on" all the time?

925
01:24:29,499 --> 01:24:32,650
What's the matter,
you going to be a fuss-budget all your life?

926
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:35,207
Drink it up. Aren't you having any fun?

927
01:24:36,259 --> 01:24:38,375
-Where was I?
-In a quandary.

928
01:24:42,659 --> 01:24:44,570
I'm telling this story.

929
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:47,167
The poor little bears...

930
01:24:47,539 --> 01:24:52,090
...they didn't know what to do.
Somebody had been sleeping in their beds.

931
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:55,531
Who slept in their beds?
Who was it, Lovey?

932
01:24:57,219 --> 01:24:58,811
You called me "Lovey"?

933
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:03,168
Look at those eyes.
There's the devil in those eyes.

934
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:10,137
"Here we go gathering nuts in May

935
01:25:10,259 --> 01:25:14,571
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
Early on Tuesday morning

936
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:21,172
"Here we go, Shangri-La, Shangri-La

937
01:25:23,179 --> 01:25:25,135
"Here you are in Shangri-La"

938
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:18,133
Hello, Maria.

939
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:25,128
You promised to come for tea yesterday.

940
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:28,612
I waited for so long.

941
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:31,058
Sorry.

942
01:26:34,699 --> 01:26:38,135
-I haven't got any cigarettes left.
-I'll make some for you.

943
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:40,732
You will come today?

944
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:42,734
Perhaps.

945
01:26:42,859 --> 01:26:44,451
Please say you will.

946
01:26:45,219 --> 01:26:48,291
The days are very long and lonely
without you.

947
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:50,528
Please.

948
01:26:52,099 --> 01:26:53,657
All right, I'll be there.

949
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:55,578
Thank you.

950
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:59,528
You'll tell me the things
I want to know, right?

951
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:03,009
Who's in charge? Why we were kidnapped
and what will happen to us?

952
01:27:03,099 --> 01:27:05,659
Chang's been lying about those porters,
hasn't he?

953
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:38,367
Beautiful.

954
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:41,648
-I'm waiting for the bump.
-"Bump"?

955
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:45,851
When the plane lands at Shanghai
and wakes us all up.

956
01:27:47,739 --> 01:27:49,775
You see. It's not a dream.

957
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:53,056
I sometimes think
that the other is the dream.

958
01:27:53,259 --> 01:27:54,612
The outside world.

959
01:27:55,419 --> 01:27:58,411
-Have you never wanted to go there?
-Goodness, no!

960
01:27:58,499 --> 01:28:01,138
From what you tell me,
it doesn't sound very attractive.

961
01:28:01,259 --> 01:28:03,056
It's not so bad really.

962
01:28:03,819 --> 01:28:07,175
Some phases of it are sordid, of course.
That's only to be expected.

963
01:28:07,459 --> 01:28:08,528
Why?

964
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:10,207
Usual reasons.

965
01:28:10,339 --> 01:28:14,537
-A world of people struggling for existence.
-Struggling? Why?

966
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:18,448
Everyone naturally wants
to make a place for himself.

967
01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:21,338
-Accumulate a nest egg and so on.
-Why?

968
01:28:23,579 --> 01:28:26,457
If you keep on asking that,
we're not going to get anywhere.

969
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:29,849
-And don't ask me why.
-I was just going to.

970
01:28:30,059 --> 01:28:32,573
It's the most annoying word
in the English language.

971
01:28:32,659 --> 01:28:35,093
Ever hear a child torture his parent with it?

972
01:28:35,179 --> 01:28:38,137
"Mother's darling mustn't stuff her fingers
in the salad bowl."

973
01:28:38,219 --> 01:28:39,572
"Why?"

974
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:42,009
"Because it isn't ladylike to do that."

975
01:28:42,099 --> 01:28:43,498
"Why?"

976
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:46,014
"That's what forks are made for, darling."

977
01:28:46,099 --> 01:28:49,171
-"Why, Mother?"
-"Mother read it in a book somewhere.

978
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:51,898
"If Mother's little darling
doesn't take her fingers...

979
01:28:51,979 --> 01:28:56,848
"...out of the salad bowl this instant,
Mother's going to wring her little neck."

980
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:02,417
-Would you like to wring my little neck?
-I'd love it.

981
01:29:02,739 --> 01:29:04,331
Why?

982
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:12,976
I'm sorry.

983
01:29:31,179 --> 01:29:32,976
I've thought about it for years.

984
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:35,731
I knew you'd come.

985
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:38,768
And I knew when you did,
you'd never leave.

986
01:29:40,299 --> 01:29:42,529
Am I forgiven for sending for you?

987
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:44,007
Forgiven.

988
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:50,135
When we were on that plane...

989
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,813
...I was fascinated by the way
its shadow followed it.

990
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:54,492
That silly shadow...

991
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:56,774
...racing along over mountains
and valleys...

992
01:29:56,899 --> 01:29:59,174
...covering 10 times the distance
of the plane.

993
01:30:00,059 --> 01:30:04,052
Yet always there to greet us
with outstretched arms when we landed.

994
01:30:05,019 --> 01:30:09,251
I've been thinking
that somehow you're that plane...

995
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:12,174
...and I'm that silly shadow.

996
01:30:13,059 --> 01:30:15,698
That all my life,
I've been rushing up and down hills...

997
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:19,176
...leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles...

998
01:30:20,139 --> 01:30:23,654
...never dreaming that one day,
that beautiful thing in flight...

999
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:26,852
...could land on this earth
and into my arms.

1000
01:30:41,179 --> 01:30:43,568
This place is amazing.

1001
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:46,498
That marble quarry in the valley
is simply magnificent.

1002
01:30:46,619 --> 01:30:48,689
I've looked around. I've seen everything.

1003
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:51,851
Your woodworkers and your cloth weavers
are all so happy.

1004
01:30:52,419 --> 01:30:54,933
You may not know it,
but right here you have Utopia.

1005
01:30:55,019 --> 01:30:58,056
-You're very kind.
-I don't mean it in that sense.

1006
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:00,175
I only give credit where credit is due.

1007
01:31:03,379 --> 01:31:07,008
I'm very anxious to have you realise
that I never for a moment believed...

1008
01:31:07,099 --> 01:31:08,851
...that ridiculous kidnapping story.

1009
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:10,770
-I'm so glad.
-Simply preposterous.

1010
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:15,694
Do you know what I did last night?
I held a sort of a self inventory.

1011
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:20,530
I said to myself last night,
"Lovey, Mr. Lovett..."

1012
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:24,976
-I said, "You are an ungrateful fool."
-No.

1013
01:31:25,059 --> 01:31:27,527
Those are my very words
to myself last night.

1014
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:31,891
"These people here are doing everything
to make your stay comfortable...

1015
01:31:31,979 --> 01:31:35,688
"...and I haven't done one single thing
to show my appreciation."

1016
01:31:36,019 --> 01:31:37,737
What would you like to do?

1017
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:41,488
I thought with your permission
and while I'm waiting for these porters...

1018
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:44,696
...l'd like to organise classes
for the children in the valley...

1019
01:31:44,779 --> 01:31:48,089
...and teach them something practical
and something useful. Geology.

1020
01:31:48,499 --> 01:31:50,171
-Splendid.
-Isn't it?

1021
01:31:50,259 --> 01:31:52,215
I was a professor for 20 years.

1022
01:31:52,339 --> 01:31:54,694
-And a very good one.
-I'm sure you were.

1023
01:31:55,059 --> 01:31:57,368
-When would you like to start?
-Immediately.

1024
01:31:57,459 --> 01:31:59,211
Then it's done.

1025
01:31:59,299 --> 01:32:00,334
Thank you.

1026
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:02,451
You get the idea?

1027
01:32:02,539 --> 01:32:05,133
From this reservoir here,
I can pipe the whole works.

1028
01:32:05,459 --> 01:32:07,211
I'm going to get a kick out of this.

1029
01:32:07,299 --> 01:32:10,496
It's just to keep my hand in.
With the equipment we have here...

1030
01:32:10,579 --> 01:32:14,288
...I can put a plumbing system
in the whole village. Rig it up in no time.

1031
01:32:14,379 --> 01:32:17,576
Do you realise those people
are still going to the well for water?

1032
01:32:17,659 --> 01:32:20,298
-It's unbelievable.
-Think of it! In times like these!

1033
01:32:21,019 --> 01:32:22,850
What about that gold deal?

1034
01:32:23,419 --> 01:32:25,649
-Gold, you know...
-Oh, that.

1035
01:32:26,339 --> 01:32:28,933
That can wait.
Nobody's going to run off with it.

1036
01:32:29,019 --> 01:32:31,817
I've got to get busy.
I want to show this layout to Chang.

1037
01:32:31,899 --> 01:32:34,652
-Don't you take any wooden nickels.
-All right.

1038
01:32:44,499 --> 01:32:47,457
You're acting like a child.
You haven't talked for two weeks.

1039
01:32:47,539 --> 01:32:49,211
There's nothing to say.

1040
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,734
-I'm afraid that does it.
-I'm afraid it does.

1041
01:33:07,819 --> 01:33:09,138
Shall we have another?

1042
01:33:09,259 --> 01:33:11,056
Not tonight, if you don't mind.

1043
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:25,772
Come in, my dear.

1044
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:28,373
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1045
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,733
I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here.

1046
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:34,338
Excuse me.

1047
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:47,492
Charming, isn't she?

1048
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:49,418
Yes. Charming.

1049
01:33:50,259 --> 01:33:52,773
Your brother seems
quite fascinated by her.

1050
01:33:52,899 --> 01:33:55,254
Why not?
She's an attractive young woman.

1051
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:58,137
Young? She arrived here in 1888.

1052
01:33:58,659 --> 01:34:02,447
She was 20 at the time.
She was on her way to join her betrothed...

1053
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:05,139
...when her carriers
lost their way in the mountain.

1054
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:08,211
The party would've perished,
but for meeting some of our people.

1055
01:34:08,299 --> 01:34:10,859
Amazing. Still doesn't look over 20.

1056
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:14,088
When is she likely to grow old
in appearance?

1057
01:34:14,179 --> 01:34:17,728
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her
youthful indefinitely.

1058
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:19,338
Suppose she should leave?

1059
01:34:19,539 --> 01:34:20,813
Leave Shangri-La?

1060
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,854
That's not likely.
You couldn't drive her out.

1061
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:25,167
I mean her appearance.

1062
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:28,092
If she should leave the valley,
what would happen?

1063
01:34:28,659 --> 01:34:31,617
She'd quickly revert in appearance
to her actual age.

1064
01:34:34,539 --> 01:34:35,688
It's weird.

1065
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:41,453
How old are you?

1066
01:34:43,019 --> 01:34:46,375
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves.

1067
01:34:49,299 --> 01:34:51,813
Each time you Westerners...

1068
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:56,973
...celebrate your birthday,
you build another fence around your minds.

1069
01:34:58,539 --> 01:35:02,054
There you are! You're just the man
I'm looking for. A fine trick.

1070
01:35:02,259 --> 01:35:05,217
Smart, aren't you? What lies
you told us about those porters!

1071
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:07,938
The minute they arrive we can leave,
if they'd take us.

1072
01:35:08,019 --> 01:35:10,579
-But you know you'd tell 'em not to.
-My dear boy...

1073
01:35:10,659 --> 01:35:13,810
You've been lying since we arrived.
It's worked for some people.

1074
01:35:13,899 --> 01:35:16,652
Because they lack the courage
to do something. But not me.

1075
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:18,297
You're up against the wrong man.

1076
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,337
I'll leave, even if I have to blow
this place into the valley.

1077
01:35:21,419 --> 01:35:23,535
I'll get out, porters or no porters!

1078
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:29,293
You must prevail upon him
not to attempt the journey.

1079
01:35:29,379 --> 01:35:31,893
He could never get through
that country alive.

1080
01:35:32,419 --> 01:35:34,171
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide.

1081
01:35:36,299 --> 01:35:40,929
Yes, of course your brother is a problem.
It was to be expected.

1082
01:35:41,019 --> 01:35:43,897
I knew you'd understand.
That's why I came to you for help.

1083
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:49,734
You must not look to me for help.
Your brother is no longer my problem.

1084
01:35:50,739 --> 01:35:54,254
He is now your problem.

1085
01:35:54,539 --> 01:35:55,654
Mine?

1086
01:35:56,619 --> 01:36:01,647
Because, my son,
I'm placing in your hands...

1087
01:36:01,739 --> 01:36:07,257
...the future and destiny of Shangri-La...

1088
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:10,810
...for I am going to die.

1089
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:20,291
I knew my work was done,
when I first set eyes upon you.

1090
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:25,858
I've waited for you, my son,
for a long time.

1091
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:30,738
I've sat in this room
and seen the faces of newcomers.

1092
01:36:30,979 --> 01:36:34,176
I've looked into their eyes
and heard their voices...

1093
01:36:35,019 --> 01:36:39,217
...always in hope that I might find you.

1094
01:36:42,459 --> 01:36:46,896
My friend, it is not an arduous task
that I bequeath...

1095
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:51,215
...for our order knows only silken bonds.

1096
01:36:52,779 --> 01:36:55,737
To be gentle and patient.

1097
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:00,015
To care for the riches of the mind.

1098
01:37:00,859 --> 01:37:04,295
To preside in wisdom...

1099
01:37:05,499 --> 01:37:08,138
...while the storm rages without.

1100
01:37:09,019 --> 01:37:12,295
Do you think this will come in my time?

1101
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:21,411
You, my son, will live through the storm.

1102
01:37:21,859 --> 01:37:25,852
You will preserve the fragrance
of our history...

1103
01:37:26,739 --> 01:37:30,971
...and add to it a touch of your own mind.

1104
01:37:33,619 --> 01:37:37,612
Beyond that, my vision weakens.

1105
01:37:39,379 --> 01:37:42,849
But I see at a great distance...

1106
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:46,617
...a new world stirring in the ruins...

1107
01:37:48,059 --> 01:37:50,289
...stirring clumsily...

1108
01:37:51,219 --> 01:37:52,777
...but in hopefulness...

1109
01:37:53,619 --> 01:37:58,773
...seeking its lost and legendary treasures...

1110
01:38:01,339 --> 01:38:04,775
...and they will all be here, my son.

1111
01:38:06,379 --> 01:38:08,529
Hidden behind the mountains...

1112
01:38:10,099 --> 01:38:14,092
...in the Valley of the Blue Moon...

1113
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:20,449
...preserved as by a miracle.

1114
01:39:00,139 --> 01:39:03,495
We run the pipes through here
and connect with the main waterline here.

1115
01:39:03,579 --> 01:39:05,331
Where are you going to get pipes?

1116
01:39:05,419 --> 01:39:08,377
That's a cinch. I'll show them
how to cast pipes out of clay.

1117
01:39:08,459 --> 01:39:12,168
There you are. You'd better get
your things together. We're leaving.

1118
01:39:12,419 --> 01:39:15,297
-Leaving?
-The porters are taking us back.

1119
01:39:15,379 --> 01:39:17,529
We've got clothing, food, everything.

1120
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,257
When are you going to start?

1121
01:39:19,539 --> 01:39:22,451
This very minute.
They're waiting for us on the plateau.

1122
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:25,292
That Chinaman thought he could stop me.
Come along.

1123
01:39:25,499 --> 01:39:29,617
I think I'll stick around.
I'll leave with the porters on the next trip.

1124
01:39:30,219 --> 01:39:31,811
You mean you don't want to go?

1125
01:39:31,939 --> 01:39:32,815
Well, I'm...

1126
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:35,089
You're afraid of going to jail.

1127
01:39:35,739 --> 01:39:38,492
You see I've got this plumbing business.

1128
01:39:38,659 --> 01:39:41,810
If you insist being an idiot,
I won't coax you. How about you?

1129
01:39:41,899 --> 01:39:46,131
You don't want to go yet, honey.
She'll stick around, too. That right?

1130
01:39:46,219 --> 01:39:47,447
If you want me to.

1131
01:39:47,539 --> 01:39:50,178
Sure. Don't you worry.
I'll take care of you.

1132
01:39:50,259 --> 01:39:53,808
All right, suit yourself,
but just remember you had your chance.

1133
01:39:54,139 --> 01:39:56,255
-How about you? Do you want to go?
-Where?

1134
01:39:56,339 --> 01:39:58,409
Home. I've got porters to take us back.

1135
01:39:58,619 --> 01:40:01,179
I'm sorry. That's impossible.
I have my classes.

1136
01:40:01,259 --> 01:40:04,012
I don't care what you've started.
Do you want to go?

1137
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:05,857
No, I think I'd better wait.

1138
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:08,578
-Yes, I'll wait.
-You'll wait until you rot!

1139
01:40:17,899 --> 01:40:19,491
-Hello, Gloria.
-Hello.

1140
01:40:19,659 --> 01:40:22,298
I've just finished translating
an interesting old tablet.

1141
01:40:22,379 --> 01:40:24,768
It told me of the origin
of the Masonic symbols...

1142
01:40:24,859 --> 01:40:26,087
-That's swell.
-What?

1143
01:40:26,179 --> 01:40:28,135
I want to show you something.

1144
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:30,097
Isn't that pretty. What is it?

1145
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:31,976
Plumbing. Everything modern.

1146
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:34,334
I'm going to run pipes
all through the village.

1147
01:41:55,459 --> 01:41:56,938
Hello, George.

1148
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:03,095
You can stop worrying now.
I've made arrangements to leave.

1149
01:42:03,379 --> 01:42:05,939
If you let me close that window,
I can talk to you.

1150
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:08,089
That noise is driving me crazy.

1151
01:42:11,779 --> 01:42:14,532
I said we're getting out of here.
Back to civilisation.

1152
01:42:14,619 --> 01:42:18,009
I made a deal with the porters.
They're leaving tomorrow at dawn.

1153
01:42:18,099 --> 01:42:21,296
They're waiting for us outside the valley.
Get your things together.

1154
01:42:21,379 --> 01:42:23,370
-Where's your topcoat?
-You can't leave.

1155
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:25,097
What's going to stop me?

1156
01:42:25,179 --> 01:42:27,932
-You've got to stay here now.
-Stay here?

1157
01:42:28,779 --> 01:42:30,212
What's the matter with you?

1158
01:42:30,299 --> 01:42:33,689
You've acted strangely since we came.
I've never seen you like this.

1159
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:35,849
What's stopping us from leaving?

1160
01:42:36,259 --> 01:42:38,375
Something grand and beautiful.

1161
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:41,219
Something I've been searching for
all my life.

1162
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:44,657
The answer to the confusion
and bewilderment of a lifetime.

1163
01:42:45,019 --> 01:42:47,613
I've found it and I can't leave it.
You mustn't either.

1164
01:42:47,699 --> 01:42:49,849
I don't know what you're talking about.

1165
01:42:49,939 --> 01:42:52,499
You're carrying around a secret
that's eating you up.

1166
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:54,934
-Tell me about it.
-I want to tell you.

1167
01:42:55,019 --> 01:42:58,853
I'll burst with it if I don't.
It's weird and fantastic and unbelievable...

1168
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:02,852
...but so beautiful. As you know,
we were kidnapped and brought here...

1169
01:43:02,979 --> 01:43:05,209
And that's the whole story.

1170
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:11,571
He died, as peacefully as the passing
of a cloud's shadow. His last words were:

1171
01:43:12,659 --> 01:43:15,298
"I place in your hands, my son...

1172
01:43:15,859 --> 01:43:18,532
"...the future and destiny of Shangri-La."

1173
01:43:20,099 --> 01:43:22,010
Now you know why I can't leave.

1174
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:34,895
I really don't know what to say.

1175
01:43:35,819 --> 01:43:39,778
-Except that you must be completely mad.
-You think I'm mad?

1176
01:43:40,499 --> 01:43:42,694
What else can I think after a tale like that?

1177
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:44,929
Things like that don't happen today.

1178
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:47,931
-We're living in the 20th century.
-You think it's nonsense?

1179
01:43:48,019 --> 01:43:51,807
You've been hypnotised by fanatics.
I wouldn't believe it in England.

1180
01:43:51,899 --> 01:43:55,608
Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?
How do you know these things are true?

1181
01:43:55,699 --> 01:43:57,974
-Did they show you proof?
-I don't need proof.

1182
01:43:58,059 --> 01:44:00,414
I knew there was a reason
why I hated this place.

1183
01:44:00,499 --> 01:44:03,855
I'd love to fly over it with bombs
for what they've done to you.

1184
01:44:03,939 --> 01:44:06,692
All this talk about lamas
being hundreds of years old.

1185
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:09,657
How do you know?
Did you see their birth certificates?

1186
01:44:09,859 --> 01:44:11,212
I can't believe it.

1187
01:44:11,299 --> 01:44:14,848
A bunch of old men sit around
and dream about reforming the world...

1188
01:44:14,939 --> 01:44:18,136
...and you, two-feet-on-the-ground Conway,
want to join them.

1189
01:44:18,259 --> 01:44:19,578
It's horrible.

1190
01:44:20,339 --> 01:44:22,170
Is that all my story meant to you?

1191
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:25,536
What else could it mean to me?
It's obviously a lot of bunk.

1192
01:44:25,619 --> 01:44:29,214
Then you'd better go.
This is no place for you.

1193
01:44:30,539 --> 01:44:33,531
It's no place for you.
Think of what's waiting for you.

1194
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:35,689
Do you want to stay here
till you're half dead?

1195
01:44:35,779 --> 01:44:38,373
Till your mind starts corroding
like the rest of them?

1196
01:44:38,459 --> 01:44:41,417
-I don't want to talk about it anymore.
-You've got to talk.

1197
01:44:41,499 --> 01:44:43,729
And me?
They stole the plane to bring you here.

1198
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:46,379
I didn't want to come.
You owe me some responsibility.

1199
01:44:46,459 --> 01:44:48,256
I'm tired of owing you things.

1200
01:44:48,339 --> 01:44:50,295
You're free to go. Go ahead.

1201
01:44:52,299 --> 01:44:53,414
It's that girl.

1202
01:44:53,499 --> 01:44:57,651
-That girl has twisted and turned...
-That's enough. Never mind the girl.

1203
01:45:00,059 --> 01:45:01,651
Why don't you go?

1204
01:45:08,299 --> 01:45:09,618
Look here.

1205
01:45:10,259 --> 01:45:12,727
Ever since I can remember
you've looked after me.

1206
01:45:13,019 --> 01:45:15,249
Now, you're the one
that needs looking after.

1207
01:45:16,659 --> 01:45:19,776
I'm your brother.
If there's something wrong with you...

1208
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:21,617
...let me help you.

1209
01:45:27,139 --> 01:45:29,892
I don't feel like making that trip alone.

1210
01:45:35,139 --> 01:45:38,415
You couldn't possibly stay here, could you?

1211
01:45:39,219 --> 01:45:40,572
I'd go mad.

1212
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:48,608
I may be wrong. I may be a maniac...

1213
01:45:48,979 --> 01:45:51,812
...but I believe in this
and I'm not going to lose it.

1214
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:53,935
You know how much I want to help you...

1215
01:45:54,019 --> 01:45:58,251
...but this is bigger, stronger if you like,
than brotherly love.

1216
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:03,737
I'm sorry. I'm staying.

1217
01:46:07,099 --> 01:46:09,329
I can't think of anything more to say.

1218
01:46:14,779 --> 01:46:15,894
Goodbye.

1219
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:27,173
Are you sure the porters
will take care of you?

1220
01:46:27,659 --> 01:46:29,536
It's all set.

1221
01:46:29,659 --> 01:46:32,219
-Maria made the arrangements.
-Maria?

1222
01:46:33,139 --> 01:46:35,334
-The little Russian girl.
-How's she involved?

1223
01:46:35,419 --> 01:46:37,455
-She's going with me.
-You're crazy.

1224
01:46:39,299 --> 01:46:41,449
-You can't take her away from here.
-Why not?

1225
01:46:41,539 --> 01:46:44,815
You can't. Do you know what will happen
if she leaves Shangri-La?

1226
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:47,857
She's fragile and can only live
where fragile things are loved.

1227
01:46:47,939 --> 01:46:50,976
Take her out of this valley
and she'll fade away like an echo.

1228
01:46:51,139 --> 01:46:53,209
What do you mean,
"Fade away like an echo"?

1229
01:46:53,299 --> 01:46:54,937
She came here in 1888.

1230
01:46:56,299 --> 01:46:59,894
This'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic.
She isn't a day over 20.

1231
01:47:00,499 --> 01:47:02,729
-You're wrong.
-I'm not wrong. She told me so.

1232
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:05,492
Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me.
I'd know anyway.

1233
01:47:05,579 --> 01:47:07,490
I found out a lot of things last night.

1234
01:47:07,579 --> 01:47:10,377
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's one of the few decent things...

1235
01:47:10,459 --> 01:47:14,247
...that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Everyone is happy in Shangri-La.

1236
01:47:14,379 --> 01:47:17,212
Nobody would ever think of leaving.
It's all just rot!

1237
01:47:17,299 --> 01:47:20,609
She's pleaded with me since I came
to take her away from this place.

1238
01:47:20,739 --> 01:47:23,378
She's cried in my arms,
for fear I'd leave her here.

1239
01:47:23,459 --> 01:47:26,610
She's made two trips to the plateau
to bribe the porters. For me!

1240
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:28,695
I don't believe a word of it.

1241
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:30,451
All right, I'll prove it to you.

1242
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:34,612
You've believed everything they're told you
without proof. I'll prove my story.

1243
01:47:37,219 --> 01:47:38,777
Come in a minute.

1244
01:47:49,459 --> 01:47:51,495
I've got some bad news for you.

1245
01:47:52,059 --> 01:47:55,369
My brother and I've decided
we can't take you along.

1246
01:47:56,539 --> 01:48:02,057
You can't take me?
You promised to take me with you!

1247
01:48:04,259 --> 01:48:07,331
It's all your fault.
It was all arranged until he spoke to you.

1248
01:48:07,419 --> 01:48:09,250
Why can't you leave us alone?

1249
01:48:09,579 --> 01:48:13,458
-You want to leave Shangri-La?
-I'll die if I have to stay another minute.

1250
01:48:14,019 --> 01:48:17,568
I've waited a long time for this chance
and you're not going to stop me now.

1251
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,138
If I have to, I'll go alone.

1252
01:48:19,219 --> 01:48:22,291
I brought the porters.
If it weren't for me, you'd never get out.

1253
01:48:22,379 --> 01:48:24,973
The High Lama told them
not to take anyone.

1254
01:48:25,099 --> 01:48:28,455
The High Lama!
Who pays any attention to him?

1255
01:48:28,659 --> 01:48:30,650
The porters laugh at the High Lama.

1256
01:48:30,739 --> 01:48:32,889
They only want to know
how much gold he'll give.

1257
01:48:32,979 --> 01:48:36,210
I gave them more gold.
I've been stealing it for a year.

1258
01:48:36,459 --> 01:48:38,336
I'd do anything to leave this place.

1259
01:48:38,419 --> 01:48:41,217
To leave the High Lama,
who calls himself Father Perrault.

1260
01:48:41,299 --> 01:48:43,096
He's been insane for years.

1261
01:48:43,219 --> 01:48:46,814
-Father Perrault is dead.
-He's dead! That's fine.

1262
01:48:47,339 --> 01:48:50,536
You won't see me
shedding any tears over him.

1263
01:48:52,139 --> 01:48:53,891
You must take me with you.

1264
01:48:54,459 --> 01:48:56,177
Aren't you afraid to leave?

1265
01:48:56,459 --> 01:48:59,292
You don't want to look
like an old woman, do you?

1266
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:02,098
Old woman?

1267
01:49:04,299 --> 01:49:07,177
-Chang told you that, didn't he?
-Yes.

1268
01:49:07,379 --> 01:49:08,698
I thought so.

1269
01:49:09,699 --> 01:49:11,371
He tells everyone I'm old.

1270
01:49:11,859 --> 01:49:15,534
He wants them to stay away from me.
He gets mad when anyone comes near me.

1271
01:49:16,339 --> 01:49:19,172
He's punished me for every minute
I've spent with George.

1272
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:23,014
If it weren't for him, I'd have left long ago.
But he always stops me.

1273
01:49:23,099 --> 01:49:26,216
Six months ago I tried to escape
and he locked me in a dark room.

1274
01:49:26,299 --> 01:49:27,857
I nearly went crazy.

1275
01:49:28,299 --> 01:49:30,972
Look at me! Do I look like an old woman?

1276
01:49:31,339 --> 01:49:33,136
Is this the skin of an old woman?

1277
01:49:33,499 --> 01:49:36,252
Look into my eyes.
Are these the eyes of an old woman?

1278
01:49:36,339 --> 01:49:39,934
She was kidnapped and brought here
two years ago just as we were.

1279
01:49:40,379 --> 01:49:43,530
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.
She's lying.

1280
01:49:43,939 --> 01:49:46,692
You're lying.
Every word you've been saying is a lie.

1281
01:49:46,779 --> 01:49:48,451
Say it! You're lying, aren't you?

1282
01:49:48,539 --> 01:49:53,055
No, I'm not lying.
What reason could I have for lying?

1283
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:56,495
Chances are we'll never come out
of that horrible trip alive.

1284
01:49:57,339 --> 01:50:00,490
But I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm,
be buried alive...

1285
01:50:01,179 --> 01:50:03,568
...than to stay here one more minute.

1286
01:50:48,139 --> 01:50:50,937
-You say the porters are waiting for us?
-Yes.

1287
01:50:52,499 --> 01:50:54,410
-Clothes?
-Yes, everything.

1288
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:00,087
What about the others?

1289
01:51:00,179 --> 01:51:02,534
I've asked them.
They're afraid to make the trip.

1290
01:51:02,619 --> 01:51:05,087
We'll have to send
an expedition back after them.

1291
01:51:05,299 --> 01:51:06,891
Come on, we're wasting time.

1292
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:09,812
-Are you taking me?
-Certainly. Come on.

1293
01:51:20,739 --> 01:51:22,934
It won't be long before we're in London.

1294
01:51:23,019 --> 01:51:25,817
Can't you just see everyone
when we pop in out of the blue?

1295
01:51:25,899 --> 01:51:28,891
We'll have them breathless
when we tell them our story.

1296
01:51:28,979 --> 01:51:32,255
You had me worried for a while.
I thought you were gone completely.

1297
01:51:33,379 --> 01:51:36,052
Lucky for me you snapped out of it.
You saved my life.

1298
01:51:36,219 --> 01:51:38,653
-I never could have made it alone.
-What was that?

1299
01:51:38,739 --> 01:51:41,731
-I was saying...
-Shut up! Must you go on babbling?

1300
01:52:07,299 --> 01:52:10,655
-What's happened? Where's Bob?
-He's going, my child.

1301
01:52:11,019 --> 01:52:13,374
-Going?
-But he will return.

1302
01:52:13,539 --> 01:52:14,335
No!

1303
01:54:43,979 --> 01:54:47,415
I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore.
I've got to rest.

1304
01:54:54,059 --> 01:54:56,892
How long is this going to go on?
I can't stand it.

1305
01:54:57,539 --> 01:54:59,450
Can't you get them to wait for us?

1306
01:54:59,539 --> 01:55:01,689
They're leaving us
farther behind every day.

1307
01:55:01,779 --> 01:55:05,408
There's nothing that would suit 'em
more than to lose us, but we must go on.

1308
01:55:05,619 --> 01:55:09,248
-Come on, darling.
-I can't. You've got to let me rest.

1309
01:55:39,619 --> 01:55:43,055
Target practice again.
One of these days they're going to hit us.

1310
01:55:43,899 --> 01:55:47,687
As long as they keep on aiming at us,
we're safe. Come now.

1311
01:58:05,299 --> 01:58:07,255
Look at her face!

1312
02:02:25,379 --> 02:02:27,768
"Dropping from nowhere after a year! "

1313
02:02:28,059 --> 02:02:29,697
-Cable from Gainsford.
-Read it!

1314
02:02:29,899 --> 02:02:33,016
"Leaving today for London
with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria.

1315
02:02:33,099 --> 02:02:35,249
"Conway can tell nothing
of his experiences.

1316
02:02:35,339 --> 02:02:38,376
"Is suffering from complete loss
of memory." Signed, Gainsford.

1317
02:02:38,459 --> 02:02:41,019
-"Loss of memory"?
-All right, give it to the press.

1318
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:43,169
-All of it?
-Yes. Might as well all of it.

1319
02:02:43,259 --> 02:02:44,977
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.

1320
02:03:01,419 --> 02:03:04,252
Conway's gone again.
Listen to this, from Gainsford.

1321
02:03:04,419 --> 02:03:05,408
Let me have it.

1322
02:03:06,059 --> 02:03:07,458
"Aboard S.S. Manchuria.

1323
02:03:07,539 --> 02:03:10,690
"Last night Conway recovered his memory.
Talked about Shangri-La.

1324
02:03:10,779 --> 02:03:13,134
"Telling a fantastic story
about a place in Tibet.

1325

1327
02:03:17,979 --> 02:03:21,051
"I'm leaving ship to overtake him,
as fearful of his condition.

1328
02:03:21,139 --> 02:03:24,848
"Wrote down details of Conway's story
about Shangri-La, which I am forwarding.

1329
02:03:25,019 --> 02:03:26,134
"Lord Gainsford."

1330
02:03:42,379 --> 02:03:44,210
Here's Gainsford now.

1331
02:03:46,939 --> 02:03:49,407
-It's good to see you back.
-Glad to see you.

1332
02:03:49,499 --> 02:03:52,172
-It's good to see you again.
-Thought you would never come.

1333
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:55,414
-Sit down. Have a drink.
-Scotch and soda. I'm parched.

1334
02:03:55,579 --> 02:03:57,331
Here you are. Ready and waiting.

1335
02:03:57,419 --> 02:04:00,411
-Any news of Conway?
-We're eager to know what you discovered.

1336
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:01,488
Where is he?

1337
02:04:01,699 --> 02:04:05,931
Gentlemen, you see before you
a very weary old man...

1338
02:04:06,539 --> 02:04:09,451
...who has just ended a chase
that lasted nearly 10 months.

1339
02:04:09,539 --> 02:04:11,211
You never caught up with him?

1340
02:04:11,299 --> 02:04:14,257
Since that night he jumped off the ship,
till two weeks ago...

1341
02:04:14,339 --> 02:04:16,978
-...l've been missing him by inches.
-You don't mean it.

1342
02:04:17,059 --> 02:04:20,051
-Was he that determined to get back?
-Determined?

1343
02:04:20,819 --> 02:04:25,939
Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life,
I've never encountered anything so grim.

1344
02:04:26,579 --> 02:04:30,811
During those last 10 months, that man
has done the most astounding things.

1345
02:04:31,219 --> 02:04:35,417
He learned how to fly, stole a plane,
got caught, put in jail, escaped...

1346
02:04:35,499 --> 02:04:37,376
...in an amazingly short space of time.

1347
02:04:37,459 --> 02:04:39,450
This is only the beginning of his adventure.

1348
02:04:39,539 --> 02:04:43,612
He begged and fought,
pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier.

1349
02:04:43,859 --> 02:04:47,010
Everywhere I heard these amazing stories
of the man's adventures.

1350
02:04:47,099 --> 02:04:49,408
Positively astounding. Till eventually...

1351
02:04:49,539 --> 02:04:52,337
...I trailed him
to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.

1352
02:04:52,739 --> 02:04:54,650
Of course, he had already gone.

1353
02:04:54,739 --> 02:04:56,138
But his memory...

1354
02:04:57,059 --> 02:05:00,654
His memory will live with those natives
for the rest of their lives.

1355
02:05:00,859 --> 02:05:03,089
"The man who was not human,"
they called him.

1356
02:05:03,659 --> 02:05:06,457
They won't forget the stranger
who tried six times...

1357
02:05:06,539 --> 02:05:10,248
...to climb a mountain pass
that no other human being dared to travel.

1358
02:05:10,339 --> 02:05:13,570
And six times was forced back
by the severest storms.

1359
02:05:14,179 --> 02:05:17,410
They won't forget the madman
who stole their food and clothing.

1360
02:05:17,499 --> 02:05:20,889
Who they locked up in their barracks
and who fought six guards to escape.

1361
02:05:20,979 --> 02:05:24,415
Their soldiers are still talking
about their pursuit to overtake him...

1362
02:05:24,499 --> 02:05:26,330
...and shuddering at the memory.

1363
02:05:26,579 --> 02:05:29,457
He led them the wildest chase
through their own country.

1364
02:05:30,139 --> 02:05:34,451
Finally, he disappeared
over that very mountain pass...

1365
02:05:34,939 --> 02:05:37,897
...that they themselves dared not travel.

1366
02:05:38,979 --> 02:05:40,298
And that, gentlemen...

1367
02:05:40,539 --> 02:05:45,329
...was the last that any known
human being saw of Robert Conway.

1368
02:05:45,419 --> 02:05:46,932
That's what I call fortitude.

1369
02:05:47,019 --> 02:05:49,249
-Think of it.
-Tell me something, Gainsford.

1370
02:05:49,579 --> 02:05:53,413
What do you think of his talk
about Shangri-La? Do you believe it?

1371
02:05:56,379 --> 02:05:58,210
Yes. I believe it.

1372
02:05:58,579 --> 02:06:02,857
I believe it, because I want to believe it.

1373
02:06:05,259 --> 02:06:06,738
I give you a toast.

1374
02:06:08,139 --> 02:06:09,697
Here's my hope...

1375
02:06:10,059 --> 02:06:13,893
...that Robert Conway
will find his Shangri-La.

1376
02:06:14,819 --> 02:06:16,571
Here's my hope...

1377
02:06:17,099 --> 02:06:20,296
...that we all find our Shangri-La.
