1
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,393
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

2
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,677
Thank you.

3
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,229
Good morning.

4
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:51,688
Deposit.

5
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:02,323
Another nice deposit.

6
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,488
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

7
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,158
I'm in a hurry, please.

8
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,036
Hi, Kate.

9
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,207
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

10
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:39,706
I haven't had time yet.

11
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:41,955
You should always do that one first.

12
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,053
Anne!

13
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:58,554
Come here.

14
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,440
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

15
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,028
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

16
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,314
Send Joe in.

17
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:11,489
Joe.

18
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,916
Hello, Pretty Boy.

19
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:27,459
- Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

20
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:31,382
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

21
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,278
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

22
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,825
- You want me?
- What's the idea of throwing that stone?

23
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,086
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,880
You're tough? Come here!

25
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,301
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway?

26
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,183
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

27
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,606
What for? What do you want?

28
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,606
Just wanna talk to her.

29
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,023
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

30
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,527
You live around here?

31
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,531
- In Monterey?
- Salinas.

32
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,949
What's your name?

33
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:45,832
You're not talking? Now, look...

34
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,040
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,909
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,959
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,967
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,303
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

39
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,596
She owns that house over there, too,
don't she?

40
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:05,052
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young.

41
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:07,469
Now come on. Now beat it.

42
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,307
Is that her real name?

43
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:15,271
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

44
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,363
What's her last name?

45
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,242
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

46
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:28,534
You tell her I hate her.

47
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,062
I should have gone right on in there.

48
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:58,434
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

49
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:24,588
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

50
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,300
- You know what the girls in class call him?
- No, what?

51
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,014
The Prowler.

52
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,093
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

53
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,561
- Promise me you won't.
- Why not?

54
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,934
Please don't. I don't want you...

55
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:37,982
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

56
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,609
Hello, Cal.

57
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,778
Excuse me for talking.

58
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:44,650
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

59
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,364
- Do you want to come?
- What icehouse?

60
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,738
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

61
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,579
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

62
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:52,908
Is Dad gonna be there?

63
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,037
Why sure, he's gonna buy it.

64
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:58,496
I'll skip it.

65
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,496
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

66
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,425
- Come on.
- Hey, Aron.

67
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,458
Yeah?

68
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:09,587
- Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- Would you tell me?

69
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,052
- No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

70
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,262
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

71
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:20,514
He was worried.

72
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:22,770
Yeah, I bet.

73
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,605
You gonna come or not?

74
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,738
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

75
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:33,240
He's coming.

76
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:36,032
He's coming.

77
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,584
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

78
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,343
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

79
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:51,925
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

80
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:52,962
Mastodon?

81
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,510
What have you got to say for yourself?

82
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,767
This is my son, Cal.

83
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,819
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

84
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:12,526
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

85
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:16,281
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

86
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:18,245
Well, times change.

87
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,872
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

88
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,118
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

89
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,378
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

90
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:31,880
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

91
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:33,711
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

92
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,887
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

93
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,721
- Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
- I know.

94
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,179
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

95
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:49,064
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress...

96
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,899
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

97
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:55,272
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

98
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:59,315
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

99
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,993
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

100
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,746
as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

101
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:09,160
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

102
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:10,534
- Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
- Hello.

103
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,793
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Dad.

104
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:16,045
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

105
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,211
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

106
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,545
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

107
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,632
and it still came out fresh and good.
Right?

108
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:23,804
Quite right, Son.

109
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:28,139
- Dad, is it all right if we look around?
- 'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

110
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:33,142
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

111
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:34,979
- Where?
- New York City.

112
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,944
And they can't raise them there.

113
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,818
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

114
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:44,114
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

115
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:46,410
- Yeah.
- It's about time. Well?

116
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,124
I read in the Monterey newspaper...

117
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,164
that if we get into this war...

118
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,960
there are gonna be some fortunes made.

119
00:14:57,216 --> 00:15:01,677
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

120
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:05,642
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

121
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:07,302
Beans are up to 3 cents.

122
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,349
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

123
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:11,429
And they keep, too, don't they?

124
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:14,807
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

125
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,323
Look here, Will.

126
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,361
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

127
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:27,610
but I know I have an idea here.

128
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:31,369
I come from a whole family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

129
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:33,533
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...

130
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:35,369
and the only one that ever made a dime.

131
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,619
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

132
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,714
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

133
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:48,590
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

134
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,256
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

135
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,226
I don't understand him. I never have.

136
00:15:53,312 --> 00:15:56,064
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

137
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,349
Help me up.

138
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,814
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

139
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,534
No, Cal.

140
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,286
It's dark in here and spooky.

141
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,200
Why is he so alone all the time?

142
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,458
- He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

143
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,629
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

144
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,955
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

145
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,050
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

146
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:29,543
- I guess I don't know him very well.
- I love him.

147
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:33,090
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

148
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:35,849
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

149
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,310
Sort of like an animal.

150
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,188
I don't know, he scares me.

151
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,609
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

152
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:47,563
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

153
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,114
I wish it was right now.

154
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,861
- So do I.
- Do you?

155
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,662
Abra.

156
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,214
- When we get...
- I love you, Aron.

157
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,872
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

158
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,798
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

159
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:40,033
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

160
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:42,956
- I hope so.
- You are.

161
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,418
A perfect one.

162
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,958
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

163
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,081
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

164
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:56,554
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

165
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:01,304
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

166
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,137
- Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

167
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,305
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is, too.

168
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:09,185
Let's move over here. Aron.

169
00:18:20,662 --> 00:18:24,113
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

170
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,494
I love you, Aron.

171
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,333
Really, I do. Really.

172
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,924
Sure. I love you, too.

173
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,692
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

174
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:01,656
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:07,531
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven..."

176
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:09,201
"whose sin is covered."

177
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:14,041
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity..."

178
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:18,086
"and in whose spirit there is no guile."

179
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,049
And you are forgiven, Cal.

180
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,013
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

181
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:29,384
only something I do not know.

182
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,982
Why did you push that ice down?

183
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,022
I don't know.

184
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,394
Was it...

185
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,401
Was it vengeance? Anger?

186
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:49,944
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

187
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:51,827
What was it?

188
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:56,539
I wanted to see it slide down the chute.

189
00:19:58,172 --> 00:20:01,505
- Perhaps you had better read from here on.
- I'll read it, Dad.

190
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,917
No, it's for Cal to read.

191
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,169
Start at the fifth verse.

192
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,925
Verse 5.

193
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:30,075
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid."

194
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,912
"I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord..."

195
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,534
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

196
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:36,620
Go on.

197
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,335
Six.

198
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,630
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

199
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:48,255
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

200
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:52,635
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee."

201
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:54,800
"And surely in the floods of great waters..."

202
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:58,142
"they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

203
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,225
Seven.

204
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:00,807
Not the numbers, Cal.

205
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:04,938
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble..."

206
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:08,895
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

207
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,653
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

208
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:15,286
Through and through, bad.

209
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:18,206
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

210
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,709
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

211
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:33,756
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

212
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:36,005
Well, it's true.

213
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,885
Aron's the good one.

214
00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:41,059
I guess there's just a certain amount...

215
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:43,138
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

216
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:45,639
- and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

217
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,191
Cal, listen to me.

218
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,893
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

219
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:52,312
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

220
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,979
That's where he's different from an animal.

221
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:00,033
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

222
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:08,040
My mother...

223
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,708
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

224
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:16,799
is she?

225
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,342
Why do you ask that?

226
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,719
She's not dead at all.

227
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:26,682
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

228
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,518
She's alive.

229
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,933
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

230
00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:32,569
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

231
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,860
He was just passing through.

232
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:38,908
How come you told Aron and me she died?

233
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:41,566
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

234
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,081
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

235
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:54,207
I have no idea. She went East.

236
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:55,800
How do you know?

237
00:22:56,343 --> 00:23:00,590
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

238
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,091
I heard she went East.

239
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:06,217
What was she like? Was she bad?

240
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,142
I guess she...

241
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:13,647
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

242
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:16,101
There was something she seemed to lack.

243
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:19,980
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

244
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:24,194
I never knew what she was after.

245
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:27,449
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that, either.

246
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,371
She was so full of hate.

247
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:34,129
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

248
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:40,962
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

249
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,715
No.

250
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,879
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

251
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:53,056
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

252
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:54,890
I've told you, Cal.

253
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:58,940
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

254
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,110
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

255
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:07,819
She had the most lovely hands.

256
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,322
Like ivory.

257
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:12,620
She took such good care of them.

258
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,376
Her mother had arthritis.

259
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,710
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

260
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:26,671
Talk to me, Father.

261
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:34,346
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like.

262
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:35,765
I got to know...

263
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:38,601
Where is she?

264
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:42,022
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

265
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,150
after she left, I never heard from her.

266
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,192
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

267
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:53,619
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again.

268
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,873
You coming home tonight, Cal?

269
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:59,077
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

270
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,742
Good evening, Cal.

271
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:05,254
High strung. Very high strung.

272
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:08,550
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

273
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:10,919
- He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht.
- Good.

274
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:13,302
What do you suppose he meant by that?

275
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,278
Go on, beat it!

276
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,317
Your wife has called up three times.

277
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:37,359
- My wife's a...
- I know she is. Now beat it.

278
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:48,666
Joe!

279
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:56,217
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

280
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,180
Mr. Hawks.

281
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,644
- What do you want?
- I want...

282
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,266
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

283
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,204
Hey!

284
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,661
- Where's my drink?
- All right.

285
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,250
That's not very neat, is...

286
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,166
It's okay.

287
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,673
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

288
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,966
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

289
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,544
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

290
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,640
Only, Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

291
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,765
You can tell him if you want to.

292
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,474
You're just a kid, ain't you?

293
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,222
- I'm older than you are.
- Yeah, sure, but that isn't...

294
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,895
- Hey!
- All right.

295
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,650
Kid, please...

296
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,277
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

297
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,940
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

298
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,325
There's Joe.

299
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,665
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt.

300
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:12,787
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

301
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,752
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

302
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:27,303
- Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

303
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:30,514
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

304
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:32,349
I gotta go now, kid.

305
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:33,816
Is she nice?

306
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:35,692
Don't let Joe see you, please.

307
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:38,102
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

308
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:41,113
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

309
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,820
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

310
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,535
What's the matter, kid?

311
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:50,035
- She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
- Hands?

312
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:51,239
Did you look at them?

313
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:54,584
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

314
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,247
Where is she?

315
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,216
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

316
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:05,256
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

317
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:07,055
Back that way.

318
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,469
Will you show me?

319
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:14,932
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

320
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:17,645
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

321
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,652
We... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

322
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:21,900
No, honest.

323
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:24,942
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

324
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:27,488
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

325
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:30,827
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

326
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:34,155
Come on, will you?

327
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,575
You can just show me where the door is.

328
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:38,242
Come on.

329
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:41,588
Be a sport.

330
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:46,219
Come on.

331
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,310
There's the door.

332
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,728
Thank you. You can go back now.

333
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,321
What are you gonna do?

334
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:10,445
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

335
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:16,621
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

336
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:12,711
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

337
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:16,880
I gotta talk to you.

338
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:23,975
Joe!

339
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,355
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

340
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:33,691
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

341
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,864
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

342
00:30:40,454 --> 00:30:42,743
I want to talk to her!

343
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,957
I want to talk to you!

344
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:58,043
Please, talk to me!

345
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:01,720
Talk to me, please! Mother!

346
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,720
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

347
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:09,055
No, I guess there isn't.

348
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,056
Here.

349
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,235
Put this on your cheek. Here.

350
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:21,277
Drink some coffee.

351
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,987
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

352
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,998
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

353
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,704
The one they call "Rabbit."

354
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:34,538
I thought so. He never was any good.

355
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:37,668
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

356
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:42,757
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

357
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:48,684
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging...

358
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:51,095
Yes, there is! I'm the law.

359
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:53,230
Get that through your head.

360
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,144
Shut up!

361
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:05,575
Does Adam know that you...

362
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:07,737
roam around over here at night?

363
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,167
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

364
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:17,578
way back in his ranch days.

365
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:21,874
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

366
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:25,470
that you might find out something
about Kate.

367
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:29,391
But then she was over here on the Bay...

368
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:32,809
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

369
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:36,894
- So I figured it'd be all right.
- You think he'll ever find out about her?

370
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:39,605
He'd never come over here.

371
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,697
Here. You might as well look at this now.

372
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:50,616
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

373
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:54,118
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

374
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:00,915
I knew it.

375
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:04,839
I knew it was true.

376
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:09,841
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

377
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,926
How did you know it was true?

378
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:18,269
'Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

379
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:21,025
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

380
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:30,195
I hate her.

381
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,782
And I hate him, too.

382
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,202
Come on, I'll take you home.

383
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:41,413
- You don't have to drive me home!
- I know I don't have to take you home!

384
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:43,786
Here.

385
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,383
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

386
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:49,130
Come on now.

387
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:04,558
How did Dad meet her?

388
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:07,609
Where did she come from?

389
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:11,067
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

390
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:15,241
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

391
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,864
Of all the people.

392
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,410
How come he married her?

393
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,623
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

394
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:29,002
Young and full of spirit.

395
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,795
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

396
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,877
He's not a worldly man.

397
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:47,311
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

398
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,485
How come?

399
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,316
I don't know.

400
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,947
Did he do something to her?

401
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,529
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

402
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,786
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

403
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,619
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

404
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,752
He must have done something to hurt her.

405
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,214
No. No, sir.

406
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:19,636
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

407
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:25,348
You see, your father has more kindness...

408
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:30,106
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

409
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:44,610
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

410
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,687
It's going to work.

411
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:15,857
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

412
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:27,905
It's going to work.

413
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:47,469
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

414
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,978
All right, bring her on. Come on.

415
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:03,355
Now do you think it'll work?

416
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:27,046
- Good morning, Mr. Trask.
- Good morning.

417
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,255
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

418
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,841
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

419
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,014
It's this war in Europe.

420
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:39,685
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

421
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:41,682
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

422
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:43,352
- Is that where you're loading?
- Yes.

423
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:45,352
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

424
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,105
It's this war in Europe.

425
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:03,085
Do you know where Aron is?

426
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:06,461
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

427
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:07,663
Can I do something for you?

428
00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:10,961
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

429
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:12,761
What have you got there?

430
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:17,180
I figured it would save some time. So I...

431
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:20,968
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

432
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:22,688
Yep.

433
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:25,229
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

434
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:26,976
and are working so well, Cal.

435
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:28,811
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

436
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:37,278
Think you better have your lunch now.
It's time.

437
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:40,827
Hi, Cal.

438
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:45,789
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

439
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:49,751
- Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

440
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:03,928
Lydia, vamoose.

441
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,231
He'll be here in a minute.

442
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:23,027
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.

443
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:24,700
No, thanks.

444
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,999
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

445
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:30,118
Who?

446
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:36,171
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

447
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:42,261
Girls follow you around, don't they?

448
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:45,349
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

449
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:47,384
Who is she?

450
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:52,223
I never saw her before in my life.

451
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,140
I'll bet.

452
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:01,192
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

453
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:03,493
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

454
00:40:03,577 --> 00:40:06,329
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

455
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:08,073
Just about all he's got.

456
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:10,788
I like your father.

457
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:13,040
Do you?

458
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,504
I threw away about $3,000 once.

459
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:22,132
Yeah?

460
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,798
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

461
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,682
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

462
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,341
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

463
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:33,852
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

464
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:37,935
I reckon it would.

465
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:40,732
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

466
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:42,364
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

467
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,860
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

468
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:50,579
- That's right.
- And you forgave him?

469
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:52,289
That's right.

470
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,498
Is there an egg in this basket?

471
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:59,746
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

472
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:03,588
Girls love their fathers terribly.

473
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,458
Do they?

474
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,471
My mother died when I was 13...

475
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:11,760
and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

476
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,809
No, I didn't know that.

477
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:17,144
Are you interested in hearing about me?

478
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:18,311
Yeah.

479
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:25,562
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

480
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:28,323
I just hated everybody.

481
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:31,235
I used to sit and just glare at people...

482
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:34,116
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

483
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,286
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

484
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,372
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

485
00:41:43,465 --> 00:41:45,790
I thought nobody in the world loved me.

486
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,002
And it was awful.

487
00:41:52,182 --> 00:41:55,182
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

488
00:41:56,603 --> 00:41:59,354
- so I took it and threw it in the river.
- Good.

489
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:02,648
I thought you'd like that.

490
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,937
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

491
00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:09,608
They tried.

492
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:12,235
What'd they do to you?

493
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:15,161
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

494
00:42:15,245 --> 00:42:17,867
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all.

495
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:21,456
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

496
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:23,122
But he didn't.

497
00:42:23,962 --> 00:42:26,085
Isn't it funny?

498
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:28,964
I'm grown up now...

499
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:31,624
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

500
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,883
You're not so grown-up.

501
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:35,213
- I'm very grown-up.
- That's a matter of opinion.

502
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm very grown-up.

503
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:40,390
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

504
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,596
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

505
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:47,895
I felt better.

506
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,153
Now we get along fine.

507
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:02,242
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

508
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,333
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

509
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:12,588
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

510
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,593
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

511
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,566
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

512
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,854
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

513
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:38,653
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

514
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,992
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

515
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,166
My, your hair's in a mess.

516
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,707
Dad, what's that?

517
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,134
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

518
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,379
Aron! I brought your lunch.

519
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,470
Looks like a coal chute.

520
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,600
Coal chute?

521
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,724
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

522
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:12,812
Cal!

523
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,311
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

524
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,740
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

525
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,625
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

526
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,333
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

527
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,712
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

528
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:44,336
- Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

529
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,597
- What'd you say?
- I said, it's a good idea if it works.

530
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:50,139
It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.

531
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:52,350
It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.

532
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:56,433
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

533
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:58,851
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

534
00:45:02,323 --> 00:45:04,861
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

535
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:10,236
Good luck, Adam.

536
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:46,780
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

537
00:45:46,865 --> 00:45:49,403
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to...

538
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:51,569
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

539
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:53,904
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

540
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:56,914
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

541
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:59,704
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

542
00:45:59,794 --> 00:46:01,870
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

543
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:03,706
and about time he learned to drive it.

544
00:46:03,798 --> 00:46:06,336
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

545
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:08,418
Now pay strict attention, boys.

546
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:10,549
Don't touch that!

547
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,263
Wait till it's explained to you.

548
00:46:12,348 --> 00:46:15,385
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

549
00:46:16,227 --> 00:46:19,228
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

550
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,931
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

551
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:26,856
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

552
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:29,650
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

553
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,776
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

554
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,820
This here's the ignition key.

555
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:39,582
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

556
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,833
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

557
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:44,959
- See where it says "bat"?
- Yes.

558
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:48,497
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

559
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:50,460
Thank you. Thank you very much.

560
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:52,093
First you gotta retard the spark.

561
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:55,878
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

562
00:46:55,973 --> 00:46:57,551
Now remember that.

563
00:46:57,683 --> 00:46:59,261
This here is the spark.

564
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:02,602
You push her way up. Listen.

565
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:07,101
- This here's the gas. You push her...
- Down.

566
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,193
- You had lessons before.
- No, I just saw you do it.

567
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,907
- You're a pretty smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

568
00:47:14,991 --> 00:47:17,482
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

569
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,911
Now, this here is the crank.

570
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:23,199
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

571
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:26,126
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

572
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:27,669
Push in till she catches.

573
00:47:27,754 --> 00:47:29,248
See how my thumb is turned down?

574
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:30,881
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

575
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:33,800
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

576
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,877
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

577
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:39,967
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

578
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,133
- That's kind of wrong way around.
- How's that?

579
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,476
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

580
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:49,064
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in.

581
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:51,731
Then you give her a hard spin.

582
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:55,361
- She caught, first time!
- Caught on what?

583
00:47:56,198 --> 00:47:58,025
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

584
00:47:58,115 --> 00:48:00,785
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

585
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:02,742
So, there you are.

586
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:05,366
Isn't that wonderful?

587
00:48:05,456 --> 00:48:07,994
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

588
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:09,115
That's the easy part.

589
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,084
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

590
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,744
Spark up, gas down.

591
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,215
Switch to bat.

592
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:18,051
Crank to compression, thumb down.

593
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:20,093
You get that? Let's have it again.

594
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,255
Spark up, gas down.

595
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:24,554
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

596
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:27,595
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

597
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:30,390
Can see water running out of the cars.

598
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:46,363
It's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

599
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:48,364
Someday, somebody'll prove it.

600
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:52,579
- It was your idea.
- No!

601
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:55,503
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

602
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,425
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

603
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:05,677
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

604
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:09,388
You don't understand him.

605
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:12,761
- You can't go in there.
- I gotta see Will Hamilton.

606
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:15,261
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

607
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:17,432
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

608
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,526
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

609
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:22,154
Right, left.

610
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:38,288
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

611
00:49:51,141 --> 00:49:52,932
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

612
00:49:53,018 --> 00:49:54,678
We better have a look.

613
00:49:56,855 --> 00:50:00,354
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

614
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:03,771
- Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
- Hello, Cal.

615
00:50:03,861 --> 00:50:05,735
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

616
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:07,316
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

617
00:50:07,406 --> 00:50:08,438
Yeah. I had to see you.

618
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:10,490
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

619
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:12,901
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

620
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:15,908
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again.

621
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:19,284
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

622
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:22,911
- You see, I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

623
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,543
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

624
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:28,915
you ought to raise beans?

625
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,252
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

626
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:33,588
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

627
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,840
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

628
00:50:35,934 --> 00:50:37,808
I don't see any way out.

629
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:41,393
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

630
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:44,980
See, that's why I wanna go into beans.

631
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:49,026
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

632
00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:52,276
I see.

633
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,609
You think you can make
all that money back?

634
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:57,078
I gotta.

635
00:50:57,162 --> 00:50:59,072
You know, you're crazy.

636
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:01,870
Look, Cal, don't you know...

637
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,746
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

638
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,163
- I'll get some money.
- How?

639
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,127
I'll get it.

640
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:13,216
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

641
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,174
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

642
00:51:16,265 --> 00:51:18,423
If you had $5,000...

643
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,099
$5,000?

644
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:28,900
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

645
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:33,362
I know you wanna help your father...

646
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:36,567
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

647
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:40,277
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

648
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,827
I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

649
00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:45,702
- I'll get $5,000.
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together...

650
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,462
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal.

651
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:49,576
I'll get the $5,000.

652
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,664
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

653
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:55,005
Yeah.

654
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:58,466
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

655
00:51:58,555 --> 00:52:01,307
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

656
00:52:01,391 --> 00:52:04,309
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

657
00:52:04,895 --> 00:52:07,730
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

658
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:10,269
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

659
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:11,816
So will a lot of other farmers.

660
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:14,771
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

661
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:20,238
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

662
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:23,657
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

663
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:25,661
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

664
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:27,990
We're apt to be in war any minute.

665
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:31,784
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

666
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:34,204
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

667
00:52:34,297 --> 00:52:36,705
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

668
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,958
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

669
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:41,839
That's what I want. That's it. See?

670
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,136
- How much will I make?
- Enough for what you want.

671
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:36,393
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

672
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:38,976
It's in the Bible.

673
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:44,269
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

674
00:53:45,408 --> 00:53:47,151
That's in the Bible, too.

675
00:53:51,413 --> 00:53:52,741
What's he like?

676
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:56,825
He looks like you.

677
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:00,670
Is he like me?

678
00:54:00,755 --> 00:54:02,831
No. He's good.

679
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,381
I'm more like you.

680
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:13,601
How's Adam?

681
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:15,887
How's your father?

682
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:19,395
I don't wanna talk about him.

683
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:30,439
- You don't?
- No.

684
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,495
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

685
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:43,913
I knew you didn't.

686
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,923
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

687
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:52,549
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

688
00:54:57,518 --> 00:54:58,929
What do you want?

689
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:03,229
Just to look at me?

690
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:10,688
I want $5,000.

691
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:26,707
All right, come on in. Sit down.

692
00:55:27,422 --> 00:55:28,585
Come in.

693
00:55:30,258 --> 00:55:31,586
Try that chair.

694
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:36,303
You got your father's eyes.

695
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:39,638
That's all I can see of him.

696
00:55:40,977 --> 00:55:43,977
- You're a nice looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

697
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:50,813
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

698
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:56,942
Caleb and Aron.

699
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:00,154
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

700
00:56:00,245 --> 00:56:01,620
Them's just names.

701
00:56:02,163 --> 00:56:04,785
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

702
00:56:04,874 --> 00:56:06,784
Are you good in your studies?

703
00:56:08,628 --> 00:56:10,585
I get by with them.

704
00:56:10,672 --> 00:56:12,665
Does Aron get by with them?

705
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:13,920
He's bright.

706
00:56:15,218 --> 00:56:18,717
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

707
00:56:19,638 --> 00:56:20,634
Maybe.

708
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:24,052
Or back to some ranch?

709
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:26,978
No, I don't like the ranch.

710
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:29,646
You take after me.

711
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:33,857
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

712
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:36,851
Sit down.

713
00:56:41,744 --> 00:56:42,739
Thanks.

714
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:52,456
What do you want with $5,000?

715
00:56:53,212 --> 00:56:54,956
I want to go into business.

716
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:58,381
- You're a little young for that, aren't you?
- I'm old enough.

717
00:56:58,885 --> 00:57:01,423
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

718
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,718
- What business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

719
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:10,603
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

720
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:13,309
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

721
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:16,185
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

722
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:18,399
- Will Hamilton says that...
- Will?

723
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:20,812
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

724
00:57:20,906 --> 00:57:22,281
You see...

725
00:57:24,242 --> 00:57:27,742
my father, he lost about all he had in...

726
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:30,830
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

727
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,584
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

728
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,706
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

729
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:40,747
Yeah.

730
00:57:43,552 --> 00:57:44,548
Only...

731
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,429
Only he's too good to bother with money.

732
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,766
Okay.

733
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,442
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

734
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:08,275
I don't know who else to ask.

735
00:58:10,662 --> 00:58:12,536
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

736
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,493
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

737
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:23,544
It's a good business venture.

738
00:58:26,593 --> 00:58:29,345
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

739
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,099
You're a business woman, ain't you?

740
00:58:32,182 --> 00:58:33,676
One of the best, Son.

741
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:39,804
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

742
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:47,190
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

743
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,407
This $5,000, now.

744
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:56,329
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

745
00:58:56,414 --> 00:58:58,157
I never thought about that.

746
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,491
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

747
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,960
- I guess, maybe.
- It's not.

748
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,759
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

749
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:15,760
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

750
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:18,258
Father thinks you're in the East...

751
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:21,476
and Aron thinks you're dead.

752
00:59:22,564 --> 00:59:26,514
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

753
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,776
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

754
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:37,931
What are you staring at?

755
00:59:39,893 --> 00:59:41,387
How come you did it?

756
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:43,391
Did what?

757
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:46,393
Shot my father?

758
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:49,731
Did he tell you that?

759
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:55,490
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

760
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:58,909
- Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
- None of your business.

761
01:00:00,288 --> 01:00:02,660
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

762
01:00:03,624 --> 01:00:06,245
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

763
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,577
I just wanted him to let me go.

764
01:00:09,254 --> 01:00:12,754
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

765
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,755
He wanted to tie me down.

766
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:18,466
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

767
01:00:18,555 --> 01:00:20,797
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

768
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:23,097
Nobody holds me.

769
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:25,643
- But he loved you.
- Love.

770
01:00:27,355 --> 01:00:29,312
He wanted to own me.

771
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:32,562
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

772
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:36,352
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

773
01:00:37,865 --> 01:00:41,199
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

774
01:00:41,994 --> 01:00:44,117
Reading the Bible at me.

775
01:00:44,956 --> 01:00:47,281
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

776
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:50,957
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

777
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,956
Always so right himself?

778
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:55,834
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

779
01:00:57,384 --> 01:01:00,634
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

780
01:01:04,141 --> 01:01:05,884
Yeah, you got sense.

781
01:01:06,435 --> 01:01:09,685
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

782
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:13,520
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

783
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:16,693
I got the toughest house on the coast...

784
01:01:16,778 --> 01:01:19,103
and the finest clientele.

785
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:23,820
Half the stinking city hall go there.

786
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:27,071
They sneak in at night...

787
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:30,080
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

788
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:32,915
And I built it up from nothing.

789
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,376
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

790
01:01:36,464 --> 01:01:39,299
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

791
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:41,002
You know, that's funny.

792
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:44,762
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

793
01:01:44,846 --> 01:01:47,218
No, but it's funny just the same.

794
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:49,510
Your father.

795
01:01:50,268 --> 01:01:52,640
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

796
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:57,182
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

797
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:01,144
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

798
01:02:01,237 --> 01:02:03,479
to save him his purity.

799
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:07,775
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

800
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:18,582
Okay.

801
01:02:22,716 --> 01:02:25,005
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

802
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:29,381
He's a good businessman.

803
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:36,432
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

804
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:38,183
I don't know.

805
01:02:39,732 --> 01:02:41,855
I do. Maybe he likes you.

806
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:44,065
Maybe.

807
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:49,029
You're a likeable kid.

808
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,249
You give this to him.

809
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,671
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

810
01:03:04,756 --> 01:03:06,131
it's okay with me.

811
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:27,312
You're a likeable kid.

812
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,986
Go on, get out of here.

813
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:42,405
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

814
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:27,040
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

815
01:04:54,695 --> 01:04:55,726
Hi, partner.

816
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,364
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

817
01:05:04,329 --> 01:05:05,491
Kaiser.

818
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,866
All we have to do is call his bluff.
He'll come to heel like a dog.

819
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:19,081
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

820
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:36,191
Cal, stop it.

821
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,483
There's Cal.

822
01:05:45,327 --> 01:05:48,162
- Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
- Hello, Cal.

823
01:05:48,706 --> 01:05:49,701
Thanks.

824
01:05:58,423 --> 01:06:02,467
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

825
01:06:02,885 --> 01:06:05,092
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that.

826
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:06,294
Will you go?

827
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:08,465
I think the war will be over. I don't think...

828
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:12,176
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

829
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,894
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

830
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,972
No, I guess you didn't.

831
01:06:18,316 --> 01:06:20,772
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

832
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:30,658
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

833
01:06:32,247 --> 01:06:34,405
I just don't believe it's right.

834
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:53,507
- Did you water them good?
- Sure, lots of water.

835
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:55,807
- Not too much, though.
- No, just right.

836
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,038
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

837
01:07:17,123 --> 01:07:19,199
I remember the day we sent him off.

838
01:07:21,753 --> 01:07:24,505
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

839
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:27,127
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

840
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:28,925
They're a military nation.

841
01:07:29,302 --> 01:07:31,378
Go back where you came from, German!

842
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:33,095
Go on home, German!

843
01:07:40,604 --> 01:07:41,932
This is just the start.

844
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:44,430
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

845
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:46,268
The German people don't want this war.

846
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,111
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

847
01:07:49,196 --> 01:07:51,272
it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

848
01:07:51,365 --> 01:07:54,698
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

849
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:57,074
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

850
01:07:57,829 --> 01:08:01,328
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,
I don't know...

851
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:04,915
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

852
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:09,248
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

853
01:08:11,259 --> 01:08:12,539
You tired, Dad?

854
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:17,678
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board.

855
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:22,427
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

856
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:27,981
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

857
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,687
not much left after my great fiasco.

858
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,192
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

859
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,359
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

860
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:43,864
Let's don't worry about money.

861
01:08:53,382 --> 01:08:55,173
Hey, Rantani!

862
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:58,212
Ain't this some sight?

863
01:08:58,304 --> 01:08:59,762
Beans!

864
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:02,555
Yeah, boy, some beans.

865
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:05,346
You come here everyday, boy,
what do you think...

866
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:07,512
you gonna make them grow quicker?

867
01:09:16,988 --> 01:09:18,268
He's crazy.

868
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:28,455
Hey, where have you been?

869
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,376
Come on.

870
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:33,418
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

871
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:48,048
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

872
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:52,022
You wanna try one? No?

873
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,097
Pick up my cigar.

874
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:58,565
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

875
01:09:58,654 --> 01:09:59,685
No, I'm not.

876
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,856
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

877
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,699
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call someone.

878
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,741
- Hello, Cal.
- What's the matter?

879
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,203
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

880
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:13,243
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

881
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,208
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- I hope not.

882
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,129
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

883
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,423
Here I am, lady.

884
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,418
That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

885
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,217
- What're you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

886
01:10:27,305 --> 01:10:30,259
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

887
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:33,849
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

888
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:37,020
- What time you gonna meet him?
- At 8:00.

889
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:40,226
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

890
01:10:40,318 --> 01:10:41,349
Yeah, I know.

891
01:10:41,444 --> 01:10:43,603
I'm so glad you happened to be here.

892
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:50,573
8:00?

893
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:53,448
You got a half hour?

894
01:10:58,335 --> 01:11:00,624
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

895
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:01,792
I'm around.

896
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,214
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

897
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,634
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

898
01:11:09,972 --> 01:11:11,881
I feel awfully sorry for him.

899
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,059
You're terrible.

900
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:23,018
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too.

901
01:11:24,235 --> 01:11:26,441
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

902
01:11:27,572 --> 01:11:30,277
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

903
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:33,486
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

904
01:11:33,578 --> 01:11:36,413
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

905
01:11:36,497 --> 01:11:39,167
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

906
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,159
I'll agree with that.

907
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:43,622
He's right.

908
01:11:44,963 --> 01:11:46,754
He's always right.

909
01:11:46,882 --> 01:11:48,921
And he has always been right.

910
01:11:49,009 --> 01:11:50,752
Now let's talk about something else.

911
01:11:50,844 --> 01:11:51,923
All right.

912
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:54,670
8:00.

913
01:11:54,973 --> 01:11:56,551
We got a lot to see.

914
01:11:57,768 --> 01:11:59,844
Will we be back in time for Aron?

915
01:12:03,356 --> 01:12:05,064
All right. I'd love to.

916
01:12:12,823 --> 01:12:13,819
Easy.

917
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:41,972
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

918
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,760
- Who was that?
- Who?

919
01:12:46,856 --> 01:12:48,979
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

920
01:12:49,067 --> 01:12:52,851
She was standing right...
Girls follow you around, don't they?

921
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:56,612
What are girls like that like?

922
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,278
All right, never mind.

923
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,284
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

924
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,864
since the time of Julius Caesar.

925
01:13:02,955 --> 01:13:06,620
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

926
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:07,788
Look.

927
01:13:07,876 --> 01:13:09,287
Would we have time?

928
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,579
...after the Germans had been through...

929
01:13:11,672 --> 01:13:14,127
- the women of the town...
- That German's here again.

930
01:13:14,216 --> 01:13:17,300
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

931
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:21,171
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

932
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:24,886
Here we go.

933
01:13:34,986 --> 01:13:37,274
It is lies, all lies.

934
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:39,901
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

935
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,109
See over there. That's Castroville.

936
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:43,945
Everything looks so small down there.

937
01:13:44,036 --> 01:13:45,828
"Higher and higher and higher and higher"

938
01:13:45,913 --> 01:13:46,992
What?

939
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,405
"Growing and growing
and growing and growing"

940
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:53,367
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

941
01:13:58,216 --> 01:13:59,924
Does Aron really love me?

942
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:04,046
I seem to have sort of lost him.

943
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:07,923
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but...

944
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,556
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...

945
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:13,057
I can't tell anymore.

946
01:14:15,858 --> 01:14:17,815
Cal, can I ask you something?

947
01:14:18,736 --> 01:14:20,016
Yeah, go ahead.

948
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:24,278
These girls that you always
go around with.

949
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:27,735
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

950
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:29,785
What are girls like that like?

951
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:35,826
You don't really love them, do you?

952
01:14:37,754 --> 01:14:40,874
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

953
01:14:42,342 --> 01:14:44,050
You're not angry, are you?

954
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:50,554
- Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
- Do you think I'm bad?

955
01:14:52,936 --> 01:14:54,311
I don't know.

956
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:58,979
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

957
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:01,355
I mean, Aron is so good...

958
01:15:01,944 --> 01:15:03,521
and I'm not.

959
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:05,688
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

960
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:08,153
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...

961
01:15:08,742 --> 01:15:11,150
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

962
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,914
and think about it
and that's all right, but...

963
01:15:15,082 --> 01:15:18,201
These girls that you go out with, do you...

964
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:22,082
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.

965
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:26,339
I know love is good the way Aron says...

966
01:15:28,427 --> 01:15:30,800
but it's more than that, it's got to be.

967
01:15:32,974 --> 01:15:35,132
I shouldn't talk to you this way...

968
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:37,468
but I don't know who else to talk to.

969
01:15:38,062 --> 01:15:40,434
Sometimes I think I'm really bad.

970
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:43,938
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

971
01:15:46,696 --> 01:15:49,400
- Aron'll knock that out of you.
- Will he?

972
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:51,821
He's got to.

973
01:15:52,742 --> 01:15:54,782
The way I figure it out...

974
01:15:55,662 --> 01:15:57,785
Aron never having had a mother...

975
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,994
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

976
01:16:02,669 --> 01:16:04,460
and that's what he thinks I am.

977
01:16:04,546 --> 01:16:07,381
That's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

978
01:16:09,092 --> 01:16:12,128
'Cause I'm not a bit like that made-up one.
Not a bit.

979
01:16:12,512 --> 01:16:15,383
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

980
01:16:18,475 --> 01:16:19,970
Look at that star.

981
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,762
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

982
01:16:24,773 --> 01:16:25,769
Probably.

983
01:16:31,071 --> 01:16:34,156
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

984
01:16:35,868 --> 01:16:37,659
She can just wait.

985
01:16:38,162 --> 01:16:39,656
She was pretty.

986
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,537
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

987
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,763
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

988
01:17:14,071 --> 01:17:15,613
I do.

989
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:22,734
To give these fiends a lesson that...

990
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:24,324
Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?

991
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:25,529
Lies. All lies.

992
01:17:25,624 --> 01:17:27,498
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

993
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:29,209
Gus, come on.

994
01:17:29,836 --> 01:17:31,247
There's Aron.

995
01:17:32,588 --> 01:17:34,248
You're a good shoemaker.

996
01:17:36,342 --> 01:17:38,085
There's Aron, down there.

997
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:40,170
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

998
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:41,460
Mr. Albrecht.

999
01:17:42,348 --> 01:17:45,633
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

1000
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:48,763
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1001
01:17:48,854 --> 01:17:51,559
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again.

1002
01:17:51,649 --> 01:17:52,598
Hey!

1003
01:18:01,157 --> 01:18:03,066
Cal, don't!

1004
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:04,986
Watch yourself, get back!

1005
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:08,535
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1006
01:18:09,624 --> 01:18:11,083
Don't bother me!

1007
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,875
Come on.

1008
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:23,552
- Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink.

1009
01:18:30,018 --> 01:18:31,726
What are you waiting for?

1010
01:18:34,565 --> 01:18:36,937
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1011
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:39,101
Aron, you are a child.

1012
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:46,655
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1013
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:49,532
Gustav.

1014
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,700
Silence.

1015
01:18:50,788 --> 01:18:53,575
You all loved him a few weeks ago,
what's gotten into you?

1016
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:55,659
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1017
01:18:55,751 --> 01:18:58,539
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

1018
01:18:58,629 --> 01:19:02,413
There are rose plants in that border there.
Please be careful where you step.

1019
01:19:02,508 --> 01:19:05,794
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1020
01:19:05,887 --> 01:19:08,425
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1021
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:11,559
- What is it?
- Let him come down and read it.

1022
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:14,512
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

1023
01:19:14,978 --> 01:19:16,437
Here, give it to me.

1024
01:19:21,776 --> 01:19:24,564
"The Government, with deep regret,
informs..."

1025
01:19:30,785 --> 01:19:34,735
"that your son was killed in action,
15th of April."

1026
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:38,242
"He died a hero and an American."

1027
01:19:43,214 --> 01:19:45,539
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...

1028
01:19:45,633 --> 01:19:47,210
You're not sorry enough.

1029
01:19:47,301 --> 01:19:50,635
- I don't think he's sorry.
- He's not sorry at all.

1030
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:53,841
- Listen, why don't we all go on home...
- You're not sorry enough.

1031
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:56,009
Why aren't you in the war?

1032
01:19:56,101 --> 01:19:57,809
This will make you sorry.

1033
01:20:28,048 --> 01:20:29,376
Hello, Charlie.

1034
01:20:30,133 --> 01:20:32,707
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1035
01:20:32,803 --> 01:20:33,799
Get up.

1036
01:20:34,388 --> 01:20:37,057
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.

1037
01:20:37,558 --> 01:20:38,933
Evening, Rose.

1038
01:20:40,227 --> 01:20:43,643
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1039
01:20:44,064 --> 01:20:45,938
Somebody owes you an apology.

1040
01:20:53,573 --> 01:20:56,776
How about you folks all going home now?

1041
01:20:57,034 --> 01:20:58,908
I think this'll do for tonight.

1042
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:06,290
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

1043
01:21:07,003 --> 01:21:08,378
- May I?
- Come in.

1044
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:16,427
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1045
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:19,631
- I'm gonna see to it.
- Ja. He will see to it.

1046
01:21:27,981 --> 01:21:29,309
Where were you?

1047
01:21:32,152 --> 01:21:33,979
Where did you get his coat?

1048
01:21:45,623 --> 01:21:46,868
You all right?

1049
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,201
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1050
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:54,373
You had to start slugging.

1051
01:21:54,965 --> 01:21:58,002
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

1052
01:21:59,053 --> 01:22:02,469
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1053
01:22:02,556 --> 01:22:06,684
- And don't lie to me about trying to...
- Aron, I tried to help you!

1054
01:22:11,606 --> 01:22:15,189
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

1055
01:22:16,569 --> 01:22:20,733
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

1056
01:22:20,823 --> 01:22:22,068
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

1057
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:24,649
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

1058
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:35,242
Wait here.

1059
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:16,452
I was trying to help him.

1060
01:23:19,588 --> 01:23:21,664
Who am I kidding?

1061
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:24,090
I tried to kill him.

1062
01:23:26,594 --> 01:23:28,172
Mike, give me a drink.

1063
01:23:31,099 --> 01:23:32,759
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

1064
01:23:32,851 --> 01:23:35,887
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

1065
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:40,476
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1066
01:23:42,193 --> 01:23:45,443
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1067
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,105
It didn't mean anything, really.

1068
01:23:48,282 --> 01:23:50,773
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

1069
01:23:52,077 --> 01:23:54,284
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.

1070
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:01,709
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1071
01:24:02,796 --> 01:24:03,792
What?

1072
01:24:05,632 --> 01:24:07,376
Someday he's gonna know.

1073
01:24:10,804 --> 01:24:13,046
I don't understand you. You scare me.

1074
01:24:16,476 --> 01:24:19,430
- I know. I scare myself.
- Abra.

1075
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:41,158
Fix me another drink.

1076
01:24:47,464 --> 01:24:51,711
- I want that money. Now you give it to me.
- You know I haven't any money here.

1077
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,676
Okay.

1078
01:24:57,474 --> 01:25:00,309
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

1079
01:25:01,519 --> 01:25:04,057
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1080
01:25:06,065 --> 01:25:08,734
Come on. You've gotta go home.

1081
01:25:08,818 --> 01:25:11,024
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1082
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,903
you come back, we'll go to the bank...

1083
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:15,740
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1084
01:25:15,825 --> 01:25:19,324
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1085
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:24,790
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1086
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:52,354
Abra.

1087
01:25:55,904 --> 01:25:57,233
What?

1088
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:00,027
- Who is it?
- Cal.

1089
01:26:02,369 --> 01:26:03,484
- Cal?
- Yeah.

1090
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:08,116
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I want to see you.

1091
01:26:09,126 --> 01:26:11,332
Wait till I put something on.

1092
01:26:29,729 --> 01:26:32,813
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1093
01:26:33,357 --> 01:26:35,516
Yes. What is it?

1094
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:39,530
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1095
01:26:42,866 --> 01:26:45,108
- I got it.
- What?

1096
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:51,531
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1097
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:53,368
On that lettuce business?

1098
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:59,836
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

1099
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:02,712
- I've earned every cent.
- That's wonderful, Cal.

1100
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:10,346
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1101
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:14,302
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1102
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,855
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1103
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,144
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1104
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:30,110
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1105
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:32,656
to be there.

1106
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,499
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1107
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,797
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1108
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:44,716
- and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

1109
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:48,460
And we'll get balloons...

1110
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:55,346
- and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

1111
01:27:57,938 --> 01:28:00,310
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

1112
01:28:17,124 --> 01:28:19,828
I'm sort of...

1113
01:28:27,466 --> 01:28:28,925
Why did I hit Aron?

1114
01:28:31,595 --> 01:28:33,884
Why did I hit him so hard?

1115
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:47,897
Will you help me?

1116
01:28:47,986 --> 01:28:50,311
Will you really help me?

1117
01:28:52,574 --> 01:28:54,068
I'll help you, Cal.

1118
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,195
Be careful.

1119
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:06,247
How'd I get up here?

1120
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,844
- Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

1121
01:29:20,934 --> 01:29:23,971
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- I think it looks beautiful.

1122
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,306
Don't you? I love the way it looks.

1123
01:29:26,398 --> 01:29:28,640
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1124
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:30,394
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1125
01:29:30,486 --> 01:29:32,893
- Do you think this is childish?
- Not a bit.

1126
01:29:32,988 --> 01:29:36,024
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it.

1127
01:29:37,075 --> 01:29:39,316
- How's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

1128
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:41,569
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

1129
01:29:41,662 --> 01:29:44,996
- Aron didn't get him anything?
- He told me he had something.

1130
01:29:53,716 --> 01:29:56,468
- What?
- He didn't tell me what it was.

1131
01:30:04,434 --> 01:30:07,104
- It won't stack up against mine, will it?
- No.

1132
01:30:07,687 --> 01:30:09,395
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

1133
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,105
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

1134
01:30:11,191 --> 01:30:12,222
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

1135
01:30:12,317 --> 01:30:13,396
Okay.

1136
01:30:15,612 --> 01:30:17,023
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

1137
01:30:17,114 --> 01:30:18,691
You think it's pretty?

1138
01:30:20,408 --> 01:30:22,152
Don't drink any more wine.

1139
01:30:25,747 --> 01:30:28,748
- Did Aron tell you what the present was?
- No.

1140
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,871
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

1141
01:30:33,587 --> 01:30:36,078
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

1142
01:30:37,258 --> 01:30:40,709
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

1143
01:30:42,429 --> 01:30:43,840
The brooms.

1144
01:30:44,265 --> 01:30:46,838
- Don't you do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

1145
01:30:46,934 --> 01:30:49,639
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself.

1146
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:53,773
- We'll act like it was any other old day.
- Yes. Wait, Cal.

1147
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:57,562
Cal.

1148
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:04,067
You look wonderful.

1149
01:31:05,743 --> 01:31:06,739
Thanks.

1150
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,546
But I need my son.

1151
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:21,797
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1152
01:31:21,884 --> 01:31:23,212
I need him to work the farm.

1153
01:31:23,302 --> 01:31:25,709
Things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1154
01:31:25,804 --> 01:31:28,295
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1155
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:31,889
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1156
01:31:31,977 --> 01:31:33,222
Everything cost so much now.

1157
01:31:33,312 --> 01:31:35,981
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1158
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:38,057
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1159
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:40,605
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1160
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:43,730
- Come on, Poppa.
- I don't like it.

1161
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:47,192
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1162
01:31:51,704 --> 01:31:53,744
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1163
01:31:53,831 --> 01:31:57,081
- Gonna stay to dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1164
01:31:57,168 --> 01:32:01,082
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board.

1165
01:32:01,797 --> 01:32:04,715
- Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
- Yes, I saw it.

1166
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,126
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1167
01:32:07,219 --> 01:32:10,718
- We could use it.
- Let's go in.

1168
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:33,906
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1169
01:32:33,994 --> 01:32:36,532
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1170
01:32:36,622 --> 01:32:39,955
- Are you surprised?
- I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1171
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:43,826
- We knew you had, didn't we?
- Completely. I don't know what to say.

1172
01:32:47,758 --> 01:32:49,383
We got turkey.

1173
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:53,051
- And champagne.
- Champagne, and we got all the things.

1174
01:32:55,932 --> 01:32:58,601
- We got the trimmings here.
- Isn't that pretty?

1175
01:33:03,648 --> 01:33:06,815
Got something for you.

1176
01:33:06,901 --> 01:33:09,902
Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.

1177
01:33:14,867 --> 01:33:17,240
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Yes.

1178
01:33:17,328 --> 01:33:21,706
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1179
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:26,950
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

1180
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:33,341
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

1181
01:33:34,845 --> 01:33:37,799
A lovely birthday present.

1182
01:33:38,974 --> 01:33:41,346
- You have my blessings.
- Thank you, Dad.

1183
01:33:42,686 --> 01:33:45,391
- But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
- No.

1184
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,685
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1185
01:33:51,861 --> 01:33:52,940
Excuse me.

1186
01:33:54,447 --> 01:33:58,694
'Course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1187
01:34:02,997 --> 01:34:04,159
What's this?

1188
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,709
What is this?

1189
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:15,208
I made it. And it's for you.
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

1190
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,589
You made it? But how?

1191
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:20,919
Go on.

1192
01:34:22,474 --> 01:34:23,802
- Beans.
- Beans?

1193
01:34:25,477 --> 01:34:28,727
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1194
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:34,225
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1195
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:38,904
So, that's for you.

1196
01:34:40,157 --> 01:34:43,074
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1197
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:45,650
It's for you.

1198
01:34:47,664 --> 01:34:50,535
- I made it for you.
- You will have to give it back.

1199
01:34:53,045 --> 01:34:57,921
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1200
01:34:58,634 --> 01:35:01,919
- You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it...

1201
01:35:02,011 --> 01:35:05,712
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1202
01:35:05,807 --> 01:35:08,594
- I can't give it back.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1203
01:35:08,684 --> 01:35:10,262
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1204
01:35:10,353 --> 01:35:14,185
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1205
01:35:15,108 --> 01:35:18,607
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1206
01:35:19,153 --> 01:35:21,395
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1207
01:35:21,489 --> 01:35:23,398
Not one will come back untorn.

1208
01:35:24,033 --> 01:35:26,904
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1209
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:32,284
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1210
01:35:32,874 --> 01:35:35,709
- I thank you for the thought, but...
- I'll keep it for you.

1211
01:35:35,794 --> 01:35:38,664
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here...

1212
01:35:38,755 --> 01:35:40,166
I'll never take it!

1213
01:35:40,257 --> 01:35:43,590
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1214
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:46,761
something like your brother's given me.

1215
01:35:46,847 --> 01:35:50,796
Something honest and human and good.
Don't be angry, Son.

1216
01:35:51,642 --> 01:35:54,643
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1217
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:56,763
That's something I could value.

1218
01:36:25,633 --> 01:36:27,044
I hate you!

1219
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,854
What are you doing?

1220
01:36:53,243 --> 01:36:55,485
He doesn't want anything from me.

1221
01:36:55,913 --> 01:36:57,193
Cal, don't.

1222
01:36:59,917 --> 01:37:01,115
Please, don't.

1223
01:37:10,301 --> 01:37:11,297
Abra!

1224
01:37:33,031 --> 01:37:35,024
Don't you ever touch her again.

1225
01:37:37,786 --> 01:37:39,161
I don't trust you.

1226
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,320
You're no good.

1227
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:48,372
You're mean and vicious and wild.
And you always have been.

1228
01:37:48,755 --> 01:37:50,582
You know it, too, don't you?

1229
01:37:50,966 --> 01:37:53,457
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1230
01:37:53,552 --> 01:37:57,715
you could think of since you were a child.
And we've always forgiven you.

1231
01:37:58,305 --> 01:38:00,677
But now I don't want you to go near Abra.

1232
01:38:00,766 --> 01:38:04,016
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1233
01:38:31,796 --> 01:38:34,631
- You want to go some place with me?
- Why should I?

1234
01:38:37,969 --> 01:38:39,796
I got something to show you.

1235
01:38:41,347 --> 01:38:45,131
- Think you'll find it very interesting.
- What are you talking about?

1236
01:38:46,268 --> 01:38:49,601
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1237
01:38:50,314 --> 01:38:53,268
- What do you mean by that?
- Maybe she didn't.

1238
01:38:53,358 --> 01:38:55,232
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1239
01:38:57,362 --> 01:38:59,022
What are you up to now?

1240
01:38:59,114 --> 01:39:02,697
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1241
01:39:03,327 --> 01:39:08,035
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1242
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:11,580
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1243
01:39:12,293 --> 01:39:14,250
You cried and you said...

1244
01:39:14,378 --> 01:39:17,498
that she would have cried, too,
'cause she was so tenderhearted.

1245
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:20,425
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1246
01:39:21,427 --> 01:39:24,926
I just want to show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1247
01:39:25,014 --> 01:39:26,342
What's the matter, you afraid?

1248
01:39:26,432 --> 01:39:28,888
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1249
01:39:28,976 --> 01:39:33,104
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1250
01:39:35,523 --> 01:39:40,020
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1251
01:39:41,571 --> 01:39:42,567
Come on.

1252
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:47,360
I want to show you something.
It won't take very long.

1253
01:40:22,528 --> 01:40:23,726
Oh, Cal.

1254
01:40:25,947 --> 01:40:26,943
Hello.

1255
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:55,973
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1256
01:40:58,145 --> 01:41:00,470
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1257
01:41:09,406 --> 01:41:11,315
Say hello to your mother.

1258
01:41:26,046 --> 01:41:28,039
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1259
01:41:29,175 --> 01:41:31,547
Joe!

1260
01:41:43,563 --> 01:41:45,556
- Play another song!
- Quiet!

1261
01:41:48,151 --> 01:41:49,182
Five!

1262
01:41:49,694 --> 01:41:53,526
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes"

1263
01:41:54,657 --> 01:41:57,908
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow"

1264
01:41:58,495 --> 01:42:02,492
"Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1265
01:42:08,337 --> 01:42:11,753
- Where is Aron?
- I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

1266
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,500
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

1267
01:42:13,592 --> 01:42:15,798
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

1268
01:42:16,136 --> 01:42:18,971
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

1269
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:21,215
I like it. I think it's great.

1270
01:42:21,975 --> 01:42:24,098
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1271
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:27,721
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1272
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:31,943
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

1273
01:42:32,026 --> 01:42:34,861
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1274
01:42:35,404 --> 01:42:38,240
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1275
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:41,488
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

1276
01:42:41,577 --> 01:42:44,329
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1277
01:42:44,413 --> 01:42:46,240
from what you thought was right.

1278
01:42:46,332 --> 01:42:50,246
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1279
01:42:51,087 --> 01:42:53,163
I know why you didn't love me.

1280
01:42:53,256 --> 01:42:54,714
Because I'm like my mother...

1281
01:42:54,799 --> 01:42:57,753
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1282
01:42:59,928 --> 01:43:03,926
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1283
01:43:04,015 --> 01:43:08,594
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

1284
01:43:09,479 --> 01:43:11,970
She's over there in Monterey,
if you want to know.

1285
01:43:12,065 --> 01:43:13,892
She owns one of them houses.

1286
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,065
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1287
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:23,324
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1288
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:30,202
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1289
01:43:32,334 --> 01:43:34,374
But now I don't want it anymore.

1290
01:43:37,047 --> 01:43:40,796
- I can't use it anymore.
- Don't talk to your father like that.

1291
01:43:44,597 --> 01:43:46,885
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1292
01:43:48,808 --> 01:43:50,302
It doesn't pay off.

1293
01:43:50,852 --> 01:43:52,679
No future in it.

1294
01:43:55,189 --> 01:43:56,933
Let him go if he wants to.

1295
01:44:01,988 --> 01:44:03,815
No, I won't.

1296
01:44:16,668 --> 01:44:18,495
You hate me, too, don't you?

1297
01:44:20,005 --> 01:44:21,416
I'm afraid of you.

1298
01:44:26,511 --> 01:44:30,130
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1299
01:44:32,726 --> 01:44:35,299
I feel like I'm to blame, too.

1300
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:41,812
- Adam!
- Here. What is it?

1301
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,902
...drunk and had a couple of fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1302
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:47,905
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.

1303
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,069
Cal!

1304
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:58,536
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

1305
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:01,793
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1306
01:45:01,878 --> 01:45:04,084
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1307
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:06,165
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

1308
01:45:06,257 --> 01:45:08,749
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1309
01:45:08,843 --> 01:45:12,426
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1310
01:45:12,514 --> 01:45:14,921
I think you better get down there.

1311
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:17,933
- Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

1312
01:46:17,075 --> 01:46:19,364
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1313
01:46:23,707 --> 01:46:26,874
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1314
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,119
There have been earlier, smaller leakages.

1315
01:46:29,212 --> 01:46:32,213
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1316
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:35,546
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1317
01:46:36,762 --> 01:46:39,928
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

1318
01:46:40,723 --> 01:46:42,300
He might die tonight.

1319
01:46:49,273 --> 01:46:52,642
- Will he know me?
- You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1320
01:46:57,323 --> 01:46:58,782
Good day.

1321
01:47:00,868 --> 01:47:04,319
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.

1322
01:47:06,331 --> 01:47:09,248
"Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him."

1323
01:47:09,793 --> 01:47:13,921
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."

1324
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:18,628
Now why don't you go away some place?

1325
01:47:33,023 --> 01:47:36,024
- He's right.
- No.

1326
01:47:37,986 --> 01:47:40,524
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.

1327
01:47:50,582 --> 01:47:52,824
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1328
01:47:54,711 --> 01:47:55,826
Thank you.

1329
01:47:58,172 --> 01:48:00,129
- There you are.
- How is he?

1330
01:48:00,216 --> 01:48:03,170
He's fine. He's my darling.

1331
01:48:03,261 --> 01:48:05,134
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1332
01:48:05,221 --> 01:48:06,799
Can I go in there now?

1333
01:48:07,265 --> 01:48:10,764
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1334
01:48:12,728 --> 01:48:16,512
- How is he, really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1335
01:48:17,275 --> 01:48:19,433
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

1336
01:48:19,527 --> 01:48:20,902
I didn't think so.

1337
01:48:20,986 --> 01:48:24,236
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1338
01:48:24,322 --> 01:48:28,534
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1339
01:48:43,258 --> 01:48:47,303
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient.

1340
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:50,675
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1341
01:48:51,515 --> 01:48:53,804
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

1342
01:48:53,893 --> 01:48:56,977
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1343
01:48:57,688 --> 01:48:59,597
I'll report you to the doctor.

1344
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:02,562
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1345
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:39,055
Father.

1346
01:49:42,481 --> 01:49:43,809
Can you hear me?

1347
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:51,279
I did an awful thing.

1348
01:49:55,452 --> 01:49:56,531
I'm sorry.

1349
01:50:31,236 --> 01:50:33,312
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1350
01:50:34,406 --> 01:50:37,157
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1351
01:50:37,742 --> 01:50:39,153
Can you answer?

1352
01:50:41,413 --> 01:50:43,701
I think you can understand me, though.

1353
01:50:44,582 --> 01:50:48,283
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1354
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:52,505
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1355
01:51:00,139 --> 01:51:03,971
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1356
01:51:04,393 --> 01:51:08,640
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1357
01:51:10,858 --> 01:51:13,396
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1358
01:51:13,736 --> 01:51:17,436
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1359
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:20,401
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1360
01:51:21,743 --> 01:51:24,862
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

1361
01:51:26,664 --> 01:51:31,410
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1362
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:34,793
You never asked him for one thing.

1363
01:51:35,923 --> 01:51:39,672
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes...

1364
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:45,968
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1365
01:51:46,433 --> 01:51:49,304
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1366
01:51:49,644 --> 01:51:51,554
or else he'll never be a man.

1367
01:51:52,272 --> 01:51:56,519
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him.

1368
01:51:58,153 --> 01:51:59,528
Please, help him.

1369
01:52:00,072 --> 01:52:03,772
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1370
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:06,488
and you're the only one who can do it.

1371
01:52:06,577 --> 01:52:08,451
So try, please try.

1372
01:52:10,414 --> 01:52:13,617
If you could ask him for something.

1373
01:52:14,418 --> 01:52:17,336
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1374
01:52:18,255 --> 01:52:19,915
Let him do for you.

1375
01:52:23,386 --> 01:52:28,297
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1376
01:52:34,062 --> 01:52:35,177
You've tired my patient...

1377
01:52:35,271 --> 01:52:38,854
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1378
01:52:41,152 --> 01:52:45,067
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1379
01:52:45,365 --> 01:52:48,117
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1380
01:52:48,201 --> 01:52:49,743
- No.
- Then stop it.

1381
01:52:50,537 --> 01:52:53,656
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1382
01:52:53,748 --> 01:52:56,619
- I can't.
- Please try.

1383
01:52:57,334 --> 01:52:58,663
Get it straight.

1384
01:52:59,711 --> 01:53:03,840
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1385
01:53:10,514 --> 01:53:14,428
- Is there any coffee around here?
- I'll get you some in a minute.

1386
01:53:20,231 --> 01:53:21,262
Try.

1387
01:53:22,608 --> 01:53:24,897
Is there anything to read around here?

1388
01:53:26,404 --> 01:53:27,898
What would you like?

1389
01:53:27,989 --> 01:53:31,986
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1390
01:53:47,132 --> 01:53:50,880
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1391
01:53:50,969 --> 01:53:54,718
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1392
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:58,559
A man has a choice.

1393
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:01,895
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1394
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:03,558
You see, I remember.

1395
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:07,349
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man.

1396
01:54:09,695 --> 01:54:11,320
You see, I do remember.

1397
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:15,481
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Get out!

1398
01:54:26,337 --> 01:54:27,332
Look.

1399
01:54:35,678 --> 01:54:38,928
Do something...

1400
01:54:41,142 --> 01:54:42,340
for me.

1401
01:54:42,435 --> 01:54:43,716
Yes.

1402
01:54:47,857 --> 01:54:50,894
That woman...

1403
01:54:51,528 --> 01:54:55,857
the nurse, can't stand her.

1404
01:54:58,076 --> 01:54:59,736
Get me another.

1405
01:55:15,592 --> 01:55:17,632
I can't stand her, either.

1406
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,395
What did he say?

1407
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:21,526
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1408
01:56:23,073 --> 01:56:25,611
He said, "You stay with me..."

1409
01:56:26,994 --> 01:56:28,737
"and you take care of me."
