136
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,375
<font color="#ffff00">It must have been frightening for you.</font>

137
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,046
<font color="#ffff00">We should explain something. It sounds
like we are insulting each other,</font>

138
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,758
<font color="#ffff00">but we're actually not. This is the way
we pay compliments in Hollywood.</font>

139
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,384
<font color="#ffff00">That's correct. It's true.</font>

140
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,888
<font color="#ffff00">Hollywood compliments are a lot like
regular compliments.</font>

141
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,016
<font color="#ffff00">But they have a slight passive aggressive
dig at the end.</font>

142
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,476
<font color="#ffff00">-I'll give you an example.
-Yeah.</font>

143
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,728
<font color="#ffff00">Steve, you know,
it's truly an honor for me</font>

144
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,314
<font color="#ffff00">to be performing with
the world's biggest star...</font>

145
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,525
<font color="#ffff00">from 1978.</font>

146
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,903
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, Marty, that is so sweet!</font>

147
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,281
<font color="#ffff00">And I often hear people refer to you
as a whole entertainer.</font>

148
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,409
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I added the word "entertainer."</font>

149
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,834
<font color="#ffff00">And may I say that you look fantastic?</font>

150
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,463
<font color="#ffff00">And I guess that's the charm
of looking 70 since you were 30.</font>

151
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,259
<font color="#ffff00">Burn!</font>

152
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,513
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Marty, you know I think of you
as a Renaissance Man,</font>

153
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,223
<font color="#ffff00">and not just because
you carry smallpox.</font>

154
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,683
<font color="#ffff00">You know, I...</font>

155
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,352
<font color="#ffff00">I don't often use the word "genius."</font>

156
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,728
<font color="#ffff00">-And?
-Nothing.</font>

157
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,149
<font color="#ffff00">You know, the other day,
Steve butt-dialed me,</font>

158
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,609
<font color="#ffff00">which was so impressive,</font>

159
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,778
<font color="#ffff00">considering he still uses a rotary phone.</font>

160
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,536
<font color="#ffff00">When did you add that?</font>

161
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,288
<font color="#ffff00">-Tonight.
-OK!</font>

162
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,417
<font color="#ffff00">And by the way, I loved you on
Fallon  the other night. Oh, my God!</font>

163
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,836
<font color="#ffff00">-Your comedy was so effortless.
-Thank you.</font>

164
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,256
<font color="#ffff00">And I kept thinking, I wonder how it'd be
if you'd put a little effort into it.</font>

165
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,926
<font color="#ffff00">-Did you see me on  Ellen?
-No, I missed that.</font>

166
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,637
<font color="#ffff00">Of course. What am I thinking?
That's on at 3 p.m.</font>

167
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,180
<font color="#ffff00">And that's when you're having dinner.</font>

168
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,519
<font color="#ffff00">By the way,
Martin Short is also the name I use</font>

169
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,147
<font color="#ffff00">when I check into a hotel
and want to be anonymous.</font>

170
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,320
<font color="#ffff00">Thirty-five years later
and you're still the jerk.</font>

171
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,617
<font color="#ffff00">And that's how we do it in Hollywood.</font>

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,041
<font color="#ffff00">Steve and I feel that you, the audience,
might like to get to know us better.</font>

173
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,459
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. And the reason we think that</font>

174
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,586
<font color="#ffff00">-is because we're egomaniacs.
-Correct.</font>

175
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,214
<font color="#ffff00">So we'd like to share with you
some of the hidden gems</font>

176
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,800
<font color="#ffff00">-from our family photo collections.
-Yes.</font>

177
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,719
<font color="#ffff00">These are rarely, if ever, seen
private photos.</font>

178
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,596
<font color="#ffff00">-Absolutely.
-Let's look at the first one.</font>

179
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,098
<font color="#ffff00">This is Marty when he was just
two years old. Adorable.</font>

180
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,308
<font color="#ffff00">That's cute, isn't it?</font>

181
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,143
<font color="#ffff00">My dark period. Look at that.</font>

182
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,899
<font color="#ffff00">And here's a shot of me on Christmas
morning when I was six years old.</font>

183
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,360
<font color="#ffff00">Let me ask you something, Steve.</font>

184
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,779
<font color="#ffff00">When the guy sold you
that Christmas tree...</font>

185
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,699
<font color="#ffff00">how hard was he laughing?</font>

186
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,164
<font color="#ffff00">This was taken when I was just
a young boy in Texas.</font>

187
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,625
<font color="#ffff00">And it's a photo of my first marriage.</font>

188
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,300
<font color="#ffff00">-Next!
-Let's go to the next one.</font>

189
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
<font color="#ffff00">-[Martin] Ooh!
-[Steve] Aww...</font>

190
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,600
<font color="#ffff00">Here's a photo of me
when I was 13 years of age</font>

191
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,435
<font color="#ffff00">on the beach with my parents.</font>

193
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,939
<font color="#ffff00">Because at first I thought it was
Winnie the Pooh.</font>

194
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,819
<font color="#ffff00">You know what's amazing about this photo?</font>

195
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,029
<font color="#ffff00">How well my parents
are hiding their disappointment.</font>

196
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,702
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, and then now that's me at 15.</font>

197
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,664
<font color="#ffff00">My first trip to New York City.
That's my mom and two brothers.</font>

198
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,583
<font color="#ffff00">We went from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
to New York City.</font>

199

200
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,837
<font color="#ffff00">And we were at
the Latin Quarter nightclub.</font>

201
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,130
<font color="#ffff00">Now that, that's impressive.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Your family drove you down
from Canada to New York City</font>

203
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,677

That's pretty sophisticated.</font>

204
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,679
<font color="#ffff00">-Do you remember the name of the show?
-Sure.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">It was the late Bea Arthur's
one-woman show entitled</font>

209
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,410
<font color="#ffff00">Now, let's see the next one.</font>

210
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,662
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yes. This was me</font>

211
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,207
<font color="#ffff00">right before I was sent away to camp
to pray the gay away.</font>

Apple in my garage.</font>

00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,174
<font color="#ffff00">Next stop, just OK.</font>

265
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,552
<font color="#ffff00">And it was on that movie
that I first realized</font>

266
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,138
<font color="#ffff00">that Marty had this kind of
quirky sense of humor.</font>

267
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,141
<font color="#ffff00">We'd only been on the movie a couple of
weeks, so I knew him for two weeks.</font>

268
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,311
<font color="#ffff00">And there's a lot of down time
on the movie, so Chevy, Marty, and I</font>

269
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,564
<font color="#ffff00">would pass time by playing Scrabble
in one of our trailers.</font>

270
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,108
<font color="#ffff00">And so we're playing Scrabble.</font>

271
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:28,362
<font color="#ffff00">I look over at Marty, whom I don't really
know, and he's writing a note.</font>

272
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,365
<font color="#ffff00">He folds it over and slides it to me,
and it said,</font>

273
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,828
<font color="#ffff00">"I will let you ball my wife Nancy
for an E or a Q."</font>

275
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,883
<font color="#ffff00">The Three Amigos  was so amazing for me,
you know, because it was my first movie.</font>

276
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,593
<font color="#ffff00">And for a first movie,</font>

277
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,556
<font color="#ffff00">I'm suddenly put on equal billing
to two massive movie stars.</font>

278
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,683
<font color="#ffff00">Or... so they told me.</font>

279
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,600
<font color="#ffff00">And...</font>

280
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,271
<font color="#ffff00">I remember the opening night of
The Three Amigos  was like out of a movie.</font>

281
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,900
<font color="#ffff00">It was insane. It was like, you know,
2,000 people lining Hollywood Boulevard</font>

<font color="#ffff00">in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.</font>

283
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,613
<font color="#ffff00">And the studio had asked
the three of us to show up</font>

it's a different kind of life.</font>

393
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,940
<font color="#ffff00">And, you know, things happen
that wouldn't happen ordinarily</font>

394
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,192
<font color="#ffff00">and you kind of remember them.</font>

395
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,820
<font color="#ffff00">Then eventually you just remember
the two or three kind of odd things</font>

396
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,990
<font color="#ffff00">that happen, like... Actually, this just
happened a couple of months ago.</font>

397
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,660
<font color="#ffff00">I was in Santa Barbara, walking down
the street, and a young girl about 16</font>

398
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,331
<font color="#ffff00">came up to me and said,
"Did you do that movie  The Jerk?"</font>

399
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,291
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "Yes, I did."</font>

400
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,960
<font color="#ffff00">And she said,
"You gonna do another movie?"</font>

401
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,263
<font color="#ffff00">It's also perfect circumstance
for left-handed compliments.</font>

402
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,432
<font color="#ffff00">They think they're complimenting you
but they're not.</font>

403
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,978
<font color="#ffff00">We always screen a comedy movie
to test it to see if it gets laughs.</font>

404
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,730
<font color="#ffff00">So we did that in the '80s sometime.</font>

405
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,817
<font color="#ffff00">We had a test screening,
and after the movie,</font>

406
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,277
<font color="#ffff00">a woman spotted me
and came over and said,</font>

407
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,906
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, I love this movie!
And my husband loved it</font>

408
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,408
<font color="#ffff00">and he  hates  you."</font>

409
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,249
<font color="#ffff00">Even my own mother could do it.</font>

410
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,962
<font color="#ffff00">I had a movie open one weekend and
on Monday, she called me up and she said,</font>

411
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:46,216
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh. Some friends of mine
went to the movies last weekend,</font>

412
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,386
<font color="#ffff00">and they couldn't get in anywhere,
 so they went to see yours."</font>

413
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,223
<font color="#ffff00">That's a...</font>

414
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,475
<font color="#ffff00">That's a Hollywood compliment!</font>

415
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,061
<font color="#ffff00">My mother died when she was 91.</font>

416
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,356
<font color="#ffff00">And toward the end,
she was a little bit senile,</font>

417
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,278
<font color="#ffff00">which is, you know, quite poignant,
but also could be sometimes quite funny.</font>

418
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,448
<font color="#ffff00">Once I was talking to her and she said...</font>

419
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,576
<font color="#ffff00">"Where's Glenn?" That was my father.</font>

420
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,121
<font color="#ffff00">And I said,
"Well, he died three years ago."</font>

421
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,622
<font color="#ffff00">And she said...</font>

422
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,251
<font color="#ffff00">"Well, that explains a lot."</font>

423
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,135
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, that's great!</font>

424
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,929
<font color="#ffff00">I love your story
about meeting Frank Sinatra.</font>

425
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,517
<font color="#ffff00">I also met some pretty good people too.
I met Cary Grant.</font>

426
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,644
<font color="#ffff00">-Wow!
-I met Fred Astaire. I met Elvis.</font>

427
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,813
<font color="#ffff00">That was the biggest get of all.</font>

428
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,148
<font color="#ffff00">It was about 1970.</font>

429
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,611
<font color="#ffff00">I was just a young comedian and I was
opening for Ann-Margret in Las Vegas.</font>

430
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:51,281
<font color="#ffff00">And I knew Elvis was coming to see
the show, because they were friends.</font>

431
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,783
<font color="#ffff00">And so I did my act, and now
I'm waiting after the show.</font>

432
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,912
<font color="#ffff00">I leave my dressing room door open
'cause I know Elvis is coming back.</font>

433
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,332
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just kind of standing there waiting
and he walks by me and looks and goes...</font>

434
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,709
<font color="#ffff00">[imitates Elvis] "Sir...</font>

435
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,753
<font color="#ffff00">You have an oblique sense of humor."</font>

436
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,634
<font color="#ffff00">And then he came in
and we started talking.</font>

437
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,305
<font color="#ffff00">And I was very flattered, because
Elvis has a guy whose sole job it is</font>

438
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,516
<font color="#ffff00">to get him out of conversations.</font>

439
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,559
<font color="#ffff00">So the guy came up and said,</font>

440
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,355
<font color="#ffff00">"Elvis, we have to go."
And Elvis said, "It's OK."</font>

441
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,444
<font color="#ffff00">And so we talked a little bit more.
And Elvis was a big gun collector.</font>

442
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,073
<font color="#ffff00">He liked exotic guns,
engraved things and pearl handles,</font>

443
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,492
<font color="#ffff00">and finally, when we ran out
of conversation, he said,</font>

444
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,202
<font color="#ffff00">"Wanna see my guns?"</font>

445
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,412
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "Sure."</font>

446
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,998
<font color="#ffff00">And so he had three guns on him.</font>

447
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,376
<font color="#ffff00">He did.</font>

448
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,712
<font color="#ffff00">First one was a little engraved derringer.
He's very safety-conscious.</font>

449
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,006
<font color="#ffff00">He took the bullets out
before he handed it to me.</font>

450
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,592
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm admiring them and eventually</font>

451
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,222
<font color="#ffff00">I'm holding three guns
and Elvis is holding eighteen bullets.</font>

452
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,268
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm thinking...</font>

453
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,812
<font color="#ffff00">Where is Elvis's guy?</font>

454
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,655
<font color="#ffff00">And I realize that
I now have to get my guy</font>

455
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,783
<font color="#ffff00">to get me out of conversations
with Elvis.</font>

456
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,119
<font color="#ffff00">Not something you'd ever think about!</font>

457
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,039
<font color="#ffff00">-It's absolutely true, by the way.
-That's hilarious!</font>

458
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,959
<font color="#ffff00">Now I have a question for you.</font>

459
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,545
<font color="#ffff00">You do something I don't.
You do characters, impressions.</font>

460
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,965
<font color="#ffff00">When you do an impression of someone,
do they ever get mad at you?</font>

461
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,800
<font color="#ffff00">Well...</font>

462
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,388
<font color="#ffff00">When you do a new character,
hopefully they don't find out, you know.</font>

463
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,267
<font color="#ffff00">But when you do a new character,
you kind of... You do have to base it</font>

464
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,812
<font color="#ffff00">or I do, on someone you've met
in your life, even in your childhood.</font>

465
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,732
<font color="#ffff00">It kind of gives the character
three dimensions.</font>

466
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:53,945
<font color="#ffff00">And in the year 1984, '85, I was
a cast member of  Saturday Night Live.</font>

467
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,285
<font color="#ffff00">And...</font>

468
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:05,457
<font color="#ffff00">the head of makeup that year
was a woman named Marion Siebert.</font>

469
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:11,504
<font color="#ffff00">And Marion was the most defensive
human being you'd ever met in your life.</font>

470
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,673
<font color="#ffff00">You'd sit in her makeup chair.</font>

471
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,342
<font color="#ffff00">And she always chain-smoked.</font>

472
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,802
<font color="#ffff00">You could do that inside in 1984 then.</font>

473
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,263
<font color="#ffff00">And she'd be dabbing your makeup
and smoking.</font>

474
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,350
<font color="#ffff00">And you'd say, "Gee, Marion,
I look a little pale, don't I?"</font>

475
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,395
<font color="#ffff00">And she'd say, "I know that!
I'm a makeup artist. I would know that."</font>

476
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,315
<font color="#ffff00">"Sorry!" You know?</font>

477
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,192
<font color="#ffff00">So about a month later,</font>

478
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,570
<font color="#ffff00">Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest,
Harry Shearer and I</font>

479
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,907
<font color="#ffff00">are writing a satiric piece
on  60 Minutes.</font>

480
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:43,411
<font color="#ffff00">I was going to play the defensive
lawyer who always represents the bad guy.</font>

481
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,207
<font color="#ffff00">And we called him Nathan Thurm.</font>

482
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,168
<font color="#ffff00">But I didn't know how to play it.
I didn't know I should do it.</font>

483
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,172
<font color="#ffff00">And Billy Crystal said,
"Why don't you do it as Marion Siebert?</font>

484
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,761
<font color="#ffff00">You impersonate her behind her back
all the time anyway."</font>

485
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "No, but she'll find out."</font>

486
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,268
<font color="#ffff00">"She won't know," he said.</font>

487
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,062
<font color="#ffff00">"They never know," he said.</font>

488
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,023
<font color="#ffff00">So I said, "OK, good idea. I'll do it."</font>

489
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,776
<font color="#ffff00">So I even got a cigarette,
same brand as Marion's,</font>

490
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,529
<font color="#ffff00">but I put a wire in it,
so that as it burned down,</font>

491
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,781
<font color="#ffff00">the ash would never fall off,
you know?</font>

492
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,741
<font color="#ffff00">So I go to the set,</font>

493
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,745
<font color="#ffff00">and I forget that Marion is there,
of course,</font>

494
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,665
<font color="#ffff00">because she's the head of makeup.
So she's over there.</font>

495
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,792
<font color="#ffff00">I'm here with my cigarette.</font>

496
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,670
<font color="#ffff00">Harry Shearer is playing Mike Wallace
and he says,</font>

497
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,632
<font color="#ffff00">"Mr. Thurm, you've admitted your client
was breaking the law at that point."</font>

498
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,009
<font color="#ffff00">I say, "I know that!
You don't think I know that?</font>

499
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,511
<font color="#ffff00">I'm a lawyer. I would know that."</font>

500
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,518
<font color="#ffff00">And the director goes,
"Cut! He's sweating."</font>

501
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,730
<font color="#ffff00">Marion says, "I know that! You don't
think I know that? I'm a makeup artist."</font>

502
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,989
<font color="#ffff00">It was insane.</font>

503
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,909
<font color="#ffff00">But, you know, when a character
becomes popular on  SNL,</font>

504
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,537
<font color="#ffff00">you're kind of expected to do it again.</font>

505
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,791
<font color="#ffff00">And every time I did Nathan Thurm,
I was terrified I would get caught,</font>

506
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,251
<font color="#ffff00">and I never got caught.</font>

507
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,463
<font color="#ffff00">But then after the last show,
there was a big, big, big party.</font>

508
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,299
<font color="#ffff00">And Marion's assistant got drunk.</font>

509
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,470
<font color="#ffff00">He went into her office and said, "Marion!</font>

510
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,889
<font color="#ffff00">How stupid are you?</font>

511
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,060
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you know that you're Nathan Thurm?</font>

512
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,731
<font color="#ffff00">Everybody else does!"</font>

513
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,817
<font color="#ffff00">And she was devastated.</font>

514
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,362
<font color="#ffff00">She was so upset, you know,
and she came up and she confronted me.</font>

515
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,240
<font color="#ffff00">She said, "I thought you were my friend."</font>

516
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,535
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "Marion, I  am  your friend.</font>

517
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,287
<font color="#ffff00">But you know that...</font>

518
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,665
<font color="#ffff00">impersonation is the highest form

riding the border, looking for Mexicans.</font>

I can't bear this any more.</font>

953

I'll let you stand on your own two feet.</font>

feeling a little sentimental.</font>

that I get inspired once in a while,</font>

tonight. Your lyrics are in black</font>

993
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,923
<font color="#ffff00">had a few moments of emotionality,
I thought.</font>

994
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,677
<font color="#ffff00">My wife thinks Marty and I are too close,
but we resolved that</font>
