17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,023
Seems like the perfect holiday
for the Faitelsons.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,903
I'm sure that it is life-changing.

19
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,441
Yeah, well, I'd rather backpack
than end up on some fancy wine tour.

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,026
Well, and you can't ride a bike.

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,237
Fuck you.

22
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:56,952
-Jean, it's been too long.
-Oh, hey, Allen.

23
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,204
Congrats on the new grandson.

24
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,907
-You did a great job with this.
-Thank you.

25
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,207
Well,
Michael did a wonderful job in Texas.

26
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,581
-Aw, thank you.
-I heard.

27
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,497
You guys looking at the Burgundy trip?

28
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,256
-Ah, well...
-No, I think Jean wants to rough it more.

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,009
I think maybe an ashram in India,
or something or a silent retreat.

30
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,723
[Jean]
I never said that. He's being ridiculous.

31
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,764
-She's thinking it, though.

-[Allen whispers]
-[Michael] Okay. All right.

33
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,951
Okay, um, have you had enough small talk
with my colleagues?

34
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,488
Oh, you know how I like
to play the perfect wife.

35
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,162
You do a very good job of it.

36
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,922
[Michael] Mm.

37
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,089
Did you see, um...

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,394
Hey, Alexis. You look beautiful.

39
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,008
You too, Jean.

40
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,604
-[Michael] Hey.
-Hi.

41
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,505
Enjoying the party?

42
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,392
Yeah, I mean,

43
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,435
I don't know half the people here,
but it's an open bar.

44
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,694
My attitude exactly.

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,529
It sounds like you guys had fun in Texas,
at least.

46
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,859
Yeah. It was pretty uneventful.

47
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,784
Yeah, it was, you know, work, hotel...

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,000
Still, must be nice to be
in the middle of nowhere, right?

49
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,373
Yeah, I guess.

50
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,754
-Hey, honey. Um...
-Yes?

51
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,046
-Can you grab me another?
-Yeah.

52
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,960
-Yeah.
-Okay.

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,837
Looks like Alexis needs one, too.

54
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,842
-All right.
-Thanks, honey.

55
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,966
Okay.

-[Jean] How are you?
-[Alexis] Good.

57
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,649
Oh, wow.

58
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,309
[Alexis] Wish I could afford that.

00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,567
-It's so evocative, right?
-Yeah.

[shutter clicks]

61
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,488
So, how's the writing coming along?

62
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,664
Michael mentioned
that you were pursuing it on the side.

63
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,082
Yeah. Good, actually. I, um...

64
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,172
I just found out that one of my stories
is going to be in n+1 magazine.

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,078
Wow.

66
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,536
It's kind of like
an indie version of Salon.

67
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,457
Honey, did you know Alexis's story
is going to be in a magazine?

68
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,836
-Oh. Oh, well, congratulations.
-Thank you.

-Yeah.
-It's, um, it's the one you read.

70
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,052
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-About my dad.

That's, uh, fantastic.

I didn't say hello. Would you mind?

-Sorry. Excuse us, sorry. Okay.
-Of course.

-Yeah.

When did you read Alexis's story?

80
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,400
A couple of weeks ago. She wanted me
to give her some feedback, but...

81
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,319
-I'd like to read it.
-Oh, really?

82
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,494
Since when are you into creative writing?

83
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,783
Maybe I'm into a lot of things
you don't know about.

84
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,786
I'm sure that you are.
At this point, nothing would surprise me.

if you'd ended up with Catherine?

What's bringing this up?

92
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,983
I don't know. Just...

93
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,274
You used to be a major stoner back then.

94
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,821
Used to smoke all the time, right?

95
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,823
-Just made me think of her.
-You rejected me.

96
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,781
And I was dulling the pain.

97
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,583
No. You fell hard for her.
Nearly killed me.

98
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,999
I thought about you the whole time.

99
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,168
Yeah, right. Even during sex?

100
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,205

a picture of yourself.

-What?
-Nothing. I, uh...

-[Sidney] Yeah.

-Do they?
-It's what they say.

148

I really don't care what people say,

why you can't come here...

00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,981
I might have to touch myself.

I told you. I'm not on social media.

159

Yeah, yeah.
You're a fucking ghost, I know.

160
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,118
Well, it's too bad.

161
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,576
I would've let you watch, but...

162
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,126
I guess you'll just
have to wait till tomorrow.

[Claire] "The two most important days
in your life are the day you're born...

166
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,901
and the day you find out why."

167
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,730
Mark Twain said that.

168
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,822
And Zane ended our meditation
with that quote.

169
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,575
And all of a sudden,
everything came into perspective.

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,830
The purpose of my life.

171
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,952
-Which is?
-To give.

172
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,865
Not unlike yours, actually.

173
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:58,211
I mean, when Rob left my neighbor Pat,
I took her in for two months.

174
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,627
Let her stay in my guest room,
'cause I didn't want her to be alone.

175
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,547
And I made her oatmeal every morning,
and I took care of her.

176
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,717
Well, that's great, Claire.

177
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,766
-It's good to be giving.
-Yeah.

178
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,980
But it's also healthy
to have your own needs. We all do.

179
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,942
But, ultimately, by serving others,
we serve ourselves.

180
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,074
And by accepting myself as I have,

181
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,197
honestly, truthfully,

182
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,203
I hope my daughter will accept me.

183
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,411
Hmm. I have the same hope.

184
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,159
So...

185
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:32,997
I have been telling her about my work
in here and my work in meditation.

186
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,132
You know, the whole "letting go" thing.

187
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,594
And she has agreed to see me!

188
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,259
[Jean] That's great news.
I'm really happy for you.

189
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:47,971
[Claire] Yeah, so I wanted to know
how we could work out some time with you.

190
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,927
What for?

191
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,556
Well, I mean, she wants to come in
and do a session with me,

192
00:14:56,647 --> 00:15:01,897
and do you remember at the beginning
of our work, you suggested it?

193
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,985
Right.

194
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,107
And I feel you're the only person

195
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,777
who could do this healing process
with us, Jean.

196
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,327
Right. Of course. Um...

197
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,917
It's just I'm not really, uh...

198
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,801
an unbiased source anymore.

199
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,338
I'm very much a part of your journey,
your perspective, and...

200
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,681
I wouldn't want Rebecca to feel attacked.

201
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,310
I think it would be good
for the two of you to see someone...

202
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,730
that can be fair to both of you.

203
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,650
I'm not very comfortable with that.

204
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,397
-I understand, but--
-Jean...

205
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,148
I really need this.

206
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,124
Okay.

207
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,200
If you truly think
Rebecca will be open to it,

208
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,004
let's-- let's do it.

209
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,631
-You mean it?
-Against my better judgment, yes.

210
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,631
-Hey.
-Hey.

211
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,683
-Can we talk for a sec?
-Sure, what's up?

212
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,215
I don't want you to panic,
but it's a little troubling.

213
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,768
Oh, no. Is something wrong?

214
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,138
Well, it's about Texas.

215
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,855
Uh, if they are recanting
their statements again,

216
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,268
-I'm telling you, I am not--
-No. Nothing about the case.

217
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,727
Oh, okay.

218
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,534
-It's about your assistant.
-Alexis?

219
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,784
Apparently, there's a story
going around that you...

220
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,329
were intimate on the trip.

221
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,037
Are you kidding?

222
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,503
Wow.

223
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,213
Okay. Listen.

224
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,429
Look, Allen, I would tell you.

225
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,049
I consider you to be a friend.

226
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,595
I would own up to it
and tell you if I fucked up.

227
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,640
I mean,
that happens to people all the time.

228
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,267
Nothing...

229
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,231
like that happened.

230
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,232
Okay.

231
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,574
Then it's a non-issue.
Just wanted to hear from you.

232
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,244
Well,
I appreciate you coming to me directly.

233
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:08,903
Of course.

234
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,550
Hi, Rebecca. It's Diane.

235
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,803
Listen, I need to speak to you. Um...

236
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,560
It's a long story. Can you call me back
when you get a chance?

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,470
Thanks.

238
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,518
[knock on door]

239
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,439
Hey, come in.

240
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,572
I have to talk to you.

241
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:47,987
Yeah?

242
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,027
-You missed it.
-What?

243
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,034
My a capella show.

244
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,576
-Oh, fuck, Lar.
-It's fine. It's fine. I'm...

245
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,035
-Honestly, I'm so over it by now.
-No, I'm so sorry.

246
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,207
But, um, it did make me think...

247
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,051
in general,

248
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,216
you've been really absent.

249
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,513
You're right.

250
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,016
-I haven't been there.
-The more I think about it,

251
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,435
how selfish you've been,
how addicted to your phone,

252
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,823
or how you're just lost
in your own world...

253
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:34,914
I realized that I recognize this behavior.

254
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,373
I remember the signs from Daryl.

255
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:43,834
He was so aloof, and he was so forgetful.

256
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,376
-Operating like no one else existed.
-You know me.

257
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,224
Larin, I'm not cheating on Michael.

258
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,591
I couldn't do that.

259
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,934
You remember how paralyzed I got
when things weren't good between us.

260
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:08,269
But you're right.
I haven't been a good friend.

261
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,242
Okay.

262
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,202
[sighs]

263
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,727
[whispering] What the fuck am I doing?

264
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:07,501
So, I found many mentions in print,

265
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,420
but no images.

266
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,921
I told you, I like my privacy.

267
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,224
Mmm. It's like you're not a real person.

268
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,643
I mean, you have nothing out there.

269
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,966
[Jean exhales]

270
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,809
-Hey, delete that.
-Or what?

271
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,645
I mean it.

272
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,731
-Oh, you're cute when you're angry.
-I'm not fucking around.

273
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,031
All right, fine.

274
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:42,026
-Deleted it. See?
-Good.

275
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,905
What the fuck happened to you?

276
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,754
What do you mean?

277
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,883
Something bad must have happened.

278
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,341
I mean...

279
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:58,884
you don't go AWOL with no attachments
if your life's been peachy keen.

280
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,297
How do you know?

281
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,846
I don't think you're a criminal, either.

282
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,645
Yeah, well, I could probably rob a bank
and no one would notice.

283
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:13,067
They might even hold the door for me
on the way out.

284
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,975
-So you're invisible?
-Mm-hmm.

285
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,531
And you think that means
you can do whatever the fuck you want?

286
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:20,907
Doesn't it?

287
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,662
Look, whatever it is, I don't care.

288
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,713
With our lives and our jobs,
we could easily just hit the road.

289
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,125
[Sidney chuckles]

290
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,925
Where would we go?

291
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,465
Have you ever been to Marfa?

292
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,640
-No.
-Well...

293
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,106
We can road trip there...

294
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,227
fuck around.

295
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,319
And then drive our car off a cliff
like Thelma &amp; Louise.

296
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,832
-Yeah, well, that's not how I'd do it.
-Oh, yeah?

297
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,327
If you really want to escape,
you need a plan.

298
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:16,424
I'd start by renting a Westfalia,

299
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:21,799
send my apologies to my colleagues
for missing any deadlines,

300
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,681
tell them I have a second cousin's funeral
that I have to attend in South Dakota.

301
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,313
No, fuck it.
South Dakota's way too specific.

302
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:38,819
Maybe Cleveland or outside Sacramento?

303
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,236
And we'd go on a regular week,
not a holiday.

304
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,450
And...

305
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,211
that way, people would be consumed
with their real lives, their work.

306
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:01,797
And then, I'd sell off
all my ex-husband's jewelry.

307
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:05,586
The kind you can't wear
for emotional reasons.

308
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:11,885
And then we'd burn through that money
with reckless abandon.

309
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,385
[heavy breathing]

310
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,358
Dude, you're taking way too long
on your breaks.

311
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:24,775
Suck my dick.

312
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,266
[Alexis chuckles]

313
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,101
What did Allen wanna talk to you about?

314
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,095
I need you to be honest with me, okay?

315
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,570
-Should we go into your office?
-No, we shouldn't.

316
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,859
That'll just make it worse.

317
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,149
-[stammering] What worse?
-Did you tell anyone about Texas?

318
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,987
-Of course not. What do you mean?
-Did you mention...

319
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,791
anything about me...

320
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:17,792
on our trip to anyone?

321
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,252
Are you crazy?

322
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,503
Why would I open my...

323
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,053
mouth?

324
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:32,717
Dan and Lena in accounting
did mention something similar at lunch.

325
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,681
I thought they were just
making assumptions.

326
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,814
They probably just picked up
on something.

327
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,602
There's nothing to pick up on.

328
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:43,034
-Right.
-Could you hand me that, uh...

329
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,278
that file?

330
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,905
-I'm gonna have to move your desk.
-Don't do that.

331
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,580
That'll only make you look more guilty.

332
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,786
-Make people more suspicious.
-I know that.

333
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,840
We didn't even do anything.

334
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,340
Doesn't matter.

335
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,381
Now, it's basically the same as if we did.

336
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,968
[church bell ringing]

337
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,814
-Hey! What's going on?
-Shh! It's okay.

338
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,362
Hey, just wait a second. Tell me.

339
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,779
I shouldn't have gone
to that fucking meeting, okay?

340
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,281
Look, I'm not proud of myself.

341
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,529
Did you?

342
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,119
It was a moment of weakness. Okay?

343
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,370
Couldn't help myself.

344
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,708
-And you were with Tom?
-Yeah.

345
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,631
Because I don't have anywhere else
to fucking go.

346
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,209
Amber's boyfriend moved back in.
He's a raging alcoholic.

347
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,513
I can't live with my mom.

348
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,008
At least, with him,
I have somewhere to stay.

349
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,335
I can sleep through the night.

350
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,718
How do you walk away from that?

351
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,345
Just to feel good
for one night is something.

352
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,558
We could talk to your mom.

353
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,318
Would that help, if I go with you?

354
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,568
I told you I'm not ready. Don't push me.

355
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,776
I won't push you.

356
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,987
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:24,214
I just want a chance to be a real person
in the world.

358
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,589
Like you.

359
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,520
-I'm only as real as you are.
-No, you're not.

360
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,443
No, you got things.

361
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,984
No, you got things!

362
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,524
Imagine if you couldn't go home
to your fucking suburban life?

363
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,358
-All right, I'm just gonna call him.
-No, hold on.

364
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,365
Look...

365
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,580
I have a solution.

366
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:03,078
Just for a few days,
until we talk to your mom, okay?

367
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,543
Please.

368
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,181
What is this place?

369
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,640
[door closes]

370
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,975
It's a friend's.

371
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,436
She's out of town,
so sometimes I check in on it.

372
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:31,571
Diane?

373
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:37,573
Yeah.

374
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,167
Expensive looking.

375
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,755
You know, I'm trusting you here.

376
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,807
You really are a miracle worker.

377
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,147
No, I'm not.

378
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,489
My friend Drew, remember?
Her mom said the same.

379
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,237
Maybe you're my magic pill.

380
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,030
Well, I just wanna help.

381
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,081
-It's my job.
-No. No one cares.

382
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:26,504
They say they care.

383
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:30,002
They look you in the eye and tell you
that your problems matter to them, but...

384
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,840
Soon enough, they're back
debating what to watch on TV,

385
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,304
what restaurant to eat at.

386
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,938
I just want you to have a real chance.

387
00:28:54,985 --> 00:29:00,235
I don't want you going back to drugs
just because you don't have any options.

388
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,699
You know, if I had a mom like you,
I'd give it all up.

389
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,331
-Hey there, hot shot.
-Hey. What, you got groceries?

390
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,330
Yeah, I was gonna make
some turkey meatballs.

391
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,043
Oh, that sounds delicious.

392
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:51,499
How was work?

393
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,383
Um, it was good. It was good.

394
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,844
[panting] Allen thought,
you know, we did a good job...

395
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,050
in Texas,
and he was happy to see you the other day.

396
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,170
[basketball dribbling]

397
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,506
Looking good, mister.

398
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:49,177
-[Dolly] What's your name?
-Oh, you know my name, honey.

399
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,311
Mommy, I'm trying to memorize my lines.

400
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,194
Oh, for the play.

401
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,358
It's so hard when one minute I'm Dolly,
and the next, I'm Peter Pan.

402
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,279
It's confusing.

403
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,530
Well, it's acting.
It's supposed to be fun.

404
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,778
And you get to pretend to be someone else.

405
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,486
Yeah.

406
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,076
The best way is just
to go over and over it

407
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,504
so much that
you don't even have to think about it.

408
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,252
You know it so well,
and it's inside of you.

409
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,125
You start to believe it yourself.

410
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,296
-Can you read Wendy?
-Sure.

411
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,220
What's your name?

412
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,097
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

413
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,518
-What's yours?
-Peter Pan.

414
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,603
Where do you live?

415
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,569
I don't know.

416
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,653
[heavy breathing]

417
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,819
Look at me.

418
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:12,328
-Look at me.
-I'm looking at you. What?

419
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,829
[heavy breathing]

420
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,044
Hey.

421
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,917
[Sam]
Things with Emily are really good.

422
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:29,052
She's lost some weight
and is actually more adventurous.

423
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:30,888
I mean...

424
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,429
Last night, in the middle of sex,
she even slapped me.

425
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,097
-How did you like it?
-The slap?

426
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,610
I hadn't felt that way in a while. Um...

427
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:48,698
-That kind of intensity.
-Hmm.

428
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:53,367
Why do you think she did it?

429
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,575
Guess she wanted to get my attention.

430
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,036
And what were you thinking about?

431
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,253
Um, I don't know.

432
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,088
I was in the moment.

433
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,799
Emily's really helping me move on.

434
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,889
She doesn't even let me
say Sidney's name anymore.

435
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,234
That's good, Sam.

436
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,691
But as you pursue a relationship
with Emily,

437
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:27,991
it's important that you continue working
on your unresolved feelings for Sidney.

438
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:32,448
Right, but I'm over her.
I don't want to talk about her with you.

439
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,164
You seem a little angry.

440
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:39,865
Was there any aggression?

441
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,883
Did things ever get physical
with you and Sidney?

442
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,588
Depends what you mean by physical.

443
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,351
Sidney calls it "good pain."

444
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:04,396
When you're just toeing that line between
hurting and complete fucking ecstasy.

445
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,193
I'm sure drug addicts get it
when they shoot up, I don't know.

446
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,447
What did she do...

447
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,530
to make you feel that way?

448
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:20,826
[sighs]

449
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,746
Well, she'd get mad at me, right?

450
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:30,633
And then, we'd fight.

451
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:35,925
And then, she'd say something
like she was gonna go...

452
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,229
blow the guys
at the bar down on our street.

453
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:46,768
Take them all home and make me watch
while she sucked them all off.

454
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,981
And while she'd start to tell me this,

455
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:53,954
she'd suck on my cock.

456
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,491
It was crazy.

457
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,581
How did you like it?

458
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,417
Well, I never came as hard
as when we did it like that.

459
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:16,132
It's sick, I know, but I couldn't help it.

460
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,007
And can I ask...

461
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:25,057
how does it make you feel
thinking about it here, in this room?

462
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,727
[heavy breathing]

463
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:45,964
What are you doing to me?

464
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,794
Seriously...

465
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
You think you're helping?

466
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,627
I'm telling you I moved on.
I'm fucking happy.

467
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,131
What do you want me to say?

468
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,005
That I think about Sidney
every time I fuck Emily?

469
00:36:57,092 --> 00:37:00,682
Sam, it's clear that you seem
to have a lot of...

470
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,223
emotion surrounding this subject.

471
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:07,024
[stammers] I'm sorry for raising my voice.

472
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:08,853
Look...

473
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:13,685
I'm happy
that Emily's helping you move on.

474
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:17,028
It's just what I want.
You know that, right?

475
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:23,446
But it's important that you release all
of your feelings here with me.

476
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,213
[knock on door]

477
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,211
[Larin] Come in.

478
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,261
-Hey.
-Hey.

479
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:38,469
Can you talk for a sec?

480
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,304
[Larin] Sure.

481
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,809
What's up?

482
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,270
I, uh, wanted to apologize for yesterday.

483
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,186
You were...

484
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,936
right to say something.

485
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,494
I haven't been honest with you.

486
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:06,325
I actually haven't been honest
with anyone.

487
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,455
I, um...

488
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:21,175
I have been having issues with Michael.

489
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,760
What kind of issues?

490
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,929
Just been fighting a lot

491
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,892
and it's part of the reason I've been
on my phone so much.

492
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,980
The other night, I was awake at two a.m.,
and he wasn't in bed,

493
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:37,283
and he was in the bathroom talking
to someone on the phone.

494
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,204
Is it his assistant?

495
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:42,866
Honestly, I don't know.

496
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:46,238
I know he's interested.
I can tell from the way he...

497
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,081
He tries to leave her out of stories.

498
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:52,462
The way he forces himself
not to say her name.

499
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,421
Oh, God.

500
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,836
That's so hard.

501
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:00,721
I haven't even spoken to him yet.

502
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,350
I don't know if he trusts me
after everything that went down.

503
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,014
I mean, that's possible.

504
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:16,483
When you shut someone out emotionally,
you know, it's hard to get the trust back.

505
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,993
And you blurred so many boundaries.

506
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,574
But I was protecting Melissa.

507
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:27,954
I couldn't tell Michael anything about it.

508
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:31,213
It would be implicating him.
She's the patient.

509
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,956
I get it, but you know,
somewhere along the way,

510
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,252
Michael lost you.

511
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:41,835
I get that's the price for doing business,
but it still has an effect.

512
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,508
I don't know who I'd be without him.

513
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:58,855
It's like I'm so anxious, and so...

514
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,358
I'm a mess.

515
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,452
[sighs deeply]

516
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,577
Seriously, I'm scared of you.

517
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,496
Oh. So, how's it going?

518
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,548
How's your sister doing?

519
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,590
-She gets out in about two weeks.
-Oh, yeah?

520
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,465
We still haven't spoken,
and I'm actually a little worried.

521

The therapist is gonna ask your mom to
go through all the ways that you hurt her.

it's her therapist, so...

it's always gonna be biased.
