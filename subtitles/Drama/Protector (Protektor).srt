00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,749
A Czech is a cyclist

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,037
Emil!

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,953
Today, May 27, at 10:30

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,195
an attempt to assassinate
Deputy Protector, Police General,

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,313
SS Obergruppenführer
Reinhard Heydrich was made.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,949
One of the suspects
escaped on a bicycle

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,998
towards Stara Liben quarter

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,473
wearing nondescript dark
clothes and a dark hat.

21
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,676
- You were crying?
- Leave me alone, please.

22
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,232
I shan't. You could
do something silly.

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,797
Silly? You think love is silly?

24
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,912
Don't worry.
You are safe here with me.

25
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,310
Safety with you
is farfrom safe...

26
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,990
With my eyes closed
I disappear...

27
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,229
A concrete fortress
with a barbed wire fence reveals

28
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,472
that we are reporting
from a secure location.

29
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,959
For security reasons I can't
give away our exact position.

30
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,759
After meeting conditions
of the Munich agreement

31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,389
we have lost over 30% of our
original territory to Germany,

32
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,277
Poland and Hungary.

33
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,393
Tens of thousands of Czechs
left the occupied territories

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,675
and are looking for
a new home inland.

35
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,115
They are refugees
in their own country.

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,398
Staff captain, how does
our army view this situation?

37
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,838
Although we weren't allowed to
fight, the border has calmed down

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,799
and by being prudent, careful
and orderly we've kept peace

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,394
for our European allies.

40
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,550
Hopefully our powerful allies
won't forget this sacrifice.

41
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,516
Just like Alice in Wonderland

42
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,910
I close my eyes
and feel so grand...

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,948
- You are safe here with me.
- With you... Sorry...

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,997
Cut!

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,588
Bravo!

46
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,434
Franta, I'm totally with you
but the censors won't allow it.

47
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,996
Any problems are mine.
You don't have to worry.

48
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,877
We can't give up now, can we?

49
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,192
- You're just drawing attention.
- Thas what you like about me.

50
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,109
Les go. I want to fetch
Hanka at the film studio.

51
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,875
Come on, join us for dinner.
She can get home on her own.

52
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,511
She's been a bit restless lately...
so I have to go calm her down.

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,275
You're jealous. Afraid someone
might hit on her there.

54
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,351
- No, I'm not.
- To hell with it.

55
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,637
If she wanted she could cheat on you
any time during the shooting.

56
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,517
Why are you saying that?

57
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,151
Look how pissed off he is.

58
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,308
That was a great tip of yours. This
girl's got a career in front of her.

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,437
But beware of her.
She was much better than you!

60
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,229
You're right. I've never been
good in female roles.

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,072
Here she is.

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,631
Your eyes are magic, Hana. In a film
is everything. Do you believe me?

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,359
That you're too shy to ask
for an autograph?

64
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,514
No way! Producers are never
shy. You're not shy, are you?

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,272
You'll see how far we'll go.
This will be a blockbuster.

66
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,150
Soon ill be in shops. Everyone'll
buy it. People want nice things.

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,073
Les hope enough people
share your taste.

68
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,073
- Aren't you too tough on him?
- Not really. He likes that.

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,071
He thinks is artistic.

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,477
To our new star.

71
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,717
Is totally dead here.

72
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,277
Whas going on? Is there going
to be some entertainment?

73
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,476
Just like Alice in Wonderland

74
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,397
I close my eyes
and I feel grand

75
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,156
Oh how the world
would suddenly seem

76
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,550
if I could close my eyes
and dream.

77
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,316
Strings of wind
will gently play

78
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,110
All the clouds will cast away

79
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,552
Thas just the way
my world should be

80
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,674
With my eyes closed
I clearly see.

81
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,074
- Is there anything wrong?
- No.

82
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,200
I just want you
to stop bothering Hanka.

83
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,272
I don't think
I've been bothering her.

84
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,793
- And you are who?
- I'm her husband.

85
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,031
Anyone could say that.
Excuse me.

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,757
Wait a minute!

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,037
Get off each other!

88
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,558
Don't go nuts. I'm sore all over.

89
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,117
Serves you right.

90
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,317
You acted like an idiot.

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,036
I just wanted to talk to him.
He was touching you.

92
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,190
That means nothing in film.

93
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,749
You think is all orgies.
Fantl is my friend, full stop.

94
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,196
A friend? Why is he
all over you all the time?

95
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,517
He's not all over me.

96
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,677
We work together.

97
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,313
I just can't get used to
these new friends of yours.

98
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,037
Alright.

99
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,517
We kissed.

100
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,997
Once.

101
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,037
On screen.

102
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,751
You're such a dummy, Emil.

103
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,594
There's nothing going on between me
and anybody else. Honestly, darling.

104
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,477
My watch is broken.

105
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,276
Is nothing.
I'll buy you a new one.

106
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,437
Close your eyes.

107
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,919
- I love you, Hanka.
- I love you too. Very much.

108
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,077
Make sure you're careful.
I have anotherfilm coming up.

109
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,317
Cut!

110
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,949
You can't just leave
in the middle of shooting.

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,549
This was my last scene.
You've got one more week left.

112
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,428
What about the premiere?
Won't you be here?

113
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,876
Arnost, this is
ourfirst film together...

114
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,750
When the Germans come,
thas going to be a real premiere.

115
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,197
- People like us will be done.
- What kind of people are we?

116
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,638
You can't imagine
whas about to happen. I can.

117
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,999
I'm ready and don't intend to wait.
Come away with me while we can.

118
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,910
You're panicking.
The situation's calming down.

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,912
- We'll make anotherfilm.
- Are you listening at all?

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,197
The two of us are done, for good.
You get it?

121
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,909
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not leaving Emil.

122
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,677
You'd better go.

123
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,676
He already suspects there's
something going on between us.

124
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,833
- Excuse me. They need you.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

125
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,158
Hang on.

126
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,676
Here, Visa, contacts,
everything. Take it.

127
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,953
- Where did you get my photo?
- Just don't put it off.

128
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,355
Are you mad? I don't want this.

129
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,510
Yes, there is a huge chance
for introducing new industries.

130
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,634
Our businessmen must establish
healthy industries capable...

131
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,030
Hi. This was left for you
at reception.

132
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,359
...of thriving and providing
good livelihoods for all.

133
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,389
If it comes to favors
and protecting those

134
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,119
who never cared about our state

135
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,195
then all attempts to develop
our businesses are in vain.

136
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,075
At the behest of the President
of the Republic we report

137
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,711
that today, 15 March at 6:00 A.M.

138
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,918
German forces
occupied Czech and Moravia.

139
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,912
It is impossible to oppose this
action and no incidents must occur.

140
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,157
I was so scared.

141
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,717
What will happen to us?

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,436
Don't worry,
I'll take care of us.

143
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,155
I was promised that the independence
and advancement of our country

144
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,276
will be protected.

145
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,556
I received this promise
today in writing,

146
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,191
a declaration of the Protectorate
of Bohemia and Moravia.

147
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,314
A script may be broadcast
only if the text is censored.

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,599
Each section will submit
everything to the Czech censors.

149
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,833
The Czech censors will then
submit it to the German censors.

150
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,471
And, after this is executed,
we receive the text back.

151
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,629
Does that mean
that a censor censors the censor?

152
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,236
Mr. Vrana, all censored texts
will be given to the inspector.

153
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,595
He will hand it to the commentator

154
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,194
who will give out
relevant instructions.

155
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,239
He is in charge
of the whole broadcast, ok?

156
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,233
And he'll confirm the text.

157
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,438
You don't mind we're to
censor each other now, do you?

158
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,513
After censorship comes ratting out
and eventually collaboration.

159
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,114
If you think I'll bootlick
such a scumbag

160
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,113
who'd be a janitor under
normal circumstances...

161
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,635
Only an idiot acts like this.

162
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,753
So he's flipped out a bit.
We're all a little nervous.

163
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,197
...and to start working again.
- Explain how you can act like this.

164
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,750
Why? They can't bust you
for a constructive remark.

165
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,115
It was an unconstructive
provocation.

166
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,751
I just expressed my opinion.
Is my right. This is my home!

167
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,591
He just doesn't get it...

168
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,993
...I was expressing my view. - We
all have views but keep them quiet.

169
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,230
I won't grovel
before these usurpers!

170
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,596
Tell him something.
You know whas going on here.

171
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,478
They should know
they came uninvited...

172
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,157
Franta, I know we should
protest. But tactically.

173
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,195
Could you repeat that, please?

174
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,428
We've got a chance
to express our views pretending

175
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,911
we mean the opposite.
People will understand.

176
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,155
You know what? To hell with you!

177
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,837
You did that well.

178
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,991
Don't get me wrong. Maybe you're
overreacting, maybe Franta's right.

179
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,517
Franta is an idiot. With them
we have to do something else.

180
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,397
Hello?

181
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,557
Speaking.

182
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,230
First there was this hassle
with Fantl. And now your wife.

183
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,348
Sorry for being frank but she was
selfish to hold back her descent.

184
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,989
My new film is being
withdrawn from cinemas. Get it?

185
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,993
No, I don't get it.
Just tell me where my wife is.

186
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,034
Calm her down. Take her home.
I can't afford another scandal.

187
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,917
Don't come here!

188
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,037
Or I'll jump!

189
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,954
Don't be silly and get down here.

190
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,952
Mainly don't drink!
Everything will be alright.

191
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,113
- Like shit it will!
- At least we'll be together more.

192
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,035
You can relax at home, read...

193
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,275
What are you babbling about?

194
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,514
You're actually happy about it!

195
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,230
- No need to be jealous anymore!
- Stay there! We're going home!

196
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,033
Blackouts in Prague

197
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,555
We Have What We Need

198
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,949
The German Army
Charmed By Beautiful Prague

199
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,956
And In Prague Now Driving
Is Only On The Right

200
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,153
Jews Prohibited At Swimming Pools
Jewish Music Forbidden

201
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,313
Jews Prohibited To Be Among Aryans

202
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,119
Jews Prohibited From Cinemas

203
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,430
Jews Prohibited From Leaving Prague

204
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,997
Jews' Use of Prague
Trams Restricted

205
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,999
Jews Stroll Through The Cemeteries

206
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,555
- Won't you stoke it?
- I shouldn't deliver coal at all.

207
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,838
This is the last time, because
you're injured and I'm a gentleman.

208
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,957
Hi, Otto.

209
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,114
Hi. Franta's inside.

210
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,279
- What happened?
- Another of his provocations.

211
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,150
Forgot to mind his tongue
but this time live on-air.

212
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,955
- What are we going to do?
- Nothing. I'm through with him.

213
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,837
How come?

214
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,637
I broke up with him.

215
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,069
I won't sleep with someone
who never listens.

216
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,397
Mr. Vrbata, come in.

217
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,277
- How's your German?
- We studied it at school.

218
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,630
So we'll understand each other.

219
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,912
Your colleague tells me
you're a sportsman.

220
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,397
I rowed.

221
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,757
I boxed.

222
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,637
I have a problem.

223
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,839
I can't rely
on the Czech reporters,

224
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,118
that there won't be
more cases like Mr. Vrana's.

225
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,477
Your wife is Jewish.

226
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,398
My wife isn't really Jewish.
She's Czech. Always has been.

227
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,677
So you know, I, as a National
Socialist, must care about this.

228
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,672
But this time
that isn't my priority.

229
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,997
I need to replace Mr. Vrana.

230
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,078
And I think
the best solution is you.

231
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,677
If I can rely on you, you can
rely on me. Fair enough, yeah?

232
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,635
- Could I think it over?
- Don't think too long.

233
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,876
I have no interest
in dismissing efficient reporters.

234
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:09,435
Every Czech citizen
can find their perfect place here.

235
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,637
We might not have our own state

236
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,109
but we are part
of a powerful Reich

237
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,109
which gives us
the chance to develop.

238
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,159
Prague. Hitlerjugend roll call
took place in the German House...

239
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,232
Thank you so much for
such a wonderful explanation!

240
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,237
Yes, yes.

241
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,594
You've no idea how happy I am
to be born in this lovely century.

242
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,477
Yes.

243
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,589
A military parade
on Wenceslas Square

244
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,195
was watched by Commander-ln-Chief,
General Blaskovic.

245
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,671
This military spectacle showed the
greatness and power of the nation

246
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,957
which now protects
Bohemia and Moravia.

247
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,389
Two men left, two right.

248
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,914
The whole street.
Every house.

249
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,597
I.D., please.

250
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,237
This is your cellar.

251
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,079
This passage leads
to a staircase.

252
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,118
- What was that?
- A round up I guess.

253
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,913
How about coming straight to me
next time? For a private screening?

254
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,637
I don't think so.

255
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,872
But thank you. For everything.

256
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,117
What are you doing?

257
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,917
I did a horrible thing.

258
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,877
- I went to the cinema.
- Hanka, you can't do that!

259
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,953
You know what time it is?
You're under curfew.

260
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,510
- We should get divorced, Emil.
- What are you talking about?

261
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,191
I'm dangerous for you now.

262
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,517
Come here...

263
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,116
You're not dangerous,
just really silly.

264
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,950
Drink up. There's rum in it.

265
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,397
How about Franta?

266
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,435
Whas going to happen to him?

267
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,793
Hard to say. He got arrested.

268
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,717
I don't know...

269
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,836
I hope it won't look
as if you exploited this.

270
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,076
If I don't say yes,
they'll fire me. If I do...

271
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,311
This can't last forever.
We have to hold on.

272
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,555
All right. But make sure
that you stand by me.

273
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,953
That you don't do anything
you shouldn't. Promise?

274
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,037
Don't worry.

275
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,315
I'll look after us.
I'll protect you.

276
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,677
Hallo, hallo. After a short break
yourfavorite reporter Emil Vrbata,

277
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,470
signs on from the German
art exhibit Greatness And Beauty.

278
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,519
I am standing in the middle
of this historical hall

279
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,070
and right behind me
there is a statue of a rider

280
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,358
who is waving his right hand
at an imaginary audience.

281
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,317
Now, let me welcome
our special guest,

282
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,153
the exhibition's curator,
associate professor Kouba.

283
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,550
Could you tell us how this
event came into existence?

284
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,159
The art of the new Germany
is an example for all of us.

285
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,230
Such an exhibit works best
when seen with one's own eyes.

286
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,280
How did you manage
this exhibition?

287
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,912
It was hard to imagine these
big pieces being moved in here.

288
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,516
Fortunately, everything went
smooth thanks to our ability.

289
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,910
We are all happy to hear that.

290
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,959
Our Czech workers
have received much praise.

291
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,193
- They worked like ants, they...
- Thank you very much, Mr. Kouba.

292
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,714
And now les move
into another hall.

293
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,391
For Voices of Our Home,
at the microphone Emil Vrbata.

294
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,352
Thank you, Mr. Kouba.

295
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,317
Good day.

296
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,830
...of course, very pleasant,
especially for longer journeys.

297
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,993
- I like going to the woods.
- I wouldn't say no to that.

298
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,836
Longer pace and more space.

299
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,797
One - two - three...

300
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,833
One -two - three...

301
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,238
Stop! You have to arrive sooner!

302
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,193
I've been working on this for
three days and is still wrong!

303
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,077
Les go!

304
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,312
One, two, ready!

305
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,149
- Hello.
- Hello.

306
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,317
Are you Emil Vrbata?

307
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,433
For Voices of Our Home,
at the microphone Emil Vrbata.

308
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,875
Could you give us an autograph?

309
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,672
I want an autograph too. Would you
give me one, for old times?

310
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,439
Don't mind me,
I'm not here on business.

311
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,988
We just decided to go out
for the evening.

312
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,551
Gentlemen, this is the rising star
in our radio firmament,

313
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,910
reporter Emil Vrbata.

314
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,079
- Good day.
- Good day.

315
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,071
Pleased to meet you.

316
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,920
Voices of Our Home,
Emil Vabata.

317
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,797
Vrbata...

318
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,834
Your hat... Don't forget your hat...

319
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,877
Good night.

320
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,114
- What is it you're wearing?
- I thought you'd like it.

321
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,839
Yeah. Is marvelous, splendid.

322
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,433
What is it? Anything wrong?

323
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,277
Nothing.

324
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,430
All night drinking great schnapps,
smoking expensive cigars,

325
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,912
and in the end
I even sang beautifully.

326
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,835
You think I had a better time?

327
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,598
Sitting here all day alone,
waiting for you to come home?

328
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,036
Emil, take me out.

329
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,394
I wouldn't be such a nuisance.

330
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,035
Where to? Is night.

331
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,557
Not now, of course.

332
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,230
Not very lively here, is it?
If you don't like it, we can leave.

333
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,870
Why? I like it here. Is like
a Jewish Wenceslas Square.

334
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,192
Is hard when you can't go out.
A park's not possible so this is it.

335
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,795
Sure, is logical.
A cemetery is a promenade,

336
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,314
an occupation is protection...

337
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,033
Why don't we go to that café
of ours? We could go there.

338
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,555
Or the gentleman thinks
Jewish cafés stink?

339
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,349
The gentleman doesn't think so,
but he'd rather be here.

340
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,237
Is quite pretty here.

341
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,117
You're ashamed of me.

342
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,677
No, I'm not. Is just that
I don't think is very smart.

343
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,152
That café is really crowded.
Is much better here.

344
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,516
Right now we are in a cozy room,
sensibly furnished.

345
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,548
Opposite me is the cute face
of our young listener

346
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,392
trembling with anticipation

347
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,314
because she can't wait to hear
some national news.

348
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,155
This is what our youngsters are
like now. Eagerfor new knowledge

349
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,516
which our radio station
can bring them.

350
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,878
For Voices of Our Home,
at the microphone, Emil Vrbata.

351
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,511
See? I'm no star but my voice,
thas a different story.

352
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,670
- It will go far.
- Don't joke. You're popular.

353
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,357
Half and half. Nothing
compared to actors or sportsmen.

354
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,551
Still, it must affect you.

355
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,711
How about your personal life?
You're married, aren't you?

356
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,757
It doesn't matter...

357
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,359
How did you get
to where you are now?

358
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,914
- What did you do 10 years ago?
- I wanted to be a champion rower.

359
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,113
- Why aren't you, then?
- Because I realized

360
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,556
an average rower
cannot become a champion.

361
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,595
But don't quote that either.

362
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,440
You know, is hard work with you.

363
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,636
Can you at least
pick a photo for the cover?

364
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,277
How about this one?

365
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,551
Sorry! I didn't know
you had a visitor.

366
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,758
- She's a journalist.
- I'm just on my way.

367
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,115
Is starting any minute now.

368
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,758
4 legs and 4 feet, and winch
and grinch and ring-o-ding

369
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,396
run to the barn
and sleep there til spring.

370
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,912
Did you do anything bad this year?

371
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,992
- I didn't, Your Saintliness.
- Good, good.

372
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,877
Here you are.

373
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,513
What about you in the back?
Did you do anything bad?

374
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,797
- Even something little?
- No, I didn't.

375
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,557
Here you are.

376
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,110
We'll drink to that.

377
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,158
And now you!

378
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,394
Have you been good?
All year? You weren't bad? Really?

379
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,198
Franta! Is it you?

380
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,551
I heard they released you.

381
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,838
- So they have.
- Thas great.

382
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,117
What are you doing here?

383
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,437
I work in the archive.

384
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,837
Thas good.

385
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,357
Was it bad?

386
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,229
Pleasant it wasn't.

387
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,395
You must be angry with me, huh?

388
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,672
But there was
nothing else I could do.

389
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,153
Franta, the whole situation,
it was unbearable...

390
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,228
I'm not angry with you.
I hope you're a decent man.

391
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,439
- We have to make use of it.
- Of what?

392
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,796
Of your position.
No one will suspect you.

393
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,558
Franta, you're on your own. I'm
in a totally different situation.

394
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,437
Wait!

395
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,916
Sorry, but provocateurs
are everywhere.

396
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,839
Don't worry. Nothing will happen
to anybody. Les spice things up!

397
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,117
Vrbata!

398
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,750
You're still a sportsman.

399
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,911
Les show them...
show them that we're men.

400
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,996
If you don't give, you get.

401
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,830
Bravo! Bravo!

402
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,879
- Sorry. I didn't mean to.
- Is alright. He's used to it.

403
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,077
Won't he take it personally?

404
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,989
You mean when he discovers
you hit him for real?

405
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,793
Don't worry, he's asleep.
But I don't want to sleep.

406
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,797
Hi.

407
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,516
Does it have to be so loud?

408
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,909
Look what I've brought you.
A Christmas tree.

409
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,949
You're so sweet.
Us Jews are so into Christmas.

410
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,917
- What is it? Are you upset?
- No... I'm not upset.

411
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,515
You'd better go wash yourself.

412
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,073
Someone must have rubbed
herself against my face.

413
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,638
Somehow it all lasted
till morning. We were boxing...

414
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,711
At least don't lie, Emil.

415
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,630
- Where are you off to?
- I don't know. I have to go out.

416
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,190
I can't listen to this anymore.

417
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,070
But I'm not lying. Really.
I couldn't leave an official party.

418
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,430
I'm not doing it for myself.

419
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,673
Who are you doing it for?
This is not about me anymore.

420
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,238
It was naïve to think
we'd get through this easily.

421
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,595
So far nothing's happened to us.

422
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,229
Emil, hush.
For Goïs sake shut up!

423
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,357
You know what?

424
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,118
Do whatever you want.
Is not my fault you're Jewish.

425
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,476
- Were you crying?
- Leave me alone, please.

426
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,072
I shan't. You could
do something silly.

427
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,317
Silly? You think love is silly?

428
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,877
- So you're a photographer?
- No. I work with corpses.

429
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,232
Don't worry.
You are safe here with me.

430
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,834
You want to scare me?

431
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,798
I neverfinished my medical
studies so I work at pathology.

432
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,795
Where did you get this? I thought
it never made it to the cinemas.

433
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,157
- It did. It just wasn't screened.
- Do you realize how dangerous I am?

434
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,800
- You're not dangerous.
- How so?

435
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,351
I'm in a cinema
even though I can't be.

436
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,433
But no one can see you here.
Quite a safe danger.

437
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,748
Would you like to try
something really dangerous?

438
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,196
Oh how the world
would suddenly seem

439
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,710
if I could close my eyes
and dream.

440
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,348
Strings of wind
will gently play

441
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,355
All the clouds will cast away

442
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,112
Thas just the way
my world should be

443
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,435
With my eyes closed
I clearly see

444
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,239
- Will you have something?
- Cognac.

445
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,635
What are you doing here, Hana?

446
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,269
Here goes my wish
when the world goes sore

447
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,075
To close my eyes forever more.

448
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,669
Tell me what would you do
if you were in my place?

449
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,677
You don't lead a bad life.
Your husband takes care of you.

450
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,757
So how did it go?

451
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,597
Good.

452
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,198
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. It wasn't about him.

453
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,830
Do you still have some film?

454
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,790
Jews Not Admitted

455
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,031
Box Office
Jews Forbidden To Enter

456
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,791
Pure Aryan Business

457
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,955
- Hi there, sailors.
- Hello.

458
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,959
Admit it. You're old. You can never
keep up with these young stallions.

459
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,079
I could care less.
I'm worried about other things.

460
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,833
I see. You know what?

461
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,873
I've been thinking and I say
screw your conscience.

462
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,877
Your wife should be grateful

463
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,714
you make such sacrifices. There's
nothing she can reproach you with.

464
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,078
She doesn't reproach me.
She simply doesn't talk to me.

465
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,475
Can't you make a deal with her?

466
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,429
How can I make a deal with her
when we don't talk?

467
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,713
Or do you consult
these things with Tomek?

468
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,917
No. Thas what I've got you for.

469
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,076
- Why don't we consult more often?
- Because we can't.

470
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,073
- You know I'm getting married.
- I know but I don't get it.

471
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,071
You know is good with us.

472
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,075
Emil, I thought a sportsman can
tell when is only about sport.

473
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,198
What if we take them
with us tonight?

474
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,757
23...

475
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,797
24...

476
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,277
25...

477
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,837
26...

478
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,273
- 27!
- Bravo!

479
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,878
You can't do this!

480
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,555
Ladies and gentlemen, this here
is our caretaker, in person.

481
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,996
And this is his guest book
so les all sign it now.

482
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,277
This party was
duly announced and permitted.

483
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,591
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

484
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,388
Wait. I haven't signed yet.

485
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,033
The one with the gate
doesn't count. I didn't get in.

486
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,350
It counts. What would he have done
if he'd known you're Jewish?

487
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,357
What are you staring at?
Haven't you seen The Springman?

488
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,040
You haven't because
no one's ever seen him.

489
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,477
He's a mysterious phantom
who always escapes the Nazis.

490
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,995
He jumps like a kangaroo,
with these springs on his feet,

491
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,959
and he can jump over everything,
houses, walls... stuff.

492
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,837
Nice bit of nonsense.

493
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,477
Guys, who are you provoking?
Why such barking?

494
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,317
Humor.

495
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,834
- Don't provoke anyone!
- We're not provoking anyone.

496
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,917
Oh yeah?

497
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,757
You're not?

498
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,598
Wearing shirts with emblems of a
non-existent state isn't provoking?

499
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,757
That helps a lot, boys.

500
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,436
Where does he get
all the grocery tickets from?

501
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,317
All this butter.

502
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,236
We've got nothing
but margarine and he's got butter.

503
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,157
You want some butter?

504
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,997
Do you now?

505
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,435
Here, have some butter then.

506
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,637
Will you sleep with me?

507
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,957
No.

508
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,637
Good evening.

509
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,551
I'm so stupid.
What am I to do when I love him?

510
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,910
I can't help you with that.
You have to do it yourself, miss.

511
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,558
- Where were you?
- At the cinema.

512
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,952
When will you finally
throw out that Christmas tree?

513
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,953
You have all the time
in the world, sitting at home.

514
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,157
You're his wife?

515
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,717
Hey!

516
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,318
DEATH TO THE OCCU...

517
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,355
Despite an excited atmosphere
over the last few days

518
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,396
marked by a state of emergency

519
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,233
in the Protectorate
of Bohemia and Moravia,

520
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,472
our defenders and representatives
of the great German Reich

521
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,394
have come to listen
to a concert of classical music

522
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,031
which is to honor Deputy
Protector, SS Obergruppenführer

523
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,949
and Police General
Reinhard Heydrich.

524
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:48,070
All eyes are set
upon the Deputy Protector

525
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,355
whose tall figure attracts
attention like a magnet.

526
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,988
Now it looks as
if the event is about to start.

527
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,152
The lights are going down.

528
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,869
The ceremony will open
with the German anthem.

529
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,437
Please.

530
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,909
Papaver somniferum is a poppy.

531
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,869
It produces opium
which isolates into morphine.

532
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,036
It can calm you down,
ease your pain, bring euphoria,

533
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,513
colorful dreams...
Many reasons to give it a taste.

534
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,397
Alright then.

535
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,353
- You know where to inject it?
- Don't worry,

536
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,639
I was a semesterfrom graduation
when the Germans closed the school.

537
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,597
What now?

538
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,397
We wait.

539
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,077
Will you sleep with me?

540
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,557
No.

541
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,032
Attention! Attention!

542
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,716
General Heydrich Has Taken Office

543
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,317
The Marking of Jews Introduced!

544
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,956
Beware of Jews Without Stars

545
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,790
Marriage With a Jewess Is Hell

546
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,951
Jews Out Of Europe!

547
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,477
You may go.

548
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,950
I'd like to assure you I had
nothing to do with any of this.

549
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,838
Mr. Vrana made a mistake.
We let him go

550
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,435
and he interpreted
our generosity as weakness.

551
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,116
Don't make mistakes.
Thas the main thing.

552
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,111
There are many people here
discussing a recent event,

553
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,709
a repeal of martial law,

554
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,550
and the kind attitude of Deputy
Protector, General Heydrich

555
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,035
toward Czech workers.

556
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,869
Mr. Deputy Protector helped us
through great hardship.

557
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,235
He arranged for better wages.

558
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,434
We've gotten much more peace
to meet our obligations

559
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,399
and thanks to him, we've got
the best work conditions ever.

560
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,919
Fellow workers, Mr. Deputy Protector
understands us, the Czech laborer.

561
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,793
May the Reich lead its
victorious fight to the end!

562
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,637
A Jew.

563
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,317
Gas poisoning.

564
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,473
- He's young and handsome.
- He was to be transported.

565
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,113
- What are you doing?
- I thought I could smell the gas.

566
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,159
Name, surname,
official title orfunction,

567
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,237
address and religion.

568
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,117
You need to fill in the same
about your wife.

569
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,112
Add birth
or marriage certificates,

570
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,473
or official abstracts
from state and parish registers

571
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:38,270
for your wife, parents -
hers and yours - and grandparents.

572
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,713
This is how we reference
all our employees.

573
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,997
But my marriage has
no influence on my work.

574
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,640
The new guidance
is non-negotiable.

575
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,716
Once we agreed
we're both in the same boat.

576
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,432
Now we need to agree
we're both rowing with the flow.

577
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,673
You get rid of your wife
or I'll throw you overboard.

578
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,310
Get a divorce.
Is enough as a formality.

579
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,995
- Yes?
- Yourfiancée has arrived.

580
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,877
Hi there!

581
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,437
I won't disturb you.

582
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,713
What happened?
Is he making problems?

583
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,997
The problem is his wife.

584
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,157
Will you sleep with me?

585
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,197
No.

586
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,155
But you can take pictures of me.

587
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,317
Hanka!

588
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,357
Is me!

589
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,152
Will you let me in for a while?

590
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,755
Just like Alice in Wonderland

591
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,030
I close my eyes
and I feel grand

592
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,349
Oh how the world
would suddenly seem

593
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,750
if I could close my eyes
and dream.

594
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,468
Strings of wind
will gently play

595
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,395
All the clouds will cast away...

596
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,197
- Couldn't you turn it off, please?
- Why?

597
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,037
I like it.

598
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,189
Sorry, it reminds me of times when
I had my booze and cigars, a bath

599
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,077
and things were normal.

600
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,229
Why didn't you show up earlier?
We could have figured something out.

601
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,313
Like what? Your husband
is the Reich's mouthpiece.

602
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,519
We'll have to talk
with him anyway.

603
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,468
Mind you, I'm also in hell.

604
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,268
- Do you have a phone at home?
- Yes.

605
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,511
And a radio? Grocery tickets?

606
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,833
Stuff it and stop whining.
Your life is a paradise!

607
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,829
Take a whiff of me.
This is the smell of despair!

608
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,476
May I take a bath?

609
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,677
What if he reports us?

610
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,077
Maybe he'll drown.

611
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,317
What happened to you?

612
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,717
- Nothing.
- Wait!

613
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,993
- What does this mean?
- Nothing. He needed to wash up.

614
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,352
How did he get here at all?
I thought he'd run away.

615
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,749
He had bad papers
so they sent him back.

616
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,115
Get him out. Is my bathroom.

617
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,434
- I'm not taking it. I only used it.
- Shut up. You're not here at all.

618
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,755
Is it clear? He emigrated.
We haven't seen him since.

619
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,798
We've got to help him!
He's a friend.

620
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,869
Les just hide him
until the transpors gone.

621
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,875
He escaped from a transport?

622
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,717
For Goïs sake, Hanka, think!

623
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,236
What will happen if someone
sees him? What if someone has?

624
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,117
We can't throw him out.
He'll be caught!

625
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,479
He'll be caught anyway and put
on another train, and you with him.

626
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,837
If he goes, I go.

627
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,235
He's on your conscience now!

628
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,038
Ladies and Gentlemen,
it is my privilege

629
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,636
to be your host
at this special radio wedding.

630
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,477
My main task is to be the funny
guy so I'll start with a joke.

631
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:46,075
On a gloomy afternoon one of
Prague's female broadcasters said:

632
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,154
And now, dear listeners,
I Want A Baby with Jara Benes.

633
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,838
Of course, she meant
a record by Jara Benes

634
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,435
with a song called
"Mum, I Want A Baby".

635
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,274
A colleague of hers, though,
swiftly sent her this message:

636
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,989
Dear Madam, do you really
insist on Jara Benes?

637
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,951
Long live our newlyweds!

638
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,157
My husband locked me in.

639
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,397
Emil!

640
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,710
Why are you lolling about?
The bride wants to dance with you.

641
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,112
How about asking me
whether I'm happy?

642
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,554
- Are you happy?
- The two of us are realists.

643
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,397
May I?

644
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,799
Let me go! No!

645
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,272
No, not there!

646
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,473
I won't let you destroy
everything I've done for you!

647
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,917
- Emil!
- Be quiet! Is for your own good!

648
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,117
Emil!

649
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,472
What was that?
Are you insane?

650
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,639
How could you let your Jew
show up at my wedding?

651
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,359
- I'm so sorry...
- Spare me your apologies.

652
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,433
You have to make a clear
statement. Come tomorrow at 11.

653
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:27,514
And be on time. I want to deal
with this before my honeymoon.

654
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,673
You're an idiot, Emil. Don't
count on me. I'm not suicidal.

655
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,518
- Good to see you here!
- Yes?

656
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,589
I'm here for work.
I write for the gossip column.

657
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,277
Yes.

658
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,717
Very good.

659
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,917
Please.

660
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,674
- Hi.
- Hey.

661
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,399
- Whas up, honey?
- I overslept.

662
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,155
I shoulïve been there by now.

663
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,630
- I can't explain this.
- Tell them you're getting divorced.

664
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,677
Right...

665
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,237
Emil!

666
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,190
- Is he in there? - Yes.
...towards Stara Liben quarter...

667
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,909
I'm really sorry. I missed
everything and overslept.

668
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,560
- It all just went wrong...
- Speak German.

669
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,918
He was wearing nondescript
dark clothes and a dark hat.

670
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,589
You don't know what happened?

671
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:55,997
A ladies bicycle with a dirty
net was found at the crime scene.

672
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:03,755
The other bicycle used
by the culprits, probably a man's,

673
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,990
dark in color,

674
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,634
is being searched for.

675
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:15,029
If anyone is familiar with
the whereabouts of these items,

676
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,079
please, report
to the nearest police station.

677
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,717
Emil?

678
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,317
Emil!

679
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:03,033
Today, May 27, at 10:30,

680
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,719
an attempt to assassinate
Deputy Protector, Police General,

681
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,157
SS Obergruppenführer
Reinhard Heydrich was made.

682
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:20,429
The Deputy Protector was driving
in his carfrom Panensky Brezan

683
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:26,470
towards Stara Liben quarter
and was just about to turn...

684
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,633
Wait. Wait.

685
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,675
I have to explain something to you.

686
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,718
...28 May at 6:00 AM

687
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,433
announced house
searches commence.

688
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,789
This is not a guest book.
Is a salad!

689
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:02,119
Take this drunken pig home
where he can sleep it off.

690
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,277
House search.

691
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,397
Documents, please.

692
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,510
- You are here alone?
- My wife is here with me.

693
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,597
You wife is a Jew?

694
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,913
- Yes.
- And where do you have her?

695
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,958
For Voices of Our Home
at the microphone, Emil Vrbata.

696
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,877
Okay.

697
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,157
Attention! Attention!

698
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,353
We appeal to citizens
to help with the investigation

699
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,591
of the assassination attempt
against Deputy Protector

700
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,274
and SS Obergruppenführer
Reinhard Heydrich

701
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,832
which was perpetrated
on May 27, 1942 in Prague.

702
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,309
- Any information including...
- Come help me!

703
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,350
...seemingly irrelevant details
can be of great importance.

704
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,077
Attention! Attention!

705
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:40,115
Whoever knows the owners of
the items presented in detail here:

706
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,270
Lady's bicycle, black frame.

707
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,634
Here, it is nickel-coated.

708
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,312
Here, it is painted red.

709
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,913
The net on the back wheel
is quite dirty and tattered.

710
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,157
This beige cap
is dirty and shabby.

711
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:10,389
The dark brown cowhide briefcase
has a glossy front side.

712
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,949
...the criminals
who attempted to assassinate

713
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,518
the highest-ranking official
of the Reich in our territory.

714
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,390
We appeal to those
who today hide the British agents,

715
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,075
whether out of compassion orfear,

716
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,232
to make the appropriate
denouncement.

717
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,878
Is me.

718
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,679
...if he confesses,
would save his family.

719
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,557
Hana!

720
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,029
- What?
- I need to talk to you. Let me in.

721
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,157
Not now.

722
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,637
Hana.

723
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,631
- What are you doing? - I'm here
because you don't come to me.

724
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,678
- Petr...
- You were in the cinema.

725
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,320
I saw you. Why didn't you come?

726
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,951
I can't. Go away, please.

727
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,829
He's at home, isn't he?
He locks you up in here.

728
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,428
Are you content now?
Go away before he comes back.

729
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,235
You said you didn't love him.

730
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,037
Is not so easy, Petr.

731
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,471
I can't keep running away.

732
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,870
I have to go back to reality.

733
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,514
For me, the reality is I love you.

734
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,277
I know.

735
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,157
I know.

736
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,918
- So why aren't you with me?
- I can't.

737
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,431
I have to be with Emil now.

738
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,997
I don't understand you.

739
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,437
Try...

740
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,276
Things have changed.
I can't tell you more.

741
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,517
You'll come back.

742
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,516
- Hey.
- Hi. Why is it so dark here?

743
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,117
Is safer.

744
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,197
Whave you got?

745
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,314
You really think this will help?

746
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,872
Is a cover.
Thas the way they do it.

747
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,314
Emil, you don't believe in me.
You think I don't get it.

748
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,473
- What don't you understand?
- I'm not totally blind.

749
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,799
If you'd just give me a hint, I'd
understand you're up to something.

750
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,677
And I'll keep quiet, promise.
But how about the bicycle?

751
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,435
People keep talking about it.

752
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,630
But they've already got it.
Is on display in the Bata store.

753
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,877
I mean the other one.

754
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,917
This is the bicycle
they're looking for.

755
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,428
Emil, you don't have
to patronize me. I'll help you.

756
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,798
No way! You'll be better off
if you don't know anything.

757
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,992
I'll sort it out.
I'll take care of it.

758
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:47,477
This morning Reich Protector
Reinhard Heydrich,

759
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:55,752
succumbed to injuries
suffered during the deadly attack.

760
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:01,275
On the occasion of the transport
of the Deputy Protector's remains,

761
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,989
before the coverage
of the funeral itself,

762
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:10,234
we will broadcast a radio workers'
oath of loyalty to the German Reich.

763
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,835
If anyone misses this
without a serious reason,

764
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,913
there will be consequences.
Thas all. You can go.

765
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,557
Vrbata.

766
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,314
Though I withdrew you
from the microphone,

767
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,676
our management wants you
to read the oath.

768
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,958
They think it should be read
aloud by a popular person.

769
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,557
This time, be punctual.

770
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:51,478
Any lapse can be regarded
as a nod to the assassination.

771
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,713
Emil? There's someone
waiting for you at the gate.

772
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,235
- What do they want?
- Nothing.

773
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,078
Listen, I hear
if they don't catch anyone,

774
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,113
they'll execute every
tenth Czech. Can it be true?

775
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,917
Why are you asking me?

776
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,351
I know nothing about it
and don't want to talk about it!

777
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,237
You know about Franta?

778
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,917
He was executed.

779
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,076
Why didn't you call?
I thought you were ill.

780
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,193
- Were you ill?
- What are you doing here?

781
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,555
I've brought you your bow tie.

782
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,669
And I also came to tell you
I probably love you.

783
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:02,273
Krista, thas great
but this is not the right time.

784
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,030
- You're not happy?
- Don't you understand the situation?

785
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,998
- What situation?
- I can't talk about it now.

786
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,718
Is dangerous...

787
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,918
We've been looking for you upstairs
the whole time, and here you are.

788
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,710
You have a pretty daughter.

789
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,631
I don't have any daughter.

790
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,197
We know you don't.

791
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,277
Les go.

792
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,792
...Miks Frantisek, Police Sergeant,

793
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:41,031
born 12 March 1915, living in Tabor.

794
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,748
Convicted of conspiring
and abetting the perpetrators

795
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,789
in the assassination
of SS Obergruppenführer Heydrich.

796
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,238
I still see him, how he looked
at me, how they led him out.

797
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,158
Definitely he wanted to go to you
and tell you the truth about us.

798
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,998
- Only he didn't make it.
- When exactly was it? - What?

799
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,116
- What time did they grab him?
- I don't know.

800
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,030
Around noon.

801
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,677
You've got to help me.

802
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,317
Can you keep a secret?

803
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,916
Why are you keeping
a bicycle in an airshaft?

804
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,999
You have to get it out of here.

805
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,877
Good day, Mr. Vrbata.

806
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,437
Good day.

807
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,195
Do you know
why we've called you here?

808
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,750
If they don't find anything
they can't charge him.

809
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,515
Shall I call home...
that I'm not coming?

810
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,152
Why wouldn't you go home?
Have you done something?

811
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,912
Wait a minute. We're needlessly
afraid. This is our bicycle.

812
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,911
What do you mean, your bicycle?

813
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,675
What are you babbling about? This
is the bicycle they're looking for!

814
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,955
Do you know this photograph?

815
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,956
This bicycle is from our house. Emil
took it as he was rushing to work.

816
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,749
What do you mean?
Emil has never taken anything.

817
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,470
He did. He overslept at my place.
So then he just borrowed the bike

818
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,870
and as he was in such a rush
he forgot to bring it back.

819
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,758
He probably
didn't want to tell you.

820
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,992
- What?
- You have to get divorced.

821
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,355
You see, we love each other...

822
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:07,630
You can't take them seriously.
Maybe they look like adults

823
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,154
but really they're still boys.

824
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:15,669
They don't do anything. Only
exercise. Nothing more than that.

825
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:21,312
No one's banned exercising yet.
Is just games.

826
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,637
Turn around.

827
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,794
And? Do they strike you
as if they're playing games?

828
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,188
Okay, gentlemen, les go.

829
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,517
Move it.

830
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,394
Don't you want to tell me something?

831
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,317
I don't know.

832
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,716
I don't know. I haven't
seen them for ages.

833
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,753
And you won't ever see them again.
The paradox is that they think

834
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,149
you informed against them.

835
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,469
But I haven't informed
against anyone.

836
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,357
Thas not essential.

837
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,108
Ultimately, it really
doesn't matter who did it.

838
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,035
You simply have to decide
on which side you stand.

839
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,998
You have the night
to think about it.

840
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,433
Petr. Turn it off!

841
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,149
Is a national day of mourning.
Someone might report you!

842
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,399
Safety with you
is farfrom safe...

843
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,875
I close my eyes
and feel so grand...

844
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,437
Come on. We have to go!

845
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,309
Police here! Open up!

846
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,512
Showing a film is forbidden!

847
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,911
Stop the film immediately!

848
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,997
Run.

849
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,830
I'll take care of this. Run!

850
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,593
Force the door!

851
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,995
- Is a national day of mourning!
- You support the assassination!

852
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,196
You're under arrest!

853
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,677
- Hello?
- Hello?

854
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,597
Hanka?

855
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,519
- Is me. Where are you?
- Is it you, Krista?

856
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,593
I thought I'd never see you
again. I'll come for you.

857
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:57,068
We radio workers swear to
stay unfalteringly loyal

858
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,674
to president Hacha

859
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,993
and our lawful government

860
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:11,191
and assure them
we want to be fully duteous

861
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:17,869
and that we shall
fulfill our duties to the Reich

862
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,035
with the highest faithfulness
and honesty,

863
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:26,756
being aware that theirfight for a
better order in Europe is also ours.

864
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:31,038
We fully agree with Mr. Benes
being called a public enemy

865
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,917
of the Czech nation.

866
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,595
If it were not for instigations
by Mr. Benes, his people abroad,

867
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,195
our country would be
the most blessed and quiet place

868
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,875
- in an otherwise disorderly Europe.
- The sun is setting.

869
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:47,430
Lights of fire, a scent of flowers.

870
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:54,635
It was a hard,
mournful and sad day.

871
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:04,350
At 7pm, when long shadows
are cast over the Castle courtyard,

872
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,596
Deputy Protector,
SS Obergruppenführer

873
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,632
Reinhard Heydrich shall leave
the Prague Castle forever.

874
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,637
Where is Vrbata?

875
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,637
Third floor.
