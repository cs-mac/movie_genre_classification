<i>Episode 35</i>

3
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,840
Was there anyone
that you liked?

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,340
Well...

5
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,560
What about you?

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,810
How was my sister?

7
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,630
Yeon Ah.

8
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,920
You know I really hate
being asked to hire

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,650
somebody that I don't
even know, right?

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,660
I'm sorry to say this

11
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,070
but I was going
to fail her for sure.

12
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,960
Unexpectedly, she can
touch people's heart.

13
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
Strangely, she's very attractive.

14
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,670
Can I look forward to
hearing good news then?

15
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,190
Well... I don't know yet.

16
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,220
Anyway, thank you for coming here

17
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,770
even though you have
a very busy schedule.

18
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,930
Oh, there will be a meeting

19
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,250
only with lead roles soon.

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,150
I want you to come.

21
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,250
Sure.
Why not? Just tell me when.

22
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,040
Bye.

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,910
It's Go.

24
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,800
You will be
so surprised, man.

25
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,100
Hey, Soon Shin.
You're late.

26
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,810
You didn't sleep yet?

27
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,630
Yeah.

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,190
Mi Ryung is in her room.

29
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,230
Do you want me to tell
her to come down?

30
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,600
No. I'm tired.
I'm going to take a rest.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,780
- Good night.
- Okay.

32
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,720
She's stubborn as Mi Ryung.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,170
No wonder she's
Mi Ryung's daughter.

34
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,350
<i>Can I come in?</i>

35
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,410
Are you sleeping already?

36
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,930
Did the audition go well?

37
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,640
Have you heard
from Soon Shin?

38
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,020
She's doing just fine.
I met her a few days ago.

39
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,010
- You met her?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,740
I think she feels awkward
about coming home.

41
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,160
And she's busy
preparing for an audition.

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,240
No, she's not!

43
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,450
If her dad had been alive,
would she have done this?

44
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,270
I bet she looks
down on us.

45
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,660
Grandma, you need to let go
of your anger.

46
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,700
I wouldn't be able to
keep in contact.

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,750
How could I keep in contact

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,460
when you're acting
like you're going to kill me.

49
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,600
Do you even
deserve to say

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,740
that to me, Yoo Shin?

51
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
Don't you know
why the atmosphere

52
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,380
in our house is
so depressing now?

53
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,390
It's not because of Soon Shin.

54
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,910
It's because of you.

55
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,870
Don't you know? Don't you see
the wrinkles

56
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,570
on your mom's face have doubled?

57
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,560
Grandma, don't worry.

58
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
Mrs. Park is going to approve
our marriage soon.

59
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,680
I can see that, you know.

60
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,540
Are you kidding me now?

61
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,130
I thought you had pride
in yourself, at least.

62
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,010
Is Chan Woo so great that
you had to do that?

63
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,490
Aren't you mad at him?

64
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,420
Don't you feel sorry
for your mom?

65
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,990
Let's go.

66
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,120
Bro, you need to invite me
to your new house.

67
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,810
Bro, aren't you going to
have a housewarming?

68
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,500
You should have that since
you moved to a new place.

69
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,430
It has been long time

70
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,860
since you moved
to a new place, you know.

71
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm not having
a housewarming.

72
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,420
I'm going to move.

73
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,110
Why? Is it because of
that married woman?

74
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,830
That married woman?
Watch your mouth.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,510
I'm going to go find a
different place to live.

76
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,130
- You overslept, didn't you?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you want to go
exercise with me?

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,960
You need to start taking
care of your body.

79
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,150
I have to go practice.

80
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,700
Then have breakfast
before you leave.

81
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,900
The maid prepared
rice and soup for you.

82
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,690
It's okay.
I'll be back.

83
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,990
- Doctor Shin.
- Wow.

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,460
- Do you come here to exercise?
- You too?

85
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,240
Yeah. I have been a member
of this club

86
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,470
a long time ago.

87
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,570
Did Soo Jeong recommend
this place to you?

88
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,860
No.
I searched it.

89
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,370
Because I knew
you come here.

90
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,390
You're so funny.

91
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,140
I thought you would play
a static sport like golf.

92
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,790
You exercise at the gym as well.

93
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,510
I like to run actually.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,530
When I was young,
I heard I was good at sports.

95
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,760
How young was that?

96
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,470
When I lived in
the country side.

97
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,240
Because I didn't
have a soccer ball

98
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,530
I had to use a pig urinal
tub to play soccer.

99
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,250
Have you heard of this kind of story?

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Of course. I grew up
in the country side too.

101
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,890
Around this time of season

102
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,700
whenever I got hungry,
I would eat mulberries from the street

103
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,820
and pick apples from trees
and eat them.

104
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,870
But after getting a stomache
from eating them

105
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,490
there were a lot of times
I couldn't go to school for a few days.

106
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,330
Who would say
that's how you lived?

107
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,400
That goes the same
for you, too.

108
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,710
People would think
you grew up in a rich family.

109
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,220
Let's go have lunch.
What do you want to eat?

110
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,380
How about soy bean
paste soup?

111
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,320
I was thinking about
the same thing!

112
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,170
Let's go!

113
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,010
- Mr. Shin.
- How did it go?

114
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,480
The director hasn't
decided yet.

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,450
Really?

116
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,050
You know he's well-known for deciding things
very carefully.

117
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,690
I think it's going
to take some time.

118
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,490
Call him again.

119
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,690
Mr. Shin, why do you
care so much

120
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,190
about Soon Shin's audition?

121
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,390
No, I don't.
Go call him again.

122
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,510
- Hi, Mr. Shin.
- Hi.

123
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,680
- Hi, Mr. Shin.
- Hey.

124
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,990
- Hi, Mr. Shin.
- Hi.

125
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,670
You came early.

126
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,030
Did the result for the
audition come out?

127
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,660
You think you can
pass the audition?

128
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,290
You're so greedy.

129
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,660
This is just the start.

130
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,280
- Did I fail the audition?
- He hasn't decided yet.

131
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,540
Just think that you didn't pass
the audition

132
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,990
and forget about it.

133
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,180
Don't be so disappointed.
You can prepare for another one.

134
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,980
Okay.

135
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,870
You need to go
somewhere with me.

136
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,030
What?

137
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,220
You want to know too, right?

138
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,980
Let's go find out.

139
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,130
To where?

140
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,320
So you want to know
whether you passed

141
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,010
the audition or not?

142
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:26,610
How is it?
Is she going to pass?

143
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,810
Is she going to fail?

144
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,970
Courage and determination.

145
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,530
It seems very mild and
meek but it can be a lion.

146
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,870
This card symbolizes an
iron will and strength.

147
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,630
- It also means that you...
- So is she going to pass or not?

148
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,510
Miss, are you dating somebody?

149
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,260
Pardon? No.
I don't have a boyfriend.

150
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,620
This card symbolizes very
noble and pure love.

151
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,980
The guy is very close to you.

152
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,390
Dude, I asked you
if she will pass or not

153
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,590
and you're talking nonsense.

154
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,500
So is she going to pass?

155
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,750
Who's this guy?

156
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,940
Is he your uncle?
Your brother?

157
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,020
He's a CEO of my agency.

158
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,400
CEO?

159
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,180
You're very impetuous.

160
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,710
Whether she passes the audition
or not isn't important.

161
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,630
I told you before.
It's an iron will.

162
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,220
If you're trying to live,
you will die.

163
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,110
If you're trying to die,
you will live.

164
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,390
Do you think being nervous,
would make things work?

165
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,900
Can you get out, Mister?
My spiritual energy is declining.

166
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,330
- Pick one more card.
- One more?

167
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,570
He's such a swindler.

168
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,680
He can't even guess
what we asked right.

169
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,200
He shouldn't be a
fortuneteller.

170
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,710
Who is it?

171
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,230
Are you talking
to yourself?

172
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,100
He said there's someone
who likes me.

173
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,700
He said the guy is close to me.

174
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,230
Close to me?
I don't have any guys close to me.

175
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,900
A man that's close to me?
I don't have anyone.

176
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,360
Is it...

177
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,340
Boss?

178
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,660
What am I saying now?
Don't tell him I said that.

179
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,200
Since there's a guy
close to me.

180
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,470
He's the only one
that I can think of.

181
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,270
I must be crazy.

182
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,330
That guy isn't a fortuneteller.
Can't you tell?

183
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,470
He had the word
'swindler' written on his face.

184
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,890
A real fortuneteller
wouldn't act like that.

185
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,290
You said this was a famous place.

186
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,610
Didn't you search it
before you came?

187
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,100
Yes, I did.

188
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,060
Maybe it changed.
Or maybe his spiritual energy declined.

189
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,310
What a waste.

190
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,160
Who's the guy anyway.

191
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,920
What's up?

192
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,390
What?

193
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,210
Okay.
Thanks.

194
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,950
Are we not going?

195
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,890
What are you doing?

196
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,370
You passed the audition.

197
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,550
What?

198
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,090
Soon Shin,
you passed the audition.

199
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,970
Really?

200
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,110
Oh my God.
Oh my God!

201
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,180
- Are you that happy.
- Yeah.

202
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,350
Me too.

203
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,320
You did a good job.

204
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,710
Cheers.

205
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,150
Finally, we have a star
in our restaurant.

206
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,650
Come on, Boss.

207
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,610
- I was just lucky.
- No, it wasn't that.

208
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,900
It's the result of
practicing so hard.

209
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,170
You helped me a lot.

210
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,650
Thank you for saying that.

211
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,230
Congratulations.

212
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,480
It's my treat today.

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,510
- Why?
- Why not?

214
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,280
She might be a model

215
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,030
for my restaurant's promotion,
you know.

216
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,940
You said you're playing
a would-be singer role, right?

217
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,560
Yeah. She's a cooking assistant

218
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,320
who keeps going to singing auditions.

219
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,380
Can you teach me how to cook?

220
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,860
You're a would-be singer.
Why cook?

221
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,960
There are some scenes
where I have to cook.

222
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,550
I want to look real.

223
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,620
It's an honor to me.

224
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,210
Yeah. If you decide
to do something

225
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,820
you should do it right.

226
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
That's so Soon Shin.

227
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,510
Many people want me
to teach

228
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,940
how to cook these days.

229
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,770
Why do you want
to learn that?

230
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,530
Just focus on acting.

231
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,960
Who's the main lead role?

232
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,200
Choi Yeon Ah.

233
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,250
Yeon Ah?

234
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,000
Hi, Yeon Ah.

235
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,140
- How did it go?
- She got the role.

236
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,610
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,380
I got the call from
the assistant director.

238
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,690
Lee Soon Shin got the role.

239
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,050
Congratulations.
You get to be in a drama with your sister.

240
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,380
Thanks.

241
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,690
Are you on the way
to my house?

242
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,190
Mother Park.

243
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,630
Guess what this is?
I heard you like wheat buns.

244
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,560
This bun is really famous.

245
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,440
It tastes like the original.

246
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,640
Come on.
I'll steam it for you.

247
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,850
You're so brazen.
How can you act like this

248
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,080
without even
blinking your eyes?

249
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,060
Mother Park?

250
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,570
Don't give it to me.

251
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,890
Just go to your house
and give it to your grandmother.

252
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,380
Mother Park, come on.

253
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,790
What's wrong with you?

254
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,460
I didn't tell you to buy that.

255
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,290
This happened because
you're doing something

256
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,570
you usually don't do.

257
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,590
You think I don't know you?

258
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,020
You should've been
nice to me before.

259
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,740
Get up.

260
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,060
Go home.
I'll call you.

261
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,120
I said go home.

262
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,300
Are you going at me now?

263
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,600
Are you mad at me
because I shoved her?

264
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,090
Mom, I'm just going to marry
her without your permission.

265
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,950
What?

266
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,370
If you keep opposing to our marriage

267
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,320
we'll register our marriage
and move out together.

268
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,030
What did you say?

269
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,280
Do you even have the money
for a place?

270
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,110
I can rent an apartment.

271
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,420
If I can't, I will just
live in Yoo Shin's house.

272
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm sorry. No matter how hard
I think about it

273
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
this seems to be
the only way.

274
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,670
I don't think you will
ever like Yoo Shin.

275
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,870
And I'm never going
to give up on her.

276
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,430
There's no other way.

277
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,790
You...

278
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,080
How could you say
that to me?

279
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,250
Honey, is that
really our son?

280
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,330
I knew this would happen.

281
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,500
You're going to lose him forever,
like this.

282
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,410
Hey, honey.
Give me a glass of water.

283
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,760
Hello, sir.

284
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,310
- Mom.
- Soon Shin.

285
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,820
- What's up?
- Mom...

286
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,970
<i>I...</i>

287
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,610
- Did something happen?
- Mom, I...

288
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,940
<i>I passed the audition!</i>

289
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,460
What?
Really?

290
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,270
That's so great, Soon Shin!

291
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,660
Mom, I can't believe if
this is a dream or not.

292
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,120
I couldn't even sleep last night.

293
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,080
I am in the broadcasting
station now.

294
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,500
I came here
to meet the director.

295
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,150
- I kind of believe it after I got a call...
- You can go ahead.

296
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,450
Mom, isn't this so great?
Huh?

297
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,180
<i>I'm so glad to hear that.
Soon Shin</i>

298
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,750
<i>I'm kind of busy right now.</i>

299
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,510
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

300
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,520
What?
Oh, you're busy?

301
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,510
Okay.
I'll call you later...

302
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,670
Soon Shin.

303
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,580
I guess you just talked
to Mom on the phone.

304
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,440
Can I talk to you
using the familiar form?

305
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
Yeah.

306
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,610
I heard the good news.
Congratulations.

307
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,620
Thank you.

308
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,010
I'm so happy for you.

309
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,020
Now we're going to be
in the same drama.

310
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,120
Do you best so you don't
disgrace me and Mom.

311
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,250
Okay?

312
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,480
You're on the way
to see the director, right?

313
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,470
Good thing.
Let's go together.

314
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,470
Since you two beautiful
siblings are sitting together

315
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,850
the room got really bright.

316
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,370
Director, thank you so much.

317
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,230
I was so happy when I heard
she passed the audition.

318
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,050
Your sister cares
about you a lot.

319
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,220
Looks good.

320
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,360
Don't worry about
her acting.

321
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,990
I'll take care of her.

322
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,060
I liked your emotional feeling
when you sang the song.

323
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,900
You said somebody you like
used to sing that song, right?

324
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,820
Who is that person?
Your first love?

325
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,470
My late father.

326
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,200
Ah, I see.

327
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,410
That's why it touched
my heart.

328
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,260
Anyway, let's do our best.

329
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,060
Don't hold your head high

330
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,330
just because of your connection
to Actress Song Mi Ryung.

331
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,000
Your skill is the most important
in this field of work.

332
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay.

333
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,950
Director, please take
good care of my sister.

334
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,090
Don't worry about it.

335
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,570
Then I'll see you at rehearsal.

336
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,980
Okay.

337
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,430
Let me help you.

338
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,900
- I'll carry it.
- No, it's okay.

339
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,570
Did you hear what I said
the other day?

340
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,400
That was...

341
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,390
That was a joke.

342
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,420
I must've been out of my mind

343
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,460
because of the hot weather.

344
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,010
Okay.
I'll take that as a joke.

345
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,870
Um...

346
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,820
I think I'm going to have to
quit getting lessons from you.

347
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,830
I've gotten busy lately.

348
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,120
I think I'm going to stop
studying for a while.

349
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,630
Oh, I'm also looking
for a new home.

350
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,960
I think I'm giving
you pressure.

351
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm very sorry.

352
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:02,370
I think I'm making you
feel uncomfortable so...

353
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,180
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,590
Let's go.

355
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,500
Hey, Hye Shin.

356
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,900
Why didn't you
answer my call?

357
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,460
Mrs. Han...

358
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,690
You're the owner of the bakery

359
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,700
who kicked me out, aren't you?

360
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,230
What kind of relationship is it

361
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,480
between the both of you?

362
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,050
Now that I look at it

363
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,850
you made me look like a fool!

364
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,310
No, Mrs. Han.

365
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,490
Then what is it?

366
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,990
Now that I look at it,
you're such a scary woman.

367
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,790
It hasn't been that long
since you got a divorce.

368
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,260
You're seeing another man already?

369
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,050
You told me not to send
you the child expenses

370
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,760
because of this man?

371
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,090
- Excuse me.
- You be quiet.

372
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,830
You don't have a right to get
involved in this conversation.

373
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,830
It's not that.

374
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,160
You come here.
We need to talk.

375
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,470
Mrs. Han, I don't have anything
to talk about with you.

376
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,010
Why? Because you got caught
right in front of my face?

377
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,950
This is ridiculous.

378
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,550
The say the quiet ones
are the most conniving.

379
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,180
And you are the one.

380
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,380
- How could you say that?
- Don't say anything.

381
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Just follow me.

382
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,650
Grandma, don't do this
to my mom!

383
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,590
Woo Joo.

384
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,270
Go!
Leave now!

385
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,650
Long time no see, Woo Joo.

386
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,560
We rent out one of the
rooms in our house to him.

387
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,020
You're misunderstanding her.

388
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,170
Oh, really?

389
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,150
Grandma, why are you doing
this to my mom?

390
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,220
What did she do wrong?

391
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,120
Why are you doing this to her?

392
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,310
It's not that, Woo Joo.

393
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,570
I have something to discuss
with your mom.

394
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,030
No, you don't.
Just leave.

395
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,620
Mom, let's go.

396
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,330
Come on.

397
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,720
Hey, call me later.
Okay?

398
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:43,480
Oh my God. How did she become so fierce
after all this time?

399
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,660
This isn't good.
How did her mom educate her?

400
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,960
My son...

401
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,360
A relationship contract?

402
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Rule number one: If our families find out
about the relationship

403
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
we're going to break up.

404
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,100
Rule number two:
Respect each other's jobs.

405
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,910
Don't come to the work place
without telling first.

406
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,080
Rule number three: Don't
control each other's privacy.

407
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,730
Don't ask why one doesn't
call the other

408
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,800
what time one came home,
who one met with.

409
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,170
What's this?
It's ridiculous.

410
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:07,580
Lee Yoo Shin!
How could she treat my son like this?

411
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,800
I heard you're sick.

412
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
I bought some rice porridge, Mrs. Park.

413
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,510
You come sit here.

414
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,120
Here.

415
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,540
This is...

416
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,580
Where did you find this?

417
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,210
This is why I don't like you.

418
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,730
How could you make my
son sign this contract?

419
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,730
There was a reason to do this
at that time.

420
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,450
I didn't know I would
marry him back then.

421
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,420
You're going to control my son
like a slave if you marry him.

422
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,580
Am I right?

423
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,610
Don't say that.
That's so mean.

424
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,990
So I'm going to make you
sign this contract too.

425
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,940
Pardon?

426
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,630
If you sign this contract

427
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,280
then I'll approve your marriage.
Read it.

428
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,140
What do you think?
You think you can take it?

429
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,320
- Mrs. Park...
- Why?

430
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,430
Letters are too small to read or something?

431
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,910
Then I'll read it out
loud for you.

432
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,740
Contract.

433
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,790
Rule number one: I, Lee Yoo Shin,
will respect

434
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,200
and obey Park Chan Woo forever.

435
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,260
Respect?

436
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,270
Obey...

437
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,840
Rule number two: I, Lee Yoo Shin,
will respect

438
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,860
and obey in-law's family and live with them.

439
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,500
And support my in-law parents forever.

440
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,580
Mrs. Park, are you telling me to live here?

441
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:07,060
Yeah. I can't let Chan Woo
get controlled by you.

442
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,050
I'm going to teach you
how to respect people

443
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,540
and how to do housekeeping.

444
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,830
Here. Take this home
and think about it.

445
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,710
You can either choose
to break up with him

446
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,200
or sign the contract.
It's one or the other.

447
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,290
Understand?

448
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,710
Hey...

449
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,280
I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

450
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,540
Don't be.

451
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,270
Hye Shin, would you
come here

452
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,800
and punch
this sandbag?

453
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,390
Like this.
Try it.

454
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,570
I hung this here
so you can punch it

455
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,020
when this kind of stuff happens.

456
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,080
Even an idiot like me says
what he wants to in life.

457
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,160
But... how come a smart person like you,
endures everything?

458
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,570
You know...

459
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:50,590
Everybody needs a single blow
in their lives sometimes.

460
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,000
Endure over and over...

461
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,020
It's not a great thing
in the long run.

462
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,720
Why do you have
to live like that?

463
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,050
For what?

464
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,830
If you want to scream,
then do it.

465
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,470
If you feel heavy
with worries...

466
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,520
Like this.

467
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,900
Don't put up
with them.

468
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,750
I must be crazy.

469
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,290
Why did I move in here?

470
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,650
What?

471
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,890
Me?

472
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,570
Are you telling me to be
Soon Shin's manager?

473
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,080
Yeah. You're the most
competent person here.

474
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,730
That's true.

475
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:53,250
That's why I'm telling you to do it.
So be her manager.

476
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,040
Mr. Shin, do you hate me?

477
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,240
I've always hated you.

478
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,370
I'm going to see how you do.

479
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,890
Then I'm going to decide
if you can be my assistant again.

480
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,600
Look for her stylist
and make-up artist.

481
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,690
Make a team
and report it to me.

482
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,390
Okay.

483
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,310

00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,570
Wow, who is this?

485
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,210
Actress Lee.

486
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,570
Are you not practicing?

487
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm going to.

488
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,740
I have something to tell you.

489
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,210
What is it?

490
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,830
Thank you, Mr. Shin.

491
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,500
What?

492
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,920
You're acting like you became
a famous actress already.

493
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,810
This was just the first step.

494
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,660
I know.
I know.

495
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,530
But this is a big deal to me.

496
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,210
I never dreamed this would
happen in my life.

497
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,660
I like how you appreciate everything.

498
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
So what is it
you want to tell me?

499
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,340
This.

500
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,080
You...

501
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,530
How did you get it?

502
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,870
It was so hard to find this.

503
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,380
I had to search every website to buy it.

504
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,030
It's so embarrassing.

505
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,960
No, it's not.

506
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,990
Mr. Shin,
you were a singer.

507
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,360
You had good skills.

508
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,950
Don't make fun of me.

509
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm not making fun of you.

510
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,470
I really liked it.

511
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,120
So I want your autograph.

512
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,310
I really became your fan.

513
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,670
Thank you for encouraging
me all the time.

514
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,750
I'm really going
to try my best.

515
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,990
And trust yourself.

516
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,220
I trust you.

517
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,380
You think I would be
impressed by this?

518
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,120
What is your name, Miss?

519
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,460
It's Lee Soon Shin.

520
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,380
<i>I'm not making fun of you.
I really liked it.</i>

521
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,140
<i>So I want your autograph.</i>

522
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,030
<i>I really became your fan.</i>

523
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,820
What are you doing, Joon Ho?

524
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,570
When did you come in?

525
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,830
What's this?

526
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,010
It's your old album.

527
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,340
The one that didn't
even sell at all.

528
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,790
Get out.

529
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,740
- You're acting weird.
- What is?

530
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,010
You're snickering a lot, lately.

531
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,630
Did something good happen to you?

532
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,280
Just get out.

533
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,730
You were so quiet
for a few days.

534
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,350
Did you overcome
the break up already?

535
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,030
Why did you enter without knocking?

536
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,180
You purchased a new
membership at a health club.

537
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,690
It was the magazine about
the club so I opened it.

538
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,690
Why do you open my mail
without my permission?

539
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,370
Isn't this where Mi Ryung
also goes to exercise?

540
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,420
Does that matter?

541
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,640
Why doesn't it?
I really don't understand.

542
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,990
Why didn't you tell me about the
model thing and this earlier?

543
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,400
Stop talking nonsense.
Why are you being so sensitive?

544
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,170
This is something to be sensitive about.

545
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,540
Don't you have
other things to do?

546
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,850
You got tired of cooking so
you're doubting your husband now?

547
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,500
What?

548
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,120
Please get out.
I have to work. I'm busy.

549
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,830
How can you be
so busy everyday?

550
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,300
Is there nothing else to say

551
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,030
besides telling me that you're busy?

552
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,530
There has to be some of kind connection
in order to talk with you.

553
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:13,240
You either cook or gossip
about celebrities everyday.

554
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,730
Or you shop with Yi Jeong.

555
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,980
Or gossip about your friends.
How can that be fun to me?

556
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,000
Is that why?

557
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,260
But there are things you can
talk about with Mi Ryung?

558
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,720
What's wrong with you nowadays?

559
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,240
Do you have a delusional jealousy
towards your husband?

560
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,540
A delusional jealousy
towards my husband?

561
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,140
That's enough.
Let's just stop talking.

562
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,150
What's the use in talking about it?

563
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,100
My mouth would only hurt.

564
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,310
What are you doing, Mom?

565
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,260
Nothing.

566
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,460
Did you fight with dad?

567
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,090
No.

568
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,960
Mom, don't you think
Joon Ho is acting weird?

569
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,720
I don't think he's dating Yeon Ah.

570
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,140
Is he seeing
a different woman?

571
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,750
A different woman?
Who?

572
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:23,090
I don't know.
He snickers a lot.

573
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,510
Seems like he's dating somebody.

574
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,350
But I don't think that's Yeon Ah.

575
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,140
Hey, don't worry him.
Worry about yourself.

576
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,350
Are you going to live like this?

577
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,500
Go on a blind date.

578
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,820
You should get a job or something.

579
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,380
Until when are you going
to follow me around?

580
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,910
Mom, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

581
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,870
Why are you yelling at me
all of a sudden?

582
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,730
Hey.

583
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,690
What's this?

584
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,590
I'm sorry it's late.
It's your birthday present.

585
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,600
Are you still mad at me?

586
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,870
I don't know why but I
forget things these days.

587
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,740
Please lighten up.

588
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,530
Yeon Ah, I'm kind of disappointed
in you too, honestly.

589
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,090
How come you haven't visited
my house for weeks?

590
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,940
I told you I've been busy.

591
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,000
Even if you're busy, don't
you have time to stop by?

592
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,330
You can help Soon Shin practice
for auditions and get along with her.

593
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,210
She already passed the audition.
What else is there to prepare?

594
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,190
What are you talking about?
She passed?

595
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,770
She passed the audition?

596
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,310
Didn't she tell you
she passed?

597
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,550
I asked the director a favor.

598
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,930
It's the drama I'll be shooting too.

599
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,380
Really?

600
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,530
Thanks, Yeon Ah.

601
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,750
She hasn't told you that she
passed the audition yet?

602
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,380
She had a meeting with me
and the director yesterday.

603
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:26,210
'Mom, I passed it.' I think
she called her mom.

604
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,210
I guess she meant
the other mom.

605
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,950
- Is Soon Shin home?
- Yeah.

606
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,590
She just came home.

607
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,460
We need to talk.

608
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,240
What is it?

609
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,840
I heard you passed the audition.
Why didn't you tell me?

610
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,500
Why didn't you
tell me you passed?

611
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,450
Because you're going
to find out anyway.

612
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,440
You think that makes sense?

613
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,590
I have to practice my guitar.
Please get out.

614
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,580
If you were going
to keep acting like this

615
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,970
why did you decide
to come into this house?

616
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,670
Did you come here
so you can make me suffer?

617
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,270
I came here
because you told me to.

618
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,520
If you want me to leave,
I'll leave.

619
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,660
What?

620
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:58,010
How can you do this to me?
How can you be so spiteful?

621
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,690
Where are you going?

622
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,630
I'm going for a walk.

623
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:28,440
Mother. We have good
news about Soon Shin.

624
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,420
How about inviting her over
and having dinner together?

625
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:40,990
Let's buy some pork belly and
throw a BBQ party for her.

626
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:45,060
I'm planning to invite her tomorrow.
You're okay with this, right?

627
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:49,240
Do you make decisions
with my permission?

628
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,580
If you want to do it, do it.
If you want to invite her, then invite her.

629
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,350
Please let go
of your anger now.

630
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,890
I think she feels so sorry

631
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,770
that it's awkward for her
to come here.

632
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,240
Please be nice to her, Mother.

633
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,350
Why would I be nice to her?

634
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,010
She hasn't done anything that I liked.

635
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,120
She betrayed her family.

636
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,080
She decided to go live
with her real mother

637
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,140
and wants to become an actress just like her mother.

638
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,580
Is it something I should
congratulate her for?

639
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,840
Do we have to throw
a party for that?

640
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,850
We should congratulate her.
It's hard to become an actress.

641
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,950
She has wanted
to become an actress.

642
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,020
It doesn't matter if
she's with her mother or not.

643
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,220
I'm just so happy
for her now.

644
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,840
Her voice was so excited.

645
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,250
I bet she wants us
to congratulate her the most.

646
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,030
I'm going to invite
her tomorrow, okay?

647
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,290
Please don't be so mean to her, Mother.
Okay?

648
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,280
I told you to do
whatever you want.

649
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,880
Oh my God.
She's just too nice.

650
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,270
She's ridiculous.

651
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:37,710
<i>[Mom]</i>

652
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,970
She must be really busy.

653
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,030
<i>Soon Shin, I'm sending you a
text since you're so busy.</i>

654
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,830
<i>Congratulations on passing the audition.</i>

655
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,410
<i>Do you want to come over
for dinner tomorrow?</i>

656
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,120
<i>I'm throwing a party for you.</i>

657
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,690
<i>[Delete]</i>

658
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
You weren't sleeping yet?

659
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,490
You said you quit drinking
but you're drinking again.

660
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,050
Mind your own business.

661
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,180
Where's Soon Shin?
Did she go out?

662
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,360
I don't care.

663
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,950
I heard she passed the audition.

664
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,060
Where did you hear that?

665
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,970
I got a call from
Gabi Agency.

666
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,540
I heard they're making
a team for Soon Shin.

667
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,380
I think Mr. Shin
is working so hard for her.

668
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:24,250
I guess she is very talented.
She got that from you.

669
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:31,320
I'm so proud of her.
How did she pass the audition at once?

670
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,650
Il Do.

671
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,690
Let's throw a party
at our house tomorrow.

672
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,450
A party?

673
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,050
Yeah.
A party.

674
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,600
My daughter passed
the difficult audition.

675
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,750
Shouldn't I throw a
party for her as her mother?

676
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,460
Let's invite the staff that's going
to work with Soon Shin

677
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,570
along with her friends
and have a party tomorrow.

678
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,240
Tomorrow?
Don't you think that's too soon?

679
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,280
Why is that soon?
We can do it.

680
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,950
Call people right now.

681
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,930
Hire a buffet caterer and check
the director's schedule.

682
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,310
But isn't tomorrow
too soon?

683
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:15,710
Does it have to
be tomorrow?

684
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,680
Yeah. It has to be tomorrow.

685
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,490
We're doing it tomorrow.

686
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,100
Oh, who else is
in that drama?

687
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,940
I'm going to tell other actresses

688
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,500
to take a good care
of my daughter too.

689
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,770
Welcome.

690
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,530
It's really spicy.

691
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,920
This is a very fresh one.

692
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,600
It's kind of expensive.

693
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,340
No. I need one more pound.

694
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,770
Did something good happen
to your family?

695
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,690
Yeah.

696
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,900
My daughter became an actress.

697
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,250
She passed an audition,
so I'm throwing a party for her.

698
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,930
Really?
Congratulations.

699
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,840
- I'll give you some more.
- Thank you.

700
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,730
I got a call from Mr. Hwang.

701
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,460
He's inviting people for dinner
at Mi Ryung's house.

702
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,630
Teacher Song is throwing
a party to congratulate

703
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,840
Soon Shin
for passing the audition.

704
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,250
- A party?
- Yeah.

705
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:33,180
She invited all the staff, the
director, and main leading roles.

706
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,370
Why is she making such a
big deal out of this?

707
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,550
Why is she doing that?

708
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,970
What's wrong with that?
It's good.

709
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,640
We get to have some
nice food there.

710
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,830
You're going, right?

711
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,980
Wow. That's a lot of food.

712
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,540
Why did you make
so much food?

713
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,600
She cooked all day
for Soon Shin.

714
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,640
Didn't you go
work today, Mom?

715
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,070
I told Gil Ja that I won't work
for a few days.

716
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,060
Why?
Why?

717
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,420
Are you kidding me now?

718
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,070
I'm not going work
until you figure things out with Chan Woo.

719
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,780
Nice. I didn't want you
to work there anyway.

720
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,740
You should just quit there, Mom.

721
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,600
How are things going anyway?

722
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,070
I don't know. She's so much
more spiteful than I thought.

723
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:33,160
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know. It should go well.

724
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,930
Anyway, Soon Shin is so lucky.

725
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,480
Even if she left us like this

726
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,110
Mom is having a party for her.

727
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,930
Don't be so mean to her
when she comes.

728
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:45,570
Just congratulate her.

729
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:46,940
Okay?

730
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,520
Okay, Mom.
Okay.

731
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,340
Why isn't she calling?

732
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,970
That's such a nice wine.

733
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:09,120
Switch the position
with this one.

734
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,630
Hey, Soon Shin.

735
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,960
Is today
a special day?

736
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,600
It's a celebration party.

737
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,970
A celebration party?

738
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,470
Yeah. I invited some people
to congratulate you

739
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,310
on passing the audition.

740
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,440
Soon Shin.

741
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,130
Chan Mi.

742
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:54,950
I'm Park Chan Mi, also Soon Shin's stylist.

743
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,390
And her friend.

744
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,170
I see.

745
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,860
What's going on?

746
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,980
Aren't you surprised?

747
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,300
I didn't tell you to surprise you.

748
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,280
Your agency offered me the
position so I said I would do it.

749
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,200
Why didn't you call me?

750
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,580
Soon Shin, go change your clothes.

751
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,490
- I prepared a dress for you.
- What?

752
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:21,110
Go get changed.

753
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,250
- Go have a seat.
- Thank you.

754
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,260
What time is it?

755
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,790
She's very late.

756
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,990
She must be busy now.

757
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,730
Let's just start
eating first.

758
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,360
She should've called
and let us know

759
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,850
if she's going to be late.

760
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,930
Let's roast the pork.
Woo Joo must be hungry.

761
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,590
Okay, Grandma.

762
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,830
<i>[Song Mi Ryung]</i>

763
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,350
- Hello.
- Hi, Mrs. Lee.

764
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,640
<i>Did you hear the good news from Soon Shin?</i>

765
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,540
Ah...Yeah.

766
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,100
Her director came to my house

767
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,750
and is having a meeting with Soon Shin now.

768
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,200
Soon Shin said she's having a sore throat.

769
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,310
Do you still have some
balloon flower tea?

770
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,780
Balloon flower tea?

771
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,490
Yeah. The one you
made for Soon Shin.

772
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,400
I think my maid
accidentally threw it away.

773
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,790
Can you bring
that for her now?

774
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,730
- Now?
- Yes, now.

775
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,710
She's practicing
her acting now.

776
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,740
I want her to do well
in front of the director.

777
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,750
Please bring it now.
I'd really appreciate that.

778
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:06,300
What are you doing here?
Everyone is here.

779
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,450
Really?

780
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:13,830
Thank you for spending
your time here with us.

781
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:17,110
As her mother, I'm really happy

782
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,500
that she got a great
role in this drama.

783
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:28,470
I'm having this party for my
daughter and for people here.

784
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:32,740
Here.
Shall we all have a toast?

785
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,430
Cheers.

786
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,670
Congratulations, Soon Shin.
Thank you, Director.

787
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,760
Mom, isn't Soon Shin coming?

788
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,160
Yeah. She said she can't come.
I think she's really busy.

789
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,750
- Oh my gosh.
- Go eat. I have to go somewhere.

790
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,040
Go where?

791
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,120
Our writer, too.
Here.

792
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,590
Enjoy the food.

793
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,330
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

794
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,190
When is Mr. Shin coming?

795
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,550
He'll come soon.

796
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:37,460
Soon Shin, the food here
is so delicious.

797
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,910
I think these are
from a hotel.

798
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,290
- Can I take some home?
- Yeah.

799
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,320
Are you also good at singing,
Teacher Song?

800
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,090
Singing?

801
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:55,560
I wasn't sure at first but the way
Soon Shin sings has emotion.

802
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,560
I heard that from Director too.
Can I hear her singing?

803
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,410
Why not?

Can you go to Soon Shin's room
