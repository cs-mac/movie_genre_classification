What's with sudden interest

So that I can take your job

I don't think she's kidding.

As if she ever does!

34
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,320
Studying is just an excuse
I need some time off.

Plus, there is
my daughter's operation.

59

- Forget it!

What about the show?

64

Don't you know how busy I am?

65
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,050
I'm not a family babysitter.

66

Even Jun-young had me pick up

She's still up?!

70
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,870
Your mom is angry
because you're still up.

71
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,070

A single tap for no and
3 for yes, is it?

95
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,980
Isn't it better
to just text each other?

96
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,070
I don't want her
to forget how to talk

97
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,380
She's putting up with so much...

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,320
So many operations.

99
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,090
Will she get a better result

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680

Out in plain sight...

118
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,080
It scares me to raise a daughter

It's obvious he's stone drunk.

Is that why you have
those broad shoulders?

161
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,140
She won't be using this
number from tomorrow.

162
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,810
<i>Saved</i>

163
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,850
What do you see in her?
She a mom, you know?

164
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,720
She has... a divine voice.

165
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,690
Real soft up in your ears.

166
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,200
Like a soft tongue?

167
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,710
You're dirty.

168
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,410
I'll give you a shout later.
Go to the bathroom.

169
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,110
Switch off the cell...
Do it now

170
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,710
He is a just fan.
We can't change him now.

171
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,050
Did you see this?

172
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,220
Look at those muscles!

173
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,060
There is only a fine line between
a fan and a stalker.

174
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,030
Let your guard down and
they'll walk all over you

175
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,630
It's your fans that keep
you on your job.

176
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,730
Make sure you get that
to the new girl as well.

177
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,970
The minute you let them
take control, it's over.

178
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,380
Whatever you say!

179
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,880
Totally oblivious of this.

180
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,290
How about coming in
on time for once?

181
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,450
- What a beautiful night!
- Hi!

182
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,190
It's the last show.
You could have come early

183
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,490
Coffee?

184
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,690
...and doughnuts! Oops!

185
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,700
Go on.

186
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,500
They're fattening

187
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,160
You said I should
put on some weight

188
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
Did you check the CDs?

189
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,300
Am I your maid?

190
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,610
- My sweetheart
- Cut it out!

191
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,910
Thank you for this!

192
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,610
It's nothing

193
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,050
Let me see

194
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,810
I'm impressed!

195
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,920
It is quite hard to take in but

196
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,020
it's our dear friend's last show.

197
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,230
In 5 minutes.

198
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,680
What's gotten into him?

199
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,390
Sam?

200
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,600
Sam!

201
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,210
Sam!

202
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,210
Where are you?

203
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,620
You scared me.

204
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,960
You'll wake Eun-soo up
if you scream like that.

205
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,270
I said stop screaming.

206
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,780
Stop!

207
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,090
What do you want?

208
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,390
Shhh...

209
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,960
Eun-soo!

210
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,490
<i>Have you ever had</i>
<i>coffee with an angel?</i>

211
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,120
<i>This program is brought to you</i>

212
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
<i>by angels' choice of coffee,</i>
<i>Angel-in-us</i>

213
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:01,710
3... 2... 1!

214
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,510
Did you have another
movie-like day?

215
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,530
Hi, this is Ko Sun-young
from Midnight FM.

216
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:31,820
Tonight will be the precious
last time that I share with you.

217
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:40,940
<i>I hope the next two hours will</i>
<i>be an unforgettable experience.</i>

218
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,340
Our last...

219
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,720
I never thought I would
ever say these words.

220
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,590
Tonight we're going to
talk about farewells.

221
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,590
There she goes again!
Why bother writing up the script?

222
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,760
If I were to pick the most
beautiful farewells in the movie.

223
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,100
What's wrong with you today?

224
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,470
I would choose last scene
from Casablanca.

225
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm a bit of a romantic.

226
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,710
At the foggy Moroccan airport.

227
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,440
Two people stand facing each other
unable to speak their mind.

228
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,210
Ilsa boarding the plane and
Rick watching on.

229
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,220
A farewell scene that was
as beautiful as it was heartbreaking.

230
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,020
What would our farewell be like?

231
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,930
It's a text from a listener.

232
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
It says

233
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,640
Love that lasts the longest is
love that never returns.

234
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,440
I suppose that parting
could be...

235
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,450
<i>a way to preserve your love forever.</i>

236
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,350
The queen of improvisation!

237
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,450
What is this?

238
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,090
The reason why so many fans
still remember James Dean.

239
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,690
<i>Somerset Maugham</i>
could be because of

240
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,490
his unexpected early farewell

241
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,500
A listener who sent in
the Somerset Maugham quote.

242
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,010
<i>You forgot to give us your name</i>
<i>but thank you.</i>

243
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,510
You could call this the love
theme song of "Casablanca"

244
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,810
'As time goes by'

245
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,010
They won't notice that
this was an accident?

246
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,210
How could they?
When she's that smooth.

247
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,820
Take it easy, relax!

248
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,820
You nervous? Forgetting to
switch off your cell.

249
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,520
It's officially the final show.

250
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,690
Even Ms. Perfect is making mistakes.

251
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,820
I've never seen her make
a mistake since her first broadcast.

252
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,370
It's your fault.

253
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,030
She's low on caffeine.

254
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,830
I could use a cup of coffee.

255
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,000
You heard her! Get some
doughnuts and cheesecake, too.

256
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,340
<i>People will remember</i>
<i>this show forever</i>

257
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,740
Shall we go together then?
Consider it a date.

258
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,040
Go on. It's still quite early.
I can manage by myself.

259
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,480
I don't like where this is going...

260
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,190
- You said my pot belly...
- I know you want it, too

261
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey, sis! Are you trying
to pull tricks on me?

262
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,410
I know you're trying
to loosen me up.

263
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,610
But tonight's show is
really important for me.

264
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,720
Ko Sun-young?
Did you get my fax?

265
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,720
Who is this?

266
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,420
You'll play the songs
as it appears on the list.

267
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,130
Because I'm holding
your family hostage.

268
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,030
What?

269
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,440
Or your sister will die.

270
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,540
What?

271
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,790
A-young, who was that just now?

272
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,290
Listen carefully.

273
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,700
You try to tell anyone about
this situation and I kill them

274
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,700
Hello?

275
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,900
Hello?

276
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,820
Hello? Police?

277
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,750
I can't reach home.

278
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,910
Could you send someone
to look around?

279
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,320
Detective Cho, check this out.

280
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,130
Something is wrong.

281
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,370
Face covered up and bow-like knot
looks like our serial killer's

282
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,300
But he's only been going after
pimps and drug dealers.

283
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,740
Is she one of them?

284
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,170
Who reported this in?

285
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,580
The killer called in to say
he left her body here.

286
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,580
Detectives!

287
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,580
The suspect called himself?

288
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,280
It's the producer from
the radio show.

289
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,190
- I'm Detective Cho.
- Oh Jung-moo.

290
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm sorry to have called
you so late.

291
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,890
But the victim's cell phone had
multiple calls from you

292
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,790
Hang in there.

293
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,400
It won't take long.

294
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,100
Who is that kid?

295
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,010
Where is Sun-young's daughter?

296
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,260
She's... in the hospital.

297
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,470
Because... she hurt... her neck.

298
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,380
<i>Those of you still up at this hour</i>
<i>and listening to this show</i>

299
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,380
send in texts to #2112.

300
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,480
'Sun-young,
is this really the end?'

301
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,180
'You already kept me company
through the night'

302
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,990
<i>Hi, Ms. Bridget Jones,</i>

303
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,290
it's you guys who kept me company

304
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,400
Tomorrow morning,
tell me the sky is white...

305
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,260
then, I'll reply that
the clouds are black'

306
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:36,990
It's black.

307
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
'Travis'! You quoted from...

308
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,000
- "Les amants du Pont-Neuf"
- "Les amants du Pont-Neuf"

309
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,210
<i>This quote reminds of the</i>
<i>scene where the heroine leaves</i>

310
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,110
And my heart starts to ache.

311
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,210
<i>I feel that I've broken</i>
<i>a promise I made with you</i>

312
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,280
<i>because of personal reasons.</i>

313
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,690
Mr. Ko Joon-young...

314
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,690
- So, you're her brother.
- That's right.

315
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,250
<i>But in the movie, the lovers</i>
<i>are eventually.</i>

316
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,190
But, it's a protocol.

317
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,570
We still have to take a look around.

318
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,170
Well...

319
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,680
If you must.

320
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,480
Pont Neuf is the oldest bridge
in Paris

321
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,850
<i>But its name actually</i>
<i>means a 'new bridge'</i>

322
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,480
Thank you and sorry to be a bother.

323
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,580
What a nice place.

324
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,100
You have upstairs, too?

325
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,400
The radio is a little too loud

326
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,400
<i>I'm already jealous that</i>
<i>she'll get more love.</i>

327
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,050
I missed 3 minutes of the show.

328
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,460
I hope you'll give her just as much

329
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,450
love and attention.

330
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm going back up.

331
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,370
The next song is from
Michael Haneke's "Pianist"

332
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,880
another film about obsessive love.

333
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:40,325
Hey, Sun-young.

334
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,790
I told you not to tell anyone.

335
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,300
Why did you call the police?

336
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,340
Why won't you listen to me?!

337
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,200
Now I'll show you what
the consequences are.

338
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,110
Listen very carefully.

339
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,830
You cannot tell anyone
about this situation

340
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,040
Who are you?
Are you a friend of A-young's?

341
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,640
Stop this sick joke!

342
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,740
Does this look like a joke to you?

343
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,550
Does it?

344
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,160
Look!

345
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,860
I am holding your family hostage.

346
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,270
Where is your daughter anyway?

347
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,070
I only see this kid.

348
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,510
She's in the hospital.
She hurt her neck.

349
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,110
Please...
Why are you doing this?

350
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,620
Hey! I'm telling the truth!

351
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,930
From this moment,

352
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,940
you'll be running the show
according to my instructions

353
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,030
You got my fax, right?

354
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,340
So, you faxed over
your own little playlist?

355
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,840
I put a lot of thoughts into that,
you know

356
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,250
I don't have it with me.
Somebody took it away.

357
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,150
I hope you won't
disappoint me any more.

358
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,650
Shouldn't we try for
a beautiful ending?

359
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,300
I'll tell you what you
should play next.

360
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,800
July 18, 2005...

361
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Was the first week after you
started the show.

362
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,230
I want the first song
you played that day.

363
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,930
Trouble recalling?
Let me give you a clue.

364
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,240
It's a bit like our relationship.

365
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,640
The main character was a DJ.

366
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,940
Quite a bit actually.

367
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
"Play Misty for Me",
"Good Morning Vietnam"

368
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,780
"Fisher King", "Talk to Me"

369
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,350
The list goes on.

370
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,760
You're going to find that song
and play it.

371
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,300
Right after this one.

372
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,000
38551

373
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,410
What are you doing here?

374
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,020
Woo-han, when this song
ends play the ads.

375
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,210
What?

376
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,620
Don't play any songs!
Just the ads!

377
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,390
Ko A-young

378
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,820
Look at this

379
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,240
Now, it's all up to your sister.

380
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,090
Are you... okay?

381
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,320
Sun-young!

382
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,020
What's the matter with you?

383
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,830
Hey, stop it!

384
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,840
What's the matter?

385
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,840
What's this about?

386
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,140
From when?

387
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,740
July 18, 2005!

388
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,050
I must find the first song
I played that day

389
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,590
What the...

390
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:10,790
It was 'Everybody knows'
from "Pump up the volume"

391
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,090
You know that? From memory?!

392
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,900
It's right...

393
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,330
<i>'Everybody knows'/"Pump up the volume"</i>

394
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,000
Holy shit! He's right.

395
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,600
This is all you need?

396
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,710
You really are a stalker!

397
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,610
That's creepy.

398
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,220
Find "Pump up the volume"
OST from the database.

399
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,230
Pump up the volume!
P! U! M! P!

400
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,520
It's not on the database.
Try the shelf.

401
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,230
What kind of database is that?
Pathetic!

402
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,220
Found it! Hang on...

403
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,240
Shit! The case is empty

404
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,300
Can you download an MP3
or something?

405
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,240
Are you for real?
We are a radio station

406
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,280
Is it the sound quality?
Listeners won't notice.

407
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,370
Why on earth do we need it anyway?

408
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,580
I don't know, either.

409
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,380
Look up Leonard Cohen discography.

410
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,890
You're right!
It's a Leonard Cohen song.

411
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,790
I'll be right over.

412
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,090
- Excuse me, Mr. Oh.
- Yes.

413
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,390
We haven't notified the family, yet.

414
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,900
Please keep it discreet.

415
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,500
It's track 3

416
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,600
I had to play six public
service ads in a row.

417
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,610
What the matter with her?

418
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,400
She has completely lost it.

419
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,500
What a sure way to screw up.

420
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,410
I'll have to write
a thousand report on this.

421
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,620
Talk about something after this ad
while I get the song ready.

422
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,720
While I get the song ready.

423
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:03,670
Maybe because it's my last show.

424
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,880
I'm getting really nervous.

425
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,380
I hope you'll understand

426
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,180
Even if I seem to be
acting a little strange.

427
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,180
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

428
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,000
It's just... really hard
for me today

429
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,590
because I don't want it
to be the end.

430
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,900
Originally, I wanted to
talk about farewell

431
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,710
as the subject of the last show.

432
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,710
But, let me just play the songs
you want like always.

433
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,450
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

434
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,230
My apologies. I must
have been too sentimental.

435
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,930
<i>Up next is 'Everybody knows'</i>
<i>from "Pump up the volume"</i>

436
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,670
Where the hero was a DJ.

437
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:08,570
A shy teenager, Mark
becomes a DJ at night

438
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,980
and enthrals fellow teenagers.

439
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,180
Through broadcasting
he discovers himself changing.

440
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,180
Here is the song.

441
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,110
We need to talk
What is it?

442
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,110
Is it Mr. Oh?

443
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,810
He won't get off your case?

444
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,410
Excuse me

445
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,410
Well, I...

446
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,670
It ain't...

447
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,180
What do you mean?

448
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,770
I dug up the old cue sheet...

449
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,680
I specifically requested the song
you played on July 18, 2005.

450
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,890
And the version you played
wasn't Leonard Cohen's.

451
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,700
It was the Concrete Blonde.

452
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,790
You even said yourself.

453
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,300
That Cohen version
was in the movie

454
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,500
but not on the OST!

455
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,400
You don't even remember
what you said.

456
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,900
I am really disappointed.

457
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,120
Who are you talking to?

458
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,230
Sun-young!

459
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,630
Sun-young!

460
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,530
Open the door!

461
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,440
Look! Ko Sun-young!

462
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,880
If you hang up on me again,

463
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,750
I'll fucking kill them all!

464
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,550
I'll give you one more
chance to make up...

465
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,150
With the next song.

466
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,760
Oh, my god! A-young...

467
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,760
Please... what is it that you want?

468
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,460
Is it money?
I'll give you it to you.

469
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,270
It's not money that I want.

470
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,680
Let's meet up
I'll come over to you.

471
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,320
You'll come here?

472
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,910
How can you be so irresponsible?

473
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,110
This is your last broadcast!

474
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,630
Wasn't it your idea to make
a memorable time with your fans?

475
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,130
And, now... you'll abandon
the show and come here?

476
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,430
Hey... please!
What is this about?

477
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,530
You will not stop the broadcast!
Because, If you do...

478
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,840
It'll be your sister's ankle
not just a toe.

479
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:32,940
Next is the theme song
from "Taxi Driver"

480
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:41,160
You must say the exact thing
you said when you.

481
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,850
Played that song on Dec 5, 2006.

482
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,750
Come on, Sun-young
You can do this!

483
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,360
You poor little thing.

484
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:18,630
Do you remember what I said

485
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,220
when we played 'Taxi Driver'?

486
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,320
You're driving me nuts!

487
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,500
Tell me what's going on
so I can help

488
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,940
I'll explain everything later
But now...

489
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,950
You've got to help me out
Please, okay?

490
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,950
Give us at least
some kind of explanation.

491
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,920
Well, the main character Travis
is a taxi driver...

492
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,750
so every night...

493
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,810
No... no!

494
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,720
You said you remember
all my shows.

495
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:54,760
That's right...

496
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,260
December 5, 2006.

497
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,190
What did I say when I
played the song from "Taxi driver"?

498
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,900
This song is finishing
Shall I play another advert?

499
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,310
Quickly! Think!

500
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,620
Travis, a hero grows...

501
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,210
through suffering

502
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,820
A hero grows through suffering.

503
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,410
I have never heard before

504
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,120
They could no longer put up
with the corrupt world...

505
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,030
So, they had to stand up.

506
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,330
Taxi driver

507
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,940
<i>"HBC Radio"</i>

508
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,140
That was 'Everybody knows'
from "Pump up the volume"

509
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,850
You have to tell me
what the situation is

510
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,060
Stop making prank calls to 911.

511
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,150
<i>By killing the pimps and</i>
<i>rescuing the prostitute, Iris,</i>

512
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,890
<i>Travis earns the title of hero.</i>

513
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,690
<i>Was he really a hero?</i>

514
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,700
<i>At time, I said a hero grows</i>
<i>through suffering'</i>

515
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,310
In the movie, Travis is
portrayed as a maladjusted man.

516
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,810
But if you think about it,

517
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,310
<i>all heroes are like that</i>
<i>to a certain extent.</i>

518
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,820
<i>Because they cannot endure</i>
<i>the corruption of society,</i>

519
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,510
so they must act.

520
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,920
<i>Right answer! Clap Clap</i>

521
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,420
Are you out of your mind?

522
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,820
What do you think you're doing!

523
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,130
I said unless the world changes,
we can only wait for heroes to rise

524
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,930
Are you all trying
to finish the show?

525
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,530
Don't shout at me
I'm fed up too

526
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,940
I suddenly remember this

527
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,840
Let's fuck it up and
hand in our resignations!

528
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,050
Someday a real rain will come and
wash all the scum off the streets.

529
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,590
She's already introduced
the next song.

530
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,890
If you have any bitter feelings
you wish to get rid of.

531
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,990
Hope you can wash them away
with this song...

532
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,010
You want to fuck up?
Let's finish it off.

533
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,520
- The music! Change the song!
- Screw you! All of you!

534
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,540
Sun-young... Don't cry.

535
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,840
Do you know where
I've just been?

536
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,990
You were doing so well.

537
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,200
Why are you screwing up now?

538
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,600
It wasn't me.

539
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,010
Your sister is dead because of you.

540
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:06,080
<i>Shouldn't we work together</i>
<i>for a beautiful ending?</i>

541
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,480
No, then he'll kill her daughter

542
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,280
But we gotta call the cops.

543
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,290
That psycho killed a cop
He's capable of anything.

544
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,990
Exactly! We don't know
if he'll keep his word.

545
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:28,200
Are you okay?
Who the hell is he?

546
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,600
We saw your phone
He threatened us, too.

547
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,310
Sun-young, check this out.

548
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,310
My sister got killed because of you!

549
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,720
If I only played the right song...
You killed her!

550
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,710
Calm down and check this out.

551
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,120
I don't want to listen to you.

552
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,830
Se-yeon is dead, too.

553
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,770
I just went to identify her body.

554
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,480
What's up?

555
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,880
Hey...

556
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,880
This came in for you.

557
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,290
No name?

558
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,900
What is this?

559
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,410
The police thinks it's connected
to the serial killer.

560
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,110
Maybe he has something
to do with us.

561
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,510
Can you think of anything?

562
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,650
Baby... is that you?

563
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,750
Baby, are you okay?

564
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,260
Eun-soo!

565
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,570
The playroom, you know.

566
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,760
Get inside the closet
and stay quiet.

567
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,870
Inside the closet
and stay there, okay?

568
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,570
mommy will come for you
Hang in there, okay?

569
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,920
What are you doing?

570
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,620
I gotta go.

571
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,630
You should calm down.

572
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,530
Pull yourself together!

573
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,730
Can you get a broadcast van ready?

574
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:35,660
Leave one phone line open
Put others on hold.

575
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,560
Stay focused!

576
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,570
- You've got the ads?
- Yes, sir!

577
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,260
- Can you give us a hand?
- Relay channel... 3!

578
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,960
Let me take it.

579
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,670
Once you get home,
what will you do?

580
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,870
She's hiding from him in that house.
I can't just wait around.

581
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,480
This is like asking him
to kill you, too.

582
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,780
I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

583
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,120
Have the van meet me
at the front.

584
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,810
Hey! Sun-young!

585
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,430
This is too dangerous.

586
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,260
Are you up now?

587
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,070
You've only done
40 minutes of the show.

588
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,480
Doesn't look like you're
in the studio.

589
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,480
- Where are you?
- The restroom

590
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,480
The restroom?

591
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,610
Why are you doing this to me?

592
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,120
What did I ever do to you?

593
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:10,920
How uncommitted you must've
been all this time?

594
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,430
Just get to the point.

595
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,630
What is it that you want?

596
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,730
I gave you many chances.

597
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,330
What the fuck do you want,
you psychopath!

598
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,740
Shut up!

599
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,950
Of all people, you cannot
insult me like that.

600
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:43,150
We've still got so much work
to do together.

601
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,350
And you're bailing out?

602
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:55,160
That's all fine but you gotta
put things right before you go.

603
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,860
Put what right?

604
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,910
Don't worry.
We still have time.

605
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,610
Part 3, when you take calls

606
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,210
that caller will be me.

607
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,620
I hate it when I get
beat off for that.

608
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,420
Whatever you want.

609
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,830
But, don't touch the kids

610
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,830
Kid...s?

611
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:55,160
Maybe the kids are tired
of playing hide-and-seek.

612
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,970
Maybe she wants to play ball.

613
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,000
Lay a finger on my daughter,

614
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,900
and, I'll kill you myself!

615
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,310
You're a big fat liar.

616
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:19,220
Eun-soo! Come out, come out
wherever you are!

617
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,720
Hide!

618
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,420
Don't let him find you!

619
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,650
You can get the call sign
through this.

620
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,620
Do you know where
we're going anyway?

621
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,420
Turn left here.

622
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,890
Damn traffic!

623
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,400
Let's get started.

624
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,500
It's not the time yet...

625
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,310
Signal!

626
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,310
<i>You're listening to Midnight Soundtrack</i>

627
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:28,010
<i>We're back with part 3 of the show.</i>

628
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,210
<i>In part 3, we'll be connecting</i>
<i>to one of the listeners</i>

629
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,810
<i>and have a live chat.</i>

630
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,130
We already have a caller
I'll put him through.

631
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,230
Hello?

632
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,240
<i>Hi</i>

633
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,040
<i>Can you tell us who you are?</i>

634
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,640
<i>About me?</i>

635
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:59,950
I'm someone who believes
this program is all about you.

636
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,390
Your partner, Han Dong-soo.

637
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,480
What do you mean by that?

638
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,180
I'm saying that.

639
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,990
I don't think anyone else
can replace you on this program.

640
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,590
An unqualified DJ like Lim Se-yeon?

641
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,400
Simply unacceptable!

642
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,600
Although she won't be able to now,
even if she wants.

643
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,610
Son of a bitch!

644
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,510
<i>What do you for a living?</i>

645
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,910
Look! Hurry!

646
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,000
Can you tell us more...

647
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,520
Hurry!

648
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,320
Hello? Hello?

649
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,420
Hang on a second.

650
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,130
Hurry!

651
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,120
He hung up.

652
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,120
We have a bad connection.
Let's listen to a song first.

653
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,940
Eun-soo!

654
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,280
Hurry, Eun-soo!

655
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:24,500
Try not to breathe heavily.
And, be careful!

656
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,400
Sun-young, wait a little bit.

657
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,810
There is no time
I think he found my daughter.

658
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,900
Wait till the cops arrive.

659
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,710
Did you call the police?

660
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,810
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

661
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:50,230
Are you crazy?
He killed a cop already.

662
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,530
You're only provoking him!

663
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,930
He's a nutcase!
It's too dangerous.

664
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,830
You can't reason with him.

665
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,330
If anything happens to the kids,
I swear I'll kill you.

666
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,240
Don't do this.
Don't go in there!

667
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:10,440
Ex... excuse me...
I'll come with you.

668
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,850
Just stop it!

669
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,050
I don't need this.

670
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,250
I think I can help.

671
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,660
You're a god-damn stalker, too.

672
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,960
We're back on.

673
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,970
We'll try again.

674
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,980
- Dong-soo?
<i>- Hello</i>

675
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,380
Shall we continue
where we left off?

676
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,780
What you do for a living?

677
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,580
I... I raise rabbits.

678
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,880
Because I just adore rabbits.

679
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,680
Did you say... rabbits?

680
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:58,060
They love to hide from me
when I as much as blink.

681
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,290
I see.

682
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:04,530
They are such sweet little creature

683
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,540
<i>but they cause trouble time to time.</i>

684
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:11,380
And, one of them has
a injury on the neck.

685
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,440
I see.

686
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,940
<i>As an avid listener...</i>

687
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,850
What's your most...?

688
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,940
Wait!

689
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,950
You said earlier.

690
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:29,450
Parting could be a way
to preserve love eternally.

691
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,260
That's not what I meant...

692
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:35,770
If my rabbits vanish one day.

693
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:43,680
Then, I'll be able to keep
their loving memories.

694
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,370
No, actually...

695
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,470
<i>So, I...</i>

696
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:51,280
Found the two rabbits
that got away.

697
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,280
And killed them.

698
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,990
You son of a bitch!

699
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,890
Music!

700
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,130
<i>All force dispatch immediately.</i>

701
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,730
What the fuck did you do
with the kids?

702
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,640
What did you do with them?

703
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,440
Hey! What are you doing here?

704
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,180
- Anything?
- There's no one here.

705
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,550
Nobody upstairs either.

706
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,860
Sun-young! He got away.

707
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,030
Eun-soo!

708
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,050
Seon-young

709
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,250
Was it so hard to follow
my instructions?

710
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:39,250
I asked you not to leave
the studio no matter what!

711
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,760
He knows everything.

712
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:48,570
It's too bad but you won't be
able to see the kids again.

713
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:56,280
No... Don't do that

714
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,720
Hello? Is this the TV station?

715
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,330
I have information about the murder.

716
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,940
<i>It's difficult to confirm without</i>
<i>an official police announcement.</i>

717
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,950
<i>But, Ms. Ko Sun-young is</i>
<i>staying at her house</i>

718
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,960
<i>while the police is trying to locate</i>
<i>the perpetrator on the run.</i>

719
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:43,480
<i>As Han turns out to be the one</i>
<i>responsible for the recent serial murders.</i>

720
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,260
<i>Relationship with Ms. Ko seems to be</i>
<i>the key to understanding this case</i>

721
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:48,160
What about the show?

722
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:52,260
Play the songs on the list.

723
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,260
I'll call you back.

724
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,400
It's ready.

725
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,830
<i>I want to be like mommy.</i>

726
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,850
- This is the fax he sent you?
- Yeah.

727
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,190
I pulled up his record.

728
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:54,260
He was arrested for
attempted murder 4 years ago.

729
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,560
Attempted murder?

730
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:01,700
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia
during investigation.

731
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,410
I'm Ko Sun-young's partner.

732
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,610
He was sent to a mental institution
for 3 years

733
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,010
and got released last year.

734
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:15,150
This type of serial killer is
known as mission-oriented

735
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,660
They believe they're doing

736
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,420
good for the society
by ridding the world of criminals.

737
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:23,830
What about an innocent family member
or a DJ? A contribution?

738
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,230
A contribution?

739
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,930
I'm saying that he's a mental case
who believes his cause.

740
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,700
Look at the date the fax.

741
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,640
I think he was motivated
by Sun-young's program.

742
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:38,140
The dates of the murders
coincide with the program schedule.

743
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:41,150
<i>Travis from "Taxi Driver",</i>
<i>drives his taxi every night</i>

744
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,840
<i>through the decadent streets</i>
<i>of New York.</i>

745
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,150
<i>'Someday a real rain will come and</i>
<i>wash all the scum off the streets'</i>

746
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,750
<i>Why do get such satisfaction</i>
<i>from watching our heroes in the movie</i>

747
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,160
<i>Because in reality,</i>
<i>no-one takes care</i>

748
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,830
<i>of the wrongs we come</i>
<i>across everyday</i>

749
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,900
<i>Where is my hero right now?</i>

750
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,200
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

751
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:12,200
<i>Heroes sometimes suffer</i>
<i>at the weight of their fate.</i>

752
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,920
<i>But, it's that suffering</i>
<i>makes them stronger.</i>

753
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:22,910
<i>Where is my hero right now?</i>

754
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,020
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

755
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,820
He's using the term partner

756
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,630
he probably wants recognition
from his object of obsession.

757
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:36,430
<i>I don't want to see these</i>
<i>psycho killers even in the movies</i>

758
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,030
Sun-young is a victim, too.

759
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:42,630
Stop connecting her to the case.

760
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:48,550
<i>I don't want to see these</i>
<i>psycho killers even in the movies.</i>

What!

762
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,490
You'd better turn on the television.

763
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:07,330
<i>The suspect just sent us</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>And is hailed as a hero</i>

<i>Is this being aired?</i>

It's from our show

When did you get that?

790

You can't just show that
on a public channel!

791
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,940
We were blackmailed, too.

01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:19,430
<i>whether there is any justice</i>
<i>in our society.</i>

800
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,560
<i>Ko Sun-young who was</i>
<i>the newscaster at the time...</i>

801
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,540
Ms. Ko, how do you feel right now?

802
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,670
Please, just one word!

803
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:29,370
Was the voice on the tape yours?

804
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,570
It was.

805
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,480
How do you feel about
Han Dong-soo?

806
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,090
<i>He...</i>

807
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,090
<i>He killed criminals.</i>

808
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:50,100
<i>I think...</i>

809
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:56,300
<i>It was a heroic act.</i>

810
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,910
Are you listening to me, Han?

811
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,540
<i>Come on out and talk to me!</i>

812
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,740
<i>Tell me what you want!</i>

813
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,750
What do you think you're doing?

814
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,960
He's a psycho threatening
to kill your kids!

815
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:15,150
This is what he wants.

816
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:19,160
He's a psycho who
believes he is a hero.

817
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,660
He'll call me again.

818
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:39,980
Eun-soo?

819
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,890
One more time, baby.

820
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,500
Can I consider
that as your recognition?

821
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:01,530
Yes. Isn't that what you want?

822
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:05,340
But, you're too late.

823
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,950
I've already killed them.

824
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,040
Liar!

825
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,850
You're a hero.

826
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,440
A hero would never do
such a thing

827
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,820
Officers, have you finished
tracking the location?

828
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:23,860
Come and collect the bodies.

829
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,950
Han Dong-soo!

830
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:28,560
I'm turning myself in.

831
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,360
Han Dong-soo!

832
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:30,790
Do we have his location?

833
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,770
Get everybody over there now!

834
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,070
And, request for a backup!

835
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:39,170
My kids... they're alive,
aren't they?

836
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:57,490
Ms. Ko, the sky is white
and clouds are black today.

837
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,090
Come meet me. Hurry.

838
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,630
Go! Go!

839
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,660
All hell broke loose here.

840
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:28,750
Where the hell are you?

841
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,560
Get your ass over here, now!

842
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:30,560
Yes, sir!

843
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:36,160
I gotta go back to the station.

844
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,170
Will you be okay?

845
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,870
I'm okay.

846
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,270
Come with us, ma'am.

847
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,080
I'll take my car.

848
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:55,290
- Keep closely behind her.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,130
Let's go!

850
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,430
Her car just started off.

851
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:20,140
You should've sent out
a substitute program

852
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,240
I don't believe we should do
that in this situation.

853
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,340
What situation?

854
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,550
Get your ass in the studio. Now!

855
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,950
Yes, sir.

856
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:33,250
<i>We have exclusive breaking news?</i>

857
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:40,760
<i>I have the fax that Han Dong-soo</i>
<i>sent to Ko sun-young tonight.</i>

858
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,360
Son of a bitch!

859
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,770
<i>In the fax, there is a playlist</i>
<i>of songs that Han put together</i>

860
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,860
<i>All these movie soundtracks</i>
<i>have one thing in common</i>

861
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:53,070
<i>that the main character kills</i>
<i>villains and becomes a hero himself</i>

862
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,480
<i>We're heading to the place where</i>
<i>Han says he's turning himself in</i>

863
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,280
Block off the press!
Don't let anyone near.

864
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:08,530
Are you on your way?
Can't wait to see the kids?

865
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,330
Then, let's get started with part 4.

866
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,930
Tap tap tap, if the answer is yes.

867
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,940
Can you help me?

868
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,040
<i>We'd like to apologize</i>
<i>for earlier problems...</i>

869
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,050
Hey!

870
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:38,560
Have you lost your mind?

871
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:40,150
Get out of here! Now! Out!

872
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:43,060
I'll be expecting your resignation

873
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,470
Until 4 am, this time slot
belongs to Ko Sun-young.

874
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,660
And I'm the producer in charge.

875
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,570
Is that the car?

876
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,970
I think it's a recording
of Ko's program

877
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:59,780
<i>Coming up in a few minutes in part 4,</i>

878
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:05,320
<i>We'll reconnect with Han Dong</i>

879
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:06,720
Detective Cho!

880
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,630
Who is that?!

881
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,630
I did exactly as you told me.

882
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,530
Now, where are the kids?

883
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,940
Don't worry about them.
They're safe in my hands.

884
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:27,240
Take the right.

885
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,240
What the...?!

886
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,140
She gave us the slip.

887
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,350
Were following her to the west.

888
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,260
Find out who she is.
And, get an aerial backup.

889
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,350
Yes, sir!

890
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:49,060
<i>Hello! This is Han Dong-soo.</i>

891
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:56,470
<i>I'm currently moving in a car</i>
<i>with my partner, Ko Sun-young.</i>

892
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,410
<i>Ms. Park? Are you there?</i>
<i>Can we play a song first?</i>

893
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,210
Is that... Is that her car?

894
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,120
Where are you going?

895
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,930
Where are the kids?

896
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,830
Stop right there.

897
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:26,030
You want me to stop?
The kids are in the trunk.

898
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:11,910
Just drive through.

899
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:23,820
No!

900
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,930
No!

901
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,450
That's more like it, partner!

902
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,300
Stop the car!

903
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,310
Stop the car!

904
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,410
Get out of the way!

905
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:27,620
<i>This city fills up with trash</i>
<i>like them at night.</i>

906
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,530
Out of the way!

907
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:41,440
<i>But, with your voice even things</i>
<i>like that turn into a scene from a movie.</i>

908
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,360
No!

909
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:07,860
- Sun-young!
- Keep going

910
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,470
No... no!

911
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,010
You said that I was a hero.

912
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,100
Did you mean that?

913
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,450
I did everything you
wanted me to do.

914
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,320
<i>People change their words</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

915
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,550
<i>I can't feel the sincerity</i>
<i>in your words any more.</i>

916
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,550
But, it doesn't matter.

917
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,960
<i>All they care about is</i>
<i>what you say.</i>

918
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:17,370
We're almost there.
You'll like what I've done.

919
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,170
You're right, Han Dong-soo.

920
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:26,480
I've been spitting pretentious
words out of my mouth.

921
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:28,970
But, you...

922
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,680
You're just a dumb killer who
can't tell a broadcast from reality.

923
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:12,960
Eun-soo!

924
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,060
Eun-soo! My baby.

925
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:23,560
Eun-soo!

926
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,190
Sun-young! It's me!

927
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,190
What are you doing here?

928
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:57,800
The clouds are black
and the sky is white.

929
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,740
Pont Neuf is
the oldest bridge on Seine.

930
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,540
And this is the oldest bridge
in Seoul.

931
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,850
Why do you keep avoiding me?

932
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,450
I really want to help.

933
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:27,760
Stop following!

934
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,770
Ko Sun-young!

935
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,690
Eun-soo!

936
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,430
Kids!

937
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,130
Eun-soo!

938
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,950
Eun-soo!

939
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,160
Eun-soo!

940
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,560
Eun-soo! Eun-soo!

941
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:34,470
Detective Eom!

942
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,170
Sir!

943
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,770
What about the woman?
Any leads?

944
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,080
She's still unconscious.

945
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,980
She had no identification on her.

946
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,540
Man, it's a hard day to forget.

947
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:13,440
Let the kids go.

948
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,640
You can tell me what you want.

949
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,840
I'll do anything you want.

950
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,040
Ms. Park, listen to me carefully.

951
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,250
The moment this show gets
interrupted,

952
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,350
I'm scared...
It's so cold here.

953
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,260
The kids will die.

954
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:34,160
Is that clear?

955
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,280
We'll continue with the show.

956
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:51,570
I'm at the place where
Han Dong-soo lives.

957
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:58,280
Let's hear from him directly
why he committed these crimes.

958
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:05,930
<i>Dear Midnight FM listeners</i>
<i>a special corner.</i>

959
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,930
It's your turn, Sun-young.

960
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,850
Do you recognize him?

961
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,050
He's a trash!

962
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:35,250
A piece of trash that
needs to be swept away.

963
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:41,960
You said

964
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:45,270
I'm scared to raise my daughter
in this world.

965
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,540
That's right, everyone!

966
01:26:55,550 --> 01:27:04,320
Sun-young will shoot
the guys with this gun.

967
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:09,520
And become a hero herself.

968
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:11,930
Leave me alone!

969
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,630
Sir!

970
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:22,610
What the hell?

971
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,340
What the fuck are they doing?

972
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,940
You think this your show?

973
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:34,950
Who is this?

974
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,150
Psychos!

975
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,260
Hey... Hey!

976
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,970
You wanna see them all die?

977
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,400
Back off, Han Dong-soo.

978
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,810
This is my show.

979
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:06,720
I'll host it to the end.

980
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,420
Are you all right?

981
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,520
We've got to get the show going.

982
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,230
Stay with us till the end.

983
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,530
Damn!

984
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:28,640
Park!

985
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:32,040
Get your ass over to
the control room.

986
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:39,540
What are you doing?

987
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,550
Tick-tock! 4 minutes passed...

988
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:48,260
Eun-soo, hurry!

989
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,160
- Tell me if anyone comes this way.
- Got it

990
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:03,580
Shall we get started again?

991
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:07,210
Look,

992
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,510
This man is a filthy low life
human-trafficking scum.

993
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,610
That needs to be swept off.

994
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:14,210
What do you mean
human-trafficker?

995
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,120
She is my sister!

996
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:20,520
She ran away from home!

997
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,620
He's lying.

998
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,720
What did you do with my sister?

999
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,530
Where is she?

1000
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,640
We don't have much time.

1001
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:34,040
<i>Fuck you!</i>
<i>You're delusional.</i>

1002
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,440
Find him! Now!

1003
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:39,880
Even a criminal deserves the law.

1004
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:40,780
Law?

1005
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:44,050
<i>They'll sneak out with a fine.</i>

1006
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:48,350
<i>Who are you calling a criminal?!</i>

1007
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:50,550
Is that train sound
in the background?

1008
01:29:51,330 --> 01:29:52,120
Train runs at this hour?

1009
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:54,460
From all the listeners out there
only you...!

1010
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:01,260
How did you feel when
Kim Tae-soo was found dead?

1011
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:03,260
You were happy
that I did it for you.

1012
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:09,470
Then you should be thankful

1013
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,170
<i>Leaves us all puzzled as to</i>
<i>where there is any justice.</i>

1014
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:19,880
Now, it's your turn.

1015
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,090
Ms. Ko...

1016
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:26,490
Shoot that scumbag and be my partner.

1017
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,790
Fuck yourself!
You crazy psycho!

1018
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:35,700
Search around the train tracks
where trains are still running.

1019
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,500
<i>Search around the train tracks</i>
<i>where trains are still running.</i>

1020
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:56,620
In about 5 minutes,
blood will start to freeze.

1021
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,520
It's your call.

1022
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:04,060
Listen, lady! Just calm down.

1023
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:06,970
Is it going to be your kids
or that piece of trash?

1024
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,360
Go on, do it!

1025
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,470
Like you said on the radio!

1026
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:20,880
No...

1027
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:27,990
Promise me.

1028
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:33,890
That you'll let my kids go
if I shoot that scumbag.

1029
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:38,490
I'm not a liar like you.

1030
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,600
Hey, wait! No...!
No! Don't shoot!

1031
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:46,470
No! Don't shoot!

1032
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:50,710
Eun-soo, I'm scared...

1033
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:05,250
Please, don't shoot me!

1034
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:08,360
No... please! You can't do this!

1035
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:10,960
3...

1036
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:22,080
- Why...? What did I do?
- 2...

1037
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:25,470
Please... No! Don't kill me.

1038
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,090
1!

1039
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,990
I'm not a scum.

1040
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:47,500
My brother...

1041
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:14,800
I'll get you out.

1042
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,670
Han Dong-soo!

1043
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,270
Tell the listeners!

1044
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:32,370
That you'll.
Let my kids go if I kill this scum.

1045
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:43,590
- No... no... no...
- You lied to me again!

1046
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,160
Help us!

1047
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,760
Go! Hurry!

1048
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:33,970
Run! As fast as you can!

1049
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,390
We haven't got much time.

1050
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,330
Come on! Hurry!

1051
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,550
Sun-young! Sun-young!

1052
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,850
What the fuck?!

1053
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,370
You ruined everything!

1054
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,780
You ruined everything!

1055
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,390
You...

1056
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:55,290
Get moving!

1057
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:06,430
Sun-young that talked to me
always said the right thing.

1058
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:17,540
Drop the knife!
Put your hands up where I can see 'em.

1059
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,850
It's over, Han Dong-soo.

1060
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,360
Wait!

1061
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:40,160
People should never hear
your voice again

1062
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,070
Han Dong-soo

1063
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:47,670
Go to hell.

1064
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:10,730
Did you get that shot?

1065
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,650
<i>We'll get a direct interview</i>
<i>with Ko Sun-young</i>

1066
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,720
You'll be reunited
with the children soon.

1067
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:02,920
How do you feel now?

1068
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,630
I'm reporter Jang from GCN.

1069
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,920
Any comment, please.

1070
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,020
Step back, please!

1071
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:47,160
Hey, can you stop for a second?

1072
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:58,460
Be gentle!

1073
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,570
I got shot.

1074
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:06,580
Are you okay?

1075
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:10,550
Don't worry about the reporters.

1076
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,680
They'll forget all about it soon.

1077
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,490
I'm sorry, sir.

1078
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,490
We'll get moving.

1079
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:41,520
<i>You must have felt the need to escape</i>
<i>from this suffocating daily routine</i>

<i>How about you go</i>
<i>crazy today for once?</i>

1081
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:45,320

<i>Then follow my instructions.</i>

1085
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,130
