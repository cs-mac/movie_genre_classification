1
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:38,261
She said,

2
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,914
"Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

3
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:42,511
And what did you say?

4
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,527
I took her up on it.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,350
I never wanted to be
away from her.

6
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,271
She had the spark of life.

7
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,728
Careful.

8
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,908
When did we last
wash that sweater?

9
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:21,335
Right after the war.

10
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:27,703
Christmas.

11
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,295
In the '50s sometime or the '60s.

12
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:30,448
Shut up.

13
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,191
I'll go make the fire.

14
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,349
"You climbed the bank and said,

15
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,417
"'This is how you touch
other women,

16
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,449
"the grass cutter's wife,
the lime burner's daughter.

17
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,927
"And you searched your arms

18
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,651
for the missing perfume
and knew..."

19
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,274
Don't worry, darling.

20
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,646
I expect I'm just losing my mind.

21
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,115
"What good is it to be
the lime burner's daughter,

22
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,974
"left with no trace

23
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,659
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,

24
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:09,398
"as if wounded without
the pleasure of a scar.

25
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,952
"You touched your belly
to my hands in the dry air

26
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:16,760
"and said, 'I am
the cinnamon peeler's wife.

27
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:18,549
Smell me."'

28
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,922
When I look away,
I forget what yellow means.

29
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:26,382
But I can look again.

30
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,614
Sometimes there's something
delicious in oblivion.

31
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,820
I think you're supposed to be able

32
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,337
to put your fingers
inside the curled petal

33
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,930
and feel the heat.

34
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:40,823
Well?

35
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,841
I can't be sure.

36
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,531
I can't be sure if what I can feel

37
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:52,179
is the heat or my imagination.

38
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,922
The heat attracts the bugs.

39
00:05:57,753 --> 00:06:01,048
Nature never fools around
just being decorative.

40
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,878
Yes?

41
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,993
I don't quite know
how to introduce myself.

42
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,677
I used to see your husband
at Meadowlake.

43
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm a regular visitor there myself.

44
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,000
Those are lovely flowers.

45
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:56,338
I've never seen
those purple ones before.

46
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,279
The earth there must
really appeal to them.

47
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,287
What?

48
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,558
You could just open the drawers.

49
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:10,738
Remind yourself.

50
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:11,987
What?

51
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,775
Maybe all the labels and lists
are defeating the purpose.

52
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,894
If you stopped thinking about things
the moment you write them down,

53
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:24,402
maybe that's the end
of your need to recall.

54
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,743
I heard a story at a dinner party

55
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,817
about the German soldiers
on border patrol

56
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,988
in Czechoslovakia during the war.

57
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,229
I heard it from that
Czech student of yours.

58
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:35,639
Veronica.

59
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,706
We spoke once at a dinner party.

60
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:40,982
Don't be nervous.

61
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,286
It's a good story.

62
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:47,826
She told me that each
of the German patrol dogs

63
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:51,575
<i>wore a sign saying "hund."</i>

64
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:53,299
"Why?" said the Czechs.

65
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,639
And the Germans replied,
"Because that is a hund."

66
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,058
It was one of those craft shows

67
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,977
where you look around and wonder
that the laws of supply and demand

68
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,943
can allow for the production
of so many macramé ducks.

69
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,644
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.

70
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:29,495
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.

71
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,318
You use it as a... what do you call it...

72
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,696
a light fixture holder or som...

73
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,071
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...

74
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,632
Oh, yes. Wait a second, I do.

75
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:37,266
Fiona gave it to me.

76
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:39,607
Yes, I did.

77
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,169
Would anybody like some more?

78
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:56,048
Ween...

79
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,759
Wai... Wain...

80
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,801
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.

81
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:08,183
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.

82
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,591
Some more wain.

83
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,993
The thing is...

84
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,855
half the time I wander around

85
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,535
looking for something
which I know is very pertinent.

86
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:27,568
I can't remember what it is.

87
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:33,911
Once the idea is gone,
everything is gone.

88
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,269
I just wander around

89
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:41,680
trying to figure out what it was
that was so important earlier.

90
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:48,722
I think I may be
beginning to disappear.

91
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,480
And what year is it?

92
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,146
2003.

93
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:05,433
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street,
addressed, with a stamp on it,

94
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,385
what would you do with it?

95
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,627
I'd mail it.

96
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:10,554
And where would you put it to mail it?

97
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:25,110
And if there was a fire
in a movie theater,

98
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:28,690
and you were the first person
to spot that fire,

99
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,485
what would you do?

100
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,480
Well, we don't go
to the movies much anymore,

101
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,106
do we, Grant?

102
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,277
All those multiplexes showing
the same American garbage.

103
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:54,425
Have you seen my coat?

104
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,377
There it is, dear.

105
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:57,588
It's on your chair.

106
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:00,760
Oh, yes.

107
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,022
Fiona, would you mind
if I asked you a few more questions?

108
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,578
Would you mind taking a seat?

109
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:12,088
I was just feeling
a little cold, that's all.

110
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,498
What an ugly baby.

111
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,185
When did we move into this cottage?

112
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:46,706
Was it last year
or the year before?

113
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,400
No. It was longer than that.

114
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,314
It was when I left the university,

115
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:01,426
20 years ago.

116
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,840
Well, that's shocking.

117
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:26,455
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?

118
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:31,352
How is your husband doing?

119
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,847
Okay.

120
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:35,289
He and my wife struck up
quite a close friendship.

121
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,167
I heard about that.

122
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,808
So, uh,

123
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,338
I'd like to speak to you
about something.

124
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:48,274
If you have a minute.

125
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,064
My husband did not try
to start anything with your wife,

126
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:52,472
if that's what you're getting at.

127
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,229
He did not try to molest her.

128
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,705
He's incapable of it.

129
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,144
And anyway, he wouldn't.

130
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,080
From what I hear, it was the other way around.

131
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,041
No, uh, that isn't it at all.

132
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:05,304
I didn't come here with any complaints.

133
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,509
Oh.

134
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,466
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.

135
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:14,709
Maybe you should come in.

136
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,673
It's not as warm a day as it looks.

137
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:27,029
"Never let a person make you feel guilty
for your anger with God."

138
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:30,900
Hmm. Random.

139
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,696
I can't even see what the point is.

140
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:39,829
We can't be certain this is what...

141
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,176
You're far too young.

142
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,901
"Should the patient
afflicted with the disease

143
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,589
"remain at home...

144
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,920
the caregiver will very often be the spouse."

145
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:53,103
"The caregiver must preside
over the degeneration

146
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,634
"of someone he or she
loves very much,

147
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:57,332
"must do this for years and years

148
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,988
"with the news always
getting worse, not better,

149
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,782
"must put up sometimes
with deranged

150
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,720
"but at the same time
very personal insults,

151
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,129
"and must somehow learn
to smile through it all.

152
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,688
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose

153
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:10,802
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments

154
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:12,762
"under extraordinary circumstances.

155
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,965
"Imagine the person
you love the most

156
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,561
"suddenly upset about something,

157
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,773
"but completely unable
to communicate the problem

158
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:21,810
or even to understand it himself."

159
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,329
Sounds like a regular marriage.

160
00:16:58,811 --> 00:16:59,760
Hello, there!

161
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,278
Oh!

162
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:06,169
Hello, there.

163
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:54,874
We are at that stage, Grant.

164
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:59,796
We are at that stage.

165
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:10,773
Well...

166
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:16,216
if we do think of it...

167
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:19,185
if we do...

168
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,995
then it must be as something
that isn't permanent.

169
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:30,585
A kind of experimental treatment or...

170
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:35,511
a rest cure of sorts.

171
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,726
All right.

172
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,810
All right.

173
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,468
We can think of it that way.

174
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:59,223
We have to sit in the kitchen,
where I can hear Aubrey.

175
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,689
Well, you might as well
have a cup of coffee.

176
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,586
Thank you.

177
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:16,281
My son put him on the Sports Channel
a year ago Christmas.

178
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:18,257
I don't know what we'd do without it.

179
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,273
Must be a struggle.

180
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,385
Well, you know.

181
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:26,201
You know what
struggle is by now.

182
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,002
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

183
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:36,441
You don't want to just get
a sense of the place?

184
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,744
I don't want to make
this decision alone.

185
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:43,668
What place?

186
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,172
Just kidding!

187
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:51,699
Fuck off.

188
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:03,546
You're not making
this decision alone, Grant.

189
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,913
I've already made up my mind.

190
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:11,986
Okay.

191
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,394
It's time to go home now.

192
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,052
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...

193
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:45,846
- Hi. Is this your son?
- Yeah. I'm her son.

194
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:48,818
Hi. I'm Betty. It's time for your bath.

195
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,964
- Bath.
- Yeah.

196
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:52,563
You have to have a bath now.

197
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,261
Mama.

198
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,982
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.

199
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,907
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.

200
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:01,755
I'm just going to take you
on the quick tour of the facility,

201
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,274
and then we can sit down
and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition

202
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,998
and the appropriate time
for admitting her.

203
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:12,214
As you can see,
we get a lot of natural light.

204
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,617
Yes, I can see that.

205
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:16,342
This is my favorite room.

206
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:17,938
Look, over there, as you can see,

207
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,768
they have a puzzle on the go.

208
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,145
They always have
a puzzle on the go.

209
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:23,480
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here

210
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:25,915
that our residents
maintain social function,

211
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,216
so a lot of our activities
and our whole layout

212
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:29,298
is really geared toward...

213
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,899
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.

214
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,881
Hello, Michael.

215
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:34,811
Now, as you can see,
we're coming into our common room,

216
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,593
and again, we're really emphasizing
everybody being social.

217
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,969
So you can bring the family.

218
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,313
Everybody can come and visit.

219
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,649
We have a state-of-the-art
entertainment system

220
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:45,105
so the residents can gather
and watch together.

221
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,772
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.

222
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:48,818
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.

223
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,714
Aren't you festive!

224
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:55,035
And this is our quiet corner
for crafts and reading and reflection.

225
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,613
We have a lot of activities
for physical activity.

226
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,652
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.

227
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:04,823
And here we have our
lovely new dining room.

228
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:08,438
We can accommodate
any dietary preferences or restrictions.

229
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:12,184
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner
early for the families.

230
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,107
The old Meadowlake is just next door,

231
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:17,073
and that's a day center
now, but, um...

232
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:18,969
this for the permanent residents.

233
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:20,345
This is brand-spanking new.

234
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,354
So let's go upstairs, shall we?

235
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:27,254
Just taking my tea for a ride.

236
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,068
Oh, look at this one, Flo.

237
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,369
He's a real charmer, isn't he?

238
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,087
Would you say,
are you a charmer?

239
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:38,098
I think you could say
I was kind of a charmer.

240
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,375
You're a rascal.

241
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,681
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.

242
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,953
I should have known it.

243
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,409
At this age, it's...

244
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:51,153
What do the kids call it, Flo? It's...

245
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,235
It's a real clusterfuck.

246
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:55,316
All the charmers are taken.

247
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:57,657
Or dead. Mostly dead.

248
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,764
You're kind of charming
yourself, sweetheart.

249
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:02,196
Shall we?

250
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,043
This is our second floor,
the extended care wing.

251
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:14,261
The elevators, of course,

252
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,380
have the lockdown system,

253
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,459
and this is where
the patients can move to

254
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,441
once they become more progressed.

255
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,167
Interesting choice of words.

256
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,203
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here,
while we're at it?

257
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,316
Then we can go back down
and see the regular rooms

258
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:28,664
where Mrs. Andersson will be living.

259
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,937
No, that will not be necessary.

260
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,109
My wife will not be
progressing to this floor.

261
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,417
All right.

262
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:38,233
Who chooses the music?

263
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,707
I'm sorry?

264
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,081
I'm assuming it's not the residents.

265
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:44,279
I don't see any of them
singing along.

266
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,796
Yeah, well. You know the rooms on the regular
floors all have their own stereo systems

267
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:49,941
so the patients can listen
to whatever they like.

268
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,026
How kind.

269
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:56,185
Now, we don't admit anyone
during the month of December,

270
00:23:56,252 --> 00:23:58,161
so Mrs. Andersson will
have to wait till January

271
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,059
to make the big move.

272
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:04,433
Just December, Christmas, you know, too
many emotional pitfalls.

273
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,101
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.

274
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:07,831
I'm looking for those documents
on Aubrey Burke.

275
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,394
Sure. Go ahead.

276
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:12,435
Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy,
our new managing nurse.

277
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:14,679
Against some people's
better judgment.

278
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:16,691
Now, now.

279
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,772
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife,
Mrs. Andersson,

280
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:20,219
who will be joining us in January.

281
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:21,331
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

282
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:22,419
We also have a policy,

283
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:23,922
which I'm sure you saw
in the brochure,

284
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,785
that our new residents
are not allowed visitors

285
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:27,794
or receiving phone calls
during the first 30 days,

286
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,657
just to give them a chance to settle in.

287
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:30,902
What sort of visitors?

288
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:37,461
Everyone. Even close relatives.

289
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,962
I couldn't just leave her here.

290
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,208
We understand,
it is very difficult

291
00:24:41,277 --> 00:24:43,895
to leave a loved one
in a new environment for so long,

292
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:47,161
but most people need
that time to settle in.

293
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:48,919
Before we had this rule in place,

294
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,581
residents would forget
again and again

295
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:52,059
why they were being left here.

296
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,204
Whereas we find,

297
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:55,829
you give them the month
to settle in,

298
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,907
and they're happy as clams.

299
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,283
And after that, a little visit home
every now and then, perfectly fine.

300
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:05,331
We'll take good care
of her, I promise.

301
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,927
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no! Not again.

302
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:14,996
Knock-knock. Boo.

303
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:24,723
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?

304
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:27,731
She's got a new baby,
four months old.

305
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:10,899
Smells good.

306
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,532
I was going to go for a ski,
but I thought I shouldn't chance it,

307
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:18,874
what with the Alzheimer's and all.

308
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,087
Why didn't you wake me?

309
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,012
What are these, Grant?

310
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,527
Those are the documents
you're supposed to sign

311
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:36,347
if you decide to go to Meadowlake.

312
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,322
That is exactly
what I have decided.

313
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,114
You were to go and sign these
and leave them there.

314
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,695
I wouldn't be allowed
to visit you for 30 days.

315
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:56,951
30 days isn't such a long time
after 44 years.

316
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:58,744
I don't think I like the place.

317
00:29:02,972 --> 00:29:08,374
I don't think we should be looking
for something we like, Grant.

318
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,412
I don't think we'll ever find that.

319
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:15,318
I think all we can aspire
to in this situation

320
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,845
is a little bit of grace.

321
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:03,123
I suppose I'll be
dressed up all the time.

322
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:09,369
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.

323
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,873
How do I look?

324
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,054
Just like always.

325
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,751
Just as you've always looked.

326
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,676
And how does that look?

327
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:23,987
Direct and vague...

328
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,577
sweet and ironic.

329
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,969
Is that how I look?

330
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:49,656
Oh. Remember?

331
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,105
Surprised, Grant?

332
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:55,580
No, I'm not surprised.

333
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,961
I'm just grateful
you can remember that.

334
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:01,907
I'm not all gone, Grant. Just...

335
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,218
going...

336
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,427
There are things
I wish would go away.

337
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:16,310
But won't. You know.
Things we don't talk about.

338
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:23,958
You never left me.

339
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,339
You still made love to me,

340
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:28,056
despite disturbing demands elsewhere.

341
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:37,017
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.

342
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:42,905
What could you do but be a part of the time
you were a part of?

343
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:45,276
All those pretty girls.

344
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,861
Didn't seem like anyone
was willing to be left out.

345
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,355
I think you did all right,

346
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:55,764
compared to some
of your colleagues.

347
00:31:55,837 --> 00:31:58,172
Those who left their wives.

348
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:02,935
And the women who
wouldn't put up with it.

349
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:10,844
I think people are too demanding.

350
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,139
People want to be in love
every single day.

351
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:18,646
What a liability. And then that silly girl.

352
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:20,473
That silly girl Veronica.

353
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:24,247
Girls that age
are always going around

354
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,578
saying they're going
to kill themselves.

355
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,140
But that was that.

356
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:32,605
Promised me a new life.

357
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,774
We moved out here,

358
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:38,107
that is exactly what you gave me.

359
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:42,138
How long ago was that?

360
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:45,108
20 years.

361
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:50,874
God, that's shocking.

362
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:57,171
So you see, I'm going...

363
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:59,733
but I'm not gone.

364
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:29,562
- Fiona.
- Grant.

365
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:33,523
Don't go.

366
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,876
That's what is happening, Grant.

367
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,916
It's happening... right now.

368
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:10,932
Fiona.

369
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:14,780
Hello. I'm checking in today.

370
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:16,569
My name is Fiona Andersson.

371
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,783
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.

372
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:19,642
We have your room
all ready for you.

373
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,205
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,

374
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:22,358
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.

375
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,731
I'll go fetch her. She's expecting you.

376
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:25,878
Thank you.

377
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:28,020
Fiona.

378
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:30,492
Grant.

379
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:32,118
I can't go away from you like this.

380
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,893
We had nothing
to tie us down, Grant.

381
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,641
You could have just driven away
and forsaken me.

382
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,012
But you didn't.

383
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,175
I thank you for that.

384
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:51,869
- Mrs. Andersson.
- Oh, hello.

385
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,909
- How do you do? I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.

386
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:55,508
Should I give you two a moment?

387
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,437
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.

388
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,226
All right, then, well,
we'll get you settled in your room,

389
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,203
and then I'd like to give you
a tour of the facility.

390
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:03,733
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.
- Right this way.

391
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:13,170
So, as you can see,
we get a lot of natural light.

392
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:16,924
Here we go.

393
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:27,226
Yes. This'll do just fine.

394
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,596
Good. I'm so glad
you like it. Now, is...

395
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:31,254
is this all you brought
with you today?

396
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:33,081
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.

397
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,844
Well, if you need any help arranging things,
you just let me know.

398
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:42,041
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.

399
00:35:42,111 --> 00:35:45,427
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say
good-bye to my husband.

400
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:49,812
We haven't been apart for a month
for the last 44 years.

401
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,064
It could be quite something.

402
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,660
Okay.

403
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:01,015
Please, Fiona.

404
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:06,613
Grant.

405
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,206
Fiona...

406
00:36:09,278 --> 00:36:11,318
You know what I'd like?

407
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,472
I'd like to make love,

408
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:19,641
and then I'd like you to go.

409
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,020
Because I need to stay here,

410
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,875
and if you make it hard for me,

411
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:25,331
I might cry so hard
I'll never stop.

412
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,676
Go now.

413
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:02,872
Go now.

414
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:47,605
"All of the officers

415
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,053
"were from outside
the local area,

416
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:51,028
"and it probably had not
entered their minds

417
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,656
"that almost all of us
were named McDonald.

418
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:55,930
"Nobody moved except for
the shuffling of feet.

419
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:58,267
The red roo"...Hey.

420
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:00,506
- Hello, there.
- Kristy. We met on your tour.

421
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:02,036
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?

422
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,150
I'm wondering if I could have

423
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:06,197
a moment of your time
to ask your advice?

424
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:08,442
Oh, sure. I was just
reading to Mr. Burke here.

425
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,721
Maybe when we finish this chapter,

426
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,645
I can come find you
in the dining room?

427
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,750
Sure. That's fine.

428
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:18,711
"The red roof lights
revolved in the afternoon sun,

429
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:20,637
and even the dogs were
temporarily quiet."

430
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:38,739
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?

431
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,670
Going down the center
of the dining room...

432
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,637
That's Frank. He used to be the play-by-play
guy for the Winnipeg Jets.

433
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:45,685
- Really?
- Yeah.

434
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,541
He loved his job too much to retire.

435
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,516
Frank's on the second floor.

436
00:38:54,303 --> 00:39:01,787
I just... My wife has always been
sort of a different sort of person.

437
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:06,394
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be
confirmed until after...

438
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:08,699
And on our way here today,

439
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,425
we passed this conservation area

440
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:13,561
where we went
for a walk last spring.

441
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:15,770
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.

442
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,628
Oh, those are
beautiful, aren't they?

443
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:20,411
Yes, they really made
an impression, see?

444
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:22,715
And even though the whole
place was covered in snow,

445
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:25,335
she said, "Oh, remember?"

446
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,845
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.

447
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:33,148
And isn't the short-term memory
the thing that goes first?

448
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:37,524
Well, yeah, but not all at once.

449
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,973
And what's comforting

450
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,039
is the long-term memory sometimes
stays for quite a long time.

451
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:47,068
Yeah, her long-term memory
seems quite intact.

452
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,550
But when she mentioned that,
about the skunk lilies,

453
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:53,306
it was all I could do not
to turn the truck around.

454
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:59,670
What if this is just her
just being herself?

455
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,914
She's far too young to...

456
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:05,178
She is young.

457
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:07,964
And it is hard.

458
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,452
No doubt about that.

459
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,566
A month is a real long time.

460
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:18,266
I mean, between you and me,
I don't know about the policy myself.

461
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,269
I think it makes it easier for the staff
is what I think.

462
00:40:21,342 --> 00:40:25,303
Look. I'll give you my pager number.

463
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:28,212
You can call me
whenever you want.

464
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,708
You can call me every day
if you feel like it.

465
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:36,315
I don't know what to do.

466
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:40,797
Mr. Andersson,
your wife wrote you this note,

467
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:42,936
and she asked me to pass it along.

468
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:53,751
Okay.

469
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,818
Thank you so much.

470
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:28,473
"Throughout much of the thinking brain,

471
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:33,464
gooey plaques now crowd neurons
from outside the cell membranes."

472
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,725
"And knotty tangles

473
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:42,612

"All told, tens of millions
of synapses dissolve away."

475

476
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,007

479

"It is like a series

481
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:23,323
That's a great-Iooking coffee maker.

482
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,563
I always meant to get one of those.

483
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:30,589
I saw they had them on sale
at Canadian Tire.

484
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:33,787
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.

485
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,895
They live in Kamloops, B.C.

486
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:39,228
They send us more stuff
than we can handle.

487
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:43,071
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money
to come see us instead.

488
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,261
I suppose they're busy
with their own lives.

489
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,662
Not so busy they couldn't
go to Hawaii last year.

490
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,037
I mean, you could understand it

491
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,886
if there was someone
in the family closer at hand,

492
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:57,400
but, uh... he's the only one.

493
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:04,631
People do get Ionely,

494
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:08,119
especially when they're deprived
of seeing someone they care about.

495
00:44:12,288 --> 00:44:14,393
Fiona, for instance.

496
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,843
My wife.

497
00:44:18,912 --> 00:44:21,333
I thought you said
you went and visited her.

498
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,010
I do.

499
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,600
No, that's not it.

500
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,744
She's really settling in well.

501
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:32,158
Good. Good.

502
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:34,012
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow,
Mr. Andersson.

503
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,316
Right. So I'll see you
tomorrow morning, then.

504
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:39,417
Now, remember,
she may be a little surprised to see you.

505
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:42,842
Don't be shaken by that.

506
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:45,084
Just... She hasn't seen you in a while.

507
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:47,126
She's sort of settled in here.

508
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:50,493
I understand.

509
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:06,709
There you are. I'll walk you down to her.

510
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:09,085
Wow. Narcissus this early.

511
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:11,191
You must have spent a fortune.

512
00:45:11,263 --> 00:45:13,784
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.

513
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:15,797
It's great to see you.

514
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:18,424
I'm gonna help you find
your sweater, Mrs. Albright.

515
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:21,976
All right. Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.

516
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,316
You remember from last time
you were here, don't you?

517
00:45:24,384 --> 00:45:27,417
Her nameplate's right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.

518
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:10,075
There she is. Now you just
go over and say hello,

519
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:13,853
and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...

520
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:15,862
Well, just go ahead.

521
00:46:34,176 --> 00:46:37,405
Bridge. Deadly serious.

522
00:46:37,472 --> 00:46:40,700
Quite rabid about it.

523
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,965
I can remember being like that
at college for a while.

524
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:48,766
My friends and I would cut class
and sit in the common room and smoke

525
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:51,035
and play like cutthroats.

526
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:52,664
One's name was Phoebe.

527
00:46:52,736 --> 00:46:54,198
I don't remember the others.

528
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,766
Phoebe Hart.

529
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,491
Oh, you knew her, too.

530
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,277
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?

531
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:03,962
I'm afraid the coffee's
not up to much here.

532
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:05,210
I don't drink tea.

533
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,102
Oh.

534
00:47:07,168 --> 00:47:08,793
I brought you some flowers.

535
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:11,679
I thought they might do
to brighten up your room.

536
00:47:11,744 --> 00:47:14,013
I went to your room,
but you weren't there.

537
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,414
Well, no, I'm here.

538
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,478
So you've made a new friend.

539
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,250
Oh, that's just Aubrey.

540
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,273
The funny thing is I knew
him years and years ago.

541
00:47:29,344 --> 00:47:30,905
He used to work in the store,

542
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:34,522
the hardware store where
my grandpa used to shop.

543
00:47:34,592 --> 00:47:37,309
He and I were always kidding around,

544
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:40,693
but he never could get up
the nerve to ask me out.

545
00:47:40,768 --> 00:47:43,802
Until the very last weekend,
he took me to a ball game.

546
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:48,694
But my grandpa showed up
to drive us home.

547
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:51,965
I was up visiting for the summer.

548
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:54,968
Visiting my grandparents.

549
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,112
They lived in a cottage on a lake.

550
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:01,565
Fiona, I know where
your grandparents lived.

551
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,323
It's where we lived. We live.

552
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:05,914
Really?

553
00:48:07,712 --> 00:48:09,206
I'd better go back.

554
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,768
He thinks he can't play
without me sitting there.

555
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,655
It's silly. I hardly
know the game anymore.

556
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,694
I'm afraid you'll have
to excuse me.

557
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,848
Will you be through soon?

558
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,829
We should be. I mean, it depends.

559
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:22,522
If you asked that grim-Iooking
lady over there nicely,

560
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:24,894
she'll get you a cup of tea.

561
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:27,897
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?

562
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:31,197
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.

563
00:48:31,264 --> 00:48:33,817
But you'll be surprised
how soon you get used to it.

564
00:48:33,888 --> 00:48:36,376
You'll get to know who everybody is,

565
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:40,474
except that some of them
are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?

566
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:45,498
Can't expect them all
to get to know who you are.

567
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:04,215
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?

568
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:07,158
Do you think I'd look
good with red hair?

569
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,022
You caught her at sort of a bad moment,
involved in a game.

570
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:31,292
She isn't even playing.

571
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,531
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.

572
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,583
Now, who is Aubrey?

573
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,696
That's who he is, Aubrey.

574
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:38,198
You know, they get
these attachments.

575
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:40,061
That kind of takes over for a while.

576
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:42,016
Best buddy kind of thing.

577
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,389
Sort of a phase.

578
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,206
Does she even know who I am?

579
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:49,663
No, she might not.

580
00:50:49,729 --> 00:50:53,045
Not today, and then,
tomorrow you never know.

581
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,990
Things change back and forth all the time.

582
00:50:56,065 --> 00:50:58,879
You'll see the way it is
once you get used to coming here.

583
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:00,603
You'll learn not to take it so personal.

584
00:51:00,673 --> 00:51:03,455
Learn to take it day by day.

585
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:27,292
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:29,598
I'll have to go and fix that now.

587
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,662
Here's Yung Menenikenaha,

588
00:52:00,736 --> 00:52:04,249
desperately clinging
to his one-stroke lead.

589
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,847
Here's the swing.

590
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:07,580
It doesn't look good.

591
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:10,169
Looks like he's pushed it
out to the right.

592
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:12,063
It lands 25 feet from the green.

593
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,722
This must be disappointing.

594
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:16,214
It doesn't look good
for Yung Menenikenaha.

595
00:52:16,288 --> 00:52:18,198
He was three strokes
on the happy side of par

596
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:19,320
until these last three holes.

597
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:27,806
Look at you, Mr. Andersson.

598
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:30,393
I think you might be
one of our most frequent visitors.

599
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:40,351
Hi, Fiona.

600
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,392
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?

601
00:52:42,465 --> 00:52:44,287
I brought you some books.

602
00:52:44,353 --> 00:52:46,741
They don't seem to have
an awful lot around here.

603
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:48,988
<i>Letters from Iceland by Auden.</i>

604
00:52:49,057 --> 00:52:52,221
We always meant to read that together,
didn't we?

605
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:54,526
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?

606
00:52:54,593 --> 00:52:55,837
Well, I don't know.

607
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:58,523
Um, Aubrey's card game
starts in a few minutes,

608
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,349
and then we usually go walking,

609
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:01,846
and then he does his drawing...

610
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,084
Or perhaps you can find
a bit of time later on.

611
00:53:05,153 --> 00:53:06,495
Um, I'll stay here.

612
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:08,349
Or I'll come back in a few hours.

613
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,784
Oh, you are persistent,
aren't you?

614
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:34,106
Up comes Kapanen... Boy, oh, boy!

615
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,087
Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.

616
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:38,202
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.

617
00:53:38,273 --> 00:53:40,030
Here are the Leafs again,
led by Andreychuk.

618
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:41,342
He carries it over the blue line,

619
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,936
winds up a shot right on!

620
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:45,049
The bounce, the rebound
comes back behind the net.

621
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,299
McCabe couldn't get to it.

622
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,547
It goes back on the left wing

623
00:53:47,618 --> 00:53:50,170
and here come the Flyers
led by Roenick again.

624
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:52,346
Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome
this two has been.

625
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:53,944
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.

626
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:55,708
- Go for it, Frank.
- Over to the right side.

627
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:56,921
Here we go again. The Leafs again.

628
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:59,360
Here's Sundin carrying it
up over the line.

629
00:53:59,425 --> 00:54:02,011
Can't get a shot away
and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.

630
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:04,416
A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia
over on the left wing...

631
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:07,131
I just came down to say
Aubrey is having his nap

632
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,924
if you'd like to, um, talk.

633
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:10,749
Oh, sure.

634
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:12,890
Can we go somewhere
a little more private?

635
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,455
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!

636
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:15,958
If... If you'd like.

637
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:18,717
And Philly wins this series
by a score of 3-2.

638
00:54:18,785 --> 00:54:20,247
That's it this season for the Leafs.

639
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:22,623
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.

640
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:24,217
Philadelphia wins 3-2.

641
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:26,231
The game is over
in sudden-death overtime.

642
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:48,732
Y-You said you had
some books for me?

643
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:50,230
This.

644
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:53,558
<i>Letters from Iceland.</i>

645
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:55,095
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.

646
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:59,712
Yes. That's right.

647
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:02,909
Now... where is Iceland?

648
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:10,305
Well, Iceland is
in the middle of the Atlantic.

649
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:12,606
It's an island.

650
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:16,281
Youngest country in the world.

651
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:18,426
It's constantly erupting.

652
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:22,010
Volcanoes, earthquakes.

653
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:25,627
It's always shaking itself off.

654
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:30,043
Wouldn't it be nice to come
from a young country?

655
00:55:30,113 --> 00:55:32,350
You do. That's where you're from.

656
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:35,646
That's where
your people are from.

657
00:55:35,714 --> 00:55:40,187
They immigrated here in the late 1800s.

658
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:42,560
But that's where you're from, Fiona.

659
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:47,896
And I teach... Well, I taught
the myths from there.

660
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,049
Norse mythology.

661
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:50,496
l-I must have been there, then.

662
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:52,088
Have I been there?

663
00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:54,166
No.

664
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:57,248
Oh.

665
00:55:57,314 --> 00:55:58,972
Why not? Wasn't I curious?

666
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:02,941
You were very curious.

667
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,016
Very curious.

668
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:09,180
You always said
there ought to be one place

669
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,933
that you knew about
and you thought about

670
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,691
and maybe even longed for,

671
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:15,768
but you did never did get to see.

672
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:24,605
Did I say that?

673
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:26,365
Yes, you said that.

674
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:42,620
Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.

675
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:45,275
He'll be wanting a little
walk around, I suppose.

676
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:46,328
It was nice chatting.

677
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,823
You'll be back again
tomorrow, I suppose?

678
00:56:48,897 --> 00:56:52,443
Fiona, what are you doing...

679
00:56:52,514 --> 00:56:54,009
What are you doing with Aubrey?

680
00:56:57,154 --> 00:57:00,569
He doesn't confuse me.

681
00:57:00,642 --> 00:57:03,064
He doesn't confuse me at all.

682
00:57:07,297 --> 00:57:10,265
Well, it's been nice chatting.

683
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:12,858
I'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

684
00:57:32,193 --> 00:57:36,056
These affections between residents,
do they ever go too far?

685
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:38,745
Well, that depends
on what you mean.

686
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:41,371
The problem we have here, it's funny.

687
00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:43,230
It's actually often the ones

688
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:45,338
who haven't been friendly
with each other at all.

689
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:46,937
I mean, they maybe
don't even know each other

690
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,345
beyond knowing, like,
is it a man or is it a woman?

691
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,751
And you'd think it'd be the old guys

692
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:52,509
trying to crawl in bed
with the old ladies,

693
00:57:52,578 --> 00:57:54,138
but half the time
it's the other way around.

694
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:56,927
It's the old ladies
going after the old men.

695
00:57:56,994 --> 00:57:59,066
It could be they aren't so worn out.

696
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:10,361
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.

697
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:12,375
Fiona is a lady.

698
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:14,817
She's a real lady.

699
00:58:16,418 --> 00:58:19,451
I sometimes wonder...

700
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:21,430
You wonder what?

701
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:29,023
I wonder if she isn't putting on
some kind of... charade.

702
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,912
A what?

703
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,498
Some kind of act.

704
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:36,984
Maybe some kind of punishment.

705
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:42,143
Why would she do that?

706
00:58:48,546 --> 00:58:50,172
Oh.

707
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,065
Are you getting tired?

708
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,439
- No.
- Are you certain...

709
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,554
Excuse me.

710
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:32,601
Yes, Mr. Andersson?

711
00:59:32,675 --> 00:59:35,096
How can I help you?

712
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:36,828
Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.

713
00:59:36,898 --> 00:59:39,167
Well, it's pretty, isn't it?

714
00:59:39,234 --> 00:59:40,642
No, it's not pretty. It's tacky.

715
00:59:40,707 --> 00:59:43,357
- She would never wear it.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

716
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:46,742
You can talk to the duty attendant
on Mrs. Andersson's wing.

717
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:48,761
Boy, it's a marvel, really,

718
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:51,289
the way she's getting him up
and out of that chair.

719
00:59:57,666 --> 00:59:59,160
Can you manage?

720
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:03,129
Will you be all right?

721
01:00:03,202 --> 01:00:04,990
I'll be back in a second.

722
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,919
Fiona, I'm your husband.

723
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:11,808
Fiona, it's Grant.

724
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,979
We've been married for 45 years.

725
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:17,246
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.

726
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:19,201
We had a good life together.

727
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:21,983
Those are your words,
Fiona, not mine.

728
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:24,057
That is not your sweater.

729
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:31,872
It's all right.

730
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:34,621
It's all right. It's all right.

731
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,283
I'm coming straight back.

732
01:00:36,354 --> 01:00:37,728
I'm coming straight back.

733
01:00:37,794 --> 01:00:39,769
It's going to be all right.

734
01:00:57,698 --> 01:01:00,633
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.

735
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:06,271
Please...

736
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,665
don't.

737
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:14,079
Please, please don't.

738
01:01:17,378 --> 01:01:19,931
You're very persistent, aren't you?

739
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:29,053
I wish l...

740
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:30,911
Wish I knew what...

741
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:42,204
We'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

742
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:26,168
You're not doing
too well, are you?

743
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,184
Well, no big surprise.

744
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:31,258
What we're handling isn't so easy.

745
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:34,684
I thought when I married,

746
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:38,050
I'd be with someone to the final stretch.

747
01:02:38,115 --> 01:02:41,344
I'm betting you thought the same.

748
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:43,384
Well, didn't work out.

749
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:51,482
So, I, uh, think
you're here for a reason.

750
01:02:51,555 --> 01:02:54,904
I'm the kind of person you can
say things flat out to, so shoot.

751
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:01,754
I wonder if you would consider
taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake,

752
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:04,576
maybe just for a visit.

753
01:03:04,642 --> 01:03:08,025
Or I suppose I could take Aubrey
out there myself.

754
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:09,625
I wouldn't mind that at all.

755
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,251
Homemade.

756
01:03:23,075 --> 01:03:24,285
Really?

757
01:03:26,947 --> 01:03:30,263
No. No, I can't do that.

758
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,608
And the reason is
I don't want to upset him.

759
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,235
But wouldn't he understand
it was just a visit?

760
01:03:34,306 --> 01:03:37,024
He understands everything.

761
01:03:37,091 --> 01:03:39,195
Now, if I go to all that trouble,

762
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:41,852
I'd prefer to take him someplace
that'd be more fun?

763
01:03:41,923 --> 01:03:44,378
It would make more sense
to take him to the mall

764
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:45,760
where there are kids and whatnot.

765
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:48,160
And then I'd have to get him all ready,

766
01:03:48,227 --> 01:03:49,656
maneuver him into the car.

767
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:51,902
He's a big man. He's not that easy to manage.

768
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:53,760
Even if I agreed to do it?

769
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:55,233
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.

770
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,575
You couldn't manage him.

771
01:03:56,642 --> 01:03:58,552
And he wouldn't stand
your doing for him.

772
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:03,133
And after all that, what would he get out of it?

773
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:27,096
Smoke?

774
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:29,145
No. No, thanks.

775
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:31,107
What, did you never,
or did you quit?

776
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,633
I quit.

777
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:33,788
How long ago?

778
01:04:33,859 --> 01:04:38,366
Oh, 30 years, maybe more.

779
01:04:38,435 --> 01:04:39,809
I quit quitting.

780
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,994
Just made a resolution to quit quitting,
that's all.

781
01:04:46,435 --> 01:04:49,534
So your wife's depressed, huh?

782
01:04:50,658 --> 01:04:52,569
What's her name again? I forget.

783
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:54,137
Fiona.

784
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:56,153
And how old were you when you met?

785
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:58,464
She was 18.

786
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:00,865
Holy, that's pretty young
to get married, eh?

787
01:05:05,123 --> 01:05:06,400
Wasn't my idea.

788
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,571
You mean she proposed to you?

789
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,169
Well, that's lovely,
that's what I think.

790
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:11,170
How'd she do it?

791
01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:13,690
She hadn't planned it necessarily.

792
01:05:13,763 --> 01:05:17,146
We were in Tobermory
waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin,

793
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,121
and it was miserable and rainy,

794
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:23,708
and she was in a good mood.

795
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:25,502
She didn't want any part
of my sour mood.

796
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,091
And what'd she do, what'd she say?

797
01:05:28,163 --> 01:05:32,768
Well, she said,
"Do you think it'd be fun...

798
01:05:32,836 --> 01:05:36,218
Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

799
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,753
And what did you say?

800
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:39,169
I took her up on it.

801
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,308
I shouted yes.

802
01:05:45,795 --> 01:05:48,283
I never wanted
to be away from her.

803
01:05:50,467 --> 01:05:52,475
She had the spark of life.

804
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:56,706
You know, nothing can take away

805
01:05:56,771 --> 01:06:00,732
what's happened to you
and what you've experienced.

806
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:02,494
I don't think so, anyway.

807
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:07,648
Even if it goes away somehow,
it's still there.

808
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,624
It's still what you are.

809
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:12,832
It's curious.

810
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:14,110
What's curious?

811
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,408
All of that "madly in love" business.

812
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:19,035
The beginning.

813
01:06:19,107 --> 01:06:24,258
I hear myself tell the story,
and it all sounds so crucial.

814
01:06:26,147 --> 01:06:28,001
I suppose it is.

815
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,238
But compared to what we ended up with,

816
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:32,478
until recently...

817
01:06:34,371 --> 01:06:38,081
all of that seems
so superficial somehow.

818
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:21,666
Not such a fun place to visit, eh?

819
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:22,625
Excuse me?

820
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:26,171
Not such a fun place to visit.

821
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,934
Fucking depressing.

822
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:30,530
No offense.

823
01:07:30,595 --> 01:07:31,904
None taken.

824
01:07:33,827 --> 01:07:36,958
No one came to visit you, huh?

825
01:07:37,028 --> 01:07:38,751
That must suck huge.

826
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,267
Well, it would suck huge,
but I don't live here.

827
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:44,281
I'm just visiting someone.

828
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,495
Who? Which one?

829
01:07:46,564 --> 01:07:49,695
Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.

830
01:07:49,763 --> 01:07:51,137
The one sitting with her husband?

831
01:07:51,203 --> 01:07:53,593
- You might say that.
- Why wouldn't you?

832
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:55,773
I wouldn't say that
because I'm her husband.

833
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,120
So why aren't you sitting with her, then?

834
01:08:03,396 --> 01:08:06,495
Just learned to give her some space.

835
01:08:06,564 --> 01:08:08,571
She's in love with that man
she's sitting with.

836
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:11,099
I don't like to disturb her.

837
01:08:11,172 --> 01:08:13,408
I just like to see her, I suppose.

838
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:16,923
Make sure she's
doing well, you know?

839
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:22,396
I suppose that must seem
rather pathetic.

840
01:08:24,452 --> 01:08:26,688
I should be so lucky.

841
01:08:32,452 --> 01:08:33,761
Come on.

842
01:08:57,795 --> 01:08:59,323
She's not here.

843
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:01,086
She's sick.

844
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:03,523
He's not here, either.

845
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:34,299
I brought you a book.

846
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,477
It's all about Iceland.

847
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,784
Thought you might like to take a look at it.

848
01:09:38,851 --> 01:09:40,891
Why, thank you.

849
01:09:42,276 --> 01:09:44,697
Oh, what is it, dear heart?

850
01:09:44,771 --> 01:09:47,619
What is it? Oh, I see.

851
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,823
Here. Here. Here.

852
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:52,128
Here, here, yes.

853
01:09:54,788 --> 01:09:57,602
Do you by any chance have
any influence around here?

854
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:01,083
I've seen you talking to them.

855
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:05,149
Oh.

856
01:10:07,844 --> 01:10:09,055
We'll get to see each other.

857
01:10:09,124 --> 01:10:12,735
You'll see. We have to.

858
01:10:12,803 --> 01:10:15,487
I'll come and see you,

859
01:10:15,555 --> 01:10:18,076
and you'll come and see me.

860
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:27,610
You know, I just wish his wife
would hurry up and get here.

861
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:30,979
I wish she'd get him out of here
and cut the agony short.

862
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:32,353
Should I stay?

863
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,136
Don't worry. She's not sick, you know.

864
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:38,521
To keep her company.

865
01:10:38,596 --> 01:10:41,214
Well, they have to learn to get
over these things by themselves.

866
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:44,633
They've got short memories,
and that's not always so bad.

867
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:48,317
Okay?

868
01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:17,240
Fiona. Her name is Fiona.

869
01:11:17,317 --> 01:11:18,526
And what's yours?

870
01:11:18,595 --> 01:11:21,793
I don't think I was ever told that.

871
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,130
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Grant.

872
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,515
Hello, Grant.

873
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:30,490
I'm Marian.

874
01:11:33,924 --> 01:11:36,826
Well, now that we know
each other's name,

875
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:41,057
I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.

876
01:11:41,124 --> 01:11:45,858
I don't know if he's still
so stuck on seeing your...

877
01:11:45,924 --> 01:11:47,004
seeing Fiona.

878
01:11:47,076 --> 01:11:49,727
I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.

879
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:52,992
But I don't feel like
putting him back in there

880
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,394
in case it turns out
to be more than that.

881
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,948
I don't want him
getting hard to handle.

882
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,533
I don't have any help. It's just me here.

883
01:12:01,604 --> 01:12:02,880
I'm it.

884
01:12:02,949 --> 01:12:04,093
It is very hard for you.

885
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:06,946
Did... Did you ever consider
his going in there for good?

886
01:12:07,012 --> 01:12:10,045
No. I'm keeping him right here.

887
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,451
Well, that's very good
and noble of you.

888
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:13,858
Oh, you think so?

889
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:17,721
Well, noble is not
what I'm thinking about.

890
01:12:17,797 --> 01:12:19,684
No, but it isn't easy.

891
01:12:19,748 --> 01:12:21,756
No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.

892
01:12:21,828 --> 01:12:25,440
If I pay to put him in there,
I won't hold on to the house,

893
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,810
and the house is the only thing
we own outright.

894
01:12:30,564 --> 01:12:34,339
And it means a lot to me,
this house does.

895
01:12:34,404 --> 01:12:36,030
It's very nice.

896
01:12:37,092 --> 01:12:40,027
Well, I guess it's all right.

897
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,416
I've done a lot on it,
fixing it up, keeping it up.

898
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,314
Yes, I can see
that you have... you do.

899
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:47,268
- I don't want to lose it.
- No.

900
01:12:47,332 --> 01:12:49,504
- I'm not going to lose it.
- I see your point.

901
01:12:49,572 --> 01:12:51,427
See, the company
left us high and dry.

902
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:57,025
In the end, they said
he owed them money.

903
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:03,071
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.

904
01:13:04,324 --> 01:13:08,285
But I'm not supposed
to ask, so I shut up.

905
01:13:08,356 --> 01:13:09,818
You've been married, huh?

906
01:13:09,892 --> 01:13:12,609
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.

907
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,324
And then, in the middle of all this,

908
01:13:16,388 --> 01:13:21,277
he gets sick from this virus,
and he goes into a coma.

909
01:13:25,956 --> 01:13:30,234
So that pretty much
takes him off the hook, hmm?

910
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:34,081
It's bad luck.

911
01:13:35,429 --> 01:13:38,145
It's, no, just life.

912
01:13:41,444 --> 01:13:43,266
Can't beat life.

913
01:13:44,901 --> 01:13:46,243
No.

914
01:13:57,572 --> 01:13:59,874
Oh. Hello.

915
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:41,498
Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.

916
01:14:43,748 --> 01:14:45,723
I don't have any books.

917
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,693
Oh, there are some.

918
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,588
<i>Letters from Iceland.</i>

919
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:06,237
"Isn't it true,
however far we've wandered

920
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:08,830
"into our provinces
of persecution,

921
01:15:08,901 --> 01:15:13,057
"where our regrets accuse,
we keep returning

922

"back to the common faith

923
01:15:14,821 --> 01:15:17,187

01:15:17,252 --> 01:15:20,897

925
01:15:20,964 --> 01:15:24,313
"Children are always there

926
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:26,244
"even when they are most terrified.

927
01:15:26,309 --> 01:15:30,564

928
01:15:30,628 --> 01:15:33,727
"Artist and doctor return most often.

929
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:36,928
"Only the mad will never,

930
01:15:36,997 --> 01:15:39,779
"For doctors keep
on worrying while away,

931
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:44,285
"in case their skill

932

"Lovers have lived so long

933
01:15:48,165 --> 01:15:51,580
"they want belief again

934
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:54,686
"And the artist prays ever so gently,

935
01:15:54,757 --> 01:15:58,302

like bodies."'

940
01:16:13,572 --> 01:16:16,125
To all the men and women
of the United States Armed Forces

941
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:18,618
now in the Middle East,
the peace of a troubled world

942
01:16:18,693 --> 01:16:23,931
and the hopes of an oppressed people
now depend on you.

943
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:25,827
How could they forget Vietnam?

944
01:16:25,892 --> 01:16:27,933
The air strike started again
at 5 A. M. this morning

945
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:29,893
and lasted for three hours.

946
01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:34,910
Roadside explosions have killed
eight Iraqi civilians and one U.S. soldier.

947
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:45,245
Here you go.

948
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:49,315
Next time you do it, just go pick it up, okay?

949
01:16:55,173 --> 01:16:57,442
Her muscles are deteriorating.

950
01:16:57,509 --> 01:16:58,687
If she doesn't improve soon,

951
01:16:58,757 --> 01:17:01,626
we're going to have to
put her on a walker.

952
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:03,228
I keep trying to get her walking,

953
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:05,243
but she doesn't seem
to want to go anywhere.

954
01:17:05,317 --> 01:17:08,732
But, you know, once they get on a walker,
they start to depend on it,

955
01:17:08,805 --> 01:17:10,692
and then they don't want
to walk much anymore,

956
01:17:10,757 --> 01:17:13,440
just get wherever it is they have to go.

957
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:15,419
You're going to have to
work at her harder.

958
01:17:15,493 --> 01:17:17,697
Try and encourage her.

959
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:19,042
Sorry.

960
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,362
Here you go.

961
01:17:37,604 --> 01:17:39,808
Mrs. Andersson.

962
01:17:39,877 --> 01:17:42,244
How would you like to go on a field trip?

963
01:18:23,045 --> 01:18:26,013
They've kept it so like it was.

964
01:18:28,262 --> 01:18:30,880
Who has?

965
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:33,120
The people who live here.

966
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:41,696
But everything...

967
01:19:48,037 --> 01:19:51,333
Everything just reminds me of him.

968
01:19:52,933 --> 01:19:56,676
It wasn't enough, I suppose.

969
01:19:56,741 --> 01:19:58,683
Who, Fiona?

970
01:20:00,198 --> 01:20:02,653
Who does everything remind you of?

971
01:20:20,901 --> 01:20:24,217
I'd like to go home now,
if you don't mind.

972
01:20:29,381 --> 01:20:30,843
Now, as you know,

973
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:33,885
we don't do extended care
on the first floor.

974
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:37,853
I mean, we do it temporarily
if someone isn't feeling well.

975
01:20:37,925 --> 01:20:41,471
But if they progress too far,

976
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:45,316
we have to consider
moving upstairs.

977
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,451
Do you happen to have Aubrey's address?

978
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:52,955
I'm sorry?

979
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:59,422
Aubrey and his wife.

980
01:20:59,493 --> 01:21:01,762
Where do they live?

981
01:21:18,022 --> 01:21:22,048
Well, it was probably a mistake
putting him there in the first place,

982
01:21:22,118 --> 01:21:26,874
but I wasn't going to get another chance
to get away, so I took it.

983
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:28,357
Well, so...

984
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:31,973
Now I know better.

985
01:21:35,173 --> 01:21:37,410
Did your husband ever
work in a hardware store

986
01:21:37,478 --> 01:21:39,617
in the summers
when he was going to school?

987
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:43,330
No, I never heard about that.

988
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:44,893
But I wasn't raised here.

989
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:49,979
No. I didn't think so.

990
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:00,028
Thank you very much
for your time, Miriam.

991
01:22:00,102 --> 01:22:03,233
It's Marian.

992
01:22:03,302 --> 01:22:04,676
Sorry.

993
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:15,877
What a jerk.

994
01:22:34,662 --> 01:22:36,637
Yeah, maybe someone
could just drop in on her,

995
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:37,822
like, if the nurse is around.

996
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:40,316
All right.

997
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:42,049
No, I don't think there's much to it,

998
01:22:42,118 --> 01:22:43,809
but I'd like you to call me back.

999
01:22:43,879 --> 01:22:45,701
Okay.

1000
01:22:45,766 --> 01:22:47,839
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

1001
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,503
- Hey.
- Hi.

1002
01:22:54,086 --> 01:22:58,493
I think I want to ask you
about the second floor,

1003
01:22:58,566 --> 01:23:01,665
just to know a little more about it.

1004
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,938
Well, it's for people
who've really lost it.

1005
01:23:10,981 --> 01:23:13,632
What do they do, then?

1006
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:18,142
What happens after that?
After they've... Iost it?

1007
01:23:18,214 --> 01:23:20,036
You don't really want to know.

1008
01:23:20,102 --> 01:23:22,077
But, you know,
sometimes they get it back.

1009
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:24,735
They go into their room for a year,
they don't know you from Adam,

1010
01:23:24,805 --> 01:23:27,140
and then one day, it's,
"Oh, hi. When are we going home?"

1011
01:23:27,206 --> 01:23:29,475
I mean, all of a sudden,
they're back to normal.

1012
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:31,201
But it doesn't last for long.

1013
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:32,962
You think,
"Oh, wow, back to normal,"

1014
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:36,544
and then they're gone again, like so.

1015
01:23:39,303 --> 01:23:42,303
I haven't even asked you
about yourself.

1016
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,552
You married?

1017
01:23:43,621 --> 01:23:47,267
Well, technically, yeah, I guess.

1018
01:23:47,335 --> 01:23:49,276
Got three kids.

1019
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,903
Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.

1020
01:23:51,974 --> 01:23:53,917
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.

1021
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:56,259
Must be quite a struggle.

1022
01:23:56,326 --> 01:24:00,003
It, uh... knocks the wind
out of you every now and then,

1023
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:03,420
but you just pick yourself
back up like everyone else.

1024
01:24:05,126 --> 01:24:08,672
I suppose our lives
must seem easy to you.

1025
01:24:08,742 --> 01:24:12,091
We got through life
without too much going wrong.

1026
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:15,646
What we have to suffer
now, when we're old,

1027
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,060
hardly counts, I suppose.

1028
01:24:17,126 --> 01:24:19,396
That's what you must think.

1029
01:24:23,334 --> 01:24:25,669
Well, how would you
know what I think?

1030
01:24:25,735 --> 01:24:27,523
To tell you the truth, I'd rather be

1031
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:30,906
the one that stayed
than the one that left.

1032
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:33,438
I'll bet you weren't always
the doggedly devoted husband.

1033
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:35,779
Am I right?

1034
01:24:35,845 --> 01:24:39,228
I mean, you said that you wondered

1035
01:24:39,302 --> 01:24:43,426
if maybe she was punishing
you for something?

1036
01:24:43,494 --> 01:24:45,916
I'll bet you had something
pretty specific in mind, didn't you?

1037
01:24:48,837 --> 01:24:54,402
You know, you see a lot
of things in this job.

1038
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,926
You see the end of things
all day long.

1039
01:24:56,999 --> 01:24:58,940
And in my experience,
at the end of things

1040
01:24:59,014 --> 01:25:00,541
it's almost always
the men that think

1041
01:25:00,614 --> 01:25:03,843
that not too much went wrong.

1042
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:06,015
I wonder if your wife
feels the same way.

1043
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,339
I wonder that, too.

1044
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:13,022
I bet you do.

1045
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,797
Uh, hello, Grant.

1046
01:25:37,862 --> 01:25:40,196
I hope I got the right person.

1047
01:25:40,262 --> 01:25:42,018
I just thought of something.

1048
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:46,177
There is a dance here in town
at the Legion on Saturday night,

1049
01:25:46,246 --> 01:25:49,956
and I am on the supper committee,
which means I can bring a free guest.

1050
01:25:50,022 --> 01:25:54,659
So I wondered whether you would
happen to be interested in that.

1051
01:25:54,726 --> 01:25:56,798
Call me back
when you get a chance.

1052
01:25:56,871 --> 01:26:00,449
555-3457.

1053
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,661
I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.

1054
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:10,973
Well, you probably recognize
the voice, the accent.

1055
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:12,387
It's Marian.

1056
01:26:12,454 --> 01:26:14,756
I'm still not so used
to these machines,

1057
01:26:14,823 --> 01:26:17,572
and I wanted to say
I realize you're not single

1058
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:19,493
and I don't mean it that way.

1059
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:21,020
I'm not, either.

1060
01:26:21,094 --> 01:26:23,963
But it doesn't hurt
to get out once in a while.

1061
01:26:24,038 --> 01:26:26,460
Anyway, now I've said all this,

1062
01:26:26,535 --> 01:26:29,055
I really hope
it's you I'm talking to.

1063
01:26:29,126 --> 01:26:30,948
It did sound like your voice.

1064
01:26:31,014 --> 01:26:33,186
If you're interested, you can call me.

1065
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:36,124
And if you are not,
you don't need to bother.

1066
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:40,355
I just thought you might
like the chance to get out.

1067
01:26:40,422 --> 01:26:42,113
It's Marian speaking.

1068
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:46,942
I guess I already said that.

1069
01:26:47,014 --> 01:26:50,048
Okay, then. Good-bye.

1070
01:26:54,215 --> 01:26:55,708
"The desires of the heart

1071
01:26:55,782 --> 01:26:58,238
"are as crooked as corkscrews.

1072
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:00,514
"Not to be born is the best for man.

1073
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:04,096
"The second-best
is a formal order.

1074
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:08,127
The dance's pattern:
dance while you can."

1075
01:27:13,415 --> 01:27:16,349
Fiona?

1076
01:27:16,423 --> 01:27:19,172
Is there any way to let this go...

1077
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,865
do you think?

1078
01:27:25,255 --> 01:27:28,255
If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder

1079
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:30,465
when I bump into it again.

1080
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,277
Okay.

1081
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:45,060
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.

1082
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:48,475
The tune is catchy
and will not stop."

1083
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:51,933
"Dance till the stars

1084
01:27:52,006 --> 01:27:53,828
"come down from the rafters.

1085
01:27:53,895 --> 01:27:57,059
Dance, dance, dance
till you drop."

1086
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:04,828
Yes?

1087
01:28:04,903 --> 01:28:07,269
Hello, Marian.

1088
01:28:17,095 --> 01:28:18,273
So...

1089
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:21,957
There you are.

1090
01:28:23,334 --> 01:28:24,960
Here I am.

1091
01:28:27,879 --> 01:28:28,827
Thank you.

1092
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:55,589
What are you thinking?

1093
01:28:57,831 --> 01:28:59,620
Not an awful lot, really.

1094
01:29:01,575 --> 01:29:03,298
Skiing.

1095
01:29:06,663 --> 01:29:07,743
Downhill?

1096
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:10,940
Cross-country.

1097
01:29:13,798 --> 01:29:17,410
I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.

1098
01:29:22,631 --> 01:29:23,809
What are you thinking?

1099
01:29:25,512 --> 01:29:26,941
I'm thinking you never know

1100
01:29:27,015 --> 01:29:29,502
how things are going to turn out.

1101
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:35,425
You almost know...

1102
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:39,292
but you can never be quite sure.

1103
01:30:13,864 --> 01:30:15,521
Mr. Andersson?

1104
01:30:22,151 --> 01:30:23,712
Mr. Andersson?

1105
01:30:23,783 --> 01:30:25,725
Now, as you know, we're, uh,

1106
01:30:25,798 --> 01:30:27,392
we're going to have
to think about moving

1107
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:30,659
Mrs. Andersson upstairs
fairly soon, I'm afraid.

1108
01:30:30,727 --> 01:30:33,116
She hasn't been out of that bed
for two weeks now, and...

1109
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:36,607
I'm quite aware of your policies.

1110
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:38,686
I'm more than aware
of your bloody policies.

1111
01:30:41,447 --> 01:30:45,342
Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me
back to the second floor.

1112
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:47,357
The area to my right
are the elevators,

1113
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:51,140
and as we go on down the hall,
there's a man with a broken heart,

1114
01:30:51,206 --> 01:30:52,832
broken in a thousand pieces.

1115
01:30:52,903 --> 01:30:54,944
Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office,
past the lunchroom.

1116
01:30:55,015 --> 01:30:56,771
Hopefully, they're serving right now.

1117
01:30:56,839 --> 01:30:58,246
The cannelloni
was cold yesterday,

1118
01:30:58,311 --> 01:30:59,839
but let's see what it's doing today.

1119
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:01,766
Let's have... I gotta have
some Cokes again.

1120
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,686
That's what I'm going to do.

1121
01:31:06,343 --> 01:31:10,719
Wouldn't it be better if...

1122
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:13,661
when we go out again,

1123
01:31:13,736 --> 01:31:16,321
to put Aubrey
back into Meadowlake?

1124
01:31:16,392 --> 01:31:18,758
Just for a day?

1125
01:31:18,823 --> 01:31:20,482
What do you think?

1126
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:28,006
I'm thinking that sometimes you...

1127
01:31:28,072 --> 01:31:32,480
just have to make
the decision to be happy.

1128
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:36,580
Just decide.

1129
01:31:38,215 --> 01:31:41,477
Things aren't ever
what you hoped they'd be.

1130
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:43,430
Not ever, for anybody.

1131
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:48,801
The only thing that separates
one kind of person from another

1132
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:52,733
is there are some
who stay angry about it

1133
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:58,372
and there are some who...
accept what comes their way.

1134
01:31:59,816 --> 01:32:01,310
And which kind of person are you?

1135
01:32:02,631 --> 01:32:06,079
I was pretty mad about it.

1136
01:32:06,151 --> 01:32:09,053
But now...

1137
01:32:09,127 --> 01:32:13,699
Iooking at what came my way...

1138
01:32:18,088 --> 01:32:20,902
I think I could be
the other kind of person.

1139
01:32:23,944 --> 01:32:26,213
Quite the philosopher, huh?

1140
01:32:29,447 --> 01:32:31,073
Look, why don't you pull over here?

1141
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:35,170
Just... pull over, could you?

1142
01:32:50,407 --> 01:32:51,836
I know what you're doing.

1143
01:32:53,576 --> 01:32:58,497
It would be easier for me
if you could pretend a little.

1144
01:32:59,975 --> 01:33:02,015
Do you think you could do that?

1145
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:19,173
Now, what were we talking about?

1146
01:34:02,824 --> 01:34:05,671
She was the only one in her family
who bothered to learn sign language.

1147
01:34:07,015 --> 01:34:11,206
Now she can't remember how,
or maybe even who she is.

1148
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:12,701
Her daughter?

1149
01:34:12,775 --> 01:34:14,369
Yeah.

1150
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,928
It's left her pretty stranded.

1151
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,040
Marooned.

1152
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,720
You know, I thought of you the other day.

1153
01:34:22,792 --> 01:34:24,548
You know that billboard out in front

1154
01:34:24,616 --> 01:34:25,925
of the United Church in Bradford,

1155
01:34:25,992 --> 01:34:29,254
they post all that biblical-type stuff?

1156
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,703
The other day, it said,

1157
01:34:32,775 --> 01:34:33,757
"It's never too late

1158
01:34:33,831 --> 01:34:35,489
to become what you
might have been."

1159
01:34:37,576 --> 01:34:41,252
Doesn't sound all that biblical.

1160
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:43,523
Well, maybe they're
getting creative on us.

1161
01:36:07,016 --> 01:36:09,220
See you soon, Aubrey.

1162
01:36:48,873 --> 01:36:50,563
Oh, yeah.

1163
01:36:50,633 --> 01:36:52,007
Thanks.

1164
01:37:06,504 --> 01:37:07,933
Thanks.

1165
01:38:00,392 --> 01:38:02,399
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone

1166
01:38:02,472 --> 01:38:04,033
before you come in?

1167
01:38:05,321 --> 01:38:07,525
To explain things to her?

1168
01:38:22,408 --> 01:38:26,204
I found this beautiful book
about Iceland.

1169
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:29,445
You wouldn't think they'd leave
valuable books lying around.

1170
01:38:29,513 --> 01:38:33,157
People who stay here
aren't all necessarily honest.

1171
01:38:34,633 --> 01:38:39,335
And I think they got
the clothes mixed up.

1172
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,669
I never wear yellow.

1173
01:38:49,864 --> 01:38:52,799
I seem to remember you
reading this to me.

1174
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:57,441
You were trying
to make me feel better.

1175
01:38:59,529 --> 01:39:02,180
You tried so hard.

1176
01:39:05,641 --> 01:39:07,943
You're a lovely man, you know?

1177
01:39:09,064 --> 01:39:12,261
I'm a very lucky woman.

1178
01:39:12,328 --> 01:39:14,979
- Fiona?
- You've been gone a long time.

1179
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:16,511
Are we all checked out?

1180
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:19,487
I have a surprise for you.

1181
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,934
Do you remember Aubrey?

1182
01:39:47,496 --> 01:39:49,569
Names elude me.

1183
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:04,288
I'm happy to see you.

1184
01:40:09,066 --> 01:40:11,880
You could've just driven away.

1185
01:40:11,945 --> 01:40:17,030
Just driven away
without a care in the world

1186
01:40:17,098 --> 01:40:19,367
and forsook me.

1187
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:23,456
Forsooken me.

1188
01:40:25,161 --> 01:40:27,135
Forsaken.

1189
01:40:28,969 --> 01:40:30,856
Not a chance.
