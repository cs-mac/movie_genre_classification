1
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,556
<i>What a spectacle.</i>

2
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,158
<i>Millions and millions of stars.</i>

3
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,113
<i>Funny thing, the universe.</i>

4
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,158
<i>Sort of scares the shit out of you,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,234
<i>So where did it</i>
<i>all come from, do you think?</i>

6
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,311
<i>Don't know.</i>

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,876
<i>Just happened, I suppose.</i>

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,991
<i>So, what about when we die?</i>

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,477
<i>Nothing.</i>

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,278
<i>Nothing at all?</i>

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,597
What fathead has caused all this?

12
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,476
Listen... the first race has started.

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,313
Ridiculous.

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,392
All that money to sit in a queue.

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,677
Arthur! Just relax, will you?

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,079
I know, how about a song?

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,509
- There's been an accident.
- Where?!

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,068
I don't know, do I, fathead?!

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,594
That's what we're gonna find out.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,637
Why can't you just sit and wait
like everybody else?

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,518
- Show them the stethoscope, pet.
- What for?

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,398
- Let them know we're doctors.
- We'll do no such thing.

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,359
- What are you doing?
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,352
I'm a doctor, there's been an accident.
I'm a doctor.

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,279
<i>This is the way</i>
<i>that it was with my father.</i>

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,033
<i>Minor duplicities.</i>
<i>Little fiddles.</i>

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,715
<i>My childhood a web</i>
<i>of little scams and triumphs.</i>

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,917
<i>Parking where you shouldn't.</i>
<i>Drinking after hours.</i>

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,912
<i>The goods off the back of a lorry.</i>

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,117
<i>He was lost if he couldn't cheat</i>
<i>in a small way.</i>

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,795
<i>My father could talk his way</i>
<i>into and out of anything.</i>

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,511
- Tickets, sir.
- Certainly, here you are.

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,716
- These are blue tickets, sir.
- Exactly.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,190
That is the whole problem.
I've been sent the wrong tickets.

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,431
I'm sorry, sir. This entrance
is for private members only.

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,592
- You'll have to go back to queue.
- But I am a member. See?

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,717
Simpson, T, Trevor. Doctor, you see?

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,236
As a matter of fact, we're in a bit
of a rush. The lad wants a wee-wee.

39
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,839
- All right, Dr Simpson, in you go.
- Thank you very much.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,192
How about that, Blake?
Three bob tickets for just two bob.

41
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,316
Marvellous, bloody marvellous.

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,594
<i>My father seemed to me infallible.</i>

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,671
<i>Invincible.</i>

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,512
<i>Immortal, even.</i>

45
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,796
What do you think?

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,996
Very handsome.

47
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,076
- I hope I'm going to get a mention.
- Mention?

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,277
- In your acceptance speech.
- Oh, God, a speech.

49
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,920
You really think
I'm going to have to make a speech?

50
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,397
- Do we have time?
- I think so.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,718
What's going on in there?

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,633
Right on cue.

53
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,393
The sex police.
Be right there, Dad!

54
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,199
We'll be late!
You got two minutes.

55
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,918
Hear that? We got two minutes.

56
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,835
At the risk of getting sentimental, I'd
like to say thank-you to my wife, Kathy.

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,388
Not only for all her support
and encouragement,

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,392
but because she asked me to mention her.

59
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,350
My dad always used to say,

60
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,238
and I'm sure he'll say it again
before the night's out,

61
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,915
"Being a writer, in particular a poet,
is all well and good.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,753
But it's no way to make a living."

63
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,877
Of course, as in most other things,
he's absolutely right.

64
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
Too true.

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,876
It's nice to be reminded I haven't been
completely wasting my time.

66
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,428
So thank you very much for this.
Thank you.

67
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,196
I wanted him to be a doctor.

68
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,989
Nice pension, surgery, near us.
Take over my surgery for that matter.

69
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,877
Have you actually read the poem?

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,110
- 'Course he hasn't read it.
- He's tried.

71
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,033
- Several times.
- Let's have a look then.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,678
- It's plastic.
- I'll take that from you, shall I?

73
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,876
I'm going to the bar.

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,518
He could've been a vet even.

75
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,479
Two words, that's all I'd like.
Two words.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,630
- "Well" and "done".
- He doesn't mean it.

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,358
He's here for the free buffet.

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,274
The mean-spirited, sanctimonious,
narrow-minded old sod.

79
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,796
- What now?
- He's talking to Salman Rushdie.

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,314
Look, he's telling him
how it's done.

81
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,995
"Have you read <i>Jaws,</i>
Salman? Now that is a book."

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,473
- Together.
- Like this, Granddad?

83
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,949
Oh, now where are you going?

84
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,908
What's that?

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,031
Have a guess.

86
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,396
Now bring it to me. No, no, no.

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,275
- Ends together. Like that.
- Just leave that, Dad.

88
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,239
I still can't believe you hired a
removal firm. They're rip-off merchants.

89
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,118
We could've done the whole thing
for nothing in the van.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,034
- There was too much stuff for the van.
- You can afford it on what you earn?

91
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,514
Who wants to take mummy
up some breakfast?

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,591
- Bye, Granddaddy.
- See you later.

93
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,318
My little helpers!

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,188
- I do all right, Dad.
- Why'd you borrow this money off me?

95
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,397
- If you were a doctor...
- A bit late for this conversation.

96
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,153
- What's this doing here?
- It's going in the loft.

97
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,516
- This is Uncle Bert's chandelier.
- It's wire and glass, Dad.

98
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,038
Right. I'm going to need a stepladder.

99
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,431
Phillips screwdriver.

100
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,397
Length of rope.

101
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,236
- Dad?
- It's all right.

102
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,993
Don't fuss. It's nothing.

103
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,954
Your father's going to die, Blake.

104
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,874
Of course we all die sooner or later,
but I'm afraid, with your father,

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,110
it will be sooner.

106
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,634
- Will there be pain?
- There shouldn't be.

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,871
Not with this kind of cancer.
Usually they just slip away.

108
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,110
- So how long?
- Can't say.

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,760
Depends if he feels like fighting.

110
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,989
He knows then?

111
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,550
He asked me the moment he came around.
So I put him in the picture.

112
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,033
- But we do have time?
- That depends.

113
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,475
- Time for what?
- Well, time for...

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,074
...you know, putting things in order.

115
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,150
<i>That means you have</i>
<i>to get the conundrum.</i>

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,118
<i>If you do, you will win</i>
<i>by just one point.</i>

117
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,715
<i>It's so dramatic, I want to spell it out</i>
<i>so we all know what lies ahead</i>

118
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,916
<i>in the next few seconds. OK.</i>

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,468
<i>So very intense time for everybody now.</i>

120
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,235
<i>Please now, if everyone's ready,</i>
<i>reveal the final</i>

121
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,629
<i>Countdown Conundrum.</i>

122
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,712
- What did the doctor say?
- He said there's progress.

123
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,350
Said you'd be back home soon.

124
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,198
<i>... young woman was</i>
<i>discovered in a house</i>

125
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,397
<i>in the Clacton area of Leeds</i>
<i>just after midnight last night.</i>

126
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,438
Terrible. Just terrible.

127
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,239
- Know what I'd do?
- Bring back hanging?

128
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,272
Go if you want.

129
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,397
Actually, maybe I will,
if that's OK.

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,597
I'll pop back when you're home?
Bring Kathy and the kids?

131
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,671
What do I want visitors for?

132
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,796
Not now, but maybe when you're at home.

133
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,270
Come in, number one. Your time's up.
Number two, your time's up.

134
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,510
Come in, number three.

135
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,635
I'd better go, or I'll miss the train.

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,438
See you soon.

137
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,151
We're looking for Arthur Morrison.

138
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,391
Arthur Morrison. Back corridor.

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,629
Thank you.

140
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,075
I came as quickly as I could.

141
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,116
Am I too late?

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,070
Who's that then?

143
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,957
It's Blake, Dad.

144
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,517
Blake. Blake, good.

145
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,070
How did you get from the station?

146
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,151
Taxi.

147
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,596
Taxi, eh? Moneybags.

148
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,158
When did His Lordship arrive?

149
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,231
Just now.

150
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,996
He's with him now.

151
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,992
- Back in London by teatime.
- Gillian.

152
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,833
That's enough.

153
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,718
How's he taking it?

154
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,314
- Don't know yet.
- Hello.

155
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,038
Hi.

156
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,872
All right.

157
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,556
Get off.

158
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,672
- Bloody thing.
- Just trying to remember who you are.

159
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,394
She's just very pleased
to see you.

160
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,948
Arthur's very pleased too.

161
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,637
- Is he?
- Of course he is.

162
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,919
Gosh, "Where's Blake? Where's Blake?"
Is all I've had for days now.

163
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,794
Sorry, I would've gotten down sooner,
it's that new house and everything.

164
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,519
No, it's fine, darling.
He knows how busy you are.

165
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,430
I made up your old bedroom,

166
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,114
when you want to take your stuff up.

167
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,599
Down the corridor, up the stairs,
first on the right.

168
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,911
Blake? Blake, where are you?

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,309
Come on. She's here.

170
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,948
Come on, chop-chop.

171
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,510
She's here, Blake.
Come and say hello.

172
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,318
Blake!

173
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,636
Sandra, how are you?
I'm Arthur. This is Kim.

174
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,950
This is our youngest, Gillian.

175
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,270
Blake is somewhere,
probably still asleep.

176
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,796
On a beautiful day like today.
Blake, come and say hello to Sandra.

177
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,877
This is the kitchen.
Have you ever cooked on an Aga before?

178
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,235
- No.
- Sandra, would you like a cup of tea?

179
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,309
Yes, please.

180
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,390
There he is! Sleeping Beauty.

181
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,596
Blake, meet Sandra, our new maid.

182
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,195
Maid or housekeeper?
Skivvy! I'm joking.

183
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,431
- Let's just say one of the family.
- Pleased to meet you, Blake.

184
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,115
- You're Scottish.
- Oh, what gave you that impression?

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,116
- Whereabouts in Scotland?
- Glasgow.

186
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,159
- Oh, Glasgow.
- Ever been to Glasgow?

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,479
No. No, I haven't.

188
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,510
Right! Well, let me show you your room,
you can get settled in,

189
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,593
and then we'd like you to start
sweeping the chimneys. Just joking.

190
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,070
Follow me, quick as you like.

191
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,593
Mind the step.

192
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,114
On the left,
that's Blake's room.

193
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,191
Avoid at all costs, if I were you.

194
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,716
The last maid we had went in there,
haven't seen her since.

195
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,678
No, seriously, we do have some fun.

196
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,672
It was stupid, really.

197
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,389
You spend your life trying to avoid
someone, and then it's too late.

198
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,436
<i>Why can't you talk to him now?</i>

199
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,909
He's so doped up, I could be anyone.

200
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,911
<i>I'm sure there'll be time.</i>

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,833
Yeah, well, you haven't seen him,
have you?

202
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,992
<i>No. No, I suppose not.</i>

203
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,439
The kids are here.

204
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,750
<i>Do you want to talk to them?</i>

205
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,035
No, not just now, eh?

206
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,918
Really? 'Cause they want to talk to you.

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,991
Yeah, OK, put them on, will you?

208
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,193
- <i>Miss you.</i>
- You too.

209
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,592
He wants you to go through
all the papers.

210
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
He thinks I won't understand it.

211
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,069
I'll start tomorrow.

212
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,870
Good luck.

213
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,475
He's got every petrol receipt
since 1949 in there.

214
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,190
And then there's the workshop.

215
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,950
- You seen Sandra much?
- Now and then, yeah.

216
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,517
She's moved into the village.

217
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,229
One of those worker's cottages,
you know?

218
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,117
Divorced.

219
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,276
Why do you ask?

220
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,078
Just curious.

221
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,389
<i>President Kennedy</i>
<i>meanwhile remains incorrigible,</i>

222
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,917
<i>and in a momentous decision, has</i>
<i>ordered an arms blockade of Cuba.</i>

223
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,355
<i>This government, as promised...</i>

224
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,237
Missed a bit.

225
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,869
- You could help.
- Sorry. Busy.

226
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,669
- Oh yeah? Doing what?
- Busy smoking my fag.

227
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,032
- Give us a puff.
- No way.

228
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,599
- Go on.
- No.

229
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,636
- What if your dad finds out?
- He won't.

230
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,188
He will. Your dad's all-seeing.

231
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,874
- Like God.
- Omniscient, you mean?

232
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,394
Aye, omni-whatever.

233
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,872
Besides, it's bad for you,
gives you cancer.

234
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,349
So? We'll all be dead soon, anyway.

235
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,750
- Well, you're a little ray of sunshine.
- It's true.

236
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,310
If the Americans invade Cuba,
there'll be nuclear war by Friday.

237
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,914
Just think... dead.

238
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,956
And me, still a virgin.

239
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,155
Don't push your luck, Morrison.

240
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,156
You're still here then?

241
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,636
You're not running off?

242
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,756
I'm here for a while, Dad.

243
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,430
Yes, smashing. Smashing.

244
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,876
- I don't understand, what's it for?
- It's for sleeping outdoors.

245
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,996
It's like a normal sleeping bag,

246
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,517
but inside, a waterproof sleeve to keep
out the rain and condensation.

247
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,750
It will render the tent obsolete.

248
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,833
- You'll still get condensation inside.
- No, you won't, 'cause it's plastic.

249
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,196
- It's waterproof, see?
- But condensation's on the inside...

250
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,034
We'll find out when we put it
to the test, won't we, clever-clogs?

251
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,759
- I made two, see?
- What for?

252
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,432
One for me, one for you.

253
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,350
- Thought I'd take the car out.
- Oh, the... the...

254
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,876
The headlights don't work,
so make sure you're back before dark.

255
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,111
He was gonna take it into the garage.

256
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,951
Halfords.

257
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,469
What, love?

258
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,030
New headlights.
Halfords will be cheaper.

259
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,756
Herpes is all right.
It's easily sorted with antibiotics.

260
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,833
But gonorrhoea's a bastard.
Lots of the lads had it in the war.

261
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,799
Once you've seen what a dose of
gonorrhoea can do to a lad's tackle...

262
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,270
I've got pictures in books at home
that'd turn your stomach.

263
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,749
If there's another war
would you get called up?

264
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,991
I wouldn't have thought so.
There's not going be another war.

265
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,958
- You keeping an eye out for the police?
- Yes, Dad.

266
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,315
Self abuse, that's the thing
to be wary of.

267
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,073
- Dad, please...
- It seems like good fun, I know,

268
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,039
but it actually weakens the organ
for married life.

269
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,759
- Police car, right behind us, Dad!
- Really? Where?

270
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,990
Just... over there.

271
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,154
Very funny... very smart.

272
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,710
Bloody marvellous, isn't it?

273
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,033
If they drop the bomb on Leeds,
would it get us up here?

274
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,236
I wouldn't have thought so.

275
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,436
It's God's own country.

276
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,078
What about Mum and Gillian?

277
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,758
I think Mummy and Gillian
will be fine too.

278
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,639
What if they drop the bomb on Blackpool?

279
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,474
Why on earth would the communists
want bomb Blackpool, fathead?

280
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,478
Liverpool, then?

281
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,154
It's a bit bloody morbid,
this, isn't it?

282
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,755
Come on, lets go and find somewhere
to camp before it starts raining.

283
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,033
It's a lovely spot. Nice and sheltered,
river nearby for swimming.

284
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,875
- Shouldn't we go to a proper campsite?
- It's the English countryside.

285
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,632
We're English. It belongs to us.

286
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,470
Maybe we should pitch the tent first,
just to be on the safe side.

287
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,515
Is there a canvas bag in there, Blake?

288
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,433
- Yep, yep.
- What's in it?

289
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,035
- Tent pegs.
- No poles?

290
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,192
- No, just some pegs.
- Let's have a look.

291
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,868
Oh, blast! Hell, blast and damnation!

292
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,916
Why didn't you check, fathead?

293
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,673
- You packed the tent.
- You used it last, didn't you?

294
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,070
- No, I didn't. You...
- There's no point in arguing about it.

295
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,479
- What you doing?
- Right! Follow me!

296
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,039
- Can't we sleep in the car?
- Sleep in the car?

297
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,715
What's the point of us coming all
the way up here and sleeping in the car?

298
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,995
A hotel then?
Maybe we should just go home.

299
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,153
Look, hold that and stop moaning,
for God's sake.

300
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,631
Mummy says hello.

301
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,109
Pub was bloody miles away.

302
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,079
Felt a bit rude just to use the phone
so stayed for a swift half.

303
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,720
No sandwiches though.
Here you are, supper.

304
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,997
- Not hungry.
- Fair enough. Breakfast then.

305
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,673
Do you want to put the torch out, eh?
Save on batteries.

306
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,751
If you like.

307
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,195
- Night-night, Blake.
- Night.

308
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,679
Dad!

309
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,071
Oh, my book!

310
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,152
It could have been a lot worse.

311
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,231
How, exactly?

312
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,709
If our sleeping bags weren't waterproof.

313
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,360
They're not waterproof!

314
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,471
- They are waterproof.
- So why am I wet, then?

315
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,757
Well, not waterproof, water-resistant.

316
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,358
It's not funny.

317
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,235
- Where are we going?
- I thought I'd drive us up to Scafell.

318
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,595
Can't we just go home?

319
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,910
We've only just started!

320
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,037
Besides, the sun will burn this cloud
off in next to no time.

321
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,796
We can dry the tent out on a hedge,
have a picnic and find another spot.

322
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,109
What do you say?

323
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,909
<i>The unrest followed</i>
<i>a radio broadcast in which Khrushchev</i>

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,309
<i>reiterated his command</i>
<i>missile bases...</i>

325
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,709
I was listening to that!

326
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,997
No point in fretting.
We all have die sooner or later.

327
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,593
If our times up, our times up.

328
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,750
That's more like it. Smashing.

329
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,352
I'm not going swimming,
if that's what you're thinking.

330
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,759
- I'm wet enough, as it is.
- Right, budge over, you!

331
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,310
- What for?
- Time you learnt to drive.

332
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,397
You're joking?

333
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,595
What, here?

334
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,875
Here there's no one
for you to smash into.

335
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,076
Come on, budge over!

336
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,271
Very gently off the clutch.
No, gently! Gently! Stop!

337
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,069
First gear. Top left.
Top left, that's it. Come on.

338
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,549
Come on. Gently!

339
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,151
- Clutch! No, fathead, left foot.
- You told me...

340
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,516
That's it. Now gently.
Second into third.

341
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,318
That's it, that's it. Good.

342
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,675
Now gently away. Good.

343
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,435
Excellent. Now indicate.
Indicate right. Come on, indicate right!

344
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,999
- OK!
- Now, indicate left!

345
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,753
- Indicate left.
- What am I indicating for?

346
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,515
- Because you mustn't get in bad habits.
- There's no one here, Dad.

347
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,797
Come on! Hard round,
left hand down. That's it.

348
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,873
- Now, right hand down.
- Dad! Please!

349
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,955
Faster, don't worry about it.
Don't be scared, just go faster.

350
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,917
- It's a bit fast.
- You can go faster.

351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,672
Faster than this?

352
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,634
Quick! Come on! That's it!

353
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,359
Excellent, do you like it?
Good. Are you ready?

354
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,431
One... two... three!

355
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,999
Now!

356
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,073
Come on. Come on.

357
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,077
Come on out, you little sod!

358
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,594
Come on. Come on, get up.

359
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,113
- Hello?
- <i>Hi.</i>

360
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,919
- Oh, it's you.
- <i>Who else were you expecting?</i>

361
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,355
I just... I thought it might be mum.

362
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,159
I'm walking the dog.
Mind if I call you when I get back?

363
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,071
<i>Yeah, yeah, sure.</i>

364
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
- As soon as I get in. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

365
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,911
Come on... Stupid, stupid, stupid.

366
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,909
- <i>Sending you mad is he?</i>
- <i>I'm getting your migraines.</i>

367
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,472
Can't you come and rescue me?

368
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,678
<i>Sorry, love, it's men only.</i>
<i>You're on your own, I'm afraid.</i>

369
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,149
Did he blame me for that
tent pole business?

370
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,276
<i>What tent pole business?</i>

371
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,512
- Didn't he tell you last night?
- <i>I took a sleeping pill. Why?</i>

372
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,114
<i>What happened with the tent poles?</i>

373
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,673
<i>Blake? You there?</i>

374
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,796
He woke me at six in the morning!

375
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,553
That's never happened before.
Something must be up.

376
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,555
I wasn't far wrong. I realised we were
sleeping in two foot of water.

377
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,835
The bloody stream had burst it's banks.

378
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,549
Blake gave me a look like thunder.
I thought he was going to punch me one.

379
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,551
Excuse me a minute.

380
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,953
Here you are, a present for you.
Don't tell Mummy. You'll get me shot.

381
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,431
- Where are you going?
- Phone her.

382
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,476
What, again?

383
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,154
I just want to make sure
she's managing without us.

384
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,789
If anyone asks, you're 36!

385
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,634
I wish you were here too.

386
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,232
I know, but what can we do?

387
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,833
Don't be daft. You know I do.

388
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,599
Well, there's no point in worrying
about it. Everything's gonna be fine.

389
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,194
After all, where's the harm?

390
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,311
Yes. Yeah, we will, we will.

391
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,913
How are you doing, Stirling Moss?
Behaving yourself?

392
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,357
- Right, one for the road?
- I'm going to bed.

393
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,032
Good idea.

394
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,070
- How was Mum?
- What?

395
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,879
Oh, she was asleep.
I said I'd call her in the morning.

396
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,555
- Hey, Arthur? Have you heard the news?
- No, turn it up.

397
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,438
<i>Soviet missiles</i>
<i>should be removed from Cuba</i>

398
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,988
<i>under United Nations supervision.</i>

399
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,913
<i>Further details of the deal</i>
<i>have yet to become clear.</i>

400
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,630
<i>But it seems that for tonight, at least,</i>
<i>the world can sleep a little safer.</i>

401
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,949
What did I tell you? No point in getting
worked up about it, was there?

402
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,871
Are you all right?

403
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,878
So... to Kennedy, then.

404
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,996
To Kennedy.

405
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,153
That went down well.
Think I can sneak in one more.

406
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,958
I think I'll pop you
in the boot too.

407
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,556
- Why can't you go instead?
- Not today, Blake.

408
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,598
Why? Have you got one
of your migraines?

409
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,718
No. Not yet, anyway.

410
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,997
No, I've got patients to see,
that's all.

411
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,198
Somebody's got to keep that surgery
running while Dad is off gadding about.

412
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,072
But why does Aunty Beaty
always have to come?

413
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,277
Well, because your Aunty Beaty
gets a bit blue.

414
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,036
- And your Dad likes cheering her up.
- I'd still prefer it if you came.

415
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,874
Would you stop grizzling,
for goodness sake!

416
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,234
Look, darling, I'm sorry.

417
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,795
But you'll have fun. Go on.

418
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,678
Go on. OK.

419
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,390
Oh, one more!

420
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,950
One, two, three!

421
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,352
Let's get you down.
Come on, let's have some lunch.

422
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,149
Boom-boom. Boom-boom.
Boom-boom. Boom-boom.

423
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,674
Can you hear it?

424
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,355
Pumping away?

425
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,678
Can I have a go?

426
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,633
Blake, you and Gillian
take Josie down the hill

427
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,154
whilst Aunty Beaty and I
get the picnic ready.

428
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,716
- Arthur, I don't think...
- No, no. Nonsense.

429
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,950
You can look after the ladies,
can't you?

430
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,235
Big, strong lad like you.

431
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,992
Go on, off you go!

432
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,396
What are you doing, Blake?

433
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,313
- What does it look like?
- Stop showing off. You'll fall!

434
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,678
- I won't fall.
- Blake, come down. You're too high!

435
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,957
Blake!

436
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,911
- Blake!
- Blake!

437
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,757
Blake!

438
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,237
Blake, what the hell do you think you're
playing at, sneaking up on people?

439
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,834
I fell out of a tree.

440
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,354
How did you get up a tree? Fly up?

441
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,229
I don't think
we're going to have to amputate.

442
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,039
But I am going to put
some antiseptic on it.

443
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,635
And that's going to sting a bit.
Brave enough?

444
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,991
Now, that's it. You take
that end, now take this end...

445
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,272
Now...

446
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,828
...best not to tell Mummy
about any of this, eh?

447
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,150
You'll get me in trouble.
Is that a deal?

448
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,112
Now remember, big boys don't cry.

449
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,430
Especially not in front of girls.

450
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,435
Show them how brave you are!

451
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,238
All right?

452
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,358
Good boy.

453
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,549
Another swig of wine, please.

454
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,515
"Swig." Funny word, "swig."

455
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,474
Have you been through the papers yet?

456
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,949
The stocks and tax and stuff?

457
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,152
Not yet, Dad. No.

458
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,959
Have a look at it all, will you?

459
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,270
Your Mother's a bit scared of it,
I think.

460
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,679
I will, yes.

461
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,196
Sometime soon, all right?

462
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,992
Who's that?

463
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,952
Robert Morrison.

464
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,113
Died 1948, run over by a horse.

465
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,674
Drunk, probably.

466
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,756
It says here that Daniel Morrison...

467
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,593
...married his wife's sister
as well as his wife.

468
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,231
Yes, his first wife died in
childbirth, and he married the sister.

469
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,756
Yes, God, you weren't allowed
to mention Daniel, either.

470
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,594
- All this scandal.
- Well...

471
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,398
...now it can come out.

472
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,158
What did Granddad die of, Mum?

473
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,876
Oh... cancer, I think. Yeah.

474
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,155
- Bowel?
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,711
I think you've one
or two more years yet, Blake.

476
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,031
I remember when Granddad died.

477
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,315
Dad cried for months.

478
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,676
I remember at the wake,
somebody came up him and asked him,

479
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,593
"When did you last
see your father?" and...

480
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,035
...he just went to pieces.

481
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,952
Blake! Say hello
to Beaty and Sam.

482
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,634
Hello, Beaty and Sam.

483
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,389
Blake? Where are you?
Come down and say hello.

484
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,950
- You're meant to knock.
- Look who's come to see you.

485
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,395
- Hello, Josie.
- Hello.

486
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,392
- What are you up to, then?
- I'm reading.

487
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,516
About someone who murders his father.

488
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,195
Well, read it later. Come downstairs,
Beaty and Sam are here.

489
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,192
- Why can't I just?
- Because it's Christmas!

490
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,909
What are you drinking these days, Josie?
Vodka? Brandy?

491
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,517
There you are!

492
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,070
We were about to send out
a search party for you, young man.

493
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,472
Never a piece of mistletoe
when you need one. Oh, well.

494
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,516
Merry Christmas, Blake.
Happy Christmas, Aunty Beaty.

495
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,672
I think you're big enough
for just plain Beaty now, don't you?

496
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,990
- Suppose so.
- Here.

497
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,434
Oh... the crown prince, eh?

498
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,475
Well, I'm going to help your mother.

499
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,153
All right, Sandra? Steve?

500
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,229
All right, skinny.

501
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,956
- Where have you been hiding, Blake?
- Just upstairs.

502
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,555
Playing with yourself?
Better give it a rest, Morrison,

503
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,359
- or it'll snap off in your hand.
- I was reading, Steve.

504
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,829
Dostoevsky, actually.

505
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,755
Right, well. See you later then.

506
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,308
Like the hat... Dostoevsky.

507
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,995
Grim, isn't it?

508
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,957
Sodom and Gomorrah.

509
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,309
Is it me, or does it
get worse every year?

510
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,868
It gets worse.

511
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,712
Look at Sandra and Steve.

512
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,799
Disgusting.

513
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,989
You'd think they'd do it outside,
or something. Pig.

514
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,155
There you are. Look, what can it be?

515
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,436
- Gill?
- What?

516
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,239
- You know Josie?
- What about her?

517
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,991
Do you think that?

518
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,792
Do you think that she
looks a bit like us?

519
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,075
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

520
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,516
- It's a little beauty.
- Thank you.

521
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,036
Don't be daft.

522
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,670
One of your migraines?

523
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,476
No.

524
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,232
Just...

525
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,195
Just a headache.

526
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,633
Too much wine at dinner, I think.

527
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,354
Go back to the party. Have some fun.

528
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,631
I'll just...

529
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,919
...go upstairs and lie down for a bit.

530
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,272
God, I wish...

531
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,874
I wish the ground could have
swallowed me up.

532
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,030
We were
just having a bit of fun.

533
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,315
Oh, fun! Is that what you call it?

534
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,517
It's just a dance.
It is Christmas, after all.

535
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,876
What's Christmas
got to do with anything?

536
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,714
- I love you. Come here.
- Get off me! God! God, Arthur!

537
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,156
<i>I found him under our bed,</i>
<i>groping his Christmas presents</i>

538
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,196
<i>He said he was looking for his shoes.</i>

539
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,033
<i>Why they'd be under our bed</i>
<i>he didn't explain.</i>

540
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,433
<i>Anyway, he's in his room now</i>
<i>in disgrace.</i>

541
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,830
<i>I think he's still awake.</i>
<i>Do you want to talk him?</i>

542
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,512
Not right now, no.

543
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,715
- <i>Still there?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,992
So are you staying on?

545
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,072
- Of course I am.
- <i>And you don't want us to come up?</i>

546
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,798
Not right now.

547
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,996
It's just that I wish...

548
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,516
I wish I could be more involved,
somehow, that's all.

549
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,194
Well, you can't be, I'm sorry.

550
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,952
<i>You sound very distant.</i>

551
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,674
I've got to go.

552
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,194
- You don't want to talk?
- <i>What about?</i>

553
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,191
I don't know...

554
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,589
Things, your father, the situation.

555
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,319
- <i>Why?</i>
- I just thought it might help.

556
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,030
All right then, let's talk about
my father. You first, off you go.

557
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,668
<i>You know, Blake, I know</i>
<i>that you're going through a lot.</i>

558
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,194
That is no excuse
for being a complete bastard.

559
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,152
And the balls. They get trapped.

560
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,630
- How's that?
- Lovely, pet.

561
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,794
Better now?

562
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,950
Much better, pet.

563
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,314
We've been happy, haven't we?

564
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,751
We've got through it.

565
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,756
Lucky man. Lucky man.

566
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,193
- Chelsea versus Middlesbrough?
- Away win.

567
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,795
- Watford versus Southampton?
- Score draw.

568
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,998
Crystal Palace
versus Aston Villa?

569
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,911
No score draw.

570
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,471
- Spurs versus Liverpool?
- Home win.

571
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,232
Your grandpa had a little Austin,

572
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,915
BFX 709, which is
a Blackpool registration.

573
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,879
He bought it in Blackpool, and he was
going to a football match in Bolton,

574
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,996
his team, against Blackpool.

575
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,719
And the queue of traffic was dreadful.

576
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,712
He thought "Bugger this,
I'm gonna go down the outside."

577
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,553
And they were all hooting at him
and shouting at him.

578
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,713
And when he got to the end,
they saw his Blackpool number plate

579
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,916
and took him in the visitors' car park.

580
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,151
So he had watch the whole match
from the wrong end.

581
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,913
He wasn't best pleased.

582
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,590
We've had some fun, haven't we?

583
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,474
It's marvellous having you here.

584
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,233
And Gill and Blake.

585
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,439
If our purpose on this earth is to leave
it a better place for our children,

586
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,715
we haven't done badly, have we?

587
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,399
The shares all go in your mother's name.
The solicitor knows all about it.

588
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,950
Make sure your mother opens
the envelopes and signs all the forms.

589
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,315
And keep an eye on her, won't you?

590
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,915
- Don't disappear and leave it to Gill.
- Of course I won't.

591
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,560
- Tired?
- Too true.

592
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,594
It would be good to talk at some point,
wouldn't it?

593
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,831
When you feel up to it.

594
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,388
- What about?
- Dunno.

595
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,594
Past, I suppose. Family questions.

596
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,550
Sometime. Not today though, eh?

597
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,511
OK.

598
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,157
Not today.

599
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,958
<i>Gentle as you like.</i>

600
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,033
Remember, you're not hitting the ball,
just pushing it.

601
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,993
- Kissing it, really.
- You're doing it on purpose.

602
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,150
- What?
- You know what.

603
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,594
Oh, very good!

604
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,636
Close... yes.

605
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,956
Now...

606
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,792
...Morrison, Senior,

607
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,668
probably the most naturally gifted
golfer of his generation,

608
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,159
addresses the ball.

609
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,233
Slow backswing,
keeping his eye on the ball.

610
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,079
And it's on it's way,

611
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,037
over the humpback bridge,

612
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,509
into the round thing covered in shells,

613
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,636
out the other side...

614
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,632
And it's there!
It's there! Eight under par.

615
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,553
The championship. Well done, Blake.

616
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,359
You did your best,
but at the end of the day,

617
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,749
you were up against a better player.

618
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,637
I enjoyed that.

619
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,837
It would be a lovely hotel to run.

620
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,075
- Do you go camping?
- Oh, here he is.

621
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,674
This is Blake, my eldest.
This is Rachel.

622
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,955
What are you? A blue coat, red coat?

623
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,430
Much posher than that.
I'm your entertainments officer.

624
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,397
Oh, officer!

625
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,713
- Hello.
- Hi.

626
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,190
- He's hoping to go to university too.
- Oh, where to?

627
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,192
Maybe Nottingham, to read English.

628
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,590
Which strikes me as utterly pointless.
Where's the sense in that?

629
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,274
He can already read English
perfectly well as it is.

630
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,112
Arthur, you're such a philistine.

631
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,589
Your glass is empty. What can I get you?

632
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,830
- Technically, I'm on duty.
- A white wine.

633
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,512
Babycham for you, Blake?

634
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,236
Well... we'll just...

635
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,912
We'll just...

636
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,997
Your dad's wonderful.

637
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,594
Yeah, well, you
don't have to live with him.

638
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,311
How about you?
Are you still stuck with your parents?

639
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,550
Actually, my dad's dead.

640
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,110
Heart attack, last year.
That's why I'm here.

641
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,475
My mum thought it
would do me good to get away.

642
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

643
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,919
- Were you close?
- Yes.

644
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,514
- Yeah?
- Yes, very.

645
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,873
I must just go and say hello.

646
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,199
"Actually, my dad's dead!"
Nice one.

647
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,589
Here you are. Scared her off, have you?

648
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,910
Looks like it, Dad.

649
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,752
I'll just take her this.

650
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,038
- Your wine, madam.
- Thank you very much.

651
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,635
Hey, what are you up to?

652
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,870
Just reading.

653
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,952
You ought to be careful.
You'll go blind.

654
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,832
From reading in the dark, I mean.

655
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,035
That's better.

656
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,951
Why can't you just share with mum?

657
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,793
It's more fun like this, chaps together.

658
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,030
We can have a laugh, can't we?

659
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,878
Oh, sorry.

660
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,520
- I woke you.
- It's all right.

661
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,078
How did you put up with it, Mum?

662
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,957
With what?

663
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,790
I don't know.

664
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,350
All that noise and the bluster
and the scams and the...

665
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,031
...Beaty being around all the time.

666
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,839
I just sometimes wonder, how you...

667
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,956
...put up with it all these years.

668
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,076
Well, I didn't.

669
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,038
Not always.

670
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,675
Dad's very groggy again.

671
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,997
I thought he was better.

672
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,230
We were chatting and he seemed better.

673
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,630
Well, that's all over now.

674
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,559
He's been having faecal vomiting.

675
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,749
I'm gonna have to change
the sheets, Blake.

676
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,870
I think I'm gonna need
a hand moving him.

677
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,714
Are you up to it?

678
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,793
Up.

679
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,155
Oh, blimey, Dad!
What have you been eating?

680
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,836
I think I'm gonna need you
to get him in the chair, Blake.

681
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,388
I'm just gonna get you up now.
Come on.

682
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,113
- Chair! Chair!
- It's all right, Dad. I've got you.

683
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,873
I won't let go. You're all right, Dad.

684
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,918
There you go. Safe now.

685
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,070
It's all right. It's all right.

686
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,071
I told you, didn't I?

687
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,872
You should have seen Blake,

688
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,794
sloshing around in the freezing
cold water in his underpants.

689
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,188
You weren't a happy camper,
were you, Blake?

690
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,838
No, Dad.

691
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,479
Excuse me for a moment, Rachel.
I have to see a man about a dog.

692
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,071
You're very lucky, you know?

693
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,754
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm very lucky.

694
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,632
Do you know what he calls my mother?

695
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,631
"Mummy."

696
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,633
I mean, what kind of a man
calls his wife "Mummy"?

697
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,156
- I think it's nice.
- I think it's creepy.

698
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,310
He's like a big kid.

699
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,359
He's never read a single book
all the way through.

700
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,797
As far as I can tell, he's been reading
<i>Death on the Nile</i> for the last 42 years.

701
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,758
There are more important things
in life than books.

702
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,150
Are there? I don't think so.

703
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,038
I think books are everything.

704
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,997
You want to be a writer?

705
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,753
Maybe... Ideally, I'd...

706
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,594
- Am I missing anything?
- It's all right. Doesn't matter.

707
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,797
It's not important.

708
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,073
Will you excuse me?
I need to see a man about a dog.

709
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,518
I hate...

710
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,717
I fucking, fucking, fucking...

711
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,796
...hate him.

712
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,438
Just a few words, if I may?

713
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,478
As you know, the Morrisons
are leaving tomorrow,

714
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,997
so I'd like to take this opportunity
to say how marvellous it has been

715
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,517
to meet you all and say a very special
thank-you to the lovely Rachel Stein,

716
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,593
who's made it such a memorable holiday,
especially for my lad, Blake.

717
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,395
So... raise your glasses
if you would, please,

718
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,550
and drain them, doctor's orders,

719
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,791
as we say a special toast
to newfound friends.

720
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,518
Newfound friends.

721
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,436
Blake! April fool.

722
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,478
It was just a joke.

723
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,636
Blake! Blake!
Come back! Don't be like that.

724
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,598
Come and have a drink.
It was just a bit of fun.

725
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,638
Yeah, for you and your girlfriend,
maybe.

726
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,188
Honestly, an old man like you?

727
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,636
It's pathetic. You'd think Beaty
would be enough for you.

728
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,789
I beg your pardon?

729
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,553
I'm surprised you didn't
ask her along on holiday.

730
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,234
- She goes every where else with us.
- Enough, Blake.

731
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,880
- I'm sure Mummy wouldn't mind.
- Blake.

732
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,349
And even if she does mind,
what do you care?

733
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,193
- "It's just a bit of fun."
- I said that's enough!

734
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,550
I love your mother very much.

735
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,236
I love all of you.

736
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,958
You mean the whole world to me.
You know that.

737
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,157
So why'd you do it, Dad? Why?

738
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,276
I don't know what
you're talking about.

739
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,635
Now come inside.

740
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,672
Hello, stranger.

741
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,274
So, what was it like then?

742
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,909
- All right for some.
- Meet nice girls when you were away?

743
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,150
Any holiday romance?

744
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,550
- Only for Dad.
- I just hope you weren't unfaithful.

745
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,791
If I found out you been seeing someone
else behind my back...

746
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,598
Blake, get off.

747
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,399
Blake?

748
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,994
Blake?

749
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,877
Won't be a minute.

750
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,796
He was trying to get up
to clear his lungs and...

751
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,996
And he was coughing a lot

752
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,799
and panicking,
so I gave him some morphine.

753
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,194
He... all he said was,
"Can I lie down now?"

754
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,389
He's better now, but...

755
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,550
...his breathing's very irregular.

756
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,711
What's he looking at?

757
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,473
Nothing.

758
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,038
Dad?

759
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,470
He's looking straight through me.

760
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,392
<i>Please, Dad, stop breathing.</i>
<i>Please just stop.</i>

761
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,113
<i>If you can't come back</i>
<i>as you were, then go.</i>

762
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,957
Thank God.

763
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,678
I thought he'd gone then.

764
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,999
Don't do that again. Silly old bugger.

765
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,039
- <i>I hate him.</i>
- <i>Don't be daft.</i>

766
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,635
- No one hates their dad, not really.
- Well, I do.

767
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,237
All I mean is...

768
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,154
...if there's a firing squad and
I had to choose between shooting you

769
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,912
or shooting my dad,

770
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,116
then I'd shoot my dad, that's all.

771
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,190
- What was that for? What?
- You know what.

772
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,874
- Don't you dare.
- I was trying to be nice...

773
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,315
Well it's not nice.
It's a wicked thing to say.

774
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,233
Don't you dare ever, ever say anything
like that again.

775
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,958
- Why not?
- It doesn't matter.

776
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,237
I wouldn't say that about my dad,
and he's a vicious bastard.

777
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,471
- All I meant...
- You should never wish anyone dead.

778
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,391
What if it came true?

779
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,477
- Blake? Blake, where are you?
- Sex police! Go!

780
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,990
- Arthur!
- Sandra! Sorry.

781
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,638
Why don't you knock?

782
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,438
You frightened the life out of me!

783
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,080
I didn't think you'd be in, sorry.

784
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,789
I was just looking
for Blake, that's all.

785
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,075
Oh, well, he's hardly likely to be here.

786
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,311
No, I suppose not.
But tell him...

787
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,598
Tell Blake I was looking for him. Sorry.

788
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,755
It's ten minutes now.

789
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,596
I think he's gone, Blake.

790
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,513
Should I cover his face?

791
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,318
No.

792
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,959
You'll be all right here?

793
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,350
Yeah, I thought I might just lie down
with him for a bit.

794
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,271
Do you think?

795
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,477
- Do you think that's all right?
- I'm sure it is.

796
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,159
Mom.

797
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,511
Mom?

798
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,831
The undertaker's here.

799
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,989
What?

800
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,514
The undertaker's here.

801
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,915
He's still warm.

802
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,434
That's why we like
to get in pretty sharpish,

803
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,274
before the rigor mortis. After 12 hours,
they get stiff as a board.

804
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,031
Hello, what's this?

805
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,269
Pacemaker.

806
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,954
- Cremation is it?
- I think so, yes.

807
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,918
Well, I'll have to remove that
I'm afraid.

808
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,719
Otherwise they explode.

809
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,155
I'll... I'll make a note of it.

810
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,153
<i>Boom-boom. Boom-boom.</i>
<i>Boom-boom. Boom-boom.</i>

811
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,471
<i>Can you hear it?</i>

812
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,876
<i>Pumping away?</i>

813
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,068
I was just passing, so I thought...

814
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,754
Not exactly
on your way home, though, is it?

815
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,910
Nope.

816
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,718
Poor old King Arthur.

817
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,429
Lent me the money for this house,
you know?

818
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,994
I won't half miss him.

819
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,310
You know, I used to think
you fancied him.

820
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,319
But I was shagging you.

821
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,516
I thought you were
with him on the sly.

822
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,229
Christ, Blake. What did you take me for?

823
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,794
Remember how he was always
trying to catch us?

824
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,678
Sex police? Never did though, did he?

825
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,839
Too fast for him.

826
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,355
He used to say,

827
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,716
"Leave two blokes in a room
long enough, they'll kill each other.

828
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,598
Leave a man and a woman,
and they'll screw each other."

829
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,079
Is that right?

830
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,114
You were my first love,
you know that, don't you?

831
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,039
Yeah, well...

832
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,996
...life's easier without.

833
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,152
It's funny, though, isn't it?

834
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,713
You and me. Alone together again.

835
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,711
I mean, he's not here to walk in on us.

836
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,677
Blake.

837
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,318
It's all right. Look at you.

838
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,995
Sorry. I'm sorry.

839
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,517
Hey, you want to see something?

840
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,159
- It's his pacemaker.
- Bloody hell, Blake!

841
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,596
The undertaker cut it out of his chest
with a scalpel.

842
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,875
I washed it.

843
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,269
Did you see him cut it out?

844
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,634
Nope.

845
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,677
I wanted to, though.

846
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,230
I wanted to see if I could take it,
watching him being cut open.

847
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,359
See if I could have been
a doctor too, I suppose.

848
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,595
- You think I've gone nuts, don't you?
- Yeah.

849
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,190
But then you always were
a wee bit nuts.

850
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,756
I'm back.

851
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,908
- Hello.
- Hello.

852
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,391
Oh, God, it's good to see you.

853
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,831
I'm so sorry.

854
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,476
I'm sorry.

855
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,835
This isn't working, is it?

856
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,316
It's OK.

857
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,155
You just lie still.

858
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,515
How are you feeling?

859
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,396
I don't know.

860
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,192
Cheated.

861
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,709
- Do you want to go into the car?
- Yes, come on.

862
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,832
- Oh, where'd you get that from?
- Dad's wardrobe.

863
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,674
- A bit loose around the belly.
- No, no, it's not that loose.

864
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,795
- You don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

865
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,633
No, I'm sure he'd be delighted.

866
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,392
What's up?

867
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,079
Come on, you're meant to be bartending.

868
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,594
- I still can't see it.
- See what?

869
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,557
The resemblance.

870
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,791
Oh, for Christ's sake, Blake,
why can't you just let it go?

871
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,189
It's history.

872
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,031
Would you like a drink,
Aunty Beaty?

873
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,510
Oh, I don't think anyone's called me
"Aunty" in 20 years.

874
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,352
Look at you, Blake.

875
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,149
Goodness. Well, you look just like him.

876
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,152
I think Gill needs a hand, Mum.

877
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,356
Does she?

878
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,228
- All right, dear.
- You sound just like him too.

879
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,073
- Beaty, can I have a word?
- Yes, of course.

880
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,355
In private.

881
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,831
The thing is, I do know something
went on between you and Dad.

882
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,990
- I see.
- I know it was a long time ago.

883
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,833
I'm not angry.
I mean, I was angry.

884
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:30,429
For years, furious
with him mainly, but...

885
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,112
But I'm not anymore.

886
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,156
At least I don't think so.

887
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,473
But I would like to know the truth.

888
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,279
I need to know the truth.
I think I'll go mad otherwise.

889
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,669
You can't understand that, can you?

890
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,752
Well, yes. Yes, I suppose so.

891
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,796
Well, mine was never a very happy
marriage, Blake. And Arthur...

892
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,634
...patron saint of lost causes,
he saw that and he...

893
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,870
...consoled me, I suppose.

894
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,154
I was lonely, and he made me laugh.

895
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,840
I wouldn't have got
through the days without him.

896
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,400
It was consolation, Blake.

897
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,233
- But was it physical?
- Is that important?

898
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,151
Yes, I think it is.

899
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,750
Leave me something
of him please, Blake. It is mine.

900
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,230
Whatever sadness,

901
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,476
whatever hurt we caused you,
I am sorry for.

902
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,595
All I will say is this:

903
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,436
Arthur loved your mother more than
any human being on the whole earth.

904
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,636
And you too. You and Gill.

905
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,709
And he was proud of you.

906
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,233
So, so proud.

907
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,073
Even if he didn't always show it.

908
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,031
But what about Josie?

909
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,638
Do I have a sister?

910
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,630
Oh, there you are.
The taxi's been waiting, Mum.

911
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,029
- Sorry.
- We've got to go.

912
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,993
I'm gonna miss him so much.

913
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,232
Goodbye.

914
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,678
<i>Blake!</i>

915
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,552
- Sure you don't want me to drive you?
- No, Dad.

916
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,835
I can run you to the station
in ten minutes.

917
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,115
I prefer this way really.

918
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,030
How far are your digs at the other end?

919
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,951
Couple of miles.

920
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,398
- How you going to get there?
- I don't know.

921
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,677
- Bus, I suppose.
- Bus? With all this stuff?

922
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,115
- Or taxi.
- Oh, a taxi!

923
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,350
- Is that right, moneybags?
- Dad.

924
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,910
Once your allowance is gone, that's it.
Don't come running cap in hand.

925
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,798
- Doesn't grow on trees.
- Doesn't grow on trees. I know.

926
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,310
You're studying a proper subject,

927
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,868
like medicine or science,
guarantee you a job.

928
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,076
Dad, please.

929
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,075
Right then.

930
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,391
See you then.

931
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,277
See you, Dad.

932
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,358
TTFM.

933
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,191
I'll miss you.

934
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,309
You too, Dad.

935
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,912
Dad.

936
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,596
<i>When did you last</i>
<i>see your father?</i>

937
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,433
<i>Was it when they burnt the coffin?</i>

938
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,192
<i>Put the lid on it?</i>

939
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,391
<i>When he exhaled his last breath?</i>

940
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,191
<i>When he sat up</i>
<i>and said something?</i>

941
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,078
<i>When he last recognized you?</i>

942
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,552
<i>When he last smiled?</i>

943
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,590
<i>When did you last see your father?</i>

944
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,670
<i>The last time he was healthy, active?</i>

945
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,951
<i>The last time you had</i>
<i>an argument about something?</i>

946
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,712
Dear old Dad.

947
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,915
Want to keep this,
in case it comes in useful?

948
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,989
No.

949
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,991
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

950
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,310
Dad would have done, you know?

951
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,595
<i>Those weeks</i>
<i>we tried to say goodbye</i>

952
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,557
<i>were like a series of depletions.</i>

953
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,950
<i>Each day I thought, "He can't get</i>
<i>less like himself than this. "

954
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,471
<i>Yet each day he did.</i>

955
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,029
<i>So I've been trying to recall</i>
<i>the last time I actually saw him.</i>

956
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,112
<i>The last time he was unmistakably there,</i>

957
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,837
<i>in the fullness of being...</i>

958
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,399
<i>... him.</i>

959
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,552
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing it as fast as I can.

960
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,790
- You using a Phillips screwdriver?
- No.

961
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,836
- No wonder you can't do it.
- I can do it.

962
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,638
- Doesn't look like it.
- Dad.

963
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,154
- Are you sure it's gonna hold?
- Absolutely.

964
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,470
Right, let's see.
Ready to let go?

965
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,073
Absolutely.

966
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,559
Gently does it.

967
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,235
- There.
- Told you, didn't I?

968
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,471
Moment of truth.

969
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,797
Let there be light.

970
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,950
Right. What's next then?
