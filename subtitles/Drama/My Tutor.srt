1
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,270
Dummy... dummy... dummy...

2
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,190
C'mon, it's over.

3
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,350
Time to kick out the jams.

4
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,390
Summer time fun.

5
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,109
Dummy... dummy... dummy... dummy.

6
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,390
Quit it with the ball
peen hammer imitation.

7
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,189
Here's Bonnie.

8
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,350
- Where?
- There.

9
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,709
Hi, Bonnie!

10
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,469
Bobby, I've been looking for you.
You didn't sign my yearbook.

11
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,110
Same here.

12
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,110
Here you go.

13
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,189
"To the girl who's meant the most
to me all through high school.

14
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,750
Love, Bobby."

15
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,310
That's really sweet, Bobby.

16
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,470
I gotta go. I'll see you, okay?

17
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,030
What did she write?

18
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,749
"To the funniest guy in third
period study hall. Bonnie."

19
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,310
Very romantic.

20
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,229
Tonight's the night, fellas!
The sacrifice of the virgins.

21
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,749
Not so loud!

22
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,950
Time to go to the drug
store and get you fitted.

23
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,870
Eight o'clock.

24
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,830
Bravo, Bravo, let's go!
We're running late.

25
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,230
Not too much. She'll slide off.

26
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,589
C'mon. We're going to a whorehouse.

27
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,150
We're not getting married here.

28
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,670
What the hell you got in there?

29
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,109
These are the old
"Johnny Walker Black."

30
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,230
I stole it from my dad. The stuff's
so good he never drinks it.

31
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,310
Go ahead. It'll cool your nerves.

32
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,507
You know what this stuff.

33
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:16,669
Come on. Let's go. I wanna brush
my hair. Yeah. Later. Later.

34
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,070
This is it! This is it!

35
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,950
I don't know about this, guys.

36
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,190
My stomach doesn't feel
so good, you know.

37
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,990
- How about another night?
- I think you should go.

38
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,230
Oh, Billy.

39
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,789
For these two we have
the graduation present.

40
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,389
So? Which one is
your brother, Jack?

41
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,029
Right here, over here. That's me!

42
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,830
A real eager beaver.

43
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,870
For you we have Louisa.

44
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,629
First time up at the
plate, right, Jack?

45
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,070
Yes, but I'm out to win
rookie of the year.

46
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,069
And now for you,

47
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,990
we have something
very very special.

48
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,190
Anna-Maria.

49
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,309
Give me your hand, Jack.

50
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,270
Okey dokey.

51
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,870
- Up against the wall.
- All right.

52
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,190
There you go.

53
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,110
What's going on?

54
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,749
You'll see.

55
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,870
Oh, boy, this is gonna
be really wild.

56
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,630
- Now give me your other hand.
- All right.

57
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,250
Are you sure about this?

58
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,749
Maybe this is a little
advanced for me.

59
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,111
Don't worry. It'll Be wonderful.

60
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,967
You like it?

61
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,331
Are you ready, Jack?

62
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:11,385
Oh yes, I'm ready!

63
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,356
Oh my god!

64
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,658
So am I.

65
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,996
Come over here my little bambino.

66
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,480
Climb it up.

67
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:29,894
How does it feel?

68
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,409
Wonderful. But wouldn't it
be better if I was untied?

69
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,375
But your brother wanted you
to have the full treatment.

70
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,841
- Is it good?
- Oh. Yes.

71
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,306
Do you like surprises?

72
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,493
Oh yes.

73
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,394
Good.

74
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:23,286
This is wild.

75
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:05,146
Bambino wake up!

76
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:10,204
Wake up! Oooh!

77
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:29,095
Billy, what kind of weirdo did
you set me up with in there?

78
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,416
I almost got killed!

79
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,659
- Hey, I didn't know, alright?
- Yeah, yeah...

80
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,974
well, next time do a
little legwork, will you?

81
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,978
This is ridiculous.
I don't believe it.

82
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,532
You can't even get
laid in a whorehouse.

83
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,551
Did you have a good time?

84
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:48,832
Maria, Fruit. Salad. Lunch.

85
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,647
Rose bushes. Trim.

86
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:56,679
- Fruit. Salad. Lunch.
- Right.

87
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:05,178
- Aah, Manuel.
- Aaah, Rose bushes trim.

88
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:07,576
- Hi honey!
- Hi mom!

89
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,601
- where is dad mom?
- He is in the studies.

90
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:11,591
I am late for lunch.

91
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,446
Sit down, Bobby.

92
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,681
It's been quite a morning.
Mr. Simpson called from your school.

93
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,150
It seems that we've got a problem.

94
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,830
You flunked your French final

95
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,949
I've been on the phone to Yale...
They'll hold your place,

96
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,390
on one condition, that
you take a makeup exam.

97
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,230
The only catch is, you have to
do better than an eighty-fives.

98
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,949
I've already contacted
a language agency.

99
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,229
And as of tomorrow morning,

100
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,709
the best freelance French
teacher... in the city...

101
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,989
is going to be here.
She is gonna live here.

102
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,230
You will work... with her every day,

103
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,670
and I assure you... you are
going to pass that exam.

104
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,550
I don't mind telling you,
this is damn embarrassing.

105
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,869
Hello, Bobby. I'm Terry
Green, your French tutor.

106
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,190
We going to be working
together this summer.

107
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,190
- I suppose we have to start today.
- Tomorrow is soon enough.

108
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,990
It's too soon for me.
How about next week.

109
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,070
- Oh, I am Sorry.
- One day" summer vacation.

110
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,870
Terrific.

111
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,510
In addition, if you succeed
and Bobby passes...

112
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,510
there will be a final bonus
payment of ten thousand dollars.

113
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,670
That's quite a bonus.

114
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,870
I want you as committed
to this as I am.

115
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,109
Now, I'd like this part of our
bargain to be just between us.

116
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,950
I don't want Bobby to know.
Understand?

117
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,590
Yes.

118
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,950
He is under enough pressure
already. God knows he's been...

119
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,590
a great disappointment to me.

120
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,950
His attitude, his grades...

121
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,630
I had to pull quite a few strings
to get him into Yale. And now this.

122
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,870
What is so important about Yale?

123
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,550
Because I went there.

124
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,590
And being a Yalie was just about the
finest memory I ever had in my life.

125
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,188
- I want the same for Bobby.
- What does Bobby want?

126
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:36,990
He's too young to
know what he wants.

127
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,510
All I know is what I want and
that's for him to pass that exam.

128
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:50,007
Ok. The word ethua.
To be. Conjugation.

129
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,990
Bobby?

130
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,590
I hate this French crap.

131
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,709
Oui. You've got the picture.
I even hate French fries.

132
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,349
- Pommes frites.
- Yeah right. Pommes frites.

133
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,910
- Excellent pronunciation.
- Dumb luck.

134
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:20,369
Look, forget it. No way I'm
going to pass this exam.

135
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,390
We might as well just chuck it.

136
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,010
You pass. There isn't a student
made that I can't teach.

137
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,550
A little conceited, aren't you?

138
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,630
I'm very good.

139
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,270
What are you getting out of this?

140
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,670
A little money. A quiet place
to stay for a month or so.

141
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,390
Well how come you're not married?
Or have a boyfriend at least.

142
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,550
I don't think that's any
of your business, Bobby.

143
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,110
Hey, come on, give me a break.

144
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,470
I'm trying to learn about
life and love, here.

145
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,429
Okay. I had a
boyfriend, we broke up,

146
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,110
and I needed a place to stay.
Is that Okay?

147
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,629
Well, how come you broke up?

148
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,870
This is none of your business.
Can we please do work.

149
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,750
I can tell, you're gonna
work me hard this summer.

150
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,430
That's my job, ne'st pas?

151
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,230
Okay, now if this doesn't work
out. There is always Mexico.

152
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:18,429
You'd get it down there, for sure.

153
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,789
Oh no, I'm not going to Mexico.

154
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,028
You can catch all kinds
of diseases down there.

155
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,909
That's just if you drink
the water, you turkey.

156
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,389
- Yeah, same difference.
- There it is guys. Now be cool,

157
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,950
Remember I got you
covered, all right?

158
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:41,999
Oh boy. Oh boy.

159
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,670
She won't hurt you. No whips.
She promises.

160
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,830
Hey, Billy, I don't know about this.

161
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,949
Who wants to know. You guys are
about to get your lances waxed.

162
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,509
No big deal. Even when we
speak. Right at this second.

163
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,829
Millions of people are just
banging away like crazy.

164
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,870
These are facts of life.

165
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,550
That's kind of awesome thought.

166
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,470
Yeah, it is. Isn't it?

167
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,870
There she is... athletic?

168
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,674
I am on my break. Let's do it.

169
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,390
We'll be in the bar
across the street.

170
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,310
Save some for me!

171
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,710
I've only got ten minutes.

172
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,070
Ten minutes?

173
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,966
I got a Chrysler 'cause it
has the biggest back seat.

174
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:37,999
Nice.

175
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,225
- Aw shit!!
- What?

176
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:55,503
- It's my boyfriend.
- Your Boyfriend!?

177
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:59,493
Well... actually... we're
engaged to be married.

178
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,738
He hates when I do this.

179
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:15,338
The last guy he caught me with...
he dragged behind his bike in chains!

180
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,362
Oh don't worry,
it was only over dirt!

181
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:53,041
Sylvia.

182
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,678
Sylvia. Where is he?

183
00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:06,051
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna
tear out his eyeballs!

184
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:09,249
I'm gonna rip off his arm and
beat him to death with it.

185
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,646
I want that son of a bitch!

186
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:30,361
There's the little prick!

187
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,608
Say your prayers, Boy.
You're about to meet Jesus.

188
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,068
That's not him! That's not him!
That's not him!

189
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:49,621
- It's not me! It's not me! It's not me!
- You sure?

190
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:54,556
Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't
ball that lamb even for money!

191
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,480
Thank you!

192
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:23,908
Hay, was it as good as I said?
Did I cover you or what?

193
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:27,636
Let's go. Come on.

194
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,349
Okay, here you go.
Try these, fifteen minutes.

195
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,270
Starting... now.

196
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,030
Bobby, get to work.

197
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,790
Okay

198
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,190
I'm going to go get a drink.
Do you want anything?

199
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,230
- No thanks.
- Ok, I'll be right back.

200
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,830
Bobby, where are you?

201
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,470
Oh, boy. No work?

202
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,829
I can't leave you
alone for a second.

203
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,709
Here. It looks like
you could use this.

204
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,270
Thanks.

205
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,910
Okay, get to work.

206
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,470
It's too hot.

207
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,790
Bobby, will you just
do the test, please.

208
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,230
It's really way too hot...

209
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:44,269
- Now that's better.
- I take it this is a study break?

210
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,869
Great idea.
I'm glad you thought of it.

211
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,750
All right then. Teacher
gets to take a break too.

212
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,630
Where did you learn to
speak French so well?

213
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:13,910
I went to college in France.

214
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,829
I knew it. Nobody can learn to
speak French in California.

215
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,710
Spanish, maybe. French, no way.

216
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,190
- I should've taken Spanish.
- Why didn't you?

217
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,189
My Dad thought it was a good idea.

218
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,390
He wants me to study
international law at Yale.

219
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,229
Oh yeah? You do everything
your father wants you to do?

220
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,310
No. Not always.

221
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,990
If I had my way I'd go to
UCLA and study astronomy.

222
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,429
I'm sorry...

223
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,230
But you know I'm not hired here as a
guidance counselor. And no matter...

224
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:51,990
what school you go to you'll need
to pass that test, so please.

225
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,630
How old are you?

226
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,430
- Would you stop stalling?
- Forty?

227
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,150
- Forty-five? Twenty-five?
- Twenty nine.

228
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,349
- Have you been married?
- No.

229
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,950
Engaged?

230
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,949
- Yes and no.
- You lived with a guy, right?

231
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,829
- This last guy you just broke up with, huh?
- Bobby,

232
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,910
I wish you were as good at French
as you are at Twenty Questions.

233
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,470
Vingt questions.

234
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,710
Tres bien. Get to work.

235
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,550
You pervert

236
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,550
I promised her a ride home..

237
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:12,630
Well, how are things going
between you and your tutor?

238
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,789
Okay.

239
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,790
Have you tried to
score with her yet?

240
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,110
Come on, Jack, what
are you kidding?

241
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,550
I know I would've
scored with her by now.

242
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,590
Just you and her...
Alone, by the pool...

243
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,470
Yeah, I would've been there
and beck a few times by now.

244
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,510
Jack, you don't believe
your own bullshit, do you?

245
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,150
And I'm going to hit
the ceiling tonight.

246
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,149
- It's only an eighty.
- Hey, come on,

247
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,590
an eighty up from a fifty seven
is pretty good for two week.

248
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,629
Yeah, but you've to get five
points if it was the real test.

249
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,909
No backing out now.

250
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,030
You promised a celebration
lunch if I even broke seventy.

251
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,750
- You had this planned.
- Of course.

252
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,469
Not only lunch but now you
have the rare opportunity

253
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,589
to practice your new
vocabulary under fire.

254
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,590
Great.

255
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,189
Now, I'm going to teach you a skill
that all young men should know.

256
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,590
What's that?

257
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,949
- The art of tasting wine.
- Sounds vital.

258
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,590
It's where you can impress all the
girls before you seduce them.

259
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,990
Now it sounds life or death.

260
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:33,070
First thing you do is...
sniff the bouquet.

261
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,589
Then you take a healthy sip, and
you move it around your mouth

262
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,430
so that the tongue can test
it from all sides. Like so.

263
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:54,150
You're not supposed to gargle,
Can't take you anywhere.

264
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,588
So, Cindy, put through all
my calls to Le Rendezvous.

265
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,870
I'm trying to close the condo deal.

266
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,869
Be very careful. She's an
absolutely flawless classic.

267
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,630
Yes, sir.

268
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,630
Not a scratch. Okay, my man?

269
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,950
Right, sir.

270
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,470
Pierre, how are you?

271
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,710
My table over here?

272
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,354
Roger hi. Ed.

273
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:40,726
Oh, no. Anything but this.

274
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:46,995
Where have you been?
Why did you disappear?

275
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,822
Why haven't you called me?
I've been looking for you for weeks.

276
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,958
Why do you want me to
say this again? It's over.

277
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:58,957
It can't be over. You just get up
and walked out. Not a word, nothing.

278
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,772
I don't know what you want me
to say, It's just not fair!

279
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:06,571
Fair? One day you're living
with me and the next day

280
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:09,467
you disappear without a goodbye.
And you're talking about fair?

281
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,894
Monsieur Sylvester. There is
a telephone call for you.

282
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:13,604
I'll call back.

283
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:15,439
But your secretary says
it is an emergency.

284
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,577
Yes Cindy, put him through.

285
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:25,491
Hello, Sid...

286
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:29,673
I just talked with Miller and if you
want those condos they'll cost you

287
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,776
two hundred K a piece..

288
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:35,372
I love you, Terry.
Forget what happened.

289
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,717
That's over, honey. I can change.

290
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,772
Sid, the price is right.
He'll take one third down.

291
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:44,812
The terms are terrific.

292
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:47,667
- Yeah, that's right.
- Let's go.

293
00:38:47,668 --> 00:38:50,189
No problem. Wait, Terry don't go.

294
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,389
I said I love you. Doesn't
that mean anything?

295
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,029
I wanna be with you!
I wanna be with you forever!

296
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,190
How can you turn down
an offer like that?

297
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:03,109
You'll be turning over a half million
profit in eighteen months, goddamnit.

298
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,589
Would you just wait a
second, Terry? Talk to me.

299
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,356
No, not you, Sid. Is your name
Terry, for Christ sakes?

300
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,674
Goddammit, Sid. Just
take the bloody deal.

301
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,869
Would you just talk to me? I can't
keep this up, I gave up jogging.

302
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,670
Who is this kid? Are you
teaching nursery school or what?

303
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:29,518
Nice night for a stroll, huh, Bobby.

304
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:34,807
I couldn't sleep...
I had my telescope out.

305
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,746
You shouldn't spy on people.
It's not fair.

306
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:45,589
Bobby? Would you look at me.

307
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:52,077
It's okay. Just no more spying.
Is that understood?

308
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,510
Okay. Go to bed.

309
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:05,175
Well, this way boys, over there. Oh
this is gonna look wonderful today.

310
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:08,374
Yes there is the place.

311
00:43:09,374 --> 00:43:15,170
No, no... no... no I like it better
over there. Yes, that's it.

312
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:18,178
Yes, definitely over there.

313
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:20,597
No, wait please.

314
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:24,796
I think I like it where we tried
it the first time. Right here.

315
00:43:25,523 --> 00:43:26,809
What do you think?

316
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,776
Oh, it's so hard to decide
without setting it all up.

317
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,706
It takes an hour to set
this tent up ma'am.

318
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:32,537
An hour?

319
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,002
Is that all?

320
00:43:38,718 --> 00:43:41,894
Well maybe we could set it up
in all the places I picked.

321
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:42,744
What do you think?

322
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,828
- Hi mom. Where's Terry?
- Hi honey.

323
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:48,167
She went for a drive. She said
she'll be back for your lesson.

324
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,129
- A drive? With who?
- A man.

325
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,370
Honey, you know that tent we
have for your birthday...

326
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,248
Where do you think
we should set it up?

327
00:43:53,249 --> 00:43:58,598
Over there... Over there...
Or over here?

328
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:03,743
- I think it looks fine, right here.
- Oh, fine.

329
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:09,126
Thank you honey. Ok boys.
Set it up. Right here.

330
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:12,668
Wait!... I am not sure.

331
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:27,110
Where were you?

332
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,932
- You're late.
- Not that late.

333
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:34,232
Hey, sport. Don't get
so bent out of shape.

334
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:39,750
I guess you and I got off on the
wrong foot. I'm Don Sylvester.

335
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:44,895
You know you almost made me
wrap my bike around that pole.

336
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:45,957
I'm sorry about that.

337
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:48,009
I was a desperate
man, though Bobby.

338
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:53,020
I couldn't let my girl get away
without a chase now, could I?

339
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:58,933
Well, I gotta go.

340
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:02,060
- Study time? You know?
- I'll be right there.

341
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:36,769
All right. Here you are.

342
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,657
Come on Bobby, what's that long
face, huh? Can you fetch us a smile?

343
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:46,168
Yeah, we got in this picture at
6:05 and there's not a blonde here.

344
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:48,452
This'll never work, Billy.

345
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:50,907
Trust me and ye shall be delivered.

346
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:52,833
Look, the guy at the door
is a friend of mine.

347
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,557
These are just for show.
I've got you covered, huh?

348
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:55,628
Wonderful.

349
00:45:56,238 --> 00:45:58,764
Bobby, you look like
you're going to a funeral.

350
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:00,871
What's the matter?

351
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,289
- Nothing. Let's go.
- All right. Common.

352
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:19,892
Oh shit! Duane's not here tonight

353
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:24,927
Billy, this will never do!
This will never do!

354
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:27,228
Too late now. Go for it!

355
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:30,022
Hey Blood! What's happenin', man?
All right, all right!

356
00:46:30,023 --> 00:46:31,851
Please blood, please!

357
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:50,891
Don, it's Terry. Don?

358
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,952
And stay out, punks!

359
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,973
What the hell's wrong
with you, guys?

360
00:47:03,605 --> 00:47:05,185
You're nuts to go
jump into that ring!

361
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:10,338
I couldn't help myself. They're the
most beautiful girls in the world.

362
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:14,466
Yeah, we're going to wait for them.
That blonde is crazy for me.

363
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:18,618
I could tell. When she was pinning
me, she was really getting off.

364
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:19,632
I'll be in the car.

365
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:31,325
Can you believe those guys?
They must be crazy!

366
00:48:12,894 --> 00:48:15,007
Don't you get out of
the car you bastard.

367
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:18,412
- I can explain...
- Come on!

368
00:48:19,924 --> 00:48:21,304
You weren't supposed to be here.

369
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:23,158
I don't believe you're saying this!

370
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:26,737
Don't get out of the car.
I am going to cut it off....

371
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,637
- Excuse me girls.
- Aaaah!

372
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,457
We just want to tell you how
much we enjoy your work...

373
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,825
Well, if there is any way to
wrestle with you privately...

374
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:58,086
Also, it may be of some interest to you
that I am unusually well endowed and

375
00:48:58,087 --> 00:49:00,640
would be happy to demonstrate
that fact at any moment.

376
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,003
You little turds again.

377
00:49:04,605 --> 00:49:05,905
I'm gonna break you in pieces.

378
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:28,931
I love her! I love her!

379
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:36,406
Put my dress back here! I'm naked!

380
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,122
Hi, Terry!

381
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,551
Oh! Hi Bobby!

382
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:58,515
Mind if I sit down?

383
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:00,192
No, please!

384
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:08,767
So, it looks like things
didn't work out, huh?

385
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:11,966
No.

386
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:17,767
- You were right about him.
- What happened?

387
00:50:19,971 --> 00:50:23,067
Let's just say one woman's
not enough for him.

388
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,414
I'm sorry to hear that..

389
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,529
Thanks.

390
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:35,284
Well, actually, I'm
glad you're here.

391
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:38,150
It's nice to be wanted somewhere.

392
00:50:39,484 --> 00:50:40,725
What did you do tonight?

393
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:43,682
Nothing special.

394
00:50:45,264 --> 00:50:48,085
We watched a couple of ladies roll
around in the mud and get all wet.

395
00:50:50,002 --> 00:50:51,601
Sounds exciting.

396
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:53,362
It wasn't.

397
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,600
- I was thinking about you.
- What were you thinking?

398
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:05,059
I guess... I was jealous.

399
00:51:09,752 --> 00:51:10,998
Hey, what's wrong?

400
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:13,624
Nothing... nothing. I got to go.

401
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:21,780
Terry, I'm really sorry this
guy hurt your feelings.

402
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,690
Thank you.

403
00:57:16,488 --> 00:57:21,003
Robert, I've been looking for
you want to speak to you.

404
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,109
Yes, sir.

405
00:57:22,591 --> 00:57:24,659
How long have I known you...

406
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,425
How long have your father and
I been business associates?

407
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:31,323
- All my life.
- That's right.

408
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:32,449
All your life. So...

409
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:36,833
You would say I have your
best interests at heart.

410
00:57:37,404 --> 00:57:38,384
Yes, I would say that.

411
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:42,668
And I want to say one word
to you Robert. Just one word.

412
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:44,782
Computer chips.

413
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,163
Computer...

414
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,295
- Computer chips.
- That's two words.

415
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:54,351
It's the future. Never forget that.

416
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:05,262
- Hi boys.
- Hello.

417
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:08,362
- Oh, hello, hello Mrs. Crystal.
- Oh, thank you.

418
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:14,000
- Good punch?
- It's terrific!

419
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:16,261
It is the very best.

420
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:20,587
Thank you. Go easy, it has
a very heavy kick to it.

421
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:30,334
Oh, my, nice.

422
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,991
Now you want a little more
now don't you, Mrs. Crystal?

423
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:38,772
- No. No.
- O yes yes. Just a little.

424
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:41,818
Easy does it.

425
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,458
Terry!

426
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:53,872
May I speak with you.

427
00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:01,142
- Sure.
- Would you mind refilling my drink for me.

428
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:04,506
Not at all. Its scotch, right?

429
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,973
That's right. And while it,
make one for yourself.

430
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:09,252
No, thank you.

431
00:59:11,963 --> 00:59:16,780
So, how's Bobby doing?
Is he really applying himself?

432
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:19,565
He's doing great.
He's working very hard.

433
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:22,366
And you're very fond of him.

434
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:24,595
Yeah.

435
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:29,784
No, have a sit. Come on Sit here
and talk with me over my drink.

436
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,047
How's the party going?

437
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:40,983
Lively. That band is
really interesting.

438
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:45,783
I hate parties.
It's my wife's idea.

439
00:59:46,269 --> 00:59:50,221
She has so few, I like to indulge
the occasion one she has.

440
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:56,844
Hey, can we cut through
this small talk, Terry?

441
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,658
I find you very, very attractive.

442
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:03,739
And to come right to the point,
I would like to sleep you.

443
01:00:05,194 --> 01:00:07,331
It would be worth a
great deal to me.

444
01:00:07,332 --> 01:00:09,421
I'm afraid that's not possible.

445
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:12,822
- Really?
- Really.

446
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:16,979
Why not?

447
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:20,445
You see, I just don't like men

448
01:00:20,446 --> 01:00:23,386
who think they can have anything they
want just because they have money.

449
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,468
Is that to the point enough to you.

450
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:36,547
Slut!

451
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:01,939
Hi.

452
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,039
Hi, Bonnie, how you been?

453
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:07,975
Good. You look terrific.

454
01:01:08,513 --> 01:01:09,608
What did you do?

455
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:11,456
Nothing. Same old me.

456
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:18,310
No. There's somethin' different
You must be chasing some girl.

457
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:19,913
Who is she?

458
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:24,666
There's no one. How about you.
Still seeing that college guy.

459
01:01:25,372 --> 01:01:26,550
Biff? Sure.

460
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:31,963
Biff. C'mon, nobody's named Biff.

461
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:36,722
- I do Believe you're jealous.
- Baloney.

462
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,376
I love her. She's fantastic.

463
01:02:05,293 --> 01:02:10,507
No. She hates you like poison.
She's always hated you.

464
01:02:11,342 --> 01:02:12,763
Oh come on, she's crazy about me.

465
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,177
Sue Anne, would you
care to dance with me?

466
01:02:22,388 --> 01:02:23,446
No thank you.

467
01:02:25,123 --> 01:02:27,464
Then I suppose a blow job
completely out of the question.

468
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:41,537
- Hi.
- Well, Bobby,

469
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:45,508
I'm not sure this is right. I'm
worried you getting a wrong idea.

470
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:47,569
Like what?

471
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,667
Like this is more serious than it is.
I don't want you to get hurt. Okay.

472
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,802
Terry, don't worry about me. I am
not the sensitive, vulnerable type,

473
01:02:56,029 --> 01:02:58,324
You're not. What type are you.

474
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:02,227
The lewd, crude, couldn't
give a dame type.

475
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:06,685
Come on in before your
parents catch us.

476
01:03:47,053 --> 01:03:50,690
And why, pray tell, are you
sneaking from my bed, sir?

477
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:55,096
Because my parents are gonna
to be up any minute now.

478
01:03:59,405 --> 01:04:00,456
Terry.

479
01:04:01,848 --> 01:04:03,536
Something I have to
know before I go.

480
01:04:04,609 --> 01:04:05,315
Yeah.

481
01:04:12,943 --> 01:04:13,813
How am I doing?

482
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:17,249
I don't have anything to go on.

483
01:04:18,748 --> 01:04:20,621
You know nothing to compare.

484
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:24,877
Bobby you're wonderful.

485
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,874
How about on a scale of one to ten.

486
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:44,962
You're a ten... well... you're nine
and a half, nobody is perfect.

487
01:04:49,536 --> 01:04:52,259
- You gotta go.
- Yeah, right.

488
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:40,073
Son.

489
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:44,959
You better get up or
you're gonna be all stiff.

490
01:05:46,052 --> 01:05:46,774
Thanks, Dad.

491
01:05:47,248 --> 01:05:49,644
You pulled an all night.
I'm proud of you.

492
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,204
- But I think you better go to sleep.
- Good idea, Dad.

493
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:37,454
- What do you want?
- I'm here to see Terry.

494
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:39,824
- Get out of my way.
- She's not home.

495
01:06:40,336 --> 01:06:41,645
I will see about that.

496
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,402
- I told you.
- I'll wait.

497
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:07,613
The hell you will. Look your
trespassing. Now get lost.

498
01:07:08,136 --> 01:07:09,196
Don't make threats to me

499
01:07:09,922 --> 01:07:12,657
I'm a third degree
black belt in Karate.

500
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:15,039
I know a hundred different ways
to bust you up in seconds.

501
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:16,472
Wait here.

502
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,971
I only know one way to
squeeze this trigger.

503
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:52,290
Hi! What can I do for you?

504
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:57,145
I'm looking for a night
gown for my aunt.

505
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,260
If it's for your aunt, I'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.

506
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,012
I suggest you Roebuck.

507
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,539
Well, actually it's
for my girlfriend.

508
01:09:07,406 --> 01:09:10,986
Girlfriend. That's more like it.
Is she tall, short...

509
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:15,114
Skinny, fat, big bosom, flat
chested, what's the story?

510
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:18,252
Medium size. And very
well put together.

511
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:20,360
Oh, you are a diplomat, aren't you.

512
01:09:21,817 --> 01:09:22,899
And how old is she?

513
01:09:24,713 --> 01:09:25,735
Thirty.

514
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:32,209
Thirty? Not bad. Not bad.
A modern relationship. I like it.

515
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:36,436
I think I have just
the thing for you.

516
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,016
As you can see

517
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:46,106
a matching set of leather restrainers
and riding crop to go with this.

518
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:51,728
I think that's a little too much.

519
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,687
- Too much?
- Yeah.

520
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,850
Hi, Bobby.

521
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,330
Hi Bonnie.

522
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,170
Whatcha reading?

523
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:34,290
Nothing. Schoolwork.

524
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,690
What subject?

525
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,770
French.

526
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,930
Looks like fun.

527
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:22,449
Good night, Bobby. We'll be at
the Marshalls if you need us.

528
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:24,089
Good night, Mom.
You have good time.

529
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,170
Jack called earlier, are you
gonna to see him tonight?

530
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,289
I guess so. I don't know.

531
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:33,050
Well, whatever you
do, have good time.

532
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:34,810
I will.

533
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:54,729
Are you kidding with this?

534
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:57,889
Put your... put your knee, up there.

535
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,850
No human being can twist like that.

536
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,289
Where is my foot?

537
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,609
- Wait a second.
- Is that you?

538
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:09,169
- Is there someone else in you?
- That is the way.

539
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,810
- I don't think that's the....
- But that's in the book.

540
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,370
Don't believe everything
you read... just...

541
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,170
Bobby...

542
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:31,770
Making love has nothing to do
with those wild positions.

543
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,010
It's got to do with feelings.

544
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:38,490
And, honey, you definitely
got the feeling.

545
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:49,969
I don't know. I'm not sure I wanna
go to Stanford Law in the fall.

546
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:54,010
Maybe I should just go to Berkley and
take advantage of the institution.

547
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:58,249
Papa has his heart
set on Stanford..

548
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,010
All the boys have gone there.

549
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:04,610
All the same, I'm a bit partial
to being closer to San Francisco.

550
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,130
Good morning, Mrs. Chrystal.

551
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:15,690
Maria... you... Water... plant.

552
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,010
Si... yes... water.

553
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,890
Manuel. Lawn. Mow?

554
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,370
Mow?

555
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:35,490
Que?

556
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:43,609
Cut? Cut. Cut, cut, cut.
Cut, cut...

557
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:46,970
Ah, si, cut. Cut, cut,

558
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:51,656
Muy bien.

559
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:57,450
Oh, I just love talking Spanish.

560
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,970
Terry, guess what? They're goin
away for a whole weekend.

561
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,129
Now if I can only get rid
of Manual and Maria...

562
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,849
You make it sound like
a murder mystery.

563
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,410
Just give them the weekend off?

564
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:15,090
Great idea. Now why
didn't I think of that?

565
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:30,410
- Terry, you have to talk to me.
- Go away, it's over!

566
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:33,169
- Are you and this kid getting on?
- Get lost, you creep!

567
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,529
You stay out of this.

568
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,609
Terry, I love you. You
know you are the only one.

569
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,929
- Bugger off.
- Drop dead.

570
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:44,569
- Please leave us alone.
- Us? You two are making it.

571
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:47,249
- What if we are?
- I can't believe it.

572
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,770
Well, it's true. And he is
ten times the lover you are!

573
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,170
I'll kill you!

574
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:00,490
My baby. My baby.

575
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:03,569
My baby.

576
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,770
Thank God he's all right.

577
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:19,649
All right. Common now, let's pull
him out, it's such a beautiful day.

578
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,769
Raphael, would you put
those things in the trunk.

579
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,929
Darling, his name is Manuel.

580
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:25,570
Dear, what's the difference.

581
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:28,570
Raphael, Manuel, all right?

582
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:31,250
Keep your eye on the ball.

583
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,530
I love you... be a good boy.

584
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,040
Thank you, honey.

585
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,497
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

586
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:57,366
No, no, that's it Raphael.
Put those down.

587
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:02,370
All right, son, It's all yours
now... Hold the fort.

588
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,330
Thanks dad.

589
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:22,690
Hey, Manuel, can I speak
to you for a second?

590
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,330
Si Senor.

591
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,330
Why not you and Maria
take the weekend off.

592
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,969
Come on, Manuel, knock it off.

593
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:36,250
I know you and Maria
speak perfect English.

594
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:40,010
How long have you known?

595
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,850
Couple of years.

596
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:45,490
It's all right.
Your secret safe with me.

597
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:49,170
Just take the weekend
off yourselves.

598
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,529
We will.

599
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:54,130
And, Bobby, gracias.

600
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:02,730
Hmmm, Bobby, you're wonderful.

601
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:09,290
Bobby. How long can
you keep that up.

602
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,210
As long as I want.

603
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:31,489
Billy, I don't see why we can't go
back to the whorehouse tonight.

604
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:32,569
Are you kidding?

605
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,969
You whacked all their stuff.
They'd shoot you on sight.

606
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:37,170
Picky, picky, picky.

607
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,769
There's always Mexico.

608
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:41,249
They could march you
right down main streets

609
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,449
to get ten dollar bill in your
teeth and your problem over.

610
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:49,663
No. I am not going to
Mexico No way Jose.

611
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:43,362
Mexico!

612
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:51,132
- Bobby.
- Hmmm.

613
01:19:51,603 --> 01:19:55,036
What do you think your parents would
say if they could see us, right now.

614
01:19:56,916 --> 01:20:00,471
- They don't say anything.

615
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:05,419
I think they just hear the sounds.

616
01:20:07,453 --> 01:20:09,180
Do you think, they suspect anything.

617
01:20:11,129 --> 01:20:13,562
- No. I doubt it.
- Phew. That's good.

618
01:20:14,263 --> 01:20:17,726
Because, some day I may have to ask
them for a reference, you know.

619
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:20,328
- I'll give you one hell of a reference.
- I'm sure you would.

620
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:26,446
That's not going to help
me in teaching work.

621
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:28,476
Why you don't come
to collage with me.

622
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:31,982
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of
subjects I'm going to have trouble with.

623
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,481
I only teach French.

624
01:20:38,506 --> 01:20:43,148
Maybe I can major in French.
Who knows? If I study hard enough.

625
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:46,519
I could become a Frenchman.

626
01:20:50,144 --> 01:20:53,439
Nope, after the summer
the tutoring stops.

627
01:20:54,256 --> 01:20:55,292
All the tutoring?

628
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:00,520
Yes.

629
01:21:02,989 --> 01:21:04,260
Don't say anymore...

630
01:21:27,293 --> 01:21:28,504
Where's the wine?

631
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,116
So, Bobby,

632
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:39,989
Terry tells me that you have a heavy
crammed session this weekend.

633
01:21:40,932 --> 01:21:42,193
Oh we have.

634
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,676
And you're ready for
the exam tomorrow?

635
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:46,324
I'm sure I'm dad.

636
01:21:47,012 --> 01:21:48,890
I'm really happy about
your dedication Bobby.

637
01:21:55,064 --> 01:21:57,321
- Dad. I've been thinking.
- Hmmmm.

638
01:21:58,704 --> 01:22:00,512
What if I didn't go to Yale.

639
01:22:01,139 --> 01:22:02,836
What if I went to UCLA instead.

640
01:22:03,959 --> 01:22:06,427
All my friends are
goin there and...

641
01:22:07,243 --> 01:22:09,436
Bobby, there isn't any
ambition among your friends.

642
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:12,575
You're going to go to Yale and
make something of yourself.

643
01:22:13,287 --> 01:22:15,057
But UCLA has a terrific
astronomy department...

644
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:22,253
Bobby, looking through a telescope, it's
my idea of how to become successful.

645
01:22:23,055 --> 01:22:25,217
No, but it's a good way
to become an astronomer.

646
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:28,447
That's quite enough,
Bobby. I know...

647
01:22:30,055 --> 01:22:32,273
it's gonna be tough at Yale. But

648
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:36,717
it's only under pressure that you
find out what you're really made of.

649
01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:40,288
It's going to make a man
out of you. Really.

650
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:42,824
So stiffen your resolve.

651
01:22:44,489 --> 01:22:47,901
A good education is vital for
getting somewhere in this world.

652
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,349
Let's not hear any more
talk about U.C.L.A.

653
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,939
or stargazing. Understand?

654
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:58,840
- Sure, Dad. No more star gazing.
- Drink your milk.

655
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:16,750
To Finish. Je finis, tu finis il finit
nous finissons vous finissez...

656
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:23,764
Et finis. You're ready.

657
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:32,866
No, no, Bobby.

658
01:23:33,412 --> 01:23:35,770
Hey, come on, I'm tense.

659
01:23:36,192 --> 01:23:39,345
I got to relax. Big
gain tomorrow you know.

660
01:23:46,692 --> 01:23:48,435
See, that's just the point.

661
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:51,228
I don't want you to
do a scoring in bed.

662
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:54,720
Now should you to get up...
come on...

663
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:59,492
Get a good night's sleep and
the score on your exam.

664
01:24:00,186 --> 01:24:02,490
And then?

665
01:24:02,962 --> 01:24:06,922
And then, we'll see.

666
01:24:43,573 --> 01:24:44,913
What happened? What did you get?

667
01:24:46,467 --> 01:24:48,120
Oh, Bobby tell me.

668
01:24:49,402 --> 01:24:50,393
Ninety one.

669
01:24:50,394 --> 01:24:53,792
Ninety-one!

670
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:57,707
Oh, that's great, ninety one.

671
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:03,980
Ninety one.

672
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:18,793
- Let's keep going.
- You're crazy.

673
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,965
No, I mean it. Let's go
San Francisco. I've got money.

674
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:23,787
We can't go to San Francisco.

675
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:28,180
Sure we can. Hey, I'm packing
a 132 dollars and 45 cents.

676
01:25:28,816 --> 01:25:30,801
I already got
reservation in Carmel.

677
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:32,728
Bobby, you gotta go back.

678
01:25:51,506 --> 01:25:53,315
Too serious huh?

679
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:57,530
I just want to be alone with you
for a couple of days. That's all.

680
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:59,610
Is that so serious?

681
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:02,210
People do it all the time.

682
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,009
I've to get back to
the house. I have

683
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:07,729
a lot of loose ends to
tie up before I go.

684
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,970
Go? Go where?

685
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,330
I'm going to visit
my family in France.

686
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:15,370
France?

687
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,970
You haven't told me anything about
France. When did this come about.

688
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:23,850
I made the reservations last
week and I'm leaving tomorrow.

689
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,930
You going to France?

690
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,250
You never told you gone leave me?

691
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:32,850
Bobby, I'm not leaving you.

692
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:35,850
I'm going away, that's all.

693
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,129
- Same difference.
- No. No.

694
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,730
It's a very big difference.

695
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:44,010
Yeah. Either way you're leaving me.

696
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:56,210
Bobby, may I see you
for moment please?

697
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,089
Congratulations.

698
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:15,649
The school just called.
I'm very proud of you.

699
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:17,289
Thanks dad.

700
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:19,410
I now have the

701
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:21,529
bittersweet obligation
of having to pay

702
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:24,650
Miss Green that bonus of
ten thousand dollars.

703
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:30,369
Terry gets a ten thousand
dollar bonus because I passed?

704
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,170
She didn't tell you?

705
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:40,010
Maybe that's why she gave you
such special attention all summer.

706
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:44,130
People don't always do things
for best of motives, do they.

707
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,050
Bobby, sit down.
There's more I want to say to you.

708
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:49,449
That's okay. You said quite enough.

709
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:53,009
- Listen to me.
- No! You listen to me.

710
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:55,409
All my life I've been
listening to you.

711
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,169
Now I've got something
I want to say.

712
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:58,529
Drop it.

713
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:01,690
I'm going to UCLA this
fall, to stargaze.

714
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,730
That's where you'll find me.

715
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:12,929
Bobby, what happened?
What did he say?

716
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:15,569
Is it true that you get Ten
thousand dollars Because I passed.

717
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,049
That was your father's idea.
He insisted on it..

718
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,729
Not that you objected.

719
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,769
That's how you got the
ticket to France, right?

720
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:22,930
Yes, But... it has...

721
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,729
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because It has nothing to do with it.

722
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,530
Like hell it doesn't.

723
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:30,649
God, I should have seen
this coming all along.

724
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:32,729
Why didn't you just talk to
me at the beginning, huh?

725
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:36,330
How you could've made some kind
of arrangement. Like hooker!

726
01:28:36,331 --> 01:28:39,690
How could you say that to me?

727
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:54,050
Bonnie.

728
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,729
Bobby, what are you doing here?

729
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:08,930
Bonnie, I have to talk with you.

730
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:11,410
All right, I'll be right out.

731
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:29,210
What's up?

732
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:32,130
Bonnie...

733
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:36,770
Will you go to the movies
with me on Saturday night?

734
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:40,889
Bobby, you came over here at
two o' clock in the morning

735
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,930
to ask me for the movies?

736
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:45,850
What do you expect
me to do, telephone?

737
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:49,810
Yeah, that's the way
guys usually do it.

738
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:55,370
- But the problem is I promised Biff...
- Forget Biff.

739
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:59,610
- Forget Biff?
- He's through. Finished.

740
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:03,009
- He is too old for you.
- Too old. He's only twenty.

741
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:05,410
Way too old.

742
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,250
Why don't you pick on
someone your own age?

743
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,090
Who is that?

744
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:13,930
Me for instance.

745
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:21,090
Bobby... you know you are like...

746
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:19,810
I'm sorry about what
I said yesterday.

747
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,050
I was stupid.

748
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:25,570
I'm sorry that I hit you.

749
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:28,930
I wish you would've shot me.

750
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:36,170
So where were you last night.
Everyone was so worried about you.

751
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,730
I was over at Bonnie's.

752
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:44,769
Yeah, I think it's
time for me to go.

753
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:48,570
Otherwise Bonnie is gonna
have big fight on her hands.

754
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,890
So, it's off to France.

755
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:08,089
You sure you don't
want me to come along?

756
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:12,090
Come like a translator.
For the tough words.

757
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:15,330
I think I'm going to win
this one on my own.

758
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:25,690
I'm going to forget you.

759
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,410
No, you are not.

760
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,730
No, I'm not.

761
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:52,010
I can hear the clock
measuring ecstasy.

762
01:33:52,389 --> 01:33:59,228
Every sound inside a touch

763
01:34:00,411 --> 01:34:06,588
I can hear the warm
music of you and me

764
01:34:07,182 --> 01:34:15,282
It's the first time
We made love

765
01:34:15,582 --> 01:34:20,782
The first time
We made love
