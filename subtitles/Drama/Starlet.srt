1
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,293
Melissa. Hey.

2
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,837
Melissa. Melissa.

3
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:28,632
Wake up.

4
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,218
Can I change my room?

5
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,888
Hey.

6
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:36,640
Can I change my room?

7
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:40,644
I don't know how long I'm gonna
be here, but I just- it's not me.

8
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,730
Yeah.

9
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:49,318
I don't know. I just need to, like, paint
the walls or move the furniture...

10
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,362
- 'cause I'm, I don't-
- You can't.

11
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,239
- I don't know.
- You can't paint the walls...

12
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:55,407
because Mikey
may have to shoot in there.

13
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,411
No, maybe I should just
go to IKEA or something.

14
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,750
Don't waste your money on new shit.
Just go to a yard sale.

15
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,211
Yeah.

16
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:11,590
# I said I pull up
to the club #

17
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,884
# Fresh, fit, rocking the latest, man
Hos on my dick #

18
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,011
# And they be saying
you the greatest man

19
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:18,347
- How much is this one?
- Fifty cents.

20
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,723
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,016
# Do dat#
# Do dat, my nigga#

22
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,101
# Do dat#
# Yeah #

23
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:24,103
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

24
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:27,105
- Do you need help with that?
- Uh, no, I don't think so.

25
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,026
# Say you, dog, get the...
I don't give a fuck #

26
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,863
- Ten dollars?
- Yeah, no, it wasn't $10.

27
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:37,615
I had a price tag on there.
I want to say it was four.

28
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,367
- I was gonna say three.
- Three? There you go.

29
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,703
Hey. How much is this one?

30
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,501
- Twenty-five cents.
- How much this is?

31
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:49,669
It's five dollars, but...

32
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:51,045
- Five dollar?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:54,048
Isn't this
what they keep dead people in?

34
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:57,051
What? Is there a dead
person in this?

35
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,262
No. That's a thermos.

36
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,223
It could be a nice vase.

37
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:06,352
It's not a vase or an urn.
It's a thermos.

38
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,479
Thermos.
Chill the..

39
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,064
Okay.

40
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:11,773
No refunds.

41
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,113
Gonna be a lovely vase.
Thank you.

42
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:24,244
You... Oh, you are doing great.
Oh, look at that!

43
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:26,955
Um, how much for this?
A dollar.

44
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,928
Jesus fucking Christ.

45
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,512
Shit.

46
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,100
Yo. What the hell?
Fuck is all that shit?

47
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:50,228
I'm changing up my room.
Melissa said it was fine.

48
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,524
I told her
you have to use that room.

49
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:00,738
Fuckin' light me up,
'cause I'm not gonna stop.

50
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:03,407
Ready, put it. No. Ready?

51
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,498
Thank you.

52
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,999
Okay.

53
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:16,045
Now, try to do
what she fucking couldn't do...

54
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,631
which is hold fucking
cover on me.

55
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:21,217
Okay. as I fucking storm
this motherfucking hill.

56
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:27,682
Ew!

57
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,727
Oh, come on. I've had more fucking
disgusting shit in my mouth than that.

58
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:35,106
Know yourself as well as you
know your fuckin' enemy...

59
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:39,568
and only then will you, can you
win a thousand times in a row.

60
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:44,531
That is fucking 16th century ancient
Chinese philosophy. Sun Tzu.

61
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:47,075
What, and this is gonna
help me win Xbox? Yes.

62
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:48,660
It can help you fuckin'...
Oh.

63
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,328
Yeah.
It'll help you win at life.

64
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:53,331
Do not smoke all of this.
This is my fuckin'...

65
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,625
I want to be able to
put my foot into a pretzel.

66
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,627
You know I don't even
smoke that much. Chill.

67
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,172
This is not what I sell.
This is my fucking personal stash.

68
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,425
Let's get the dog high.

69
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,176
Uh-uh.

70
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,388
No, stop!

71
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:16,354
The dog...
You know that dog is Mexican.

72
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:18,898
He's a fuckin' cholo.

73
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:22,235
Like, you should have
named him Carlito.

74
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:25,405
That fuckin'...
That dog will cut a bitch.

75
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,990
Starlito.

76
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,499
Tess?

77
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,756
Deep breath. Let it out.

78
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,632
Perfect.

79
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,384
Okay.

80
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,314
Why the fuck are you home?

81
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,613
What the fuck are
you doing home?

82
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,950
Baby, I ripped my nail off.
It hurts bad.

83
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,201
Why the fuck
aren't you at work?

84
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:58,078
Um.

85
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:03,208
What? Things got...
Things got messed up at work.

86
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,669
How did they get messed up
at work?

87
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:09,131
I just made... I fucked up.
I fucked it up.

88
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,342
Okay. How did you fuck it up?
Explain this to me.

89
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,511
I shouldn't have gotten
as fucked up as I did.

90
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,013
It wasn't that big of a deal.
It's not the end of the world.

91
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,599
What do you mean you shouldn't have
gotten as fucked up as you did?

92
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,434
Is somebody gonna call me later
about today?

93
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:23,603
Stop asking me so many questions.
I can't answer them all.

94
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,897
- $1,200! Where the fuck are we gonna...
- That's what you care about?

95
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,650
You don't even care that I
broke my nail, and it hurts!

96
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,000
What? What? What?

97
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,419
Why? Really. Why?

98
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,297
Because I hurt my finger.

99
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:55,176
Because I hurt,
and my nail broke off.

100
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,886
Okay.

101
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,847
And it hurts really bad.
Okay, okay. Okay!

102
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,765
All right.

103
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,436
Let me see it. All right.

104
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:07,688
Okay.

105
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,237
Okay.

106
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,199
Seriously,
I gotta finish vacuuming. Okay?

107
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,093
We don't eat the money.
No, we don't eat the money.

108
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:44,766
This is to buy you things
that you can eat.

109
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:46,851
It's comfy.

110
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,646
I like it. Do you like it?

111
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,981
I like it.

112
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,788
Mom?

113
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,331
Hey.

114
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,333
No, I'm good.

115
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,418
Great, listen. Listen.

116
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:15,796
I think
you should come out here.

117
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:18,298
I think you'd really like it.

118
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:26,473
No, it's fine. I have a friend who can
basically get a plane ticket for, like, free.

119
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:31,687
Are you sure?

120
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:36,692
Fine. Okay, whatever.
Yeah.

121
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,527
Bye.

122
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,466
Love them.
Beautiful, huh?

123
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,509
Yeah.

124
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,845
460 today.

125
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,892
Old money, hmm?

126
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:20,026
No, I don't have anything smaller.
Uh, okay.

127
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,070
Come on, Starlet. Come on.

128
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,375
# Microphones, turntables #

129
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,752
# Beating matters in your brains
like a hand drum #

130
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,588
# This here is a hip-hop anthem
Everybody in this... #

131
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,520
- Hi.
- Yes?

132
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:44,733
Um, I think I bought this
from you at the yard sale.

133
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:49,488
You did. And I also told you there's no
refunds, so what are you doing here?

134
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,949
No, I just... I...
Good-bye. No.

135
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,494
But it's not about...

136
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:09,799
You want to be free, Greg?
Um, I gue- Sure. Yeah.

137
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,342
Question.

138
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,012
Say you find, like, a shitload of money,
and you're...

139
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,432
you're pretty sure
you know whose it is...

140
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:20,935
and you're pretty sure that he or she
has no idea that they ever had it...

141
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,854
what would you do?

142
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,730
How much money?

143
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,860
Well, like...

144
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,238
say, 10 grand.

145
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,324
You found 10 grand?
No.

146
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:39,036
It's... I mean, it's just a story that...
I mean...

147
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,373
Never mind. Give me that.

148
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:45,376
Yeah, I'm not high enough
for these type of questions.

149
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:54,718
You know, unless they
really needed it.

150
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,804
What? Who?

151
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:00,849
The money. Unless
they really needed the money.

152
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:04,561
Like if it was a family, you know,
and they were like...

153
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,730
homeless...

154
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:09,232
and broke
and they were living off dog food.

155
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,234
Otherwise fuck it.

156
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:13,695
It's yours. Keep it.

157
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,073
Hey.

158
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,159
Be careful with that shit.

159
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,828
My mom pops like 10 a day.

160
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,709
This show sucks.

161
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,586
Just party, jackass.

162
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,130
# Big bitch, and she
answer to Mocha #

163
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,549
# My pussy stay wet,
and it's tighter than a choker

164
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,468
# It's real good, nigga
I know you want a taste #

165
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:41,222
What am I doing?

166
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,849
# Nigga, tell me where you want it
On the floor or on the bed?

167
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,352
# Bust one nut
I ain't done, I got more to come #

168
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,187
# Pussy 50 good
and it taste like a honey bun #

169
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,690
# I'm tasty #
# Pink Dollaz #

170
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,615
#And we run that shit #
# I'm tasty #

171
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,872
Starlet, where's she going?

172
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,128
Stay.

173
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:22,554
Hey. Um, you just dropped my friend
off, but I can take her home.

174
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:24,889
You mean the old lady?
Yeah.

175
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:27,016
Okay. Well...
How much is it?

176
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,396
Well, I have, uh, 13.25.
That's fine.

177
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,481
This is... This should cover it.
That's... Oh, that's plenty.

178
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:35,316
Are you kidding? Thanks.
No, that's fine.

179
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,292
Oh, my God. Hi!

180
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:57,672
Do you remember me? I was the one
who bought the thermos from you.

181
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:06,555
- Hey, what's wrong?
- My cab's gone.

182
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:10,100
- Well, I can give you a ride. No problem.
- No. I'll call another.

183
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:12,769
No, no, no. Totally fine. I got it.

184
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:14,980
Here. I'll grab those.

185
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,859
No, no, no. Don't worry.
Honestly. Hop in the car.

186
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:20,485
There. Right there.

187
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,948
Get in! I won't take no for an answer.
Come on.

188
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,829
It's so weird running into you.

189
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,627
I like that grocery store.
It's really good.

190
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,171
They have a good variety of cereal.

191
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:44,885
And they're always in stock with Rice Krispie Treats.
It thrills me on all levels.

192
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,140
You can just leave 'em right there.

193
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,434
No, it's fine.
I'll take them into the kitchen.

194
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,478
Is it that way?

195
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,313
Starlet. Off. Get off.

196
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:59,815
Starlet. Starlet. Get off.

197
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:02,693
Starlet.
Okay. I'll show you.

198
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,848
Oh, I see.
You want money.

199
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:35,351
No. No. No, no, no.

200
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,811
Totally fine.

201
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:42,315
Okay. Thank you then.

202
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,985
I'm a little... parched.

203
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:47,362
What?

204
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,197
I'm kind of thirsty.

205
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,574
Oh, God.

206
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,540
Here.

207
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,127
Thank you.

208
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:06,589
Oh. Do you have any ice?
No.

209
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:14,180
Are you thirsty?
What are you doing?

210
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,599
Starlet.
What are you doing?

211
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,643
That dog's drinking out of that...
my, my glass.

212
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,853
He's completely clean.
It's fine.

213
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:22,896
I'll have to throw my glass away.
No.

214
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,190
Do you realize an animal's
drinking out of my glass?

215
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:26,608
Sorry.

216
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:29,987
That's sickening.
And you're drinking out of it?

217
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,575
That's sick. Disgusting.

218
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:44,835
It's really nice here.

219
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,514
It's good water.

220
00:19:58,056 --> 00:19:59,600
It's water.

221
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,873
Where you goin'?

222
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:25,833
Wow.

223
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:28,127
Why do you have
so many Eiffel Towers?

224
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,214
I love Paris.

225
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,717
What do you like about Paris?

226
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,181
The Arc de Triomphe.

227
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,476
Champs-Élysées.

228
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,144
Petit Palais.

229
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,938
I love it all.

230
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:49,564
Don't touch anything!
Put it down.

231
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:51,858
Sorry.

232
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,243
The Eiffel Tower in Vegas
is pretty cool.

233
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,004
So what do you do?

234
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,841
What do you mean
what do I do?

235
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,260
Like during the day. Like...

236
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:22,597
Like I-I don't know.
I go out with my friends...

237
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,685
and we go clubbing,
and sometimes I'll lie out...

238
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:29,980
and sometimes
I'll take Starlet for a walk.

239
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,607
And...

240
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,276
I don't know. For, like, fun.

241
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,361
You know, like, whoo!

242
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:40,406
I don't know. For fun.

243
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:48,622
I play bingo every Saturday
at St. Anne's.

244
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:51,292
Is that your idea of fun?

245
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:55,880
Yeah.

246
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:58,632
That's what I do.

247
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,891
Okay.

248
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:09,518
Well, I'm gonna go...

249
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,687
and I'm gonna give you my number.

250
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,149
And if you ever need a ride
to the grocery store...

251
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:17,818
or, like,
any little errand or whatever...

252
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:22,071
I can get a cab. I don't need you.
It's... That's stupid.

253
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:26,451
Yeah, but it's so silly. I mean, I'm
not gonna charge you anything, and I-

254
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:29,162
it's easier. You just call me.

255
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:31,956
Okay.
Yeah.

256
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,918
And I'll bring my trusty sidekick.

257
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,586
Thank you for the water.

258
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,130
Yeah.
Okay. But really, call me.

259
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,298
Bye!

260
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,966
Bye.

261
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:03,695
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is Mikey home?

262
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:05,530
Uh, I don't know. I'll check.

263
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:09,701
Mikey.
Huh?

264
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:11,995
There are a couple kids
outside for you.

265
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:15,290
Oh. Fuck.

266
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,334
You gotta take this fucking game for me.
You gotta take this game.

267
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,127
It's a fucking live game.
It's a live game.

268
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,798
Do not get me killed.

269
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,470
Okay, look. I need a little favor.
Mikey's being cheap as fucking usual...

270
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:32,307
and I need to borrow $250, otherwise
they're gonna take away Big Red.

271
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,560
They can't take away Big Red.

272
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:39,898
Sorry, it's none of my business, but why
the fuck do you let him handle your money?

273
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:43,944
'Cause he's saving up
for some big extravaganza.

274
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:46,905
I don't know,
some big thing he's been plotting.

275
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:49,198
Did you get me fucking smoked?

276
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,784
You didn't get me smoked, did you?
Here. Thank you.

277
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,495
You rock, Janie-Poo.

278
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,539
Janie-Poo.

279
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:59,333
What? I come up with cute nicknames...

280
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,253
unlike some people,
who just call me "Babe."

281
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:08,968
300.

282
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:12,555
Thanks. Arash owes me a check anyway, so I'll
just pay you back when he gets it to me.

283
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:13,639
Whatever.

284
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,564
Find it yet?

285
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:30,906
Here's a diagonal,
the last number called.

286
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,701
And there's a second diagonal
with the last number called.

287
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:37,495
Are there any others?

288
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,247
Are there any others?

289
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,207
Game closed,
with one winner.

290
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:45,045
Thank you.
Thank you.

291
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:47,589
Hi.
Hi, can I help you?

292
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:51,217
Um, yeah. What do I need?

293
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:53,261
For what?
For the game.

294
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:54,888
To play bingo?
Yeah.

295
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,931
You would need
one of these packs.

296
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:59,893
Okay, and how much is it?
It's $25.

297
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,812
Out of a hundred.

298
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,565
There you go, and good luck.

299
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:07,817
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

300
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:09,694
Thanks.

301
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:28,378
B-4.

302
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,840
B-4.

303
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,134
Hi.

304
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:39,139
What are you doing here?

305
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:43,852
Bingo.

306
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:48,482
I've never seen you here before.

307
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:52,444
Well, it's a new interest.

308
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,537
O-71.

309
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:08,209
O... 71.

310
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:12,171
Phew. Can I borrow one of your markers?
I forgot mine.

311
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:15,883
Oh, go ahead. Take one.

312
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:18,469
Thank you.

313
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,642
B-3.

314
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:26,602
Look. It matches my sweater.

315
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,063
B-3.

316
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,066
I'm playing bingo.
Leave me alone.

317
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:36,362
I love this game.

318
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:38,573
O-70.

319
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:39,866
Bingo!

320
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:43,536
There is a bingo.
B-7. Hold your cards.

321
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,371
Oh.

322
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:50,167
Game closed with one winner.
Give the lucky player $150.

323
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,502
There's a five minute break here.

324
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:55,797
Plenty of room down there.
You don't have to sit here.

325
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,299
One and 30.

326
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,759
But I don't know
anybody else here.

327
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:07,851
N-38.

328
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:10,270
B-11.

329
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,441
N-35.

330
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:17,944
B-10.

331
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:25,785
O-69.

332
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,457
O-69.

333
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,168
Oh, my cab. My cab's not here.

334
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:38,005
What happened?
My cab. My cab's not here.

335
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:39,590
Again?

336
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:42,134
That's just weird.
Oh.

337
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,719
Weird.

338
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,139
I guess I can give you a ride.

339
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:55,439
I'm a Sagittarius, which means I'm
really... I'm really good with people...

340
00:27:55,522 --> 00:27:57,608
according to my chart.

341
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:59,652
I bet you're like...

342
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:02,112
a Pisces.

343
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:04,281
You seem very sensitive.

344
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,243
And quiet.

345
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:17,794
So...

346
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:22,757
do you ever win at bingo?

347
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:28,596
Oh, my God! Fu...
Help!

348
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,932
Get it off! Oh, my God!

349
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:34,102
- Fucking crazy old bitch!
- You think I was born yesterday?

350
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:36,646
I know a scammer when I see one. Help!

351
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:38,398
Bingo? Yes!

352
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:43,027
You said something about a bingo game,
and she maced you as a result of that?

353
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:46,447
She's fucking insane! Hey, hey, hey!
Again with the language.

354
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:51,119
The cab was gone, and she was there,
and she said, "Oh, well, I'll take you home."

355
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:52,704
As a favor?
As a favor.

356
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:54,414
Fine. Done. We're done.

357
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:57,125
I suggest you take her
to a fucking crazy person's home.

358
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,295
I felt that
there's something funny here.

359
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,587
Please get in your vehicle and...
I'm getting in my vehicle.

360
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:03,630
And drive away.

361
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:06,300
So you see this lady weekly?
You see her all the time?

362
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:09,386
You know, it's like every
time I turned around she was there.

363
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:11,555
So it's like I'm being haunted by this...

364
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,683
What is...

365
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:16,852
Starlet.

366
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,437
Jesus.

367
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:21,315
Yeah. Look at that. No.

368
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,818
No.

369
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,946
So what kind of cars do you have?

370
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,241
I got some trucks. I got S.U.V.s.
I got some sports cars.

371
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:33,160
How much down payment
are you working with?

372
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:35,287
With like...

373
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,498
I don't know.
I've got some cash.

374
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,500
Oh, it's so pretty.

375
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:42,419
Told you.

376
00:29:43,253 --> 00:29:46,964
Okay, so how much monthly then
are we talking?

377
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:49,800
We gotta put it in the computer system.
That way I can figure out...

378
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:51,844
how many months you wanna go,
stuff like that.

379
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:54,055
Wait. Hold on. Sorry. Hello?

380
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:56,974
I was just calling to say that...

381
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:00,144
the officers told me that
you weren't up to shenanigans...

382
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:02,021
that you were trying-
you were just...

383
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,106
you were trying to be
a Good Samaritan.

384
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:08,819
Okay. Apology accepted, I guess.

385
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:09,945
Bye.

386
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:14,283
I appreciate Good Samaritans.

387
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,577
Okay, great. Bye.

388
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,206
Uh, oh, oh,
and if you're still interested...

389
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:23,918
in driving me to the supermarket,
that would be fine.

390
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,128
Oh, that'd be fine, would it?

391
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:28,547
Bye.

392
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,173
Bye.

393
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,842
Fucking unbelievable.

394
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:34,886
Sorry.

395
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:23,517
Why'd you name him Starlet?
He's a boy.

396
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,729
I don't know.
I had the name Starlet first, and then...

397
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:30,274
found him at a rescue shelter.

398
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:32,276
Just kinda stuck with it.

399
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,028
You like it, don't you?
Don't you?

400
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:38,866
Don't you?

401
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,541
I like your garden.

402
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,919
Well, I've had it a long time, 40 years.

403
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,840
What's your favorite flower?

404
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:57,676
Mmm, I like the morning glory.

405
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:01,053
I really like those ones.

406
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:08,519
They remind me of
my neighbor back in Florida.

407
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:12,148
She had them covering her front yard.

408
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:16,527
Can't remember what
they're called though, like...

409
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:18,279
Black-eyed Susan.

410
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:19,906
Yeah.

411
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,425
So were you ever married?
Yep.

412
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:46,097
A long time ago.

413
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:48,725
Yeah.

414
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:51,978
Frank died.
He had a heart attack.

415
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,563
I'm sorry.

416
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,108
What'd he do?
He was a gambler.

417
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,154
Wait. That's what he did?

418
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:02,572
For a living?

419
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:03,907
Yeah.

420
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:09,120
Wow.
Just a gambler.

421
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,210
So what are you doing
before bingo tomorrow?

422
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,546
Why? What are you asking for?

423
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:22,050
I don't know. Do you wanna have brunch?
I don't do brunch.

424
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,469
Lunch?

425
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,596
Don't do lunch either.

426
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,057
Um, late breakfast?

427
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,559
Okay

428
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,143
7:30.

429
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,729
No, no, no.
I said a late breakfast.

430
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,315
That's two and a half hours
past the time I would eat.

431
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:43,320
Fine. 7:30 it is.

432
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,841
Dude.

433
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:07,595
What are you doing? No.

434
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,638
What the fuck?

435
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:21,357
Melissa!

436
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,443
Melissa, somebody just stole your car!

437
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:24,611
What?

438
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,447
- Somebody just stole your fucking car!
- What the fuck? What?

439
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,449
Yeah, somebody just stole your car!
Oh, my fuck.

440
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,367
Mikey,
somebody fucking took the car.

441
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:33,244
- Should I call the cops?
- No!

442
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:36,456
Tell her not to fucking call the cops.
It just got repoed.

443
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:38,750
Don't call the cops.

444
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,502
What? Why?
Fucking repo.

445
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:45,882
Why you getting mad at me? I told you
not to fucking park it there. Ow!

446
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:49,010
You guys are fucking insane.

447
00:35:07,694 --> 00:35:09,696
Jesus, you're hungry.

448
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:15,410
Well, the secret to living to be my age
is a big breakfast like this.

449
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,662
No lunch...

450
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:21,249
and a salad for dinner, and you
have the perfect bowel movement.

451
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,002
Jesus.

452
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,342
So, um...

453
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,011
yard sales often?

454
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:36,139
What?
Do you have yard sales often?

455
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:38,892
Um.

456
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:41,645
Insurance company made me do it.

457
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,771
Why?

458
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,693
The mailman, clumsy idiot.

459
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:53,406
There was a little crack in the steps,
and he fell and broke his leg.

460
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:55,991
And there was weeds and clutter...

461
00:35:56,075 --> 00:36:00,037
and they said it was a risk
and a safety hazard...

462
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:03,791
and so they...
they're forcing me to clean it up.

463
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,002
I didn't know they could do that.

464
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:13,968
So...

465
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:17,346
the thermos I bought from you...

466
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:19,557
Is it...

467
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:22,226
Is it...

468
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,563
What's with you and this thermos?

469
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:27,273
Is it broken?

470
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:29,566
No, no, no. I was just... I mean...

471
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:34,779
Is it yours, or...

472
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,823
Of course it's mine.

473
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:39,784
I wouldn't have put it...
I was just asking. I just...

474
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:42,120
Is something wrong with it?

475
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:45,331
You can get your money back.
No, it works great. Thank you.

476
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,792
So...

477
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:51,337
after your husband died...

478
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:55,258
did you ever think
of getting remarried?

479
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:56,593
No.

480
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,683
You have children?

481
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:09,022
No.

482
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:10,690
Thank you.

483
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,277
I insist.
Stop. It's not even that much.

484
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,529
No, it's mine. I didn't even
eat that much. It's fine.

485
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,742
It's mine. Listen. I have more money
than I can ever spend in my lifetime.

486
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,368
You do?
Yes.

487
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,622
Remember I told you
Franky was a gambler?

488
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:27,915
Yeah.

489
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,584
He was a good one.

490
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:34,880
L-27.

491
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,800
L-27.

492
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,679
G-49.

493
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,933
G-49.

494
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,353
Why don't you have any of those good
luck charms that everybody else has?

495
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,438
They don't...
They don't work. I don't use that stuff.

496
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,481
Really?
No.

497
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:55,484
G-55.
It's not my thing.

498
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,777
Because...
I don't like that stuff.

499
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,362
They're winning.

500
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,825
N-37.

501
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,702
Bingo!

502
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,414
You win some, you lose some.

503
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:12,500
No, you lose them all.

504
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:17,922
I'll have you know,
last year I won a game.

505
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,341
A game?
Yes.

506
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,884
Really?
Yes.

507
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,887
What did you win?
$125.

508
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:29,892
Jesus, you'd think your husband's gambling
luck would have rubbed off on you a bit more.

509
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,353
Hmm.

510
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,109
What?

511
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,279
I haven't...

512
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:46,616
I haven't seen Frank in three months.

513
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,996
What do you mean you haven't seen Frank
in three months? I thought he was dead.

514
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,373
He 13 dead.

515
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:58,044
I-I mean, I haven't been to the
cemetery since I stopped driving.

516
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,548
Did you lose your license?

517
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,718
No. I gave it up.

518
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,761
On my birthday last year.

519
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,431
I went to the D.M.V.
and turned it in.

520
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,018
Jesus. Why the fuck
would you turn in your license?

521
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,728
That's retarded.

522
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:19,524
Because when old people are old, they're old,
and they don't need to be driving anymore.

523
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,234
You see that lady over there?

524
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,320
That's Dorothy.
Yeah.

525
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,699
She was driving on the sidewalk...

526
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,869
for three blocks
and didn't even realize it...

527
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,288
and then hit two pedestrians.

528
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:36,415
56.

529
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:38,584
They have no business driving...

530
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,628
'cause they're old.

531
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,008
So basically
you're trying to ask for a ride?

532
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,426
Hmm.

533
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,973
Hmm.
Hmm.

534
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,937
Do you want me to give you a ride?

535
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,189
61. Ah.

536
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,316
Ah.

537
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,570
Oh, you know you want a ride,
and I'm gonna give you a ride.

538
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,949
Stop. Get off my thing!
just stop playing with my board!

539
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,617
Hi, Goobers! Kisses!

540
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,453
What are you doing?

541
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,455
Dyeing my hair.
No.

542
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,540
No. Stop. You're gonna mess up. Sit.

543
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,793
I got Luscious Raspberry.

544
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:24,545
Luscious.
Luscious. Luscious Raspberry.

545
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:27,090
I know...
'Cause I know, like, on the-

546
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:30,134
You know like on the color wheel
what things go together.

547
00:40:30,218 --> 00:40:32,428
I would've been good at that.

548
00:40:33,054 --> 00:40:36,182
Like, you know, and, like...

549
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:38,977
you know,
work at one of those salons and...

550
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,312
I thought about,
like, Hot Pink too...

551
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:45,733
but that's kind of like too, you know,
whorey, like wanting attention.

552
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:47,694
Red's more subtle.

553
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,716
Stop. That's it.
Stop, stop, stop, stop. That's it.

554
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:12,509
Where?
Okay. Right here. Right here.

555
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:14,594
Could you back up a little tiny bit?

556
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:18,807
That's too much.

557
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,643
That's too much.
Well, I don't... You said back up.

558
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:23,687
I assumed that you wanted to go back.
I just...

559
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,648
Yeah, but I don't want that much.
just... Now that's it.

560
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:28,442
Is this okay?
Stop right here. That's it.

561
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:30,027
You sure?
That's it. Good.

562
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,779
Maybe we can make it better and...
I want you to-

563
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:34,823
Stop. You're making me nuts!
This is nice.

564
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:37,325
Will you stop? This is it.

565
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,703
You got the car crooked.

566
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:43,039
Are those from your garden?

567
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:46,792
Yes, I try to bring a different bunch
every time I come.

568
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:49,962
I'll be back.

569
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:33,296
I really prefer my own brand.

570
00:42:34,798 --> 00:42:37,467
That dry shit
that you shove into hot water?

571
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:20,050
- Hello?
- Janey, it's me.

572
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:23,470
My cell phone got shut off.
Can you give me a ride to Renegade?

573
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,809
- I'll do it when I get home.
- No, no, no. I need a ride now. It's an emergency.

574
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:30,811
All the other girls
got their checks but me.

575
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:32,688
Where are you?

576
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:34,648
Um.

577
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:37,734
I'm on the corner
of Winnetka and Vanowen.

578
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:41,989
What's up?

579
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:44,867
We have to take a slight detour.

580
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,919
I'm really sorry about this,
by the way.

581
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:02,091
In back.

582
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:08,681
Hey! Watch Starlet!
Jesus, Melissa! Come on.

583
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:11,434
Arash is totally fucking me.

584
00:44:12,018 --> 00:44:13,853
Why isn't Mikey handling this?

585
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:16,105
Because he said he
doesn't want to rock the boat.

586
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:25,239
Renegade.
It's Zana.

587
00:44:29,744 --> 00:44:31,412
Zana. Zana!

588
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:34,040
She's quite the stable one.

589
00:44:34,123 --> 00:44:35,791
Hmm. Yeah.

590
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,090
Walking!

591
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:46,968
You wanna tell me why
you haven't fucking paid me?

592
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:49,763
Huh?
Let me call you back.

593
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,891
Where's my fucking money?

594
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:54,809
Are you kidding me?
No.

595
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:57,020
You didn't even work.
What are you talking about?

596
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:59,064
You don't even remember
what happened, do you?

597
00:44:59,147 --> 00:45:03,109
You couldn't perform, I called a
cab for you, and I sent you home.

598
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:05,111
Do you remember that?

599
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:07,280
So pay me
my fucking kill fee then.

600
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:11,493
What kill fee? You know very well kill fee
is paid when I'm the one who cancels.

601
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,203
Then...
What are you talking about?

602
00:45:13,286 --> 00:45:15,080
Then help me
find a new job like you-

603
00:45:15,163 --> 00:45:17,749
Then fucking help me like you said
you were gonna fucking help me!

604
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:20,585
- I have been trying to help you for months.
- You'd pay me if you wanted to help me!

605
00:45:20,669 --> 00:45:23,754
Pay you for what? Pay me for my work!
Or for my not work!

606
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:27,466
If you don't wanna hire me, then fucking
help me, like you say you're gonna help me.

607
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:30,052
You know what?
I had enough of this. Go.

608
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:32,346
"I had enough of this.
Go. Oh, get out."

609
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,181
Be nice.
"Be nice."

610
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:37,351
Fucking sand nigger.
Get the fuck out of here! Janice!

611
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:40,854
What kind of business is this?

612
00:45:42,314 --> 00:45:46,026
Um, it's like a temp agency.

613
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:48,362
Hmm.

614
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,949
Get the fuck off me, bitch.
Bitch?

615
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:54,868
You're outta here! Outta here!
I'm not fucking going anywhere!

616
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,204
Out! Oh, I wanna punch
you in your brown face!

617
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,248
Why don't you do it then?
Stop it. You stop too!

618
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:01,500
You fucking touch us all!
Get her out of here!

619
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,253
You fucking love molesting all of us, huh?
When did that happen? When?

620
00:46:04,336 --> 00:46:06,964
I bet you fucking touch Janice,
and she fucking likes it!

621
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:10,383
- You're out!
- I'm going. I'll take my sweet time.

622
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:13,303
Get that fucking thing
out of my face.

623
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,472
Wow. I'm really gonna miss it here.

624
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:17,557
Come on.

625
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:19,600
Stop.

626
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:23,229
I'm trying to make this a little better for you.
You could at least just walk out with some class.

627
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,565
Oh!
What is that?

628
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:27,608
What are you doing?
Zana, come on.

629
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:30,778
How's that for B.T.S.?
Fucking pathetic losers.

630
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,655
You are so paying for that.

631
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:36,326
Oh, I'll fucking pay for it
when Arash pays me, bitches!

632
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:38,995
Suck it!

633
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:42,040
Thanks, Zana.
You're gonna get me fired.

634
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:44,083
Suck my dick.

635
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:52,924
Jane, please, you have to go
get me my money. Please?

636
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:01,058
It's Tess.

637
00:47:02,934 --> 00:47:04,394
Hey. Amy.

638
00:47:04,478 --> 00:47:06,772
Wait, Tess.
No, I have to deal with this.

639
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:07,856
Really?

640
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:18,533
You all right?

641
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,247
Who are you?

642
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,666
I mean...
That's not-not my problem.

643
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,127
Can somebody just talk to her?
Janice, you're good with her. Come on.

644
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:33,632
I was good with her, until she came flying in
here like some cracked-out little spider monkey.

645
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:35,717
She called me a bitch. She's
shoving people. Fuck.

646
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:38,511
We're done. I don't know what to say to her.
She's in my car.

647
00:47:38,594 --> 00:47:40,554
I just... Let's go downstairs.
I'll walk you down.

648
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:42,556
Come. I gotta talk to you.

649
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:45,810
By the way,
we are number one in preorders.

650
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:48,646
That means you are getting the cover.

651
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:51,273
Really?
Yeah. How cool is that?

652
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,111
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet Jane's grandmother.

653
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:58,531
- I'm not her grandmother.
- Arash, she's not my grandmother.

654
00:47:58,614 --> 00:47:59,949
Oh, I'm sorry.

655
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:03,577
And you...
I'm gonna be very nice to you.

656
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:05,913
I'm gonna freeze you for one month.
What?

657
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:09,375
And ask your boyfriend
what a noncompete clause means...

658
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:12,253
'cause if I hear you're taking other
work, you're through for life.

659
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,755
Hey, we should go.
It was a pleasure meeting you, ma'am.

660
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:16,674
- Bye.
- Wait. What about the expo, Arash?

661
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:18,676
You're not coming to the show.
What?

662
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:32,313
Thanks.
Bye.

663
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:42,449
So what's up with the old lady?
just somebody I'm helping out.

664
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:44,951
Helping with what?

665
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:50,373
It's nothing.

666
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,472
Hello?

667
00:49:06,055 --> 00:49:07,389
Hey, Janice.

668
00:49:08,307 --> 00:49:10,225
Cool. Yeah, I'll be there at 10:00.

669
00:49:11,393 --> 00:49:12,603
Okay.

670
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:16,565
Wait.
Who am I working with tomorrow?

671
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:19,401
Ooh.

672
00:49:20,652 --> 00:49:24,573
You think you could talk to him for me and
just kind of, like, smooth things over?

673
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:31,663
Can't you just let things
blow over for a couple weeks?

674
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:34,917
I mean, it'll be fine.

675
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,880
Yeah.

676
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:42,925
Okay.

677
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:46,887
- Walk him. Make sure he pees.
- Yeah, yeah.

678
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,681
Hey, have fun today.
Thank you. Bye.

679
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:50,766
Bye.

680
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,528
So full of people...

681
00:50:04,362 --> 00:50:06,906
Do it, girl. They keep telling
me I should have one...

682
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:09,784
'cause every time one of them
mentions me, my followers go up.

683
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:10,910
I'm like, really?

684
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:14,830
Okay, mush.
You can cover my third eye.

685
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:19,252
One more.

686
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:22,463
There you go.

687
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:26,551
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

688
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:28,386
Cammie, how are you?
Good. How are you?

689
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:31,138
Good. Make sure she looks like
million bucks today.

690
00:50:31,222 --> 00:50:33,140
Oh. Done!

691
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:34,809
Chin up.

692
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,312
Cool.
Thank you.

693
00:50:46,027 --> 00:50:47,988
Pull that light down a little bit.
You got it.

694
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:50,907
And, uh, remove those stingers
over there, and we'll go ahead...

695
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:52,576
Tess, how are you?
Good. How are you?

696
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,244
Good. This is Manuel.
Hey.

697
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:55,870
How are you?
Good. How are you?

698
00:50:55,954 --> 00:50:57,581
Very good to meet you.

699
00:50:57,664 --> 00:50:59,624
All right. Go ahead.
Grab a seat right there, and we'll...

700
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,459
Let me look at them.
Yeah.

701
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:02,877
Beautiful. Okay.
They look good?

702
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:03,962
Yeah.
Too much?

703
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:06,172
No, it's very good.
Okay. All right.

704
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:09,843
Cool. Well, grab a seat,
and we'll just basically, you know...

705
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,137
Manuel, trusting soul here,
he's gonna take us...

706
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,388
Yeah?

707
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,432
What the fuck is this, man?
It's just a little dust.

708
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:18,935
We have two full HD cameras.
Right? Yeah.

709
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:21,854
So this stuff is gonna be on the scene.
That's props. Props!

710
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:23,230
Got it. Please clean it.

711
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:25,399
That's why I didn't like to shoot here.
This was your idea.

712
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,610
No. it's all right. It's a great space.
Make sure somebody cleans that.

713
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:29,486
I guarantee we'll take care of it.
This is very important.

714
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,322
I know it's very important for you.
Make sure it's clone right.

715
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:34,158
We're gonna take care of it. Why don't you
grab a seat back there and we'll begin.

716
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:35,534
Great, thanks.

717
00:51:35,618 --> 00:51:39,538
All right. So it's real simple.
Manuel, I need a pop shot right there.

718
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,546
What is that? Hmm?

719
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:50,382
What did you get into?

720
00:52:21,162 --> 00:52:23,790
Eight, nine.

721
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,508
That sounds great.

722
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:37,136
We'll change the script.

723
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,721
Do you want this closed?
Yeah.

724
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:40,014
Head on in, close the door...

725
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,100
and then, when I say action,
you're coming out.

726
00:52:42,183 --> 00:52:43,851
Do you want me to be dick ready, or...

727
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:46,020
Yeah, well, just, you
know, you know, you know...

728
00:52:46,104 --> 00:52:48,690
Let it build, but keep both arms
behind the back.

729
00:52:48,773 --> 00:52:50,857
Kay. Oh, perfect.

730
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:53,443
Okay, here we go.

731
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:55,195
And...

732
00:52:55,278 --> 00:52:56,780
action.

733
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,913
Oh, girl. Fuck.

734
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:51,500
I love it when you work
my fuckin' cock.

735
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:08,017
Oh, yeah.

736
00:54:09,101 --> 00:54:10,686
Open up to the camera, guys.

737
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,814
Who's my pretty bitch?

738
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:21,863
Oh, yeah.

739
00:54:23,364 --> 00:54:26,826
Mmm. Oh.

740
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,411
Come here, Tess.

741
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:30,789
Come on up. Come here. Come here.

742
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,373
Yeah, fuck me.

743
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,420
Fuck me, baby.

744
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:40,757
Come on, Tess. Come on.

745
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,010
I'm on the set. What?

746
00:54:44,093 --> 00:54:45,929
Which door?

747
00:54:46,012 --> 00:54:48,306
They fixed that door Tuesday.

748
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:51,226
No, it's all right.
I'll take a look at it.

749
00:54:51,309 --> 00:54:53,561
Just be... You're probably pressing
the wrong button.

750
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,814
Oh, God!

751
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:58,274
Tess, hair. Hair.

752
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:01,653
Oh, God!

753
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:04,905
I gotta go, man.
Okay.

754
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:06,573
Guys, I'm gonna go.

755
00:55:06,657 --> 00:55:08,867
Tess, you're a superstar, baby.
Bye!

756
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:10,828
Bye. Manuel, you were great.

757
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:12,871
Thank you.
Thanks, man.

758
00:55:12,955 --> 00:55:15,332
Okay, guys, we're ready for the pop shot.

759
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:17,417
Yeah. Come here, Tess.
Come here, Tess.

760
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:24,216
Good. All right, cut.

761
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,553
Hey, get them a towel, will you?

762
00:55:27,636 --> 00:55:29,263
Dude, I hate you.

763
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:32,516
Only for work?
Yeah.

764
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:35,269
- What's up?
- Hi.

765
00:55:35,352 --> 00:55:36,603
Hi.
I'm Asa.

766
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:38,480
Jane. I mean Tess.

767
00:55:38,564 --> 00:55:39,857
Jane.

768
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,358
You're new?
Yeah.

769
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:42,526
Nice to meet you.

770
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:44,111
She is really good though.

771
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:46,280
Yeah?
Really good.

772
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:48,282
That must mean
you're really good then.

773
00:55:48,365 --> 00:55:51,868
No, it means I'm sitting right next to him.
No, he's not that nice.

774
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:54,287
I'm not that nice.

775
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:57,373
I'm French,
and it's in my blood to be a dick.

776
00:55:57,456 --> 00:56:00,376
Okay! So I heard a funny joke today.
Want to hear it?

777
00:56:00,459 --> 00:56:02,879
Yeah, go ahead.

778
00:56:02,962 --> 00:56:04,297
What...

779
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:06,716
Wait.
She's always bad with jokes.

780
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,134
Hold on, hold on!

781
00:56:08,217 --> 00:56:11,429
What's worse
than getting fingered by...

782
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,391
No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
This is the worst ever.

783
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:17,476
Whatever. Whatever. it's ruined.
What will it be? Come on.

784
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,978
Make us laugh.
No, no, no.

785
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:21,564
Oh! I remember. I remember. It's...

786
00:56:21,647 --> 00:56:26,068
What's worse then getting banged
by Jack the Ripper?

787
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,407
Oh, God. Getting
fingered by Captain Hook.

788
00:56:36,536 --> 00:56:39,164
But that would probably
make you squirt 'cause it's like...

789
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,584
Oh, shit, guys, I have to go.
I have to get my makeup off.

790
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:45,003
Nice to meet you, Shadow.
We've got to work together.

791
00:56:45,086 --> 00:56:47,255
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
I'll probably see you around.

792
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,341
Good working with you.
You too.

793
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,553
I was just at the dentist...

794
00:56:53,637 --> 00:56:56,932
and my whole entire this side
of my mouth is numb right now.

795
00:56:57,015 --> 00:56:59,726
I can't feel it,
and I think I might drool.

796
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:01,269
Drool!

797
00:57:01,353 --> 00:57:03,480
I'm gonna pull the car
around to the front. Okay.

798
00:57:03,563 --> 00:57:05,106
I'll see you outside?
Okay.

799
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,191
Okay.

800
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:09,319
Let's go.
You're in a fire lane.

801
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:11,363
Yeah, yeah. I'm moving.

802
00:57:11,446 --> 00:57:13,406
No, you need to go. Come on.
just two seconds, sir.

803
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,492
Lady, look at all these cars here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

804
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:17,369
I'm just- I'm waiting for my...
She's old.

805
00:57:17,452 --> 00:57:19,954
I don't care if she's 90. You need
to get your car out of the way.

806
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:22,206
Please? Circle the block
so I don't lose my job.

807
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:23,499
Oh, fine.

808
00:57:42,434 --> 00:57:43,936
Oh, come on!

809
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,654
Move!

810
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:58,158
Learn how to drive, bitch!
Really?

811
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:11,087
Shit.

812
00:58:11,629 --> 00:58:13,131
I just shooed her off
a couple minutes ago.

813
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:15,842
She probably went that way.
Dude! Fuck. Shit.

814
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,593
Come on, let's go.
Thanks.

815
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,605
Are you kidding me?

816
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:35,278
What the fuck are you doing?

817
00:58:36,863 --> 00:58:38,531
Get in the car!

818
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:41,951
Sadie, get in the car.

819
00:58:54,046 --> 00:58:56,673
I can't believe
you thought I would leave you.

820
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:59,259
What-What were you trying to do?

821
00:58:59,342 --> 00:59:02,637
You were gonna walk home?
Are you insane?

822
00:59:05,057 --> 00:59:06,558
Jesus.

823
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:54,688
For the dog.

824
01:00:05,783 --> 01:00:08,452
Hey.

825
01:00:09,203 --> 01:00:10,955
- Hey.
- How'd the shoot go?

826
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:12,873
Really well, actually.
Good.

827
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:15,042
Did Arash ask about me?

828
01:00:15,126 --> 01:00:19,212
Uh, no, I didn't really have a chance
to talk to him.

829
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:22,298
- Jane?
- Yeah.

830
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:25,552
What? Never mind.

831
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,012
Okay.

832
01:00:33,685 --> 01:00:36,146
Hey, did you see lots of those in Paris?

833
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:38,106
I've never been there.

834
01:00:38,189 --> 01:00:39,816
What do you mean
you've never been there?

835
01:00:39,899 --> 01:00:41,776
I've never been to Paris.

836
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,238
But you... You said you love Paris.
I do.

837
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:49,325
There's a movie
with Astaire and Hepburn...

838
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:51,161
and they're dancing in the streets.

839
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:54,330
I don't remember the name.
That's my favorite.

840
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:57,083
Yeah.

841
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:03,380
You are one tough cookie to read.
I will tell you that, Sadie.

842
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:10,804
Well, is this baby the only man
in your life?

843
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,432
Mmm.

844
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:15,601
I don't know. it's complicated.

845
01:01:19,104 --> 01:01:24,943
Like, my work,
it doesn't really allow for it.

846
01:01:25,027 --> 01:01:29,573
Well, don't seem like a very
strenuous schedule that you have.

847
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:37,789
What about you?
What about me what?

848
01:01:37,873 --> 01:01:39,833
Oh, I don't work. I'm... No.

849
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:42,711
No, no, no,
What about dating?

850
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:47,340
Oh.

851
01:01:47,423 --> 01:01:51,844
My first, last date
with my Franky...

852
01:01:51,928 --> 01:01:56,307
was when we went
to the Los Angeles Zoo...

853
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,975
and he proposed.

854
01:01:59,143 --> 01:02:01,270
That's really cute.

855
01:02:02,521 --> 01:02:04,232
I want that.

856
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:07,360
Yeah.

857
01:02:10,655 --> 01:02:13,241
- Let's go.
- What? Why? We just got here.

858
01:02:13,324 --> 01:02:15,743
No! Let's go to the zoo.

859
01:02:15,826 --> 01:02:17,912
I wanna go to the zoo.

860
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:21,082
We could revisit where you and Frank
first got it on...

861
01:02:21,165 --> 01:02:24,335
And then, I don't know.

862
01:02:24,418 --> 01:02:27,672
I mean, a gorilla could propose
to me for all we know.

863
01:02:28,673 --> 01:02:32,300
Come on. it's a road trip.
It's just right over the hill.

864
01:02:54,948 --> 01:02:57,701
It closed in 1965.

865
01:02:59,202 --> 01:03:00,704
Sorry.

866
01:03:00,787 --> 01:03:02,622
We can go find the new one.

867
01:03:02,706 --> 01:03:04,916
But this is the one
we came to.

868
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:31,400
So when was the last time
you left the Valley?

869
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:34,737
I suppose it was a long time ago.

870
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,241
Yeah.

871
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:05,266
Sorry.
Maybe that wasn't such a hot idea.

872
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:08,770
Well... Hmm.

873
01:04:16,027 --> 01:04:17,195
Hmm.

874
01:04:18,446 --> 01:04:21,282
Hey, do you want to Star-sit
next weekend?

875
01:04:21,366 --> 01:04:23,368
Do... Do what?

876
01:04:24,452 --> 01:04:26,245
Dog-sit Starlet.

877
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:29,999
I mean, I have a job,
and I can't really bring him, so...

878
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,710
I don't know.

879
01:04:32,794 --> 01:04:33,795
Okay.

880
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,140
Bye.

881
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:07,619
Hey. Wanna tan?

882
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:10,956
No.
Wait, you got your car back.

883
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,834
Sure did. But I thought you
didn't have the money.

884
01:05:15,419 --> 01:05:18,463
Wait, so is this...

885
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:21,633
Are you doing this,
like, regularly?

886
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,719
Yeah. What's the big deal?

887
01:05:25,512 --> 01:05:27,347
You've never taken a private?

888
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:28,515
No.

889
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:34,019
Well, when you're ready,
I'll hook you up.

890
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:36,522
Don't go through Mikey.
He'll take 50%.

891
01:05:52,788 --> 01:05:55,958
Can I ask you why you're
holding on to all these newspapers?

892
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:57,960
There are articles
in there that I save.

893
01:05:58,043 --> 01:06:00,504
Would you mind explaining
what's happening in the fireplace?

894
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:05,509
That's my... Another place that I
keep things that... that I refer to.

895
01:06:05,593 --> 01:06:08,220
And then we have the tree outside. It's overgrown.
We have to trim that back.

896
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:11,140
Wait! I don't want anybody touching my tree.
That's my tree.

897
01:06:11,223 --> 01:06:13,392
We're not gonna cut it down.
We're just gonna trim it back.

898
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:15,810
These are the people
I was telling you about.

899
01:06:15,894 --> 01:06:19,105
Ms. Perkins, you have to clean this up,
or you're gonna face another lawsuit.

900
01:06:19,189 --> 01:06:21,232
I already had my yard sale...

901
01:06:21,316 --> 01:06:23,902
and I had the lawn mowed
and I had it all cleaned...

902
01:06:23,985 --> 01:06:25,820
You're gonna have to
have a bigger yard sale.

903
01:06:25,904 --> 01:06:27,822
Okay?

904
01:06:27,906 --> 01:06:31,326
Number one, you said you have no visitors.
I don't have any visitors.

905
01:06:31,409 --> 01:06:33,495
You have a visitor right here!

906
01:06:33,578 --> 01:06:36,164
You can lose your fucking attitude,
number one.

907
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:39,459
She is trying to help. I'm sorry, but it
seems like you're the one with the attitude.

908
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:42,337
- Okay, ladies. We should go.
- Yeah, I think it's time to go.

909
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:45,173
- Yeah, I think it is.
- Hmm. Sorry.

910
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:51,179
I hope she trips and falls.

911
01:06:51,262 --> 01:06:53,097
If he's being good,
you can give him snacks.

912
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:55,391
Okay.
And then...

913
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:57,769
He can play with that little toy?
Yeah.

914
01:06:57,852 --> 01:06:59,019
Okay.

915
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,604
I'm off. I have to go.

916
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:12,950
All right, here we go.

917
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:15,702
Are you nervous?

918
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:19,831
Not really. Should I be?
No. I am a little bit.

919
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:23,377
Fucking jules's booth
is three times larger than ours.

920
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,046
This is downtown L.A.,
not Vegas.

921
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:55,324
If you've done your job right,
your face is gonna be hurting by tonight.

922
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:57,159
What? Why?

923
01:07:58,077 --> 01:08:00,454
Smiling.

924
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:02,999
You a good boy?

925
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:08,421
I bet you miss your mommy,
don't you? Huh?

926
01:08:13,426 --> 01:08:14,969
Tess.
Hi.

927
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:16,429
How are you guys doing today?

928
01:08:16,512 --> 01:08:17,805
You're a fan?
Yeah.

929
01:08:17,888 --> 01:08:20,349
Do you do any girl-on-girl scenes?

930
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:22,685
You have a beautiful vagina.

931
01:08:22,768 --> 01:08:24,562
I'm so happy.
Fabulous.

932
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:26,856
She thanks you.

933
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,357
Here.
Thank you, baby.

934
01:08:29,441 --> 01:08:31,484
She has like that much left.
Okay.

935
01:08:32,652 --> 01:08:35,447
I mean, what I can do is, if...

936
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:37,699
I'll just make sure. Like, if
it does run, then I'll go...

937
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:39,868
Hi.

938
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:42,454
What's your name?
I'm Joey.

939
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:44,122
Pardon?
Joey.

940
01:08:44,205 --> 01:08:45,290
Joey?
Yeah.

941
01:08:45,373 --> 01:08:47,834
Nice to meet you. Tess.
Hi.

942
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:49,210
How's your day?

943
01:08:49,294 --> 01:08:51,338
Good.
Yeah?

944
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:53,381
They said I could
have a picture with you.

945
01:08:53,465 --> 01:08:57,010
I would love to have a
picture with you. Okay.

946
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:06,478
Starlet.

947
01:09:11,316 --> 01:09:12,317
Starlet?

948
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:14,860
Oh.

949
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:19,990
Starlet?

950
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:22,826
Oh, shit.

951
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:24,411
Take care.

952
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,376
Oh.

953
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:32,836
I'm so proud of you.
I'm exhausted.

954
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,547
You know what I was thinking?
Yeah.

955
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:39,009
We do a couple more
of these next-door-girl things...

956
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:41,053
and then we fix your tits.

957
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:42,638
Okay.

958
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:44,223
Yeah?
Yeah.

959
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:46,892
Kind of scared. I know this
great doctor in Beverly Hills.

960
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,268
Yeah?

961
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:55,192
Starlet!

962
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:57,819
Hello.

963
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,195
Have you seen...

964
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,030
I've lost my little dog.

965
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:02,615
Vanessa?
Qué?

966
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,869
What?
Did you see a little dog?

967
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,955
No, I haven't seen a dog.
A little Chihuahua?

968
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,083
No, I have not.
Oh, crap.

969
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,632
Starlet!

970
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,685
Starlet!

971
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,734
Jules, what's up man?
Good to see you.

972
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,611
How are you?
Good.

973
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,320
How are you, baby?

974
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,989
Baby, let's go.

975
01:10:44,489 --> 01:10:46,158
So anyways, yeah.

976
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:51,246
Actually, I just, like, came
by to talk to you about Melissa.

977
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:54,541
And I, you know... I understand why you did
it, but she's doing, like, a lot better.

978
01:10:54,624 --> 01:10:56,501
Where is Melissa? Is she here?

979
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,212
What the fuck is she doing here, man?

980
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,338
Can she at least sign...

981
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,215
a few pictures for the fans?
No, she can't.

982
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:03,258
Is she fucked up again?

983
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,843
All her fucking DVD's
are out here-

984
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,970
What is that fucking red hair?

985
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:09,264
I told her not to do it.

986
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:11,683
I told her, and I'm telling you.
She's frozen for a month.

987
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,311
You gotta get her out of here now.
Melissa.

988
01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,688
We got... We gotta go.
We gotta go.

989
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,356
Just fucking move away
from your table.

990
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,945
Look, I fucking totally understand
your problems with her.

991
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:26,405
I have all the same fucking problems
with her that you do...

992
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:29,867
and I don't want that
to affect our working relationship.

993
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,619
That'd be fucking
no good with me.

994
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:35,331
Zana?

995
01:11:35,414 --> 01:11:37,833
That's why I want to talk to you.
I have a good idea.

996
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:40,085
You know X-Men? We could
do fucking Triple-X-Men.

997
01:11:40,169 --> 01:11:43,297
I'd play Wolverine.
It would be so sick.

998
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,716
It would be so awesome. Think about it.
Is that a fact?

999
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,553
Yeah! I used to be a purple belt,
so like, the physicality...

1000
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:51,514
Renegade does no parodies.

1001
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:54,141
Ooh, get my butt.
My butt looks really good in this.

1002
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:55,893
Can I get a picture of your butt?
Yeah.

1003
01:11:55,976 --> 01:11:58,062
Let me just-

1004
01:11:58,145 --> 01:12:00,648
If you want to talk to me,
you come back, talk to me on first.

1005
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:02,900
Now you go get her
and get the fuck out of here.

1006
01:12:02,983 --> 01:12:06,487
Go. Now. Thanks, man. I
really fucking appreciate it.

1007
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,366
Melissa, we gotta
get the fuck out of here.

1008
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:13,368
Come on. Now.

1009
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:18,414
That girl is bad news.
I don't want to see you with her.

1010
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:21,292
I live with her.

1011
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,503
So don't live with her anymore.

1012
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,589
Think about what I told you,
all right?

1013
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:24,104
What happened?

1014
01:13:24,897 --> 01:13:26,773
Are you okay?

1015
01:13:26,857 --> 01:13:28,358
Absolutely not.

1016
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:31,904
Here, take Starlet.

1017
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:33,655
Wait. Well, what happened?

1018
01:13:33,739 --> 01:13:35,490
What did he... What did he do?

1019
01:13:35,574 --> 01:13:37,326
He didn't do anything.

1020
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:40,370
I-I don't need this friendship
or your help.

1021
01:13:40,453 --> 01:13:41,913
What do you mean?
I appreciate it.

1022
01:13:41,996 --> 01:13:45,583
I just can't handle this anymore.
What can't you handle?

1023
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,501
Just take him.

1024
01:13:47,585 --> 01:13:50,546
What happened? Nothing happened.
just take him.

1025
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:54,216
I can't handle it anymore.
I can't handle it anymore!

1026
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,968
Just go!
What happened?

1027
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:58,596
Good-bye. I can't handle it.
You want me to call the police?

1028
01:13:58,679 --> 01:13:59,972
No!
Go! Just go.

1029
01:14:00,056 --> 01:14:01,432
What are you...
Just go!

1030
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:03,476
Just go.
Sadie!

1031
01:14:03,559 --> 01:14:04,977
Good-bye.

1032
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:07,480
Sadie!
Good-bye.

1033
01:14:07,563 --> 01:14:09,649
Sadie, what happened?

1034
01:14:11,859 --> 01:14:15,404
Wh... Fuck! What is she, bipo...

1035
01:14:18,824 --> 01:14:20,534
What did you do?

1036
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:23,621
Fuck.

1037
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,460
What's up?

1038
01:14:30,543 --> 01:14:32,045
Not now, Melissa.

1039
01:14:34,172 --> 01:14:35,674
God.

1040
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:13,085
Fuck is going on?

1041
01:15:13,168 --> 01:15:15,212
Mikey has a surprise for us.

1042
01:15:17,673 --> 01:15:19,341
Mikey, come on.
Now you woke up Jane.

1043
01:15:19,425 --> 01:15:20,718
What's going on?

1044
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:23,262
Do not come down here.
It is a fucking surprise!

1045
01:15:23,345 --> 01:15:27,266
I... Listen! I repeat.
Do not come down until I'm ready.

1046
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:29,018
This shit is going to be
like Christmas.

1047
01:15:29,101 --> 01:15:31,020
I promise you it is worth the wait.

1048
01:15:31,103 --> 01:15:33,439
All right, okay. Almost ready.

1049
01:15:36,442 --> 01:15:38,944
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1050
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:41,530
Okay, no peeking.
Come here.

1051
01:15:41,613 --> 01:15:43,115
You too.

1052
01:15:43,949 --> 01:15:46,368
Sorry to wake you up,
but this is so killer.

1053
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:48,078
# You got a lovely face #

1054
01:15:48,162 --> 01:15:50,414
# We're goin' to your place #
You are gonna be so pumped.

1055
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:53,751
All right? Is everybody all right?
One stair at a time.

1056
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:55,168
Be careful.
# Scream 50 loud #

1057
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:57,378
Don't want anybody
to break their legs.

1058
01:15:57,462 --> 01:15:59,881
Well, be careful!
# You want me to stay

1059
01:15:59,964 --> 01:16:03,217
Okay, ready?
# But I got to make my way #

1060
01:16:03,301 --> 01:16:06,304
Okay. Okay, open your eyes.

1061
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:09,140
Huh? What do you think?

1062
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:11,559
# When I dream
I'm doing you all night #

1063
01:16:11,642 --> 01:16:13,519
# Scratches all down my back
to keep me right on #

1064
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:15,271
What are you doing on the couch?
Get up. Vámonos!

1065
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:17,732
Vámonos, muchachos.
You're spoilin' the groove.

1066
01:16:17,815 --> 01:16:19,817
This is what
you spent the money on?

1067
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:22,320
Hell, yeah, son!
This is what I spent our money on!

1068
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:24,655
Look. Real silk curtains.

1069
01:16:24,739 --> 01:16:26,741
This is a fuckin' real leather couch.
Both of these.

1070
01:16:26,824 --> 01:16:29,160
They spent all morning
putting up these fucking mirrors.

1071
01:16:29,243 --> 01:16:32,580
Look at this. Stainless steel pole.
Huh? This isn't going anywhere.

1072
01:16:32,663 --> 01:16:35,625
This stage is 400 pounds.
It's fabricated Italian marble.

1073
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:37,251
That is not even the best part.

1074
01:16:37,335 --> 01:16:39,003
The best part is right here. Boom!

1075
01:16:39,586 --> 01:16:40,837
Black lights.

1076
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:44,257
Looks like a legit strip club
in here, doesn't it? Huh?

1077
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:46,218
'Cause I'm gonna tell you,
what you're gonna start doing...

1078
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,261
is you're gonna start practicing
for those feature gigs.

1079
01:16:48,345 --> 01:16:49,763
Yeah. And you know what?

1080
01:16:49,846 --> 01:16:51,932
I already booked us one
for the end of the month in Seattle.

1081
01:16:52,015 --> 01:16:55,936
Pays a thousand dollars for the weekend.
Plus, we get to keep... Whoosh! All the tips.

1082
01:16:56,019 --> 01:16:58,063
I negotiated that shit.

1083
01:16:58,939 --> 01:17:00,440
Oh, and you know what?

1084
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:03,443
Listen, Jane,
if you ever want to use this...

1085
01:17:04,236 --> 01:17:06,822
feel more than free, okay?

1086
01:17:06,905 --> 01:17:09,199
Because what I'm thinking is...

1087
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:12,452
you two in, like,
some sort of dual-featured act.

1088
01:17:12,536 --> 01:17:14,287
Oh, my God, that would be sick!

1089
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:17,874
Hey, wanna go out tonight?
We haven't been out in forever.

1090
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:20,168
Yeah, could be fun.

1091
01:17:20,877 --> 01:17:22,546
Are you shitting me?

1092
01:17:22,629 --> 01:17:24,505
Can't even say thank you?

1093
01:17:24,588 --> 01:17:25,589
You know what?

1094
01:17:25,673 --> 01:17:28,467
Not so much to me but how about
to the hardworking folks from Mexico?

1095
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:31,804
You know how long they fuckin'
busted their ass putting this in for you?

1096
01:17:31,887 --> 01:17:33,389
No, you don't.

1097
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:36,267
'Cause you want to know why?
'Cause they're all fucking ungrateful.

1098
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,602
They're all ungrateful,
crazy, fucking whores.

1099
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:40,312
- Sí
- Sí

1100
01:17:40,396 --> 01:17:42,690
# But you fuck so good I'm on top of it #

1101
01:17:55,911 --> 01:17:57,496
Oh, fuck.

1102
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,665
Take it easy next time.

1103
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:03,502
Oh, Janey, you're my best friend.

1104
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:06,172
One minute. Here, here, here.

1105
01:18:06,255 --> 01:18:07,756
Here.

1106
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,466
You're such a good fr-friend.

1107
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,594
Blow your nose.

1108
01:18:12,677 --> 01:18:14,596
You're such a good friend, Jane.

1109
01:18:16,264 --> 01:18:19,893
You know I was thinking
about that question you asked me.

1110
01:18:19,976 --> 01:18:21,311
What question?

1111
01:18:21,394 --> 01:18:23,521
You know, the one about the money.

1112
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,358
I think, if I were you...

1113
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:30,695
I would spend it on someone
that I really cared about.

1114
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:33,990
On someone who really needed it.

1115
01:18:34,073 --> 01:18:36,492
You know,
the people that matter the most.

1116
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,872
Oh, come here.

1117
01:18:40,955 --> 01:18:42,624
Love you.

1118
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:44,542
I'm sorry.
No.

1119
01:18:45,376 --> 01:18:47,045
Let me get you to bed. Come on.

1120
01:18:59,556 --> 01:19:01,642
Fifty. Good.

1121
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:03,310
Sixty-eight. Good.

1122
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:08,148
Hello.

1123
01:19:08,232 --> 01:19:09,566
Listen.

1124
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:10,776
Listen!

1125
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:14,071
I have two tickets to Paris, first class.
They're non-refundable.

1126
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:17,783
And we're staying one week at the Hotel
Monte-whatever-the-fuck-it's-called.

1127
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:20,661
We leave Tuesday.

1128
01:19:20,744 --> 01:19:22,496
It's ridiculous.

1129
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:25,999
Wait, I'm sorry. I just said we had
two first-class tickets to Paris...

1130
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,502
and that's what you have to say?
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1131
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:30,545
I can't leave the country.
I'm too old.

1132
01:19:31,213 --> 01:19:33,423
And besides, I don't have a passport.
Twenty-three.

1133
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:34,925
Okay, excuse me.

1134
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:37,802
Number one, passport's not an issue.

1135
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:39,637
There's an expediting service.

1136
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,140
Number two, I spent eight grand on this.
You don't have a choice.

1137
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:46,143
Where'd you get the money? It doesn't
matter where I got the money.

1138
01:19:46,227 --> 01:19:47,478
I mean...
That's insane.

1139
01:19:47,561 --> 01:19:49,605
I'm not going to Paris with you.

1140
01:19:56,862 --> 01:19:58,614
You can't convince me.

1141
01:19:58,698 --> 01:20:00,741
Listen.

1142
01:20:00,825 --> 01:20:02,994
I will make you a wager.

1143
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:07,999
I will play the next game of Bingo,
and if I win, then you're coming.

1144
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,751
One.

1145
01:20:10,835 --> 01:20:12,628
Yes?
Bingo!

1146
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:15,172
Bingo called.
Look. Game over.

1147
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:17,591
I'll take that as a "Yes".

1148
01:20:17,675 --> 01:20:20,386
Are there any others?
Are there any others?

1149
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:23,805
Hi. I need the
maximum amount of packs.

1150
01:20:23,888 --> 01:20:24,848
I'm sorry?

1151
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:28,810
I need the maximum...
I need the maximum amount of packs.

1152
01:20:28,893 --> 01:20:31,563
Twenty-five packs will be $175.

1153
01:20:31,646 --> 01:20:34,566
You realize
the most you can win is $150?

1154
01:20:34,649 --> 01:20:37,652
Okay, 200.
Okay.

1155
01:20:37,736 --> 01:20:40,363
Uh, your change?
No, it's fine. Thank you.

1156
01:20:44,951 --> 01:20:48,747
You are totally insane. Crazy.

1157
01:20:54,085 --> 01:20:57,422
First number: N-36.

1158
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,346
O-75.

1159
01:21:06,014 --> 01:21:08,265
O-71.

1160
01:21:08,349 --> 01:21:09,391
Fuck.

1161
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,898
Sit down. You're embarrassing me.

1162
01:21:19,318 --> 01:21:22,529
O-72.

1163
01:21:22,613 --> 01:21:24,114
B-Z.

1164
01:21:24,198 --> 01:21:25,866
G-47.

1165
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:27,451
D-11.

1166
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:36,543
I've got-
N-37.

1167
01:21:36,627 --> 01:21:38,295
I've got Bingo.

1168
01:21:40,798 --> 01:21:42,549
I've got Bingo.

1169
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:44,593
No.

1170
01:21:44,676 --> 01:21:46,720
Me! Bingo! Bingo!

1171
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:50,307
- Me! Bingo!
- There's a Bingo out there.

1172
01:21:50,391 --> 01:21:52,892
Congratulations, Sadie.

1173
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:55,061
Thank you.
It's been a while.

1174
01:21:56,771 --> 01:21:59,232
I just did it.

1175
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,109
And you lost.

1176
01:22:01,192 --> 01:22:03,653
Look at all this stuff, and you lost.

1177
01:22:03,736 --> 01:22:05,238
But you never win!

1178
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,907
I did today.

1179
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:09,534
I won. O-69.

1180
01:22:11,244 --> 01:22:13,663
Does this mean
you're not coming to Paris?

1181
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:17,834
Oh.

1182
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:20,169
B-10.

1183
01:22:20,711 --> 01:22:23,756
Mmm.
Mmm?

1184
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,009
Mm-mmm.
Mmm.

1185
01:22:27,093 --> 01:22:29,011
I know that one.

1186
01:22:29,095 --> 01:22:31,639
B-2.

1187
01:22:36,309 --> 01:22:38,645
- Hey.
- Hey.

1188
01:22:38,728 --> 01:22:40,689
Oh, Mikey's using your room.

1189
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:47,362
Yeah, suck that shit. Yeah.

1190
01:22:47,446 --> 01:22:50,198
My turn.

1191
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:56,329
Mm-hmm, yeah. Gimme the tongue!

1192
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:02,794
Whoo.

1193
01:23:02,878 --> 01:23:04,671
Oh, the bathroom's over here.

1194
01:23:04,754 --> 01:23:06,548
Mikey. Mikey.
Hold on a second!

1195
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,176
I really need to rinse off!

1196
01:23:09,259 --> 01:23:12,220
Okay, there's a towel in there, but don't use
the good towels. Don't use the white towel.

1197
01:23:12,304 --> 01:23:14,431
Did you use the bed?
No, I didn't use the bed.

1198
01:23:14,514 --> 01:23:17,267
One towel?
Yeah, for both of you. Sorry.

1199
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:20,562
No, I didn't use the bed.
It was a fuckin' P.O.V. B.j.

1200
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:22,313
Why can't you just use that room?

1201
01:23:22,396 --> 01:23:24,148
I can't use that room.
I've shot that room out.

1202
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:25,900
I need the fucking yellow walls
in here.

1203
01:23:25,983 --> 01:23:28,277
You know what I'm gonna do in here,
is I'm gonna paint.

1204
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,655
I'm gonna paint black and white polka dots.
It's gonna be fuckin' awesome.

1205
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:33,282
When you guys get done,
meet me downstairs...

1206
01:23:33,365 --> 01:23:35,326
so fucking everybody
can get paid, all right?

1207
01:23:37,286 --> 01:23:39,914
Jesus.

1208
01:23:39,997 --> 01:23:42,625
What agency are you with?
I'm with 101.

1209
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,085
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay.

1210
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,506
What is this?

1211
01:23:48,589 --> 01:23:50,257
That's my luggage.

1212
01:23:51,675 --> 01:23:53,177
Can you get it?

1213
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,513
This thing is older than you are.

1214
01:23:55,596 --> 01:23:58,098
It works.
Okay.

1215
01:23:58,182 --> 01:24:00,893
This dress.
Okay.

1216
01:24:02,061 --> 01:24:03,938
And then that.

1217
01:24:04,021 --> 01:24:06,022
I see this for Paris.

1218
01:24:07,023 --> 01:24:08,024
Okay

1219
01:24:08,107 --> 01:24:10,235
This!
What?

1220
01:24:11,736 --> 01:24:13,696
And I should wear this one.

1221
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,281
Right?

1222
01:24:16,366 --> 01:24:18,701
Is it okay?
Yeah.

1223
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:22,288
No Frenchman can
resist some Leopard.

1224
01:24:22,372 --> 01:24:25,250
All right, if you say so.
I do.

1225
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:28,711
I hear the Frenchmen
can be quite the lovers.

1226
01:24:28,795 --> 01:24:30,380
Are they really?

1227
01:24:30,463 --> 01:24:31,965
They'll love you.

1228
01:24:40,974 --> 01:24:42,725
Hey, what are you doing?

1229
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:44,310
Packing.

1230
01:24:44,394 --> 01:24:46,980
I'm going...
I'm going away this week.

1231
01:24:47,063 --> 01:24:49,691
Yeah? Where are you going?

1232
01:24:49,774 --> 01:24:52,234
We're going to Paris, actually.

1233
01:24:52,317 --> 01:24:54,486
Paris? With who?

1234
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:57,239
Uh, that woman, Sadie.

1235
01:24:57,322 --> 01:25:00,158
On whose dime?

1236
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,161
Mine.

1237
01:25:18,594 --> 01:25:21,138
Bull-fucking-shit!

1238
01:25:21,847 --> 01:25:23,599
What?
Bullshit!

1239
01:25:24,516 --> 01:25:27,019
Get out of there!
Where is the fuckin' money?

1240
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:29,605
Why are you going through
my shit?

1241
01:25:29,688 --> 01:25:32,107
You fuckin' spent
all the fuckin' money?

1242
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:34,610
Why did you go through my shit?
Starlet showed it to me.

1243
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:37,403
Oh, you just blame my fucking dog? No,
the fucking dog doesn't matter, Jane.

1244
01:25:37,486 --> 01:25:39,280
I can't believe you just spent
all the fucking money.

1245
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:41,365
What did you expect? What do
you mean, what did I expect?

1246
01:25:41,449 --> 01:25:44,160
I didn't expect you to spend
the fucking money to go to Paris...

1247
01:25:44,243 --> 01:25:46,454
with some fuckin' old bitch.

1248
01:25:46,537 --> 01:25:50,291
I expected you to spend the money on us,
on me, on your fucking real friends!

1249
01:25:50,374 --> 01:25:51,626
Oh, really?
Yeah!

1250
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:53,628
Really?
Of course!

1251
01:25:53,711 --> 01:25:56,339
Like I've been doing for fucking
months, Melissa? Like that?

1252
01:25:56,422 --> 01:25:58,007
You let my car get taken away.

1253
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:00,134
You let me make a fool out
of myself at Renegade.

1254
01:26:00,217 --> 01:26:03,763
Not to mention Arash
is bad-mouthing me all over town.

1255
01:26:03,846 --> 01:26:06,807
And now you decide to go
on a fucking vacation...

1256
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:08,351
and you don't even bring me?

1257
01:26:08,434 --> 01:26:10,353
You go on a fucking vacation?
Some fucking friend you are!

1258
01:26:10,436 --> 01:26:13,814
Melissa! It is so much more complicated
than that, and you know it!

1259
01:26:13,898 --> 01:26:16,567
Why don't you wear a knee brace?

1260
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:19,861
Mmm, shut up, Greg. Why don't
you play with somethin' down the street?

1261
01:26:19,944 --> 01:26:22,405
You think I'm so fucking stupid!

1262
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:25,408
Yeah, you are fucking stupid!
You're the fucking stupid one!

1263
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:28,161
- Stay away from me.
- It's not even your fucking money!

1264
01:26:28,244 --> 01:26:30,830
It's the old bitch's money!

1265
01:26:30,914 --> 01:26:32,749
- Yeah, bitch!
- Fuck off.

1266
01:26:32,832 --> 01:26:35,585
Go back to fucking Jacksonville, whore!

1267
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:37,003
Get out!

1268
01:26:38,922 --> 01:26:41,174
Get the fuck out of my room!
Hey, hey.

1269
01:26:41,257 --> 01:26:42,676
Stop it. Stop, stop.

1270
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:45,261
- She is fucking done here, man.
- Go pop some more oxy.

1271
01:26:45,345 --> 01:26:48,473
Pack your bags, bitch.
You're fuckin' outta here!

1272
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:50,809
Shut... You know what? I don't
fucking like it here anyway.

1273
01:26:50,892 --> 01:26:54,229
Shut up! Shut up!
We're the best you ever had.

1274
01:26:54,312 --> 01:26:55,480
Okay, shut up.
Get out.

1275
01:26:55,563 --> 01:26:57,440
Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

1276
01:26:57,524 --> 01:26:59,359
Get her out of my room.
Listen to me.

1277
01:26:59,442 --> 01:27:01,069
We have neighbors.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1278
01:27:01,152 --> 01:27:02,529
Get her out of my...
Mikey?

1279
01:27:02,612 --> 01:27:05,030
Get out of here.
Get her out of my room.

1280
01:27:05,114 --> 01:27:06,782
Get out!
Get out of my...

1281
01:27:08,492 --> 01:27:09,827
Fuck!

1282
01:27:12,162 --> 01:27:13,664
Come here, okay?

1283
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,293
It's okay. it's okay, Starlet.

1284
01:27:18,377 --> 01:27:20,295
Twelve hundred bucks
is walking out the fucking door!

1285
01:27:20,379 --> 01:27:21,380
And you know what?

1286
01:27:21,463 --> 01:27:24,591
I'm not going to be able to put another bitch
up in there for at least a fucking month.

1287
01:27:24,675 --> 01:27:26,176
Are you gonna... Listen to me.

1288
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,054
Are you gonna fuckin' pay for it? You
gonna live with a liar and a cheat?

1289
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:31,932
I don't give a fuck what she is,
but she pays fucking rent.

1290
01:27:32,015 --> 01:27:35,436
Now how are we gonna... So what? Shh, baby,
baby... I can afford this place on my own.

1291
01:27:35,519 --> 01:27:37,604
I've been doing enough privates.
We'll be fine.

1292
01:27:37,688 --> 01:27:41,442
Jesus fucking Christ, Melissa!
Are you shitting me?

1293
01:27:41,525 --> 01:27:44,069
You've been booking privates
behind my back?

1294
01:27:44,153 --> 01:27:45,654
You're kidding me, right?

1295
01:27:47,156 --> 01:27:48,657
What did you expect?

1296
01:27:51,159 --> 01:27:52,827
It's everything I borrowed.

1297
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,747
Unlike some people,
I return money that isn't mine.

1298
01:29:05,065 --> 01:29:06,942
Father, tell him I wanna play.
Hold on a second.

1299
01:29:07,025 --> 01:29:09,069
You can't. You don't know how!

1300
01:29:09,152 --> 01:29:11,154
Mona, can you watch the kids
for two minutes, please?

1301
01:29:11,238 --> 01:29:13,156
Let me finish this phone call.

1302
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,909
Yes. I'll make a couple of calls.
I'll get you a house.

1303
01:29:15,992 --> 01:29:18,452
Don't worry about it.
This is for good.

1304
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:20,246
This way is much better for you.

1305
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,831
Gracie.

1306
01:29:23,666 --> 01:29:25,626
Yo, Gracie!
What?

1307
01:29:26,418 --> 01:29:29,255
Your girl's here.

1308
01:29:29,338 --> 01:29:31,590
Hi. I'm Tess.

1309
01:29:31,674 --> 01:29:34,426
You're late. Come on.
I'll show you to your room.

1310
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:36,762
There is no smoking in the house.
Go on the patio.

1311
01:29:37,429 --> 01:29:39,265
This is my room if you need anything.

1312
01:29:39,348 --> 01:29:41,016
This is Mark's room.

1313
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,102
Don't even knock on his door.

1314
01:29:43,185 --> 01:29:45,771
You good? 'Kay.

1315
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:47,815
I don't know if Arash
wants you doing any webcam or not...

1316
01:29:47,898 --> 01:29:50,734
but if he does,
put it on the schedule...

1317
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:52,695
so I don't have any conflicts.

1318
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:54,280
This is your room.

1319
01:29:55,281 --> 01:29:58,409
Don't let your dog pee in the house,
and label anything you put in the fridge.

1320
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:35,486
Thank you, Rommel.
Love you.

1321
01:30:36,487 --> 01:30:41,618
Oh, yes. Of course I'll do some
fully nude ass-shaking for you, Eros.

1322
01:30:42,994 --> 01:30:45,830
Buy those tokens, guys!

1323
01:31:01,345 --> 01:31:03,931
Oh, God.
I'm praying that you pull this off.

1324
01:31:04,014 --> 01:31:05,474
Oh, Jesus, help. Nope.

1325
01:31:05,557 --> 01:31:07,351
Fuckin' Jesus doesn't exist.

1326
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:12,648
Great job, Melissa. Great job.

1327
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:16,068
I'm glad I wasted
all this fucking money...

1328
01:31:17,653 --> 01:31:20,864
putting this in so you can
fucking learn how to do this!

1329
01:31:20,948 --> 01:31:22,449
Where are you going?

1330
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:25,869
Really?

1331
01:31:25,953 --> 01:31:27,704
Okay. Have fun.

1332
01:32:17,836 --> 01:32:19,337
Hello.

1333
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,093
Hey, remember me?
I'm Jane's friend.

1334
01:32:25,176 --> 01:32:27,053
Anyway,
I was just coming by to tell you...

1335
01:32:27,137 --> 01:32:29,723
that the only reason
why Jane's hanging out with you...

1336
01:32:29,806 --> 01:32:31,975
is 'cause she has
a bunch of your money.

1337
01:32:32,892 --> 01:32:35,687
I don't know how she got it,
but I know she has it.

1338
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,813
Mmm.

1339
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:41,443
Yeah, and...

1340
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,989
At first I thought
she was hanging out with you...

1341
01:32:46,072 --> 01:32:48,616
'cause she felt sorry for you.

1342
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,035
You know, pitied you.

1343
01:32:50,118 --> 01:32:53,580
Some old lady, probably
going to die soon.

1344
01:32:53,663 --> 01:32:55,457
Then I realized...

1345
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:59,794
she just felt guilty
for taking your money.

1346
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,756
She's not your friend.

1347
01:33:06,633 --> 01:33:08,969
Just thought
you should know the truth.

1348
01:33:12,514 --> 01:33:16,643
Okay.
Well, so I'll see you around.

1349
01:33:16,727 --> 01:33:18,228
Bye.

1350
01:35:02,664 --> 01:35:04,166
Sadie?

1351
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:06,710
Hi.

1352
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:11,339
Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.

1353
01:35:11,423 --> 01:35:13,133
You look nice.

1354
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,263
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

1355
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,731
It's not that bad.

1356
01:35:29,773 --> 01:35:31,442
Lets the sun in.

1357
01:35:35,821 --> 01:35:37,489
Oh, wait. Almost forgot.

1358
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:49,627
Hey, you're okay, right?

1359
01:35:50,669 --> 01:35:52,630
It's gonna be fun.

1360
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:58,469
Can we stop at the cemetery
on the way to the airport?

1361
01:35:59,803 --> 01:36:02,472
Uh,
I don't know if we have time.

1362
01:36:02,555 --> 01:36:05,266
It only takes a minute.
It's right on the way.

1363
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:09,145
Hey, you know,
we're cutting it kind of close.

1364
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:11,648
Are you sure you don't want to do this
when we get back?

1365
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:15,485
It's all right. We'll be okay.

1366
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:53,772
We're... We're here.

1367
01:36:53,855 --> 01:36:55,524
Could you do this?

1368
01:36:57,276 --> 01:36:58,944
You'll be faster than me.

1369
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:07,077
Yeah. Okay.

1370
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,662
Here. Hold Starlet.
