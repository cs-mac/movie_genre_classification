SALO, or THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM

00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:44,190
Masters

Female victims

Daughters

Militia

Collaborators

Servants

00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:16,152
Written and directed by

11
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:24,347
Northern ltaly, during the
Nazi-Fascist occupation

12
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:29,593
ANTE INFERNO

13
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,633
Your Excellency

14
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,473
President

15
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:13,753
Your Grace

16
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:34,229
AII things are good when
taken to excess

17
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,352
Come on, let's go

18
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:35,353
Where are you going?

19
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:20,472
Claudio! Your scarf, my son!

20
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:34,705
Sorry, we're obeying orders

21
00:07:57,795 --> 00:08:02,869
Marrying each others' daughters will
seal our destinies for ever

22
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:08,632
President, take as your IawfuI spouse
His ExceIIency's daughter, Tatiana

23
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:12,465
President, I wiII marry
your daughter, Susy

24
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:19,070
Your Excellency and my brother the
Bishop will marry my daughters

25
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:23,184
The preparations for our
undertaking are completed

26
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:34,230
In puberty's ambush, maidens bloom,
all unaware of impending doom

27
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:40,626
They listen to the radio, drink tea,
unaware they will lose their liberty

28
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:47,025
Bourgeois recoil not from slaughter
though victim be son and daughter

29
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,032
- What's this one's name?
- Claudio Cicchetti

30
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,026
- What is your name?
- Franco

31
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,988
I knew you'd consider him

32
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,193
A girI heIped us catch him

33
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,663
The fooI thought he was in for
romance, and ended up in a sack

34
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,386
- What is your name?
- Sergio

35
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,988
Shouldn't we inspect them?

36
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,869
Trousers down, shirts up

37
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,508
That will do

38
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:55,511
Lamberto Gobbi

39
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,715
Carlo Porro

40
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:03,831
Umberto Chessari... just Iook
at him, gentIemen

41
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:09,906
I waited two whoIe weeks
to ambush him

42
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:24,471
...and this is Ferruccio Tonna,
from Castelfranco

43
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,872
From a subversive famiIy

44
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,026
The one with the curly hair,
Tonino Orlando

45
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,706
I know him

46
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,585
I've waited two Iong years for him

47
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,628
Your Excellency, please help me

48
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:52,145
His father was a senior judge,
Iike myseIf

49
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:55,666
A southerner, aren't you?

50
00:12:56,035 --> 00:13:00,870
Don't expect me to deflower you.
In time we will decide..

51
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:04,626
...who will do you that
delightful honour

52
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:08,472
That's right, Tonino

53
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:07,224
Eva, come along

54
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:19,304
Try to behave yourseIf

55
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:31,666
Come, no one will harm you

56
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:36,790
Show these nice gentlemen
all your hidden charms

57
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,428
What a beauty

58
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:06,870
A delicious bum, solid yet bouncy

59
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:12,032
Tits to revive a dying crippIe

60
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:14,664
Bring us another one

61
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:19,990
Signora Castelli, your turn.
The gentlemen are waiting

62
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:04,144
Please let me go home

63
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,631
Albertina's father is a professor
in Bologna

64
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:14,069
To slip her out of the convent school
we had to convince two nuns

65
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,508
You'II prefer us to the sisters,
won't you?

66
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:20,150
I don't know yet, sir

67
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,063
Very well, undress her

68
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,386
Just a moment

69
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:44,114
We didn't notice her blemish.
She's a pretty virgin, too

70
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:03,669
Don't you disgrace me,
I know your IittIe tricks

71
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,514
We waited untiI she came out
with her mother...

72
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:18,392
...pushed the mother into the river,
where the damned fooI drowned...

73
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:22,228
...right before this angeI's eyes

74
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:33,267
There were nine boys, now only eight

75
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:39,346
Anyone know the difference between
"8", "no-no", and the family?

76
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,910
What's the difference?

77
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:46,712
"8" is twice four,
"no- no" is twice not for

78
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,548
- What about the family?
- They're fine, thank you

79
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,348
Everything is prepared
according to your wishes

80
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,631
You herded, feeble creatures,
destined for our pleasure

81
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:30,706
Don't expect to find here the freedom
granted in the outside worId

82
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:35,186
You are beyond reach of
any "IegaIity"

83
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,264
No one knows you are here

84
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:42,748
As far as the world goes,
you are already dead

85
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:47,025
These are the Iaws which wiII
govern your Iives

86
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:54,709
"At six p.m., the company will
assemble in the "Hall of Orgies"...

87
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,986
"... where our Storytellers...

88
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:03,665
"...will tell us stories, each with
a particular theme

89
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:09,944
"Our friends have the right
to interrupt at any moment

90
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:16,465
"The purpose of the stories is to
inflame lust; all will be permitted

91
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:23,191
"After dinner, the gentlemen will
conduct the so-called orgies

92
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:27,665
"The Great Hall will be
adequately heated

93
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,993
"Participants, appropriatedly
dressed...

94
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:35,673
"...will lie on the floor
like animals...

95
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:38,391
"...they will intermingle...

96
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:44,945
"...copulate indescriminately,
incestuously and sodomistically

97
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,106
"That will be the daily procedure"

98
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:51,069
No servants here!

99
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:08,633
"Any man caught in flagrante delicto
with a woman...

100
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,112
"...will be punished by
the loss of a limb

101
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:18,067
"The slightest religious act by
anyone will be punished...

102
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:20,790
"...by death"

103
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:37,104
CIRCLE OF MANIAS

104
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:45,625
I was born at a girIs' boarding
schooI, where my mother was a servant

105
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:49,745
One day, my sister asked if
I knew Professor GentiIe

106
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:53,585
"Well, look outside, he's waiting
for you...

107
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:57,425
"...to show you something
he's shown me"

108
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,868
She said: "Don't run away

109
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,068
"He'II give you some money"

110
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:09,270
I ran out to meet him.
I couIdn't beIieve it

111
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:15,345
- "Where are you going?"
- "To put away the chairs, Professor"

112
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:19,947
"Your sister will do that. I'll show
you something you've never seen"

113
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:23,985
I foIIowed him into a room

114
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:30,625
He took his huge penis from out of
his trousers and began to masturbate

115
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:33,589
"Have you ever seen the Iike?

116
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:37,425
"I've shown your sister and
girIs of your age

117
00:24:37,795 --> 00:24:43,188
"Give me a hand. Provoke the semen
from which we're all created

118
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:47,028
"I'II make it spurt on your face

119
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:50,865
"This is my sole passion, my child...

120
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,388
"...and you are about to see it"

121
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,952
At that very moment...

122
00:24:57,315 --> 00:25:01,547
...I was immersed in a white jet,
drenching me from head to toe

123
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:08,793
You mustn't omit any detaiI...

124
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:13,706
...otherwise your stories will not
arouse us sufficiently

125
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:31,510
I know I was urged to give
every detaiI...

126
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:37,268
...every particular,
even the slightest...

127
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:43,028
...that may illuminate the
human passion

128
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:46,070
I've not overIooked anything

129
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:52,306
You haven't given us details about
the size of the Professor's penis...

130
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:56,145
...or the nature, the consistency
of his emisssion

131
00:25:56,515 --> 00:26:01,908
Did you fondle his genitals,
did he oblige you to do so?

132
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,746
Dear Signora Vaccari, more clarity

133
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:11,190
From now on I shaII conceaI nothing.
May I continue?

134
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:17,593
Time the staff of my old age
had some fun

135
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:24,830
Shortly after my seventh birthday...

136
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:28,148
...I took a girI friend to see
the Professor

137
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:32,952
One of his colleagues was with him.
They drew me inside

138
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:36,466
Looking at me, one said to the other:

139
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:40,953
"Goffredo, didn't I teII you
she was a IittIe beauty?"

140
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:46,070
"She is a rare IittIe jeweI",
repIied Goffredo

141
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:53,430
Then he took me onto his Iap
and gave me a kiss

142
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:56,946
- "How old are you?"
- "Seven, Professor"

143
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,785
"You are fifty years younger than me"

144
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,626
Then he gave me another kiss

145
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:09,113
Meanwhile, the other prepared
some kind of strange syrup

146
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:15,188
They made me drink it, saying:
"It wiII make you pee"

147
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:20,310
"AII we want of you, dear chiId,
is that you urinate

148
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:24,429
"And that you do that with me,
alone together"

149
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,753
I want this miserabIe boy
punished severeIy

150
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,625
We are at your service

151
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:41,433
He had the insolence to
pull away from me

152
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:45,591
You can choose one of ours

153
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:48,668
No, thank you

154
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:58,508
It wouId take too much to
satisfy me now

155
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:04,149
A moment ago, only the slightest
effort would suffice, but now...

156
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:11,189
You know to what we're driven
by frustrated desire

157
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:14,627
AII I ask of you...

158
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:19,148
...is exemplary punishment
for this bastard

159
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:25,593
My Lord, I feeI ready to satisfy you

160
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:29,108
I need no instruction

161
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,990
No, Iet me be

162
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:39,345
There are a thousand occasions when
one does not desire a woman's anus

163
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:43,993
I'II wait. Let Signora Vaccari
continue her story

164
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:51,186
Everything was so arranged that he
swallowed every drop of my piss

165
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:55,025
At that moment his penis,
overcome by victory...

166
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:58,865
...cried tears of blood over me

167
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:04,309
Then, passion consumed, the Professor
seemed to realize...

168
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:10,705
...his idoI no Ionger inspired
such reIigious fervour

169
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:18,911
Without ado, he put ten Iire in my
apron pocket and pushed me out

170
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:31,911
The boy's hopeless at masturbation,
he needs a lesson

171
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:36,305
You'd think he'd never seen
a man's tooI

172
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,630
Well, friends...

173
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:57,752
...Signora Vaccari will turn them
into first-class whores

174
00:29:58,115 --> 00:30:00,310
Nothing is more contagious than eviI

175
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,552
You are mistaken, Your Excellency

176
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:07,591
Some can do eviI onIy when
passion drives them to it

177
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:14,065
They are always unhappy, regretting
the evils of the previous night

178
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:13,903
Umberto, Franco... what do you say?

179
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:33,230
Handsome

180
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:45,263
Efisio, it's my turn

181
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:28,153
On the Perati bridge

182
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:33,592
A black flag flies

183
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:40,305
The mourning of the Julian regiment
that goes to war

184
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:10,385
The best young men lie
under the earth

185
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:52,145
The gentleman are not satisfied
with you

186
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:56,145
The first thing you must Iearn
is how to hoId it

187
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:31,673
Go on

188
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:39,349
Up and down

189
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:43,187
Squeeze it harder...

190
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:46,070
...and stroke beneath with
the other hand

191
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,872
Slut! See how it's done

192
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:13,346
There were nine girls, now only eight

193
00:35:13,955 --> 00:35:17,425
Here's a number eight story

194
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:21,504
It's about a man who had a friend
named Six-times-eight

195
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:27,029
Going home in the blackout one night
they lost each other

196
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:30,871
Our man tried to find his friend,
Iooking everywhere

197
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:35,672
At Iast he thought he saw something
in the darkness

198
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:41,669
He was overjoyed, thinking he had
found his friend

199
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:47,189
- He cried: "Six-times-eight!"
- "Forty-eight", came the repIy

200
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:55,184
Music! Signora Vaccari will tell us
another story...

201
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:59,025
...to stimulate us for
another skirmish

202
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:08,952
I was nine when my sister took me to
MiIan to meet Signora CaIzetti

203
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:13,433
She examined me and asked if I
wanted to work for her

204
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:17,583
I said I wouId, if the pay was good

205
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:23,985
My first client, a stout man named
Vaccari, looked me over carefully

206
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:31,025
At once I showed him my pussy,
which I thought was very speciaI

207
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:37,430
He covered his eyes:
"Out of the question

208
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:42,869
"I'm not interested in your vagina,
cover it up"

209
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:47,985
He covered me up, making me Iie down

210
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:53,752
He said: "AII these IittIe whores
know is to fIaunt their vaginas

211
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:58,154
"Now I'II have to recover from
that disgusting sight"

212
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:02,274
He wrapped me in a sheet,
Iike a mummy...

213
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:05,872
...Ieaving onIy my behind uncovered

214
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:11,993
He caressed it gently, opened
and closed the cheeks...

215
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,188
...began to suck it greedlily

216
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:20,033
Then he carefully...

217
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:26,386
...put his member between my buttocks,
his movements became frenzied

218
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:36,305
"Such an adorable behind, the sweet
little anus. Now I'll anoint it"

219
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:39,509
He said that three or four times

220
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:43,032
I never saw him again

221
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,874
Your first client...

222
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:49,433
...had an idea of women that
most of us do not share

223
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:52,867
Homage to the rear temple...

224
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:56,307
...is more fervent than the other

225
00:37:56,835 --> 00:38:00,953
I put this question to the company

226
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:06,708
How can we determine the true
inclination of a boy or girl?

227
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:09,031
Their best part, in other words

228
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:14,393
I beIieve by masturbation of the
requisite body areas

229
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:17,906
Let's take the youngsters about whom
we have doubts...

230
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:21,904
...and take them aside to verify

231
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:34,226
Observing, with equaI passion
and apathy, Guido and Vaccari...

232
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,435
...masturbating the two bodies
which belong to us...

233
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,265
...inspires a number of interesting
reflections

234
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,786
Would you care to elaborate,
dear Duke?

235
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:47,545
We Fascists are the only true
anarchists

236
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,388
Naturally...

237
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:54,073
...once we've become masters of the
state, true anarchy is that of power

238
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:57,632
However, Iook at their
obscene gestures...

239
00:38:58,275 --> 00:38:59,947
...Iike deaf-mute Ianguage...

240
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:06,545
...with a code none of us can break,
no matter how great our power

241
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:09,750
There is nothing to be done

242
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:14,384
We must restrict our impulses
to a single gesture

243
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,347
He came. Now he is a man

244
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,624
Little Sergio, we're proud of you

245
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:30,145
- She's a woman now
- Our first couple has been formed

246
00:39:30,595 --> 00:39:32,790
Sergio, you've proved you're a man

247
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:35,754
She is your prize

248
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,668
Come forward

249
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:12,834
Appreciate the goodwill of
these gentlemen...

250
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:17,468
...who allow you to enjoy such
a great privilege...

251
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:20,145
...we will solemnize your marriage

252
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,509
What a fine thing

253
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:14,868
What a whore

254
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:37,588
Get out, you sluts!

255
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:55,345
Let us resume the ceremony

256
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,433
Will you, Sergio...

257
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,583
...take Renata for your wife?

258
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:09,591
I pronounce you man and wife

259
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:29,705
Clear off, all of you!

260
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:51,506
lf you salute him,
then you are bound

261
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:57,905
lf you are for him,
if you are sound

262
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:02,746
Then you must join up,
honour bound

263
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:14,545
Lustily! Aren't you newlyweds?

264
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:18,708
Give rein to your feelings

265
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:41,424
Get busy, idiot

266
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:31,033
No! That flower is reserved for us

267
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:33,027
The principle of all greatness
on earth...

268
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:38,230
...has Iong been bathed in bIood

269
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:43,990
My friends, if memory does not
betray me:

270
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:50,072
"Without bloodshed, there is
no forgiveness

271
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:53,711
"No forgiveness without bloodshed".
Baudelaire

272
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:57,745
Excellency, the expression is not
to be found in Baudelaire...

273
00:45:58,115 --> 00:46:01,710
...but in Nietzsche's
The Genealogy of Morals

274
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:06,703
It is neither from Baudelaire
nor Nietzsche...

275
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:12,149
...nor in Saint Paul’s
Epistle to the Romans

276
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:13,664
It's Dada

277
00:46:14,435 --> 00:46:20,146
Sing me that sweet melody
l loved so much, that goes da-da

278
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:27,505
Delicious creature, do you want
my dirty underpants?

279
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:31,345
My old underpants. What incomparable
refinement

280
00:46:31,715 --> 00:46:35,503
You see how sensitive I am
to the value of things

281
00:46:36,515 --> 00:46:42,545
Little angel, my greatest desire is
to grant your wish

282
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:46,386
You know I respect aII tastes
and whims

283
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:50,232
However baroque, all deserve
to be respected

284
00:46:53,155 --> 00:46:58,548
Because we're not their masters,
even the most bizarre manias...

285
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:04,308
...derive from a basic principle
of refinement

286
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:09,430
Yes, old buggers, it's a question
of delicacy

287
00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:29,910
One day Madam sent me to
another Iibertine

288
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:38,869
He took me to a room with
a splendid Chinese carpet

289
00:47:39,555 --> 00:47:44,310
After making me undress, he ordered
me on all fours, like an animal

290
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:56,152
Having stroked my head two or
three times...

291
00:47:58,115 --> 00:48:01,346
...he said: "I want to see if you're
as quick as my dogs"

292
00:48:01,955 --> 00:48:04,708
He threw two chestnuts across
the room...

293
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:08,591
...saying: "Good bitch, fetch!"

294
00:48:16,035 --> 00:48:21,314
I thought it best to go aIong
with the game

295
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:36,793
You have two beautifuI eyes...
then Iook

296
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,233
Piss

297
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:13,583
"Filthy muck, putrid bitch",
he shouted, approaching me

298
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:19,349
Then he ejaculated over my back

299
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:24,150
Then he Ieft

300
00:49:24,515 --> 00:49:27,029
I dressed...

301
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,503
...and discovered 25,000 Iire
in my coat

302
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:55,189
Eat!

303
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:19,706
Your Excellency, are you convinced?

304
00:51:20,355 --> 00:51:24,473
It is when I see others degraded
that I rejoice...

305
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:30,068
...knowing it is better to be me
than the scum of "the people"

306
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:36,306
Whenever men are equal, without that
difference, happiness cannot exist

307
00:51:36,675 --> 00:51:40,463
So you wouldn't aid the humble,
the unhappy

308
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:42,951
In aII the worId...

309
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:47,183
...no voluptuousness flatters the
senses more than social privilege

310
00:53:21,315 --> 00:53:25,752
My next story is about the mania
of Minister MissiroIi

311
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:29,903
I went to the Minister's office
at ten one morning

312
00:53:30,595 --> 00:53:32,984
The moment I entered,
the doors cIosed

313
00:53:34,115 --> 00:53:37,266
"What are you doing here,
you IittIe bitch?

314
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:41,423
"Who gave you permission
to disturb me?"

315
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:46,988
I hadn't been warned of what
wouId happen...

316
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:50,069
...so I was frightened by the weIcome

317
00:53:54,915 --> 00:53:56,394
I can't take any more

318
00:54:03,555 --> 00:54:08,310
He tore off my clothes,
shredded them...

319
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:13,430
...and threw them into the fire

320
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:36,146
Then he stretched out
seemingly semi-conscious...

321
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:40,309
...in a chair...

322
00:54:40,995 --> 00:54:42,553
...and ejaculated...

323
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:47,673
...making his sperm fall upon the
charred remains of my clothes

324
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,111
CIRCLE OF SHIT

325
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:32,305
Don't you think, Signora Maggi...

326
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:38,705
...that before your stories, you
should show us your best part?

327
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:42,545
With the greatest of pleasure

328
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:50,829
These buttocks merit our attention

329
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,992
I have seIdom seen better

330
00:56:55,715 --> 00:56:58,104
Very kind of you to say so

331
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:03,992
We thank you. Please begin

332
00:57:05,675 --> 00:57:10,385
I see that you gentIemen esteem
the rear end...

333
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:16,150
...so I shaII devote my stories
to this subject

334
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:18,870
My story will interest you all...

335
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:24,594
...especially our dear President;
it concerns a particular mania...

336
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:30,354
...his dearest caprice, which
enabled me to make his acquaintance

337
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:35,272
ConceaI my turpitudes from
these innocents

338
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,749
Enough. I am eager to hear
Signora Maggi's voice

339
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:52,305
My childhood years were spent in
endowing my body with the capacity...

340
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:58,186
...to satisfy the basest,
most outrageous desires

341
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,588
I soon became expert in that
difficuIt task...

342
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:04,788
...and my fame spread throughout
ItaIy

343
00:58:05,155 --> 00:58:07,589
My clients included many
celebrities...

344
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:11,823
...and to them I gave the best
of myseIf

345
00:58:14,435 --> 00:58:19,190
My first story concerns a most
curious episode in my Iife

346
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:23,665
Signora Evola, the Madam
I worked for...

347
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:29,746
...sent me to a client after feeding
me a large laxative-spiced meal

348
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:33,909
The client was an old
Carabinieri General

349
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:37,426
He made me undress him and
put a nappy on him

350
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:42,550
I was used to such fixations,
I was ready to heIp him

351
00:58:42,915 --> 00:58:47,909
Suddenly, my bowels rebelled and he
ordered me to relieve myself...

352
00:58:48,355 --> 00:58:53,031
...which I did without embarrassment

353
00:58:53,475 --> 00:58:58,549
He made me dip my fingers in
the excrement...

354
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:03,670
...and feed it to him Iike a baby

355
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:10,069
He swallowed everything, imitating
the cries of a baby...

356
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,950
...and ejaculated into his nappy

357
00:59:15,075 --> 00:59:18,385
I knew a man capabIe of quite diverse
refinements of the sort

358
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,225
We expect only the best tales of you

359
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:29,263
My next story took place in Verona

360
00:59:29,955 --> 00:59:35,348
I was toId that the cIient
waiting at a hoteI...

361
00:59:35,715 --> 00:59:40,152
...was an old nobleman,
notorious for his depravity

362
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:43,986
My curiosity was immense

363
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:48,792
That evening my mother was more
intolerant than usual

364
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:53,192
She pleaded with me not to go

365
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:57,423
I couIdn't resist the temptation,
so I kiIIed her

366
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:00,948
The only thing to do

367
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:07,548
The excitement awaiting you was
supreme...

368
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:11,710
...meriting the utmost sacrifice

369
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:15,505
It's foIIy to say one owes
anything to one's mother

370
01:00:15,955 --> 01:00:20,710
Must we be gratefuI for her having
pIeasure with a man?

371
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,908
That should have been enough
reward for her

372
01:00:24,595 --> 01:00:28,383
Long ago, I was cursed with
a mother...

373
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:32,543
...who aroused the same feelings
you felt for yours

374
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:37,025
As soon as I couId, I sent her
to the next worId

375
01:00:37,395 --> 01:00:43,425
It was a profound pIeasure when she
cIosed her eyes for the Iast time

376
01:00:48,595 --> 01:00:51,155
Why is that child crying?

377
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:57,189
Your words remind her of her mother

378
01:00:57,555 --> 01:01:01,343
Her mother died trying to protect her

379
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,263
Splendid!

380
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:06,869
It's your mother you're crying for?

381
01:01:07,475 --> 01:01:09,909
Come here, Iet me consoIe you

382
01:01:13,555 --> 01:01:16,706
Come back to Papa's arms

383
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,673
He'll sing you another lullaby

384
01:01:21,235 --> 01:01:24,386
What an opportunity you offer me

385
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:28,306
Signora Maggi's story merits
immediate re-enactment

386
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:37,506
I beg you to have mercy on
my suffering

387
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:45,185
My mother died for me and
I'II never see her again

388
01:01:47,155 --> 01:01:48,793
Undress her immediateIy

389
01:01:53,555 --> 01:01:59,027
Kill me! God will take pity on me!
Don't dishonour me!

390
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:04,584
This howling is the most exciting
thing I've ever heard

391
01:02:05,395 --> 01:02:11,425
Kill me! Free me from this torment,
seeing and hearing such horrors!

392
01:02:13,235 --> 01:02:15,271
You all heard her call on God

393
01:02:15,635 --> 01:02:18,832
Your Excellency, enter her name
in the Penal Register...

394
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:21,670
...for a terrible punishment

395
01:02:22,355 --> 01:02:26,189
Do away with me, so that
I can be with my mother

396
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:32,865
You will be punished and deflowered
when we decide the time is ripe

397
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:41,390
Don't think your tears restrain my
desire; they make me more ruthless

398
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:22,463
Come here, my child, it's ready

399
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:24,154
On your knees!

400
01:03:44,595 --> 01:03:46,153
Go on!

401
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,673
Eat it

402
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:13,829
That stupid girI's making a scene
over such a deIicacy

403
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:18,950
A friend insisted that all the
excrement he ate every day...

404
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,228
...come from a beggar woman, so it
would be more putrid and delicious

405
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:27,994
I found an oId woman of seventy
for him

406
01:05:50,675 --> 01:05:54,463
Spoiled food can provoke
excellent diarrhoea

407
01:05:54,835 --> 01:06:00,865
The subject should eat hastily, at
odd hours, to overload the stomach

408
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:04,470
We must try that at once

409
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:12,790
Dear President

410
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:18,788
I am eager to know how you
first met Signora Maggi

411
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:24,868
She will tell you after His Honour
has married his Sergio

412
01:06:25,555 --> 01:06:27,511
Then you'II Iaugh at my expense

413
01:06:28,115 --> 01:06:30,185
I won't deprive you of that pIeasure

414
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:36,386
Today's story demands a revision
of our rules

415
01:06:36,755 --> 01:06:40,225
If we wish to enjoy the fruit...

416
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:43,109
...of our stay within these walls...

417
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:48,549
...Iet us revise some of our ruIes

418
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:53,349
For example, we put containers in the
latrines to collect all excrement...

419
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:57,105
...so that nothing goes to waste

420
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:02,310
Let's follow Signora Maggi's example,
giving our dear President...

421
01:07:02,675 --> 01:07:06,953
...the joy of seeing his dream
come true

422
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:20,872
Good day, Signora Castelli

423
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:24,193
I'm sorry, we'II be ready in a moment

424
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:26,825
I've come to make sure

425
01:07:27,315 --> 01:07:29,670
The chamber pots, quick!

426
01:08:12,275 --> 01:08:14,106
You know the rules!

427
01:08:16,395 --> 01:08:17,908
Tell me your name!

428
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:22,224
I couIdn't heIp it, with the muck
we're given to eat

429
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:23,825
Your name?

430
01:08:24,275 --> 01:08:27,870
It's Doris, the most undisciplined
of our girIs

431
01:08:31,955 --> 01:08:37,985
She will be company for those
already listed here

432
01:09:00,115 --> 01:09:02,788
- Whose is this?
- Mine. Help yourself

433
01:09:03,315 --> 01:09:06,864
Is that how you obey our ruIes,
impertinent brat?

434
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,193
Show me this boy's arse

435
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:31,746
You even dared to wipe yourself.
You'll get what you deserve

436
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,471
We're ready...

437
01:09:49,715 --> 01:09:55,506
...but preparing this one meant that
I couIdn't watch these rogues

438
01:09:59,315 --> 01:10:01,385
There is no evasion

439
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,786
Unless the German people fall...

440
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:08,064
...we are prepared for any
eventuality ...

441
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:12,713
...to save a human soul,
even in this part of Africa

442
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:27,026
We are happy to carry out
your every command

443
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:35,754
Those I considered the most
capabIe...

444
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:38,948
...were fed appropriately

445
01:10:40,275 --> 01:10:45,349
Thus as this solemn wedding feast we
shall enjoy the greatest delicacy

446
01:10:46,035 --> 01:10:50,472
Our girls abstained from relieving
themselves all day...

447
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:53,986
...in compliance with your decree...

448
01:10:54,995 --> 01:10:57,828
...that we produce this for you

449
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:00,392
Let the rite begin

450
01:11:01,075 --> 01:11:05,830
Our guide restored the divine
character of monstrosity...

451
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:10,950
...thanks to reiterated actions,
that is to say: rites

452
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:16,067
No more intoxicating desire exists...

453
01:11:16,435 --> 01:11:18,869
...endowing you with the vigour...

454
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:22,148
...to meet the challenge awaiting you

455
01:11:24,115 --> 01:11:27,585
Eat, my exquisite bride

456
01:11:28,275 --> 01:11:33,986
You must prepare for our night
of Iove

457
01:11:35,955 --> 01:11:39,948
Nothing's worse than a breath
without odour

458
01:11:51,955 --> 01:11:53,911
I can't do it

459
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:56,471
Offer it to the Madonna

460
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:16,873
Do this

461
01:12:19,475 --> 01:12:23,593
Say: "I can't eat rice with
my fingers Iike this"

462
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,791
Then eat shit

463
01:12:50,475 --> 01:12:54,946
I refer, as you wiII have guessed...

464
01:12:55,315 --> 01:12:59,433
...to our illustrious President

465
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:02,628
After having satisfied him...

466
01:13:02,995 --> 01:13:07,432
...I was impressed by such speciaI
tastes in one so young

467
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:14,189
Tastes that will become clearer later

468
01:13:17,155 --> 01:13:19,589
Liberated from my mother...

469
01:13:19,955 --> 01:13:24,471
...I found Iife rich in aII
its deIights

470
01:13:29,235 --> 01:13:34,946
One day Madam presented me to
the Iibertine in question

471
01:13:35,315 --> 01:13:39,433
His passion will strike you
as somewhat unusual

472
01:13:41,075 --> 01:13:47,105
The scene took place in his house.
I was shown into a darkened room

473
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:52,225
I saw a man Iying on the bed...

474
01:13:53,235 --> 01:13:56,386
...and a coffin in the middle
of the room

475
01:13:57,715 --> 01:14:00,866
"You see before you...", he said...

476
01:14:01,555 --> 01:14:04,388
"...a man on his deathbed...

477
01:14:05,075 --> 01:14:08,226
"...but he doesn't want to close
his eyes...

478
01:14:08,595 --> 01:14:13,988
"...without making a Iast homage to
the object of his adoration

479
01:14:14,355 --> 01:14:17,506
"I adore the behind

480
01:14:18,195 --> 01:14:22,632
"Although I am dying, I wish to die
kissing one

481
01:14:24,275 --> 01:14:27,745
"When Iife has Ieft my body...

482
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:31,585
"...place me in the coffin...

483
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:36,063
"...wrap me in my shroud and
close the coffin lid

484
01:14:38,035 --> 01:14:42,153
"I insist that you observe my orders
to the Ietter

485
01:14:42,515 --> 01:14:48,545
"In this supreme moment with the
soIe object of my Iewd desire

486
01:14:49,555 --> 01:14:52,069
"Come quickly!"

487
01:14:52,435 --> 01:14:55,586
He went on, his voice broken, sobbing

488
01:14:55,955 --> 01:15:00,710
"Hurry! I am at death's door"

489
01:15:01,075 --> 01:15:05,830
So I went to him and showed him
my backside

490
01:15:06,195 --> 01:15:09,665
"Oh, what a marvellous arse

491
01:15:12,915 --> 01:15:18,626
"Having seen this, my Iife can end.
I've never seen one as aIIuring"

492
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:24,070
He fondled it, opened it

493
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:29,829
He played with it, kissed it, just as
would the healthiest of men

494
01:15:30,515 --> 01:15:36,545
He made me relieve myself of all
that was in my bowels

495
01:15:37,235 --> 01:15:40,068
I was not at aII embarrassed

496
01:15:40,755 --> 01:15:46,148
"Now it is the time for me to die.
The supreme moment has come"

497
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:53,186
As he said that, he gave
a profound sigh

498
01:16:06,675 --> 01:16:09,826
Piss over me

499
01:16:17,555 --> 01:16:20,069
I can't, it won't come

500
01:16:43,475 --> 01:16:45,511
I've finished

501
01:16:53,715 --> 01:16:57,503
The Iimitation of Iove is that
you need an accompIice

502
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:01,983
Your friend will know the
libertine's refinement...

503
01:17:02,355 --> 01:17:06,143
...is being executioner and victim

504
01:17:09,195 --> 01:17:12,551
My sister knew an officiaI
in the ControIIer's office

505
01:17:12,915 --> 01:17:16,703
A IittIe pig-Iike man,
with a disgusting face

506
01:17:17,715 --> 01:17:20,229
A chamber pot was arranged...

507
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:24,713
...for two to sit on, back to back,
and relieve themselves simultaneously

508
01:17:26,035 --> 01:17:29,186
He stirred it with his fingers,
and swallowed it

509
01:17:29,555 --> 01:17:32,945
My sister told me...

510
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:37,547
...he'd only to see her dirty arse
and he ejaculated

511
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:41,346
Did your sister have a
pretty backside?

512
01:17:41,835 --> 01:17:45,510
You must judge by this.
A famous painter...

513
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:49,993
...was commissioned to paint a Venus
with a splendid backside

514
01:17:50,675 --> 01:17:53,826
He selected her as his model
after many weeks...

515
01:17:54,195 --> 01:17:58,632
...Iooking at hundreds of behinds
throughout ItaIy

516
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:02,470
How old was she then?

517
01:18:03,155 --> 01:18:05,032
Fifteen, Duke

518
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:11,553
Why don't you arrange a competition
to find the nicest bottom here?

519
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:16,223
I'II do that. I'm an expert

520
01:18:24,275 --> 01:18:28,632
Your Excellency, doesn't this
situation suggest anything to you?

521
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:30,224
It might

522
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:36,388
- Aren't you ready?
- Just a moment

523
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:42,786
The act of the sodomite signifies
the death of the human species

524
01:18:43,155 --> 01:18:45,828
Ambiguously accepting social
standards while transgressing them

525
01:18:47,315 --> 01:18:51,103
More monstrous than the act
of the sodomite...

526
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:54,229
...is the act of the executioner

527
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:58,350
True, but the act of the sodomite
can be repeated again and again

528
01:18:59,475 --> 01:19:03,673
I think there is a way to repeat
the act of the executioner

529
01:19:16,995 --> 01:19:18,872
Turn off the Iights

530
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:26,986
Here is my masterpiece

531
01:19:33,195 --> 01:19:36,073
I have a proposaI to make

532
01:19:38,835 --> 01:19:43,226
We have not yet decided on
the winner's prize...

533
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:46,628
...for the best bottom

534
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:49,635
Here is my proposaI

535
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:55,348
He or she whose bottom is
judged the best...

536
01:19:55,715 --> 01:19:57,831
...will be killed immediately

537
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:01,753
Agreed

538
01:20:09,475 --> 01:20:14,230
This way we'II be impartiaI, not
knowing whose bottom we are viewing

539
01:20:14,595 --> 01:20:18,713
- A shrewd observation
- Thank you, Your Excellency

540
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:23,512
For if we knew we were Iooking at
a boy rather than a girI...

541
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,708
...we might be influenced
in making our decision

542
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:29,908
We must be completely
free in our choice

543
01:20:31,555 --> 01:20:34,706
A clever trap I wish to avoid

544
01:20:36,035 --> 01:20:40,790
When one prefers men, it is difficult
to change one's perspective

545
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:44,626
The difference between a boy and
a girI is enormous

546
01:20:45,315 --> 01:20:49,103
One cannot consider what is
obviously inferior

547
01:20:51,715 --> 01:20:55,503
But if we consider all the
stories we have heard...

548
01:20:55,875 --> 01:21:00,630
...in certain cases a girI might be
preferabIe to a boy

549
01:21:01,635 --> 01:21:04,468
Let us try to remain objective

550
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:09,592
Look at the elasticity of
those buttocks

551
01:21:09,955 --> 01:21:13,106
There can be no question here

552
01:21:13,475 --> 01:21:15,670
Allow me, Duke

553
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:21,109
I don't wish to contradict, but may I
re- examine a most impressive one?

554
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:24,228
We'II be deIighted to grant
your request

555
01:21:24,675 --> 01:21:28,145
I don't think the heaviness of
these buttocks...

556
01:21:28,515 --> 01:21:32,906
...can be compared to the most
beautifuI we have here

557
01:21:33,315 --> 01:21:36,785
However, I wiII yieId to the
opinion of the majority

558
01:21:37,155 --> 01:21:38,793
I vote for the Duke's candidate

559
01:21:39,715 --> 01:21:43,185
My vote goes to the Duke's
candidate

560
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:47,026
Dear President, three votes to one

561
01:21:47,395 --> 01:21:49,272
I bow to the majority

562
01:21:49,635 --> 01:21:55,346
But I request that my candidate
be reserved for me to defIower

563
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:56,943
Granted

564
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:01,750
We'II reveaI this mystery

565
01:22:20,675 --> 01:22:21,585
Fire!

566
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:32,063
You must be stupid to think that
death would be so easy

567
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:35,985
Don't you know we intend to kill you
a thousand times?

568
01:22:36,355 --> 01:22:40,746
To the end of eternity, if eternity
can have an end

569
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:44,946
Once I had a very mysterious cIient

570
01:22:46,915 --> 01:22:50,385
His mania was closely related to...

571
01:22:50,755 --> 01:22:56,466
...the subject of Signora Castelli's
stories, for which I apologize

572
01:22:56,835 --> 01:22:59,554
The man wanted only women...

573
01:23:00,035 --> 01:23:03,505
...who had been condemned to death

574
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:09,713
The closer they were to death,
the more he would pay

575
01:23:10,595 --> 01:23:14,713
He would visit them when the
sentence had been pronounced

576
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:20,149
Thanks to his exalted social status,
enabling him to pay the price...

577
01:23:20,515 --> 01:23:23,348
...not a single one escaped him

578
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:27,631
He did not possess them casually

579
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:32,632
He insisted on inspecting their rumps
and that they defecated before him

580
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:39,348
He was convinced that the
tastiest faeces...

581
01:23:40,355 --> 01:23:46,385
...were those of women who had just
heard the sentence of death

582
01:23:50,715 --> 01:23:52,592
CIRCLE OF BLOOD

583
01:25:26,915 --> 01:25:29,190
Your Reverence, I am ready

584
01:25:29,795 --> 01:25:32,628
We want a marvellous wedding

585
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:35,793
The President wishes to be first,
he is the most randy

586
01:25:38,435 --> 01:25:40,346
You whoresons!

587
01:25:56,355 --> 01:25:58,789
What is this, a mortuary?

588
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:02,511
These parasites do nothing
for this festive day

589
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:06,033
Do anything you Iike.
Laugh, aII of you

590
01:26:06,915 --> 01:26:11,670
Go on, idiots, show how happy
you are

591
01:26:12,035 --> 01:26:14,595
Go on, Iaugh

592
01:26:17,275 --> 01:26:20,711
Why aren't you yelling for joy?
Go on, sing!

593
01:26:28,275 --> 01:26:30,106
You two, what are you doing?

594
01:26:30,595 --> 01:26:33,428
Excellency, note their names

595
01:26:35,755 --> 01:26:40,465
If you Iike to whimper, we'II make
you, for your Iast few days

596
01:26:51,715 --> 01:26:55,503
Shouldn't you have paid your bills,
Monsieur Royale?

597
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:57,752
Of course, Monsieur Juju

598
01:26:58,115 --> 01:27:01,266
Shouldn't you also pay mine?

599
01:27:01,635 --> 01:27:03,512
Why so?

600
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:06,708
Because two and two make four
and I'm broke

601
01:27:07,075 --> 01:27:09,270
Earn some money

602
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:13,753
- How do I do that?
- Through manuaI Iabour

603
01:27:14,115 --> 01:27:15,992
I don't know how

604
01:27:16,355 --> 01:27:19,506
Then become an actor

605
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,070
That's difficuIt

606
01:27:22,435 --> 01:27:27,065
Try to write then;
all you have to write...

607
01:27:27,555 --> 01:27:29,625
...is any old thing

608
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:41,589
Are you crazy?

609
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:48,869
I have a duty to perform;
I'II return Iater

610
01:30:49,475 --> 01:30:53,104
Your friend here is ready
whenever you are

611
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:37,824
- Please, may I speak to you?
- Of course, my dear

612
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:39,390
What will you do to me?

613
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:43,834
Talk about that tomorrow;
many things will be decided then

614
01:32:44,355 --> 01:32:48,143
I know a secret. Someone is
vioIating your Iaw

615
01:32:48,515 --> 01:32:51,234
Graziella had a photograph
under her pillow

616
01:33:42,275 --> 01:33:43,594
Give me that photograph

617
01:34:03,795 --> 01:34:07,504
Spare me and I'II teII you
what Eva and Antoniska do

618
01:34:08,515 --> 01:34:10,392
They're breaking your Iaws

619
01:34:44,155 --> 01:34:46,953
Don't kill me. I have secrets
to tell you

620
01:34:47,555 --> 01:34:49,591
Speak, dirty whore!

621
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:52,504
Every night Ezio goes to the
black servant girl

622
01:34:53,315 --> 01:34:55,431
I can take you there

623
01:36:46,275 --> 01:36:48,152
Queers!

624
01:36:49,355 --> 01:36:50,913
You make me puke

625
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:41,585
Those who are named will wear
a sky blue ribbon

626
01:37:41,955 --> 01:37:44,150
You can imagine what that means

627
01:37:44,515 --> 01:37:49,031
Others, if they collaborate, are
reprieved. They will return to Salò

628
01:37:49,635 --> 01:37:51,910
What are you going to do to us?

629
01:37:52,515 --> 01:37:56,633
You'II soon know the gravity
of your crimes

630
01:38:11,235 --> 01:38:14,386
The main character...

631
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:19,510
...figured in a number of
the previous stories

632
01:38:19,875 --> 01:38:23,663
He is forty, very powerfully built...

633
01:38:24,035 --> 01:38:26,549
...with a member Iike a staIIion

634
01:38:27,555 --> 01:38:33,266
He is enormously rich,
very powerful, very cruel

635
01:38:34,595 --> 01:38:36,790
A heart of stone

636
01:38:38,115 --> 01:38:43,747
He owns a house near Milan, which
he uses exclusively for his pleasure

637
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:57,150
At his parties, at Ieast fifteen
young girIs are present...

638
01:38:57,635 --> 01:39:00,149
...aged from fifteen to seventeen

639
01:39:00,515 --> 01:39:06,545
Those who are chosen must present
themselves completely naked

640
01:39:06,915 --> 01:39:11,989
He touches them, caresses them,
examines them...

641
01:39:12,355 --> 01:39:16,792
...then makes them defecate into his
mouth, but he does not swallow it

642
01:39:19,715 --> 01:39:22,866
After these first rituals,
with fearsome gravity...

643
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:26,150
...he brands each girI
on the shouIder...

644
01:39:26,755 --> 01:39:29,713
...burning a number into
their tender flesh

645
01:39:30,915 --> 01:39:35,033
After these preliminaries,
he opens the window...

646
01:39:35,395 --> 01:39:41,425
...and places a girl standing in the
middle of the room, facing the window

647
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:47,832
Then gives such a powerfuI kick
to her behind...

648
01:39:48,195 --> 01:39:51,983
...that the poor thing flies across
the room...

649
01:39:52,355 --> 01:39:56,906
...through the window and vanishes
into a dark cellar

650
01:40:07,395 --> 01:40:13,425
Our hero is familiar not only with
Nietzsche, but Huysmans as well

651
01:40:16,355 --> 01:40:20,473
In the ceIIar, a masked executioner
with the deviI's embIems...

652
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:26,228
...presides gravely over the
horrible machines

653
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:30,383
When all the girls are in
the cellar, our hero...

654
01:40:33,635 --> 01:40:39,551
...is highly aroused, having so many
contacts without once ejaculating

655
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:46,390
Naked, his huge member jutting
from his belly

656
01:40:49,315 --> 01:40:53,752
Now all the machines have begun
to function...

657
01:40:54,115 --> 01:41:00,145
...all tortures at once, with
terrifyingly loud screeching

658
01:41:04,395 --> 01:41:07,831
The first apparatus is a huge wheeI
with razor bIades...

659
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:11,983
...to which is bound a girI
to be fIayed aIive

660
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:19,672
Another has a Iive rat sewed
inside her vagina

661
01:41:51,675 --> 01:41:55,714
Oh Lord, why hast thou foresaken us?

662
01:42:10,915 --> 01:42:13,748
A rational person...

663
01:42:14,435 --> 01:42:17,586
...is not content to kill
the same person

664
01:42:17,955 --> 01:42:23,029
He would recommend murdering
as many as possible

665
01:45:15,555 --> 01:45:17,432
Umberto, come here

666
01:46:06,955 --> 01:46:09,913
Bravo, always ready

667
01:47:26,475 --> 01:47:30,229
What does a Bolshevik do when
he dives into the Red Sea?

668
01:47:31,235 --> 01:47:34,705
You don't know what a Bolshevik does?

669
01:47:35,395 --> 01:47:36,464
No, tell me

670
01:47:36,995 --> 01:47:38,314
He goes splash!

671
01:47:41,035 --> 01:47:45,347
Poetry Corner. Ezra Pound.
The Cantos

672
01:47:48,715 --> 01:47:51,354
Canto 99

673
01:47:53,355 --> 01:47:57,143
The whole tribe is from
one man's body

674
01:47:57,395 --> 01:48:01,786
What other way can you think of it?

675
01:48:02,395 --> 01:48:04,113
The surname and the nine arts

676
01:48:05,475 --> 01:48:07,909
The father's word is compassion

677
01:48:08,675 --> 01:48:10,870
The son's, devotion

678
01:48:17,395 --> 01:48:22,833
Small birds sing in chorus. Harmony
is in the proportion of branches

679
01:48:44,515 --> 01:48:50,545
The gay face of spring
is set before the world

680
01:48:58,275 --> 01:49:03,986
The sharpness of winter
now flees defeated

681
01:49:13,635 --> 01:49:19,665
In various apparel Flora reigns

682
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:25,072
And in the euphony of the woods...

683
01:49:25,475 --> 01:49:28,228
...she is hymned in song

684
01:51:17,795 --> 01:51:19,194
Can you dance?

685
01:51:20,915 --> 01:51:21,904
Let's try

686
01:51:52,995 --> 01:51:55,509
- What's your girlfriend's name?
- Margherita
