1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,700
l was born in the city of
Bombay, once upon a time.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,400
At the precise instant of
lndia's arrival at independence...

3
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,400
...on the stroke of midnight,
l tumbled forth into the world.

4
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,800
l, Saleem Sinai, was mysteriously
handcuffed to history.

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
My destiny,
forever chained to my country's.

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,900
And l couldn't even
wipe my own nose...

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
...at the time.

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,900
Most of what matters in our
lives takes place in our absence;

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,400
and my life really began on the
shore of the Dal Lake in Kashmir...

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,500
more than 30 years
before l was born.

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,700
The central feature of
my grandfather's anatomy...

12
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,400
...was his magnificent nose.

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,500
Doctor Aziz.

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,300
Good morning, Ghani Sahib.
- Good morning.

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,600
Now that our own
lady doctor is sick...

16
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
...you, Doctor Aziz, get the
opportunity and she gets the sack.

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Big chance for you, young man.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,300
l've heard nice things about you.

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Good doctor, Europe-returned.
Good family background.

20
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Well, good enough.

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
My daughter is not well.

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,600
Do a good job. Make her alright.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
l have many friends in this town.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
And you have a practice
to build. Right?

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Right.
- Right.

26
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,900
Where is she, your daughter?

27
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,500
She is standing behind the sheet,
like a good girl.

28
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,000
But, Ghani Sahib, how will
l examine her without seeing her?

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,600
Ah, l can see your confusion.

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,000
You Europe returned chappies
forget certain things.

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,700
My daughter is not
going to flaunt her body...

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,700
...under the nose of any Tom,
Dick or, for that matter, Aziz.

33
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,400
You will...

34
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
...specify the portion
that you want to examine.

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,200
What does the lady complain of?

36
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,600
My poor child has terrible
- too-dreading - stomach-ache.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
ln that case, may l examine her?

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Yes - Naseem, stomach, pronto.

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,300
May l?

40
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,500
Yeah, yes, you can.

41
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Thank you.

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,500
Doctor Aziz, my poor child
is suffering from constipation.

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,500
Yes.
- No, no.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't even think about it.

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,900
There is no question of being
permitted to administer an enema.

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
No, no. No, no, Ghani Sahib.
- No. l said no.

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Doctor Aziz!

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,900
Thank you.

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,700
ls it... permitted that l touch?

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,300
Touch away, touch away!
Hands of a healer!

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Thank you.

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
With your permission, please.

53
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,700
ls it the lady's time of the month?

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,700
Yes.

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,300
But then, then... Then
there is nothing to worry about.

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,800
lt's, it's, it's alright.

57
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,500
Don't be embarrassed, old chap!

58
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,700
You're the family doctor now!

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,900
Doctor Aziz... she has a headache.

60
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,800
My goodness doctor, what a nose!

61
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes...

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,900
...it's quite a specimen.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,700
l agree.

64
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,800
So, Doctor Aziz.

65
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,500
Anything else?

66
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,200
Just one more thing...

67
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,900
We will be a modern couple.

68
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Naseem will not wear the veil.

69
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,400
So...

70
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
...you will allow other
men to look at her face?

71
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Most men,
Ghani Sahib, are not beasts.

72
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Most men are also not blind,
Doctor Sahib.

73
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Listen, would you...
move a little, please.

74
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,400
Move where? Move how?.

75
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,600
l mean...like, like a woman.

76
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
Who have l married?

77
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,800
l know you foreign-educated types.

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,700
You do God knows what with
those foreign terrible women,

79
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
...and then you expect
us to be like them.

80
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,600
Listen, Doctor Sahib,

81
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,700
husband or no husband,
l am not the moving type.

82
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Goodbye.

83
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,400
ln Agra, my grandfather contracted
a dangerous form of optimism.

84
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,800
lt was caused by Mian Abdullah,

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
...the hope of all lndian Muslims...

86
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
...who were against the
partition of the country...

87
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
...into lndia and Pakistan.

88
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
A politician with
a peacock-feather fan.

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,900
We can beat them.
- l'm sure.

90
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
We are ready for whatever may come.

91
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,900
There is talk of dirty deeds.

92
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,300
Oh yes?

93
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,800
This is Nadir Khan, my secretary.

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Nice to meet you, Nadir.

95
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,300
He has a heightened imagination.

96
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
He's a poet, you see.

97
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh, a poet...

98
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,700
And what poetry! Not a single verse!

99
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,300
Not a single verb!

100
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Well, all these ideas seem
out of date to me, excuse me, sir.

101
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,500
All artistic expression is equal,

102
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,600
poetry, movies, even the
old men who use their skill to...

103
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
...spit out betel-juice
and hit a spittoon.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,900
Perhaps l will get you a spittoon,..

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
...so that you can
practice your art.

106
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,500
How about that, Mian Abdullah?

107
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
These are new ideas.

108
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,500
We must leave, Your Highness.

109
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
Excuse us. Dr. Aziz.

110
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,500
Mian Sahib?

111
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,900
Help me, Doctor Aziz.

112
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
What?

113
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Please help me.

114
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,500
Who's this?

115
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,700
Sorry for the interruption!

116
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,600
Such an intrusion.

117
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,300
Nadir?

118
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,700
l had to hide!

119
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,500
ls that you, Nadir? What are you--?

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
l saw everything, Doctor!

121
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,700
They killed him.

122
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
l saw them murder him.

123
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,900
Assassins shot him like a dog.

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
And then they saw me!
- Shh. Quiet.

125
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,000
You have to hide me, Doctor.

126
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
Or l'm a dead man.

127
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,500
At home, Doctor Aadam Aziz
found himself surrounded by women.

128
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,500
His formidable wife, Naseem,

129
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,300
and their three daughters:
wise Alia, sweet Mumtaz,

130
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,700
and flighty Emerald.

131
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,300
He's asked us for our shelter.

132
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,800
We have no choice.

133
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,400
Please.

134
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
And spare us your crazy oaths!

135
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Where are you going?

136
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,400
Listen.

137
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,400
But, Abba, where will we put him?

138
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,500
We'll sweep him under the carpet.

139
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,400
Like all other problems.

140
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Sometimes emotions
are stirred into food...

141
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,600
...and become what you feel.

142
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,400
And sometimes,
people leak into each other;

143
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,300
like flavours when you cook.

144
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,300
Mumtaz Aziz,
destined to be my mother,

145
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,400
took upon herself the duties of
caring for the needs of Nadir Khan.

146
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
You're very good.

147
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,400
l'm not a brainbox like Alia,
or a beauty like Emerald.

148
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
But you are.

149
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,900
Eat, now. Don't let it go cold.

150
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
Terrible business, sir.
l fully understand your grief.

151
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
But you did know this fellow...

152
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
...Nadir,
secretary to Mian Abdullah?

153
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,700
No, l don't think so, no.

154
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,700
Met him at the Rani of cooch
Naheen's on the night of the killing?

155
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,700
Yes, of course...

156
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,500
Yes, l thought you might
be able to shed some light on...

157
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,800
...his disappearance. No?...

158
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
No.

159
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
And of course these
charming young ladies...

160
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
...of yours have also seen nothing.

161
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,600
And if we should see something,
Major Zulfikar,

162
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,500
what should we do?

163
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,800
Ah. Miss Emerald.

164
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
Naturally you should
inform your father...

165
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,700
...who will then alert me in my
office at the military cantonment.

166
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Yes, of course. - Of course.
Thank you so much, Major.

167
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,800
Yes.

168
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Thank you, Major.

169
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,500
Sir, ladies.

170
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,700
Madam.

171
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Did you see that girl, captain?

172
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes, sir.

173
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,300
That, captain,
is the girl l intend to marry.

174
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,500
Feeling left out by her
self-imposed vow of silence,

176
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,300
my grandmother eavesdropped
on her daughters' dreams.

177
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,600
She visited Emerald's dreams...

178
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,600
...and found Zulfikar
lurking in them.

179
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,700
ln Alia's, she saw the successful
and handsome businessman...

180
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
... Ahmed Sinai.

181
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,500
And in Mumtaz's, she saw a son.

182
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,600
A boy with a cucumber nose,
unfortunately.

183
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,300
No, tell me a poem -- one of yours.

184
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,300
No, no, you wouldn't like it, ok?

185
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,700
You must!
The best one you ever wrote.

186
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,700
lt's got no rhymes. lt's free verse.

187
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
Does it at least have a name?

188
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes.

189
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,300
So? What is it?

190
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,500
''Mumtaz.''

191
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Spittoon.

192
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
So that you can practise your art.

193
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,800
See, l remembered.

194
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,200
Okay, l'm sorry, everyone,
but is this really happening?

195
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,300
They're going to get married
and live in the cellar...

196
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,900
...and we have to keep the secret?

197
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,400
For how long?

198
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,200
Ten years? This is ridiculous.

199
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,200
Please, Emerald. There
might still be killers out there.

200
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
l need some time.

201
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,500
What would Major Zulfikar say?

202
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,600
Already he wonders,
how Nadir survived the shooting.

203
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,400
lf Nadir is innocent he should
go to the Major and come clean.

204
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,600
lf Nadir is innocent? lf, you say?

205
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,700
Please, Emerald.
Some time, na?

206
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,800
Okay, okay.

207
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Hide on...

208
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,900
...like a fat worm under the ground.

209
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Emerald.

210
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Enough.

211
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Begin the ceremony, please.

212
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
l'm sorry.

213
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,600
No. No, it's okay.

214
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,600
lt's okay. lt'll come, alright.

215
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,600
Family history,
too, has dietary laws.

216
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,200
One is supposed only
to swallow the halal parts,

217
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
drained of blood.

218
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,800
But that makes the
stories less juicy,

219
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,500
and this was ajuicy part.

220
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
So it must be told.

221
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,000
Try again.

222
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
What's going on?

223
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,500
- Abba,
- Move!

224
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Abba, abba,
please don't tell them anything...

225
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
this house for far too long.

226
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,800
Abbajan... please, what's wrong?

227
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,300
What's wrong? What's wrong you
say - l'll tell you what's wrong!

228
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
My daughter tells
me she is still a virgin!

229
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
That's what is wrong.

230
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
l love my husband.

231
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
What?
- l love him, abba.

232
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,900
The other thing will come, right?
lt will.

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,700
A marriage should
not depend on this thing,

234
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,900
but on love.

235
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
This should not have been mentioned.

236
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
Down there!

237
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,000
Weapons out!
- No!

238
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,700
You'll thank me later,
just wait and see.

239
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Stay tight!

240
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Follow me, boys!

241
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,900
Women must marry men, not mice.

242
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,700
So you found your voice.

243
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,000
Whose crazy fool's
scheme was this...

244
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,000
...to allow this coward
who hides underground...

245
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,700
...like a worm, into our home?

246
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,900
The bird has turned!

247
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
The worm has flown!

248
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,700
After all that,
he actually got away?

249
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,900
l divorce thee,

250
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
l divorce thee,

251
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
l divorce thee.

252
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,300
That sweet man...

253
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,400
...he set me free.

254
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,400
Please look over here, sir.

255
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,700
Big smile!

256
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Thank you.

257
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,400
Thank you. Thank you.

258
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,300
lt's a... lt's a beautiful wedding,
sir, really.

259
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,400
Most grateful.

260
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,400
Damn glad l chose
not to charge you...

261
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
...with harbouring
a wanted criminal.

262
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
Married your daughter instead.

263
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,500
Thank you, sir. Thanks very much.

264
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,500
Go away!

265
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
You know,
l've always loved children.

266
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,600
Me too.

267
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,400
But never had any.
My former wife couldn't.

268
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,800
Oh, l'm sorry.
But, you could always still...

269
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,700
Marry again.

270
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,600
Yes.

271
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,700
Well, if l found the right girl.

272
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,900
And, if she would have me,
if l asked.

273
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,900
Yes?

274
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,600
Yes.

275
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
And move to Bombay with me.

276
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,700
We're moving to...?

277
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
l mean, you're moving?

278
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Safer for a family, no?

279
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,400
Big smile!

280
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,600
Mumtaz..

281
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,500
l've got something for you.

282
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,600
What? A present?

283
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,600
Better than that. A new name.

284
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,500
Amina.

285
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Do you like it?

286
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,700
Amina...

287
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Yes.

288
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Nadir and Mumtaz
are in the past now.

289
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Better to leave them behind, no?

290
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
A new name for a new beginning...

291
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
Mrs Amina Sinai.

292
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,200
Whatever you say.

293
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,400
Why did she marry him so quickly?
For solace?

294
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,400
For the children they
both wanted so much?

295
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,500
My mother Amina Sinai,
in her new incarnation,

296
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,300
resolved to forget the poet Nadir...

297
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,900
...and fall in love with my father,
Ahmed Sinai.

298
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,000
But love is a rare thing...

299
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
Ah Bombay!

300
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Bombay, of which the old tunes sang,

301
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,900
''Prima in lndis!
Gateway to lndia!

302
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
Star of the East with
her face to the West!''

303
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,500
Ah Bombay!

304
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Ah, Mr Methwold.

305
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Mr Sinai. How do you do?

306
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,900
Very well, and you? My wife.

307
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
Well, Mr Methwold, l must say...

308
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,400
...the price you're asking
for Buckingham Villa, it's...

309
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,900
lt's rather...

310
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,500
well, it's absolutely...

311
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Ridiculous.
Yes, a ridiculously low price.

312
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,600
We're giving the whole blasted
country away, in point of fact.

313
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,600
Hundreds of years of decent,
honourable...

314
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
...government and then
all of a sudden it's up and off.

315
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,400
You must admit,
though, we weren't all bad.

316
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,300
Not at all.

317
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,900
We built your schools...

318
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
...railway stations...

319
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,500
...trains, so forth...

320
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,800
l was just telling my
wife what a fine man you are!

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Look here, Willie,
do me a favour, man, will you.

322
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,700
l've got this terrible headache.

323
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,000
And if you could nip
down to Kemp's corner

324
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,800
...and ask the chemist
to give you some pills.

325
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,900
Servants are all down with a cold.
Otherwise l wouldn't have asked.

326
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

327
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Good man.

328
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,900
My own little transfer
of power will also take place...

329
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,100
at midnight on August
the 14th, 1947.

330
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,800
When lndia rids itself of us...

331
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Buckingham Villa...

332
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,800
...will be free of
William Methwold. Me.

333
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
...And the grass must be
sprayed every single night.

334
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,500
Well, absolutely, Mr Methwold.

335
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,400
Well, as you say in Hindustani,

336
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,400
Sab kuch ticktock hai.
Everything is tickety-boo.

337
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,600
Absolutely.

338
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,900
And another small detail, Mr Sinai.

339
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,900
Nothing in the house must
change until lndependence.

340
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,700
lt must be bought complete
with its entire contents.

341
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,900
Janum, everything?

342
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,500
Not even a spoon can be thrown?
And this lamp... for two months?

343
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,800
Well, Mr Sinai?

344
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,600
Yes sir, Mr Methwold?

345
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,900
One other little condition.

346
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,700
We will take a cocktail here,
in the grounds of Buckingham Villa,

347
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,100
every evening until
my departure from lndia.

348
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Very well.

349
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Good night ladies,
good night, ladies...

350
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,800
This is Wee Willie.
Local tramp and his wife, Vanita.

351
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,500
You'll be seeing a lot of them.

352
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,400
farewell ladies, farewell ladies...

353
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,700
farewell ladies...

354
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,100
...we're going to say goodnight.

355
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,500
Good night ladies...

356
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,700
Good night ladies...

357
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,400
Sings well, your Wee Willie.
Damn silly name, though.

358
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,700
But you gave it to him.

359
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,600
So l did. Amongst other things.

360
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,900
Good night ladies...

361
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,500
...good night ladies...

362
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,100
we're going to leave you now.

363
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,700
We're going...

364
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,900
...to say good night!

365
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Very good, Willie.

366
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,600
Wee Willie Winkie is my name;
to sing for my supper is my fame.

367
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,600
l hope you are com-for-table

368
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,300
...or are you come-for-tea?

369
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,500
Oh, joke-joke ladies and ladahs!

370
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Bottoms up.

371
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,000
Fix you another one?

372
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,000
How kind. Thank you, Mr Sinai.

373
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,700
Pretty girl, that.

374
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,400
Must be due around
about the same time as you.

375
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,300
Sab kuch ticktock hai.

376
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Everything is indeed, tickety-boo.

377
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,800
Tickety-boo...

378
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,800
l think, Madame,
you're going to have a baby boy.

379
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,300
Joe! My God!

380
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
What are you doing here?

381
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
You and your politics!

382
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,700
Against the rich.

383
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,600
The rich need to become poor,
and the poor rich.

384
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,400
Understand, Mary?

385
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
You need money?
- No.

386
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Pakistan and lndia were born washing
themselves in one another's blood.

387
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,900
The empire on which
the sun never sets.

388
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,900
But l will not describe it.

389
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,700
l will avert my eyes
from the violence.

390
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,400
Selfish perhaps,
but excusably so in my opinion.

391
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,700
After all,
one is not born every day.

392
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Long years ago we made
a tryst with destiny.

393
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,400
And now the time comes when
we shall redeem our pledge...

394
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,500
...not wholly...

395
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,400
...or in full measure,
but very substantially.

396
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,000
Busy night!

397
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,900
Joe!

398
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,400
l need to get out of Bombay.
They're after me.

399
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
We need to do it now, Mary.

400
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
The real revolution.

401
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,300
Say you love me.

402
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
Say it once.

403
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,000
At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps...

404
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,700
lndia will awake
to life and freedom.

405
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,600
A moment comes,
which comes but rarely in history...

406
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,400
...when we step out...

407
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,000
...from the old to the new.

408
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,100
When an age ends,
and when the soul of a nation,

409
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,800
long suppressed, finds utterance.

410
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,500
At the precise instant of
lndia's arrival at independence.

411
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,900
On the stroke of midnight,
as a matter of fact,

412
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,700
l tumbled forth into the world.

413
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,500
Vanita?

414
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,600
Oh, Jesus.

415
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Poor baby...

416
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,900
...poor thing.

417
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,500
Mommy no more.

418
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh Mary, so many babies...

419
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,900
Give it to me.

420
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,600
Private room number four. Sinai.

421
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,900
Sinai.

422
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,900
Two babies in her hands.

423
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
Two lives in her power.

424
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,900
She did it for Joe;
her own private, revolutionary act.

425
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,900
''Love me, Joe,'' was in Mary's mind.

426
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,600
And then it was done.

427
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,500
Okay, Joe?

428
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
When she gave the
child of my mother's womb

429
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
to Wee Willie Winkie,

430
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,000
Mary knew she was condemning
the rich born boy...

431
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,400
...to a life of
accordions and poverty.

432
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,000
Shiva...

433
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,000
As Joe had said,
let the rich be poor...

434
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,900
...and the poor, rich.

435
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,600
Thank you.

436
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,300
Saleem. Saleem Sinai.

437
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,100
Look, janum. Poor fellow,
he's got his grandfather's nose!

438
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,400
Go call the newspapers.

439
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,600
Tell the photographers to come!

440
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,600
''A charming pose
of Baby Saleem Sinai,''

441
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,100
''born on the exact moment
of our nation's independence.''

442
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,800
''We shall be watching over your
life with the closest attention.''

443
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,600
''lt will be in a sense,
a mirror of our own.''

444
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,400
''The happy child
of the glorious hour!''

445
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,600
Hold it up.

446
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Look at me.

447
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
come, let's go home.

448
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,400
Mary, unable in her
fright to confess her crime,

449
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,800
realized she had been a fool.

450
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,600
She cursed herself...

451
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
...but kept her secret.

452
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,400
And decided to make
amends of a kind...

453
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,000
...to a motherless boy.

454
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Mary, isn't it?
- Yes.

455
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,600
From Dr Narlikar's clinic?
- Yes.

456
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,000
ls something the matter?

457
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,900
No. l just wanted to
know if you need any Nanny.

458
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,500
Well, yes, actually l do.

459
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,500
come.

460
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,600
Thank you.

461
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,900
Hi...

462
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,600
First time l saw him
l was just done for him.

463
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,000
Who has come?

464
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,000
Winkie...

465
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
...Winkie!

466
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,300
can l come?
- come.

467
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,700
Mary...

468
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,700
Please go give him some money.

469
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Here.

470
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Hold this.

471
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,400
Bless you, baby.

472
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:41,600
come, come. There there.

473
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,300
Saleem. Baba.

474
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,000
Anything you want to be...

475
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,600
you can be...

476
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
you can be...

477
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,600
you want.

478
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,800
...Anything you want to be...

479
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,700
By our tenth birthday,
lndia and myself...

480
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,700
...were both under
a lot of pressure.

481
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,800
There was growth, there were gains,

482
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,600
there were five-year
plans and good exam results.

483
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,500
Anything you want to--

484
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,800
Mary, please can
you stop singing that.

485
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,500
You can be...

486
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,500
Please, Mary.

487
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,100
But there was also...

488
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,900
...the weight of expectation...

489
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Please, Mary.

490
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,700
...lt was a lot to live up to.

491
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,000
Aren't you forgetting
something, Saleem?

492
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,500
Where's my morning hug?

493
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,700
come on!

494
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,400
come on. come on. come on! Yes!

495
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,600
Stop it, Abba, it's embarrassing!

496
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,900
Embarrassing?

497
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,900
What nonsense.

498
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,100
Ammi!

499
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,900
Great things in store for you,
my son! l love you.

500
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,900
come.

501
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,100
And me Abba?

502
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,300
Yes you, too, Jamila.

503
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,500
Jamila, Abba's just joking.

504
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,600
You want green chutney, baba?

505
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,900
Yes, sure. Of course.

506
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,100
What a fine boy!

507
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,400
See if l care.

508
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,600
Jamila!

509
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,500
Yes, Ammi?

510
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,100
coming!

511
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,900
Hey, Saleem.

512
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,500
Suppose it turns out
that you're not that special.

513
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,700
Suppose in the end
you're just normal.

514
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,100
l know.

515
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,000
Anything you want to be...
- Shut up! Stupid.

516
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,900
Anything...

517
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,800
Wife!

518
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,700
Frozen.

519
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,600
Freeze a Muslim's assets they say,
and he'll run back to Pakistan.

520
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,500
Leaving all his wealth behind.

521
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,000
But we must do something!
- What?

522
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,300
Something. We have law courts.
We have to fight!

523
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,900
Fight? How?. With what?

524
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,800
They have shoved my
balls into an ice bucket.

525
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,700
Janum, please.

526
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Though some of his
assets eventually unfroze,

527
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,500
from that moment,
my father entered a deep solitude.

528
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,400
And a strange perfume started wafting
out from under his study door.

529
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,800
Jamila said it was
the smell of stale food,

530
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,400
but it's my belief that
it was the aroma of failure.

531
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,000
When l say 'doggie',
you'll say 'woof, woof'.

532
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
What will you say?

533
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Woof, woof!

534
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,500
Woof, woof. Let's go. Woof, woof.

535
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,600
How much is that
doggie in the window?.

536
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,500
Woof! Woof!

537
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
The one with the waggily tail...

538
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,800
How much is that
doggie in the window?.

539
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
Woof! Woof!

540
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,800
l do hope that dog is for sale...

541
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,900
Shiva, get the money.

542
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Give Shiva some money.

543
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
What happened?

544
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,900
Let's go.

545
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,700
l said, let's go.

546
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,000
Bloody rich boy.

547
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,900
Saleem, quickly. come.

548
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,600
Look there.

549
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,800
You see it? lt's Sputnik.

550
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,000
Great achievement for Man.

551
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,800
Listen, Saleem,
my achievements have been small,

552
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,000
my ambitions thwarted.

553
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,400
But you, my son,
yours must be big.

554
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,400
Do you understand?
- Yes, Abba.

555
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,000
Hello. No. lt's the wrong

556
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,000
l told you this is the wrong number!

557
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,700
Nadir.

558
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,500
Who's..? Who's in there?

559
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,400
Ammi, l swear, l didn't
see anything! Wait a minute, Ammi!

560
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,700
There are voices in my head!

561
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,100
come!

562
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,100
Ammi, l...

563
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,500
Not one word for one whole day!
- Ammi, l...

564
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Not one word.

565
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Shhh.. Not one word.
- Mary, listen...

566
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,700
Shhh...shhh...SHHH!

567
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,400
Saleem! Saleem, listen to me.

568
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,000
We are your friends. We're just
like you! Listen to me, Saleem.

569
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,700
We are your friends.
We're just like you!

570
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,700
We are your friends.
We're just like you!

571
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,000
By the morning,
l had discovered that...

572
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
...l could somehow control
the volume of the voices

573
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,600
...through my nose!

574
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,100
Fear left me,
and l was thinking, ''Man!

575
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,000
This is better than
All-lndia-Radio!''

576
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,700
Abbu, Ammi:

577
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,000
Mary, please can
l have your attention?

578
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,100
You have something to tell us?

579
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,600
An apology, l hope.

580
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,600
Ammi, something really
big has happened finally!

581
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,800
But first, please call Abba.

582
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,100
Most certainly not.

583
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,400
What's going on?

584
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,700
Abbu, Ammi: l'm hearing voices.

585
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,700
Voices are speaking
to me inside my head.

586
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,700
l really think that Archangels
have started to talk to me.

587
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,500
What's wrong?
Has your brain gone raw?.

588
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,700
Are you growing into a madman?

589
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,800
Oh, Jesus.

590
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,600
What is it?
- Please, move aside.

591
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,400
Abba?

592
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,500
What happened son?

593
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,000
You're hearing voices
inside your head?

594
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,000
Yes.

595
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,900
Still hearing those voices, ha?

596
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,900
Still hearing the voices?

597
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,800
That was necessary...

598
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,300
...to avoid repetition.

599
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,900
Saleem, listen to me!

600
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,500
Saleem listen to me!

601
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,700
Saleem listen to me!

602
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,500
Saleem listen to me!

603
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,600
We are your friends![sic]

604
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,700
Saleem listen to me! Saleem.

605
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,000
Saleem, Saleem listen to me!
Saleem...

606
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,000
Saleem, Saleem listen to me!
Saleem...

607
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,000
Saleem, Saleem listen to me!
Saleem...

608
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,000
Saleem listen to me! Saleem.

609
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,100
Go away!

610
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,300
l don't want you!

611
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,000
Did you see what Abbu did?

612
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,800
Hello? No, it's the wrong number.

613
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,900
When?

614
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,800
Where?

615
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,100
l told you: lt's the wrong number!

616
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,800
And now she'll go out by herself.

617
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,300
Once upon a time,
there was an underground husband...

618
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,000
...who fled,
leaving loving messages of divorce.

619
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,800
After a lost decade...

620
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,100
...he emerged from
goodness-knows-where.

621
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,900
l watched my mother
and Nadir Khan...

622
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,100
...and l saw the kiss.

623
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,500
The indirect kiss.

624
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,900
l'll be gob-smacked.

625
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,500
Saleem? What on earth
are you doing here?

626
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,200
Don't talk to me! l hate you!

627
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,800
What's happening, darling?

628
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,900
You know what's happening!
l saw everything. l saw it all.

629
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,200
l saw what you did!

630
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,500
What did l do?

631
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,000
No more of these wrong-number calls,
okay, Amma?

632
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,600
Don't go out to see other men!

633
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,100
No more of this glass-kissery!

634
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,000
l hate you!

635
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,800
Saleem!
Saleem, listen to me! Saleem!

636
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,000
Go away!
l told you! Get out of my head!

637
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,100
Saleem! We're your friends!
We're like you!

638
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,200
We're not friends.
l don't even know you.

639
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,400
Never call on this number again.

640
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,700
Saleem!

641
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,400
Saleem?

642
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,600
Saleem, we are your friends.

643
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
We're like you.

644
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,600
We were born then, on that night.

645
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,500
You mean my midnight?

646
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
That midnight?

647
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,200
Yes, in that first hour.

648
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
All of you?

649
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,600
Yes, all of us!

650
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,500
But how can l hear you all?

651
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,500
How can l see you?

652
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,700
We all have gifts.

653
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,600
The closer to midnight
our birth-times,

654
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,900
the greater our gifts.

655
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,600
Who's there?

656
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,600
Saleem and Shiva. Shiva and Saleem.

657
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,400
Both born on the stroke
of midnight both alike.

658
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,700
Same to same.

659
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,000
My gift...

660
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,000
...is to fight.

661
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,500
He's the only one who
can bring us all together.

662
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,900
He's overthrow a government.

663
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,500
Aren't you...

664
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,100
Wee Willie's son?
How's your father anyway?

665
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,400
Talking to yourself?

666
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,700
Ammi is right,
your brain has really gone raw.

667
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,800
Get lost!

668
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,500
See if l care!

669
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,200
Where are you all going?
Why you are leaving?

670
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,800
You'll get better at this.

671
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,000
At what?

672
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,000
This.

673
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,000
children of midnight? No.

674
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,200
Midnight's children.

675
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,500
You see this man?

676
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,500
This man brought
civilization to savages.

677
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,000
And he commanded respect.

678
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,000
How?.

679
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,700
With his...?

680
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,200
Sword, sir?
- correct!

681
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,200
So, today's subject
-- Human Geography.

682
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Sinai?

683
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,500
Sir?

684
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,100
This is what, Sinai?

685
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,100
Sir, l don't know, sir.

686
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,000
Ah, you don't know, my friend!
come with me.

687
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,800
So, l ask again...

688
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,900
Ah!

689
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,600
Do you know what is Human Geography?

690
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,200
Oh! Sir, please! Sir, please, sir!

691
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,400
Regard, please, the hideous
face of this primitive creature.

692
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
lt reminds you of...?
- Sir, the devil, sir!

693
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,000
Sir, a vegetable, sir!

694
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,500
A cousin of mine, sir!

695
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,800
l don't know which one--

696
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,800
Silence, sons of baboons!
This object here is human geography.

697
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,500
How, sir? Where, sir?

698
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,700
ln the face of this ugly ape, you
don't see the whole map of lndia?

699
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,500
No, sir!

700
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,100
See, the Deccan
peninsula hanging down?

701
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,000
And the stains!
These stains are Pakistan.

702
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,000
The birthmark on the
right is East Pakistan,

703
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and this horrible stain is where...?

704
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,700
Tell me what you are!

705
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,000
An animal, sir?

706
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,700
Tell me what you are!

707
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,100
Er, accidents will happen,
Mrs Sinai.

708
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,000
What's wrong with you, Mr crusoe?

709
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,600
l'm here because
one of your teachers...

710
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,200
...pulled out a clump
of hair from my son's scalp...

711
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,500
and this is what
you have to say to me?

712
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,900
Just shoo!

713
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,800
Go!

714
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,700
Let's have a look, shall we?

715
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,900
This won't hurt a bit.

716
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
We've a given him a mild sedative.

717
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,800
lt'll make him a little groggy,
but it'll help him get better.

718
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,600
You'll be fine soon, okay?

719
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,800
By the way...

720
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,500
Your blood type,
A and O -- you're sure?

721
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,600
Yes.

722
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,100
Why do you ask?

723
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,100
l... Excuse me.

724
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,500
You see...

725
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,200
... he's neither one nor the other.

726
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,000
You're sure he's your son?
Not adopted?

727
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,900
Yes, of course he's our son, Doctor.

728
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,700
Excuse me.

729
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,900
l don't understand.

730
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,600
What is there not to understand?

731
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,200
He's neither one nor the other.

732
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,900
Somebody else's blood is involved.

733
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,200
What?!

734
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,600
You see he's neither
one nor the other.

735
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Abba...

736
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,200
Look at his face.

737
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,400
Where am l in the face?

738
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,600
That bloody nose.
l should have known.

739
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,200
l will not let you
say such things about me!

740
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,500
l'll kill myself!

741
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,000
Baba?

742
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,800
Baba?

743
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,900
l will make you all the
green chutney in the world.

744
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,400
Excuse me, sir, would you
like to have something? Ma'am?

745
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,700
No, thanks.

746
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,500
Excuse me,
would you like to have something?

747
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,900
My blood was wrong. My wrong blood

748
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,400
turned my father's love to hate.

749
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,500
And though it caused
my mother much pain,

750
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,500
l was sent away.

751
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,700
Ah, Saleem. Right-o.

752
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,400
Let me be clear.

753
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,700
My sister asked me to take you in,
l can't refuse...

754
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,400
...whatever my own personal
inclinations may be.

755
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,700
Welcome.

756
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,600
Thank you, Emerald aunty.

757
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,700
Your cousin Zia will
show you the ropes.

758
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,900
Zia?

759
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,900
What did you do to get kicked out?

760
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,100
l hear you still wet your pants.

761
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,200
Watch it, snotty!

762
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,500
Everything ready, Em?

763
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Yes, darling.

764
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,500
The time is close now.

765
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Very well.

766
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,600
Discretion is the watchword.

767
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,100
Of course, darling.

768
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,600
Dad, what's going on?

769
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
Quiet!

770
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,600
And you, boy. Here on sufferance.

771
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Don't act smart. Understood?

772
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,500
And forget everything
you've just heard.

773
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,400
Yes, Uncle Zulfi.

774
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,800
Yes, sir, General Zulfikar.

775
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,700
Yes, sir, General Zulfikar.

776
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,600
''Uncle'' is hardly appropriate...

777
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,800
...given the circs.

778
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Are you there?

779
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,800
All of you, are you there?

780
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:48,800
Yes!

781
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,200
Hi, Parvati.

782
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,600
Hello, Saleem.

783
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,900
Any new tricks?

784
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,600
Abracadabra!

785
01:06:58,700 --> 01:06:59,700
Wow!

786
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,600
l was born seven
seconds after midnight.

787
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,800
This is too good!

788
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,600
We've got to organize ourselves.

789
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,500
Gangs need bosses, rich kid.

790
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,600
l've been running a gang for years.

791
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,900
lt's me that's bringing
you all together in my head.

792
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,800
Yaar...

793
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,000
...everyone does what l say.

794
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,000
Let Saleem be!

795
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,100
Shut up. Hm!

796
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,600
How are you doing all of this?

797
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,400
lt's somehow because of this.

798
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,100
One thousand and one.

799
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,700
But...

800
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,800
...four hundred and
twenty are already dead.

801
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,500
And everyone else?

802
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,100
Do you know what they can do?

803
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,100
ln Orissa, there is a girl,

804
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,400
...and whoever sees
her falls in love with her.

805
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,100
And you, from Goa!

806
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,500
You can multiply fish!

807
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,500
And you, from Kerala!

808
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,000
You can step through mirrors...

809
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,000
...and reappear through
them wherever you want!

810
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,600
And you...

811
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,400
...a werewolf from Nilgiri Hills!

812
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,100
And you from the Vindhyas...

813
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,100
...you can make yourself
bigger and smaller.

814
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,700
And you can fly.

815
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:12,600
So if we have these gifts, then...

816
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,000
...we must ask why?

817
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,700
There must be a reason, na?

818
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,600
l think we should figure
it out and dedicate--

819
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,900
What's the reason that
you're rich and l'm poor?

820
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,100
What's the reason l'm starving, man?
l'll tell you.

821
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,900
You gotta get what you can,
do what you can with it,

822
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,600
and then you gotta die.

823
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,600
That's the reason, rich kid!

824
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,100
And everything else
is mother-sleeping wind.

825
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,000
Stop it Shiva.
- Shut up, slut.

826
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,000
l'm gonna take this
gang of freaks over.

827
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,500
Not without me. Without me, they
won't even be able to listen to you.

828
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,100
Just try and stop me.

829
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,700
Good evening. Please...

830
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,600
Sir!

831
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,000
Mr commander-in-chief,
be welcome in our home.

832
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,800
come, Emerald,
no need for such formalities.

833
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,900
Please...

834
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,500
You shouldn't be watching.

835
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,000
Neither should you.

836
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,200
Wow! lf he's here,
then this is something really big.

837
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,600
Shh!

838
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,800
What is the meaning of this?

839
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,700
Perhaps they should
be permitted to attend.

840
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,000
lt's their future that
we're making after all. come on.

841
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,500
come on, boys.

842
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,200
Gentlemen, here, in our Pakistan,

843
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,600
our Land of the Pure...

844
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,100
...there is impurity on every side.

845
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,700
Tonight, therefore on my command,

846
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,000
we assume control of the State.

847
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,100
Hear! Hear!

848
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,600
Martial Law is imposed
with immediate effect.

849
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,800
The constitution is abrogated.

850
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
All political parties are abolished.

851
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,800
General Zulfikar!
- Sir!

852
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,900
Kindly map out the procedures.

853
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,100
Sir.

854
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,600
Zia! come here.

855
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,900
You, Saleem. come up here and help.

856
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,100
Excuse me.

857
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,200
At this moment...

858
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,500
...the national radio
station has been surrounded...

859
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,800
...by hand-picked units.

860
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,700
Loyal armoured units...

861
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,800
...are simultaneously seizing
control of the airport.

862
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,900
Key points in the city...

863
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,900
...are now secure.

864
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,100
And finally...

865
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,800
...crack troops...

866
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,100
...have taken charge...

867
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,000
...of the Presidential palace.

868
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Gentlemen...

869
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,500
...the day is ours!

870
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,800
Pakistan!

871
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,100
Zindabad!

872
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,400
Well done, young man.

873
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Mr President...

874
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,100
You're a lucky man.

875
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,500
lt's only exile for you.

876
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:32,700
''Only exile...?!'' ln exile,
l learned about power.

877
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,000
After all, l had helped
to overthrow a government.

878
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,000
Also l learned about loneliness.

879
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,100
Years with no friends...

880
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,500
...except for Midnight's children.

881
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,900
Aaah!

882
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
That dream again.

883
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,700
come, please. All of you.

884
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,000
Now what, cucumber-nose?

885
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,500
come on, Shiva. lt's time
for the conference, everyone.

886
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,500
Hi!

887
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,100
Yaar not that story again.

888
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,200
Haven't you worked out
that it's the same every time?

889
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,800
''We must be here for a reason.

890
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,000
We're all here for a higher purpose.

891
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,700
Maybe...

892
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,700
maybe we should just use
our powers to help our parents.''

893
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,100
''No!''

894
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,500
''We must keep it a secret... shh...''

895
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,000
''lf they find us,
they will come after us

896
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,400
and they will kill us!''

897
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,000
Huh? What do you suggest,
Mister ''l'm very strong?''

898
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,600
Parvati.

899
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,700
What's your bloody plan?

900
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,100
Don't kill me with your broom.
- No, stop!

901
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,000
Parvati.

902
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,900
We all have to stay together, na?

903
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,800
lsn't that right?

904
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,500
l mean, don't you all see
everything else is breaking apart?

905
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:47,600
Languages, religions, countries...

906
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,600
We can show people
a new way of being.

907
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,700
Get up.

908
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,800
Shiva!

909
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Now listen to me.

910
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,600
Nobody can stop us. Hm?

911
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,500
We can blind people. Make gold. Fly.

912
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,200
Read minds. Dojaadu.

913
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,700
How will they fight us?

914
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,000
Get off...

915
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,600
...we're not getting hitched.

916
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,900
The world is not ideas rich kid.

917
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,000
The world is things.

918
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,000
lf you have things,
you have time to dream.

919
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,900
Hm? lf you don't...

920
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,600
...you fight.

921
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,700
No, Shiva. No, no fighting.

922
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,700
Look, people aren't things, man.

923
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,800
People need each other.

924
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,700
And it's not about flying,
or blinding, or gold... or magic!

925
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,200
And our powers aren't for fighting.

926
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
lt's this.

927
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,000
l'll beat the hell out of you.

928
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,500
Shiva, stop!

929
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,000
You don't understand.
They don't care about us!

930
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,900
No fighting, guys! Please.

931
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,000
l think Saleem's right!

932
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,100
We should start a coup!

933
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,100
No! Enough! No coup!

934
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,700
Shut up.
Hey, rich kid!

935
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,500
Agh!

936
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,100
SHlVA.

937
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,100
Shiva, don't do this. Stop!

938
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,600
Try to understand, Shiva!
Don't do this!

939
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,900
Shut up.

940
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,100
Shh. Shut up!

941
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,700
How about l finish this right now!

942
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,700
More?

943
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,500
No!

944
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,000
The Midnight's children
conference is hereby dissolved!

945
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,700
lts constitution is abrogated!

946
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,900
lts Assemblies are suspended!
l abolish it!

947
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,600
Good morning, General Zulfikar.

948
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,000
You wanted me, Emerald aunty?

949
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,000
How long has it been now, Saleem?

950
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,700
Quite a long time, you'll agree?

951
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,600
Yes.

952
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,800
Such a helpful boy. Love you.

953
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,100
l told your ma,
she must have you back.

954
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,800
To be fair,
she's been on your side all along.

955
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,600
Your pater wants to make
a fresh start here in Pakistan.

956
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,100
So you'll be joining them...

957
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,800
...at Alia's place, in Karachi.

958
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,100
Oh!

959
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,100
Oh, sorry!

960
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,600
What are you doing?!
Out! ldiot, out of my sight!

961
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,900
Yes, Emerald aunty.

962
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,900
cheerio, Uncle Zulfi!

963
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,500
Did your aunty feed you properly?

964
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,600
Her food is horrible.

965
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,500
l missed your cooking so much.
Green chutney.

966
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,300
Baba...

967
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,500
She didn't come, Mary?

968
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,600
She's waiting at home. Let's go.

969
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,300
Give it to me.

970
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,700
My child.

971
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,500
Ammi.

972
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,800
Terrible things happen
in life and we don't know how.

973
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:44,900
Forgive me.

974
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,500
Be kind to your abba.
He's not been very happy these days.

975
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,600
Hello, Abba.

976
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,300
Abba. Hi.

977
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,300
Hi, Saleem.

978
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Hi.

979
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,900
Welcome back.

980
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,600
Thank you.

981
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,500
come.

982
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,800
What happened to me, Mary?

983
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,300
How can my blood be wrong?

984
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,200
Nothing wrong with your blood.

985
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,900
lt's my mother's fault.

986
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,300
Don't say that.

987
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,700
She was with other men.

988
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,200
Shut up, baba!

989
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,200
l saw it Mary. l saw it all.

990
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,400
Please, Joe. Help me.

991
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,300
Ah, Jamila the singing
star has arrived.

992
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,400
She sings very well.

993
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,600
Thank you, abba.

994
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,700
You're welcome, darling.

995
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,300
Five-letter word for ''singer''...

996
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,100
Mary. A little more toast, please.
- Ah, ''tenor''.

997
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,200
Sir. Madam.

998
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,300
Madam, please.

999
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,600
What's wrong, Mary?

1000
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,700
What happened?

1001
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,600
Baba is not your son.

1002
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,900
He's Winkie and Vanita's son.

1003
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,500
No, he is not.

1004
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,900
Vanita's child's father is not Winkie.

1005
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,400
lt's that... that Englishman...

1006
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,200
- Methwold.
- Methwold.

1007
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,800
He's gone back to England
and poor Vanita, she's dead now.

1008
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,600
She died at midnight.

1009
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,300
l was there, Madam.

1010
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,400
l gave your child to her...

1011
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,200
...and hers to you.

1012
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,200
Sorry, Madam.

1013
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,600
Your son is Shiva.

1014
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,400
Not a nice boy at all.

1015
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,800
l'm sorry, Madam.

1016
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,800
Let the rich be poor... Poor, rich.

1017
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:30,400
Mary.

1018
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Please, just... leave now.

1019
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,600
Baba.

1020
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,500
l love you, baba. Like my own son.

1021
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,300
No! No!

1022
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,000
Stop it, abba!

1023
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,200
Let him go!

1024
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:58,800
Stop it, abba!

1025
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,300
Bastard.

1026
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,000
Get him out of my
sight before l kill him.

1027
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:12,900
No.

1028
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,300
What did you say?

1029
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,700
He will not go.

1030
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,500
No!

1031
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,800
Once before you sent him
away and l didn't want him to go.

1032
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,400
Love is not just born, it's made.

1033
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,500
He is my child!

1034
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,500
lf he goes, l'll go.

1035
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,500
Despite the revelation
of the midnight swap...

1036
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:50,900
...never once did l have any desire
to search for the Englishman, Methwold

1037
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,800
And never once, to my knowledge...

1038
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:57,600
...did Ammi and Abba set out to
look for the true son of their blood.

1039
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,700
l like to think,
that in spite of all the heartache...

1040
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,200
...my parents loved me.

1041
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,800
Parvati?

1042
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,700
Saleem?

1043
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,200
Where were you? - l know who l am now.

1044
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,700
l'm not my ammi's son.

1045
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,200
What do you mean?

1046
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,800
Then her child is...

1047
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,400
Saleem, he'll kill you.

1048
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,900
You stole his life.

1049
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,200
lt's not your fault.
- He must never know.

1050
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,800
Excuse me.

1051
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,800
Abba...

1052
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,500
...what are we doing here?

1053
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,200
Abba, why have you brought me here?

1054
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,300
come with me, Saleem.

1055
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,300
No, l'm not coming.

1056
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,200
- Saleem...
- l'm not coming.

1057
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,600
No! Why am l here?

1058
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,900
Look, can't we just talk
about this like grown-ups?

1059
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,400
They mustn't touch my nose, okay.
Do you understand?

1060
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,600
- Sit down!
- No, no, no.

1061
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,400
Take him away.

1062
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,900
You understand,
Abba, they mustn't touch my...

1063
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,900
You hear that? You are not to touch my
nose!

1064
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,600
Abba! Abba!

1065
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,700
Listen to me. Don't.

1066
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,900
You don't know what you are doing.

1067
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,400
You can't!
Look, look, you cannot touch my nose.

1068
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,400
- lt's okay.
- Please, don't! You don't know!

1069
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,300
Just be a good fellow
and count to ten.

1070
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:05,800
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six...

1071
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:11,000
Five. Four. Three. Two.

1072
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,900
One. That's it.

1073
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,600
Saleem?

1074
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,700
Are you there?

1075
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,600
All of you?

1076
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,300
Parvati?

1077
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,400
Parvati? Where are you?

1078
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,800
lt's me.

1079
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,700
They've all gone.
l can't call them anymore.

1080
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,300
Who's gone? Who's Parvati?

1081
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,400
Everybody.

1082
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,300
Saleem. Just relax.

1083
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,400
Jamila?

1084
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,000
- Hey, put that back!
- No, no, Jamila.

1085
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,800
l can smell.

1086
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,400
Through that, you can smell?

1087
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,300
Yes, l can smell everything.

1088
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,800
What can you smell?

1089
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,600
l can smell yourjasmine.

1090
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,300
l can smell traffic on the street.

1091
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,900
l can smell medicine.

1092
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:52,700
l can smell other things, like...

1093
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,300
...Love.

1094
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,600
Jamila...

1095
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,000
l can smell love.

1096
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,900
Saleem...

1097
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,800
There's going to be a big war,
you know.

1098
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,700
Yeah? So?

1099
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,500
Yeah so!

1100
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,400
So which side are we on?

1101
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,800
l know which side l'm on.

1102
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:16,700
You're the one who's confused
-- with your Bombay this, Bombay that.

1103
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,700
- l'm not confused.
- Aren't you?

1104
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,200
Maybe.

1105
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,600
War draws closer every minute.

1106
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,900
The lndian enemy rises in strength.

1107
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,200
But we too are strong...

1108
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,900
...and beti,
your voice will make us stronger.

1109
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,800
lt will inspire our
soldiers to victory!

1110
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,900
crazed by the war fought by both the
countries to which l had belonged...

1111
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,900
...l rode the night
streets of Karachi...

1112
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,800
Stop!

1113
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:05,700
Final warning!

1114
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,300
...looking for death.

1115
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,200
What are you doing!
Bring him! Bring him! Bring him!

1116
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,800
Because of me you see!
Because of my crime.

1117
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,300
What crime?

1118
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,300
lt's nothing, yaar.
The poor man is cracked.

1119
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,500
The bombs are looking for me..
- Take it easy, okay.

1120
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,900
And don't ride that thing anymore.

1121
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:56,600
Everything is tickety-boo.

1122
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:40,100
Most of my family died in that war.

1123
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,100
l, orphaned, survived.

1124
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:48,200
For six years, l slept,
brained by a silver spittoon.

1125
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,900
Wiped clean, remembering nothing.

1126
01:33:56,900 --> 01:34:02,000
After six years, l awoke,
and was shipped off to another war.

1127
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,200
Torch, please.

1128
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,300
This time, a civil war.

1129
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,200
Awake, are we?

1130
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,800
Right on time to get
shipped off to East Pakistan.

1131
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:15,500
Pakistan's East Wing fighting for
its independence against the West.

1132
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,300
Shahid.

1133
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,100
Shahid.

1134
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,900
No memory

1135
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,500
Refuses to talk.
All he's good for is sniffing, yaar.

1136
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
--He gives me the creeps, yaar.
--creeps?

1137
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,200
Hear that? Empty.

1138
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,300
Nobody's home.

1139
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,300
Asshole.

1140
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:15,400
ln three short weeks,
Pakistan had lost half its navy

1141
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,100
a third of its army, and a
quarter of its air force.

1142
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,000
By the time l tumbled into the war,
it was all over.

1143
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,900
EAST PAKlSTAN 1971

1144
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,300
General.

1145
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,800
Good. That's that.

1146
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,800
l'm sorry for your
loss in the battle, Zulfi.

1147
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,500
Thank you, sir.

1148
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,200
Shiva.

1149
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,400
Our most decorated officer.
He fought quite a battle

1150
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,900
Good show, major.

1151
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,900
Zulfi.

1152
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:01,000
When General Zulfikar
surrendered to his old friend,

1153
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:02,900
General Aurora of lndia...

1154
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,400
...Pakistan also lost more
than half its population...

1155
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,300
...who became citizens
of Bangladesh.

1156
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:14,300
ln those days, all our
wars were fights between friends.

1157
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,200
Magicians had been brought from
lndia to entertain the crowds...

1158
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,500
...and that day,
everyone believed in magic.

1159
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,300
DAccA, BANGLADESH 1971

1160
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,500
Parvati.

1161
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,100
Parvati.

1162
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,200
Parvati the witch! Parvati!

1163
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,600
Parvati! Parvati the witch!

1164
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Parvati!

1165
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,500
Saleem?

1166
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,000
Saleem?

1167
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,000
Saleem! That's it!

1168
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,100
And l thought l was
dreaming the whole thing.

1169
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,300
come!

1170
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,300
come up.

1171
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,500
Abracadabra.

1172
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,300
Abracadabra.

1173
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,800
Abracadabra.

1174
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:58,600
Hey, you there! Hurry up, they're
boarding the plane.

1175
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,000
Sir.

1176
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,100
What's in this?

1177
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,500
Don't disturb her.
lt's a personal snake.

1178
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,300
And this one?

1179
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,100
lt's empty, sir. Take a look.

1180
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,400
Very good.

1181
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,500
Gather your belongings and board the
aircraft.

1182
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:22,400
ls it okay?

1183
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:42,500
And so it came to pass that without
passport or permit...

1184
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,100
...l returned in Parvati's basket of
invisibility to lndia.

1185
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:52,500
My lndia. The land of my birth.

1186
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:56,900
DELHl, lNDlA 1972

1187
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,800
Abracadabra. Abracadabra.
Abracadabra.

1188
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:51,400
Yes.

1189
01:43:58,800 --> 01:43:59,800
Bye, Saleem.

1190
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:00,200
Bye.

1191
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:01,400
''Picture Singh...''

1192
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:05,100
''...the Most charming
Man in the World...''

1193
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,600
''charm your friends with
that Eastman Kodak.'' That's me.

1194
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,300
captain.

1195
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,900
Parvati is a good girl.

1196
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,300
Very sensible girl.

1197
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,800
But she's an orphan.

1198
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,800
She's your good friend.

1199
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,200
How to take care of her?

1200
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,200
Any idea?

1201
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,100
Picture-ji...

1202
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,200
Do you want tea?

1203
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,800
Tea.

1204
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:47,800
Then go make some.

1205
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,300
Okay.

1206
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,800
No.

1207
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,900
No.

1208
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,200
Karan, don't.

1209
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,100
Abracadabra.

1210
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:35,100
Finally, l have someone
who knows my magic is real.

1211
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,200
Why don't you tell the others?

1212
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,200
Have you ever met...

1213
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:45,000
...magicians who
believe in real magic?

1214
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,300
They don't want witches around here.

1215
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,000
Not even Picture Singh?

1216
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,000
Not even Picture Singh.

1217
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,800
Midnight's children.

1218
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:28,800
You and me. That's something else.

1219
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,500
Parvati.

1220
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,600
--Parvati, please talk to me.
--No, you talk to me, Saleem!

1221
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,200
lt... it changes.

1222
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:26,800
l'm sorry.

1223
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,300
Are you too grand for me?

1224
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,300
Remember l know a secret about you.

1225
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,300
You haven't told anyone.

1226
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:40,800
l could have.

1227
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,200
l met the other one.

1228
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,400
The other one?

1229
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
The one you're scared of.

1230
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:51,300
He was there at the victory parade.
The biggest hero of the whole war.

1231
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,500
Your old buddy.

1232
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,100
--You met him?
--Yes.

1233
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,100
And you told him.

1234
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,300
No.

1235
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,100
But maybe l should send for him.

1236
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:08,400
Send for him?

1237
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,900
And you think he'll come to you?

1238
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,600
To hell with you!

1239
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,000
No further, Picture-ji.

1240
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:08,400
come to me. Abracadabra.

1241
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,500
come to me.

1242
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,700
NUcLEAR TEST, lNDlA 1974

1243
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:44,100
certain ironies must
not pass unnoticed,

1244
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:47,100
for had not Shiva risen as l fell?

1245
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:50,200
Which of us became a slum-dweller,

1246
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,100
and who was the hero; the most
powerful of Midnight's children?

1247
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:58,100
There's nothing like war...

1248
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,900
...for the reinvention of lives.

1249
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:07,900
Who are you, hmm? Woman?

1250
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,200
l'm the witch.

1251
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,800
Mmhm.

1252
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,900
Another Midnight's child.

1253
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,600
You.

1254
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,900
l have nothing to say to you.

1255
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,100
l'm leaving.

1256
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,700
come back to me.

1257
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:51,800
Hey!

1258
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,700
Saleem.

1259
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,800
Woof woof.

1260
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:09,800
How much is that
doggie in the window?.

1261
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:14,400
l do hope that doggie's for sale

1262
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,100
l had many families and no family.

1263
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,800
There were the parents
l never knew who gave me life.

1264
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,600
And the parents who raised me,
whom l lost.

1265
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:55,600
And Midnight's children,
who were taken from me for a time.

1266
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,100
l wandered among them all,
and at last l was ready.

1267
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:35,000
l called him because
l was angry with you.

1268
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:36,700
l know.

1269
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:43,200
He left his child with me.

1270
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:48,300
Parvati. Maybe it's not his child.

1271
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,900
What do you mean?

1272
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,900
When we get married,
it will be ours.

1273
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:56,800
What?

1274
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,200
When we get married, it'll be ours.

1275
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,200
Your face.

1276
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,900
What about my face now?.

1277
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,500
Nothing...

1278
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,200
Parvati, it's so beautiful.

1279
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:12,700
June 12, 1975, will be
remembered as a historic date.

1280
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,800
At 2:15 this afternoon

1281
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,000
the Prime Minister was found
guilty of electoral malpractice.

1282
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,500
From a specially built podium, Mrs.
Gandhi told

1283
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,000
the crowd that she was a victim...

1284
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,200
''Emergency.''

1285
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:28,900
The word ''Emergency''
was heard for the first time.

1286
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,200
Saleem!

1287
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,500
The censorship of the press,
arrest of subversive elements...

1288
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,400
...and forced sterilization.

1289
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:45,300
Some things were ending,
something was being born.

1290
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,700
Saleem!

1291
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:49,300
lt's a baby boy!

1292
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:05,800
Look at your ears, they're so big!

1293
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,900
Who knows what things you'll hear?

1294
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:12,000
Aadam.

1295
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,700
Aadam Sinai.

1296
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,600
Anything you want...

1297
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:20,400
...to be, you can be...

1298
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,500
You can be...

1299
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:27,000
...just whatever you want.

1300
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,800
With the declaration
of the ''Emergency,''

1301
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:05,900
and the birth of a new,
unfree lndia, a dark night fell.

1302
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,900
A continuous midnight
that would last...

1303
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,700
...for years.

1304
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:19,800
What's happening?
Where is the daylight?

1305
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:24,000
A curse has come upon us.

1306
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,600
l have never seen such a thing.

1307
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,600
No doubt about it, Madam.

1308
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,400
Your horoscope clearly states that
you are one with the Motherland.

1309
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,500
lndia is the Prime Minister,

1310
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,700
Prime Minister is lndia.

1311
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:50,800
And we started to think
of her as ''Devi''

1312
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:53,500
''The Mother Goddess.''

1313
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:57,900
Those who would be gods
fear all other potential deities.

1314
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,100
And that's why she hated us.

1315
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,800
The magical children of midnight.

1316
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,400
lt is astrologically proven...

1317
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,800
...a threat to the nation, Madam...

1318
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:21,500
...is a threat to
the Prime Minister also.

1319
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,400
Saleem?
- Huh?

1320
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:35,500
Saleem?
- Huh?

1321
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:36,900
Did you hear that?

1322
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:47,800
A civic beautification has
been authorized in this sector.

1323
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:51,900
This slum contains subversive
elements, it's an eyesore...

1324
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:53,600
...and a public scandal.

1325
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,500
All persons must vacate immediately!

1326
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,800
Why are you doing this?

1327
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,500
Parvati! Parvati! Aadam!

1328
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,800
Go save them!

1329
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,000
Parvati!

1330
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:37,100
Shiva!

1331
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:38,500
Rich kid.

1332
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:42,700
Parvati!

1333
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:49,700
Shiva! Shiva, stop!

1334
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:51,700
Now tell me where
the other children are.

1335
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:53,900
Parvati!

1336
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:54,900
Where are they?
- Little Aadam!

1337
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:56,500
He's your son!

1338
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:25,100
Abracadabra.

1339
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,600
The ''Emergency''...

1340
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:00,600
...was necessary and justified.

1341
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:05,900
Democracy was under threat.
lt had to be protected.

1342
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,900
We think you're very dangerous.

1343
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,700
Or what you might be capable of,
potentially.

1344
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,500
What you're plotting to do.

1345
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,500
Or might be plotting
at a future date.

1346
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,900
We're going to nip you in the bud.

1347
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:25,800
cut you off at the source.

1348
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,400
Prevention is better than cure.

1349
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,400
This is an ''Emergency.''

1350
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:31,900
Your gang of freaks?

1351
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:35,800
lt will have to be
smashed... With your help.

1352
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,400
Of course.

1353
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:41,100
Names. Addresses.

1354
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,000
Physical descriptions.

1355
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:48,500
Nature of peculiar capabilities.
All of it.

1356
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:51,500
Thank you in advance.

1357
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,400
Thank you very much.

1358
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:58,600
No. Never.

1359
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:09,600
That wasn't too bad, was it?

1360
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:10,800
Not so bad at all.

1361
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,000
Shiva...

1362
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:16,600
...he's really me.

1363
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:21,000
You two, out.

1364
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:23,600
Now!

1365
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:34,100
What the hell are you talking about?

1366
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:35,700
Hm?

1367
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,100
Two babies.

1368
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,800
Born together.

1369
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:47,400
Same place, same time.

1370
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:48,900
And?

1371
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:55,400
Swapped, see? Swapped.

1372
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,900
Speak up.

1373
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
l stole your life.

1374
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:22,400
Rich boy.

1375
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,900
Bastard.

1376
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:30,400
Saleem and Shiva. Shiva and Saleem.

1377
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:04,900
Shiva. No! Stop!

1378
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,600
Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

1379
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:35,800
Forgive me.

1380
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:40,700
l'm sorry to inform you
that we're obliged to operate.

1381
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,600
Operate? What, what... what operation?

1382
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:44,800
''Sperectomy.''

1383
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,100
l'm going to take your life away...

1384
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,700
...bit by bit, like you took mine.

1385
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:05,400
No! Don't! No, stop! Stop!

1386
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:08,600
Don't do this! Don't do this!

1387
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,400
Stop... Stop. Stop.

1388
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:17,700
Take the pyjama off.

1389
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,000
The ''Emergency,'' everyone called it...

1390
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:22,300
...but it was really a betrayal.

1391
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:23,800
Her betrayal...

1392
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,700
...of her father's dreams.

1393
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:30,900
Who were we? We were
the promises of independence.

1394
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:44,400
And like all promises,
made to be broken.

1395
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,600
Vasectomy.

1396
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,500
ln a stunning upset,

1397
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,000
the Prime Minister
lndira Gandhi has been...

1398
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,800
...unceremoniously
flung out of office.

1399
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,900
Sure of a triumph,
she called an election,

1400
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
only to have it backfire on her.

1401
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,800
The Emergency is over.

1402
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:31,500
Four hundred and twenty of us stood,
blinking in the sunlight.

1403
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:37,000
And then dispersed into
the healing privacy of the crowds.

1404
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,700
And what of Shiva?

1405
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,800
Shiva, who was now a wanted man.

1406
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:32,700
Parvati...?

1407
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:38,500
Unfortunately, she...

1408
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:47,600
But captain... you have a son.

1409
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,700
come. come with me.

1410
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:31,800
come.

1411
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:46,000
She didn't even use
her magic to save her life.

1412
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,700
You see, Picture-ji, Parvati gave
up all of that before he was born.

1413
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,500
She didn't give it up.

1414
02:10:56,700 --> 02:11:00,100
l found Aadam in her
basket of invisibility.

1415
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:03,500
The soldiers looked
inside and shouted...

1416
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:05,400
lt's empty! lt's empty!

1417
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:07,600
l heard them with my own ears.

1418
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,100
But you saw him?

1419
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:14,200
l believed in her magic.

1420
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:18,500
Always knew it was not a trick.

1421
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:30,900
He's a fine child, child of dignity.

1422
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:36,000
No matter he doesn't
speak but he will,

1423
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:41,000
when he has something to say.

1424
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:55,400
This chutney!
What's this? Where's it from?

1425
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:05,700
Here, sir.

1426
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:12,600
Oh! One from famous
Braganza Pickles of Bombay.

1427
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,500
Picture-ji, we must go to Bombay.

1428
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:20,800
Just now?.

1429
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,100
Now.

1430
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:30,300
Parvati was gone.

1431
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:34,500
But in the five-syllable
monotony of the wheels,

1432
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:36,500
l heard her magic spell.

1433
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:39,800
''Abracadabra,
abracadabra, abracadabra,''...

1434
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,400
...sang the wheels,
as they bore us back to Bombay.

1435
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:02,400
ls Mrs Braganza here?

1436
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:05,500
Yes, but you can't meet with her.
Where are you going?

1437
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Hello?

1438
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:23,000
Who is it?

1439
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:35,000
Saleem.

1440
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,600
Oh...

1441
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:53,700
You've become so thin.
Let me kiss you.

1442
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:06,400
Mary, this is my son, Aadam.

1443
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,400
And Aadam...

1444
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:29,600
come here.

1445
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:34,400
come, Little Baba.

1446
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:17,600
Blow. Blow.

1447
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:33,500
Happy birthday.

1448
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:35,700
Bless you.

1449
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:43,600
Abba...

1450
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,800
He spoke!

1451
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:47,700
He's speaking.

1452
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:49,700
Abba...

1453
02:15:49,900 --> 02:15:51,500
My God.

1454
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:54,500
He's calling me ''father''.

1455
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:57,400
Speak son, speak.

1456
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,800
...abracadabra.

1457
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:05,100
What did you say?

1458
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,400
Abracadabra.

1459
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,600
Another magic child.

1460
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:19,700
So. A new generation...
but more careful.

1461
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:22,400
Tougher.

1462
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:35,500
A child and a country were
born at midnight, once upon a time.

1463
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,900
Great things were
expected of us both.

1464
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,400
The truth has been less
glorious than the dream.

1465
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:47,700
But we have survived
and made our way.

1466
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:51,500
And our lives have been,
in spite of everything,

1467
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,200
acts of love.
