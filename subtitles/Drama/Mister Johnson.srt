00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,968
Bamu! Bamu!

2
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:55,306
Hey! Hey, Bamu!

3
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,143
Bamu, it's me, Johnson.

4
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:01,187
Bamu, Johnson come.

5
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:10,363
By God, Bamu, you're a pretty girl.

6
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:12,657
Beautiful.

7
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,868
I think you have
the most beautiful breasts.

8
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,999
Beautiful breasts.
God bless you for them.

9
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:26,212
I beg how much.
Now go leave me alone.

10
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:27,964
Ah, Bamu.

11
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,508
I'm a rich man, Bamu. Rich.

12
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:36,306
Aye. I never seen
such a beautiful girl.

13
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,438
I could teach you
to be a civilized lady...

14
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,523
and you could do no work at all.

15
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:47,984

32
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,530
Good morning, sir.

33
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:57,340
Mr. Johnson, I want my money.

34
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,050
We want that money.

35
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,349
I will pay you soon.
Health to you.

36
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,476
Good health. Good health.

37
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,398
Hey! Make them stop.

38
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,942
You no go inside. Go away!

39
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,156
Johnson?

40
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,660
Good morning, sir.
God preserve you.

41
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,453
Johnson, why are you so bloody late?

42
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,749
S-Sir, the clock is fast.

43
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,710
The clock is stopped, Johnson.

44
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,421
Ah, but it was fast
when it stopped, sir.

45
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,426
Get me that PWD circular
that came in from Lagos, will you, Johnson?

46
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,511
Yes, sir. Ten seconds, sir.

47
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,848
Uh —

48
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,520
The point is, Waziri,
you just can't do it.

49
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,064
- Why not, lord?
- Because it's —

50
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,525
It's barbaric.

51
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,319
Oh, but i-it's been done for centuries.

52
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,948
Damn it, Waziri,
I am not having women flogged.

53
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,577
There's been a directive
from the governor.

54
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,787
- But they are prostitutes.
- I don't care what they are.

55
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,622
No flogging.

56
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:16,502
What shall we do to them, Lord Rudbeck?

57
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,589
W-Well, put them in prison.

58
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,382
Prison?

59
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:25,303
That's abominable cruelty.
They would die of shame.

60
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,389
Well, we can't flog them.

61
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,475
So we'll just have to think
of something else then.

62
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,186
Well.

63
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,022
Left, right, left, right, left.

64
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,817
Saleh, my pet.

65
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,337
This is the file on elephant poachers.

66
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:09,222
And why in the name of God is it full
of correspondence about tobacco?

67
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,140
Um —

68
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,558
Uh —

69
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:17,188
You say tobacco
look like elephant dropping.

70
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:23,194
This is the local exports file.

71
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,196
Yes, sir.

72
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,533
Johnson.

73
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,036
What on earth has Sergeant Gollup's cow
got to do with local exports?

74
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,621
Mmm —

75
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,624
I think the hide, sir.

76
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,293
But the bloody cow isn't dead.

77
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,463
But I think it going to die soon.

78
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,450
"Thy wife shall be as fruitful...

79
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,287
as the vine upon the walls
of thy house.

80
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,124
Lo, thus shall a man be blessed."

81
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,254
And wilt thou, Mr. Johnson...

82
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:09,884
take this woman, Bamu,
to be thy lawfully wedded wife?

83
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,303
Oh, yes. I certainly do.

84
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:17,934
And wilt thou, Bamu,
take this man, Mr. Johnson...

85
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,852
to be thy wedded husband?

86
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,988
Uh, I now pronounce you man and wife.

87
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,827
What do you go after then, Gollup? Pig?

88
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,537
Oh, no, sir. No.

89
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:42,375
No, there, uh, there aren't no pig
round here. Not now, sir.

90
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,753
Fair bit of guinea fowl though.
Oh, yes.

91
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,547
- Any leopard?
- There's a big one, sir.

92
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,800
So they tell me.
Up the Bauchi Road.

93
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,470
Uh, got himself a couple nigs —
natives, sir.

94
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,555
Uh, only last week.

95
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,683
I might have a go at him.

96
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:03,229
I'd go with you, if I didn't have to go
on this damn tour up to Maiduguri.

97
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,897
Perhaps in a few months, eh?

98
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,941
Oh, right you are, sir.
Not half. Oh, yes, yes.

99
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,943
All right.

100
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:12,530
Another one of Johnson's bloody parties.
Big one too.

101
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,825
- Oh.
- Probably going to go on all night.

102
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:24,417
- Go wear your English lady dress now.
- It no good.

103
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,255
I will make you the seat.

104
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,760
But why not?
Now, the right thing to do —

105
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,986
Waziri salutes Johnson, clerk of Fada.

106
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,030
I salute Waziri.

107
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,698
God grant you long life.

108
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,590
So... a beautiful wife.

109
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,258
A grand party.

110
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,720
Expensive.

111
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,931
But you are an important man,
clerk Johnson.

112
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:24,518
I hear the new judge, Rudbeck,
is your friend.

113
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,021
- Quite true, Waziri.
- Hmm.

114
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:31,484
That you know everything
that happens in the office.

115
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,069
Also true, Waziri.

116
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:36,155
In the government, we know all orders.

117
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,782
Mmm.

118
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:42,036
Mr. Bauli,
who used to be clerk before you...

119
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,121
he was a good friend of mine.

120
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,706
So I have heard.

121
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,209
And you give him 10 shillings a month.

122
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,629
Ah, much more, clerk Johnson.
More than that.

123
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,757
And he showed you
all the government letters.

124
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,386
Mmm, sometimes if a letter came...

125
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,930
about the-the emir...

126
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,724
or the new taxes...

127
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:07,061
I read it even before the judge did.

128
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,648
You say to me,
"You belong for the king.

129
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,526
You tell me all the king's thoughts.

130
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,986
I give you plenty money."

131
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,364
It is the custom.

132
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,658
You think I be thief, Waziri?

133
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,245

Bamu, why you no wake me?

145
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,202
Good-bye, Harry.
See you in a few months.

146
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,454
Good-bye, sir.
Oh, and, uh —

147
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,248
Oh.

148
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,672
Now, remember what I said.
Keep an eye on the emir.

149
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,843
- And that cunning old Waziri.
- Will do, sir.

150
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,845
Oh, that clerk of yours, uh —

151
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,306
- Uh, Johnson.
- Johnson. Don't trust him.

152
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,559
Keep an eye on the whole bloody lot of 'em!

153
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,486
I work for Lord Rudbeck.

154
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,699
Go! Go away!

155
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,838
Go away! Away!
I'll go pay you tomorrow!

156
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:44,093
Tomorrow!

157
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,974
What in God's name is going on here?

158
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,729
This one owes us money.

159
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,901
- To all these people?
- And many more, lord.

160
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,572
What do you have to say, Johnson?

161
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,449
These ignorant, savage people.

162
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,578
They — They no understand that —

163
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,917
Ah, sir. Excuse me one moment, sir.

164
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,175
I think you wait for this, sir.

165
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,846
Yes, by God, at last.

166
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,056
Lord Rudbeck, sir. Our case.

167
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,101
Yes, a-another time, I'm afraid.
I have things to do.

168
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,978
Away, you undereducated dogs!

169
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,856
Away! Away!

170
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:42,401
Go. Can't you see
Lord Rudbeck is thinking?

171
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,945
Away. Make they go.

172
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,948
Excuse, sir.

173
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:51,744
Maybe you could advance me
one small small portion of next pay.

174
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,788
Sorry, Johnson, you know the rules.
You'll just have to be more prudent.

175
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,458
Oh, I will, sir.
But I just got married, sir.

176
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,460
Look, Johnson,
you know what'll happen.

177
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,171
Next month, there'll be another advance
and so on.

178
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,964
Sorry. Bad idea.

179
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,300
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

180
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,068
Oh, you big, bloody fool, Johnson.

181
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,479
Johnson, why you so bloody late?

182
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,399
Eh? Ah, go away.

183
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,461
Sir.

184
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,589
- You know what this is, Johnson?
- No, sir.

185
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,340
A prismatic compass.

186
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,802
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Oh, yes, sir.

187
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,096
It'll make one fine road.

188
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,183
Yeah. Great thing, a road, Johnson.

189
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,518
Great thing.

190
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,229
When you've made a road,
you know you've done something.

191
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,648
You've — You've —

192
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,275
Well, you can see it.

193
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,569
You can see
that it's all been worth something.

194
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,280
Yes, sir.
I agree for your beautiful road.

195
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,948
Yeah.

196
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,367
It's not going far, I'm afraid.

197
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,203
No bloody money.

198
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,455
Maybe we think of something, sir.

199
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,459
A big road bring in plenty trade.

200
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,046
That's it, Johnson. Precisely.

201
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,383
Yes. Not much hope for that,
I'm afraid.

202
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:57,304
You can do it, sir.
Join the big north road.

203
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,473
The mighty road to Kano.

204
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,226
The great north road?

205
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,979
That's a hundred miles, Mr. Johnson.

206
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,065
Fourteen rivers in the way.

207
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,820
Now kindly return
to the paperwork department.

208
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,823
Oh, yes, sir. I bring you this.

209
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,327
Oh, yes.
That's very thoughtful of you, Johnson.

210
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,412
Very thoughtful of you. Thank you.

211
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,463
My friend, Lord Rudbeck and me...

212
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,924
we are going to build a mighty road.

213
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,676
100 miles.

214
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. Johnson.

215
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,389
Only 100 miles?

216
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,182
That should be easy.

217
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,809
More beer, Ajali.

218
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,645
- And your bill. What of that?
- "What of that?"

219
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,857
More beer!

220
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,608
You silly sod!

221
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,694
I told you, didn't I?
I told you!

222
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,156
You've been drinking my gin!

223
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,242
This bloody bottle was full!
Bloody women!

224
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,077
A man should beat his woman.

225
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,912
Bloody Hausa women!

226
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,248
Do you beat your wife, Mr. Johnson?

227
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,750
In England, we do not beat our wives.

228
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,002
- Huh.
- Hmph!

229
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,378
I told you!

230
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,548
♪ She round like the world,
smooth like the water ♪

231
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,843
♪ Shine like the sky,
sweet like the corn ♪

232
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,846
♪ Smell like the new grass ♪♪

233
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,559
Bamu?

234
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,404
Baba Brimah, where is Bamu?

235
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,658
But now my wife.

236
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,834
I done tell you.
I go pay at the end of the month.

237
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,601
Bad bad fool, Johnson. Tsk.

238
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,963
Waziri. You fit with me
to see the Waziri?

239
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,665
I hear your wife
gone back to her parents.

240
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,501
Oh, no, Waziri.
She has gone to see a friend.

241
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,128
I beg her to go.

242
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,213
Of course.

243
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,050
And Brimah — you owe him money.

244
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,344
And many others.

245
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,472
What can I do?
I haven't got a penny.

246
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,269
I could lend you money
to pay these low rascals.

247
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,481
Oh, Waziri.
I should thank you 10,000 times.

248
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,153
Fetch me the aloe,
Saleh my sweet one.

249
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,530
Can't you see I'm busy?

250
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,839
Ah, ah. I must sign.

251
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,549
Of course.

252
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,260
The money is going to come
from the native treasury.

253
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,928
But that is forbidden.

254
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,766
- Will Judge Rudbeck see this?
- Who knows?

255
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,143
We are all in the hands of God.

256
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,732
Perhaps, instead...

257
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,610
there is a small service
you could perform.

258
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,919
"In my view, the Waziri is
the only intelligent member of the council."

259
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,675
"As you know,
he is fluent in English.

260
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,802
But regrettably...

261
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,346
in both this language
and his native Hausa...

262
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,850
he never stops plotting
and is a skillful liar.

263
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,436
- Oh.
- You cannot trust a word he says."

264
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,854
Oh! Terrible!

265
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,482
Terrible!
Oh, terrible, terrible.

266
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,864
Does the judge really say that?

267
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,200
It gets worse.

268
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:37,495
"I suspect that he shares
the emir's distaste for British advisers."

269
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,081
- Do I read more?
- No, no, no, no.

270
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,375
If the emir should hear this —

271
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,961
You will get another flogging, old man.

272
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,963
That will kill me.

273
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:50,300
Last time you had to lie on your face
for seven days.

274
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,054
So my debts will be paid?

275
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,889
Y-Yes, of course.

276
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,308
Oh, thank you, Mr. Johnson.

277
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,418
Johnson.

278
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,505
Suli tells me he's got no money
to pay the men.

279
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,674
How much do we have left?

280
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,259
Fourpence, sir.

281
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,095
Fourpence?

282
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,097
Bloody fourpence?

283
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,182
Why in God's name didn't you tell me?

284
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,018
But you said to tell you
when all finished, sir.

285
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,937
Oh, for God's sake, Mr. Johnson.

286
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,856
I wouldn't have sent a hundred men out
on a clearing job.

287
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,068
That's about five pounds a day.

288
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,697
Fourpence.

289
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,408
Oh, well, that's it then.

290
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,120
Bloody bureaucracy.

291
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:05,208
Suli, tell the men
to pack up and go home.

292
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,211
Oh, no, sir. No, sir.

293
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,464
- I think you build the road.
- What?

294
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,050
You take 'em
from one of the other votes.

295
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,637
"Take 'em"? Take what?

296
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:20,056
The money, sir. Look.

297
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,434
Plenty money for uniforms.

298
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,352
You write voucher for this...

299
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,521
but spend it on the road.

300
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,897
Yes?

301
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,861
Here, sir.
The grant for the new native court.

302
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,446
What about it?

303
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,282
You just paint the old one.
Use the money.

304
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,034
Government never know.

305
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,413
Here, sir.

306
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,082
There's 3,000 pounds left
in the treasury budget.

307
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,585
- That's not road money though.
- No, sir.

308
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,172
But you use it now, and next year
when the new money come...

309
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,758
you write all the road vouchers...

310
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,094
but the road already finish.

311
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,810
Suli, get 'em working.

312
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,454
Suli, through there.

313
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,890
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

314
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,893
Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Johnson.

315
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,065
Here.

316
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,192
Have a piece of plum pudding.

317
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,071
Delicious.

318
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,407
Thank you, sir.

319
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,287
My mother sent it from Hertfordshire.

320
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:10,375
That Hertfordshire, one of the most
beautiful village back home.

321
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,367
Oh, darling. Ah.

322
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,329
How are you? Mmm.
How was the trip?

323
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,623
Well, you know.
A bit tiring.

324
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,750
Huh?

325
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:38,338
Harry, I expected to see you
at the station. In Jos.

326
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:41,174
Uh, I have to build this road, you know.

327
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,592
Before it rains.

328
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,263
Oh. I thought we'd be in a town.

329
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,725
Well, we will be, darling.
We're just here for a short while.

330
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,353
We will be.

331
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:57,607
- Darling, uh, this is Mr. Johnson.
- Oh.

332
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,736
My heart is big with happiness, ma'am.

333
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,656
All these people agree for you...

334
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,407
too much.

335
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,992
Thank you.

336
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,037
How charming.

337
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,549
Johnson made this house for you.
Otherwise, we'd be under canvas.

338
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,554
It's-It's wonderful.

339
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,222
Ah. Rather.

340
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,559
And what's in here?

341
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,644
That, ma'am, your latrine.

342
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,147
Your own lady latrine.

343
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:41,401
Oh, I see.
A kind of drawing room.

344
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,653
- Hmm.
- Yes, ma'am.

345
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,238
Latrine, ma'am.

346
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,953
See, ma'am, with cover...

347
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,497
you no catch foot in hole
in the dark.

348
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,250
I see. Wonderful.

349
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,003
And I scrub your seat smooth...

350
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,714
so you no scratch your leg
at the back.

351
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:06,801
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
I think it's a beautiful arrangement.

352
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:14,934
Bamu, that Mrs. Rudbeck
is a beautiful woman.

353
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,604
Her cheeks are as white as ivory.

354
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,981
And her breasts —
Hey, my God!

355
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:25,028
Wait you see her breasts.
It big like pumpkin, the two of them.

356
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,238
The king of England,
he say wanted to marry her...

357
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,865
but she refused.

358
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:32,512
Madam, this is
our most wonderful butcher.

359
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:18,391
Settling in?
I mean, really?

360
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,227
Yes, I'm loving it, darling.

361
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,812
I want to enjoy Africa.

362
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,397
Very good.

363
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,484
- Johnson looking after you all right?
- Couldn't be sweeter.

364
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,528
He's a perfect host.

365
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,495
Harry, what is this?

366
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,915
This is peanut soup.
Don't you like it?

367
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,461
Well, it's just peanuts in hot water.

368
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:48,212
Yes, I suppose it is.

369
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:09,108
Perhaps you could clean your teeth tonight
having taken the pipe out of your mouth.

370
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,569
That would be a change.

371
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,697
- I'm sorry, Celia.
- Sorry about what?

372
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,575
I'm sorry about all of this.

373
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,202
Are you?

374
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,579
You don't do anything about it.

375
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,623
"Do"?
Well, what can I do?

376
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,042
I'm in bloody West Africa
in the bloody bush.

377
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,128
- This isn't Mayfair, you know.
- You don't have to tell me that.

378
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,214
What about that horrible peanut soup?

379
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,382
Peanut soup!

380
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:37,553
Any idiot can make vegetable soup,
even in bloody West Africa!

381
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,889
Why don't you tell Jamesu
what you want to eat?

382
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,767
- He's not a chef at the Ritz.
- Oh, right!

383
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,729
Damn it.

384
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,650
You can go back home
if you think you've made a mistake.

385
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,985
- What mistake?
- Marrying me.

386
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,737
I know you think I'm a clod...

387
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,989
because I read Edgar Wallace
instead of Jane Austen...

388
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:01,244
and I can't tell "God Save the King"
from the-the marriage of bloody Figaro.

389
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:25,017
- Oh, Ce, damn it.
- Harry.

390
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,644
- Oh, darling.
- Harry.

391
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,396
Please let me come in there.

392
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,565
- Darling, I love you.
- Oh, Harry.

393
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,067
I'm a beast, and you're working so hard.

394
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,200
Oh, damn — Blast!

395
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,661
- Harry, be careful!
- Oh, bloody sheet!

396
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,663
- You're on the wrong side of it.
- Oh!

397
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,456
Oh, tear it, Harry! Tear it!

398
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,875
Oh!

399
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,924
Oh, Harry, oh!

400
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,321
Shoulder... arms!

401
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:24,368
General salute.
Present... arms!

402
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,664
Shoulder... arms!

403
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,085
Mr. Tring.

404
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:36,505
Sir, I thought you not coming
till next month.

405
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,090
Are you clerk Johnson?

406
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,009
- Yes, sir.
- You're late.

407
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,429
Uh, sir, but the clock is fast.

408
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,765
That clock has stopped.

409
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,353
Where is Mr. Rudbeck?

410
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,104
At the roadhead, sir.

411
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:55,107
- For how long?
- One more week, I think.

412
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:58,361
And you are in charge of the office
in his absence.

413
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,071
Yes, sir.

414
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:02,114
So...

415
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,533
this is all your work.

416
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,954
Oh, yes, sir.
I myself keep all the accounts.

417
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,623
There seem to be
quite a few anomalies.

418
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,793
Oh, yes, sir.

419
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:19,131
The actual budget for the road
was used up last September.

420
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,635
So how are all these payments made?

421
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,929
Uh, from the annual budget, sir.

422
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:28,182
You mean you just took
the cash you needed?

423
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,352
Oh, yes, sir.
Every penny went on the road.

424
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,771
And you falsified the cashbook?

425
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,523
Oh, sir.

426
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:39,026
When the new money come,
we replace all we took before.

427
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,070
Oh, I see.

428
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:43,948
You understand, Mr. Johnson...

429
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,076
you have committed embezzlement
and forgery.

430
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,594
Oh, wonderful.
Nothing like a woman's touch.

431
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:08,597
- Settling in, Celia?
- Oh, yes. Soon I'll be an old Africa hand.

432
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,017
Ah, not for quite a while.

433
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:14,645
- Jamesu, make more —
- Pretty girl.

434
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:17,481
- And get some water. Understand?
- Yes.

435
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,942
Never had much time for women myself.

436
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,987
- Might have missed something there.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,490
Of course, the last thing I want
is to cause any trouble for Rudbeck.

438
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,242
Oh, quite. Quite.

439
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,703
But one has a certain duty...

440
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,706
and regulations
have been so definitely ignored, sir.

441
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,374
I understand.

442
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,127
But then if we'd all followed regulations...

443
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,296
I daresay we wouldn't have an empire.

444
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,386
It's a good road, Harry. First-rate.

445
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:52,016
Yes.
Well, bloody Tring has stopped it now.

446
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,310
Yes, well, he's going by the book.

447
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,145
There's no doubt, Harry...

448
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,814
that Tring is an officious little —

449
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,649
- Well, he's very zealous.
- Oh.

450
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,319
He's quite likely
to report you to Whitehall...

451
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,404
and that could harm your career.

452
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,742
- What can be done?
- Well, there has to be a scapegoat.

453
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,911
- You better sack that clerk of yours, um —
- Johnson?

454
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,413
Johnson.
Well, he did all the books, didn't he?

455
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,333
Yes, but he was acting for me.
I mean, it's my responsibility.

456
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,336
He's only a clerk, for heaven's sake.
You can get another one.

457
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,722
Have you heard, friends?
He has turned me out.

458
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:34,517
That Mr. Tring. Me!

459
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,771
Johnson, the chief clerk of Fada...

460
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,732
and a friend of Judge Rudbeck...

461
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,946
Now — Now I'm going to be a trader —

462
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,031
the richest in Fada...

463
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:51,283
and my wife, Bamu...

464
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,454
will have clothes
like the queen of England...

465
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:59,041
and silver bangles as big as ropes.

466
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,378
And beads as black and shiny...

467
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,964
as a new cashbox.

468
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:08,300
And red paint for her nails
and cigarettes.

469
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,720
Cigarettes with gold ends.

470
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,765
Mr. Johnson. My friend.
Come now. It's all right.

471
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,143
- It's okay, it's okay. Come here.
- Ben — Benjamin.

472
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,811
- It's okay.
- He's turned me out.

473
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,479
It's okay. Come on.

474
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:23,190
- That Mr. Tring —
- It's all right. It's all right.

475
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,989
Now, this cloth is from Amsterdam,
Mrs. Rudbeck.

476
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:33,659
I mean, none of your rubbish here.
This is not for your natives.

477
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,661
Seems a little bright.

478
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,622
Yes, you're absolutely right.
It is a little bright. What good taste you have.

479
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,083
This, for instance, I think is more you.

480
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,752
This is the finest Egyptian cotton.
Have a feel of that.

481
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:48,132
Hmm. It seems a little... coarse.

482
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:57,683
- She's at sentiment, Mr. Johnson.
- Ajali?

483
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,436
Ajali! Eh, you two.

484
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,063
More work, less chat.

485
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:05,649
- Right, you got them totals yet?
- Coming, sir.

486
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,408
That's two shillings and eight.

487
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,535
But minus seven.

488
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,372
Oh, you nigs. Look, give it here.
Just give it to me.

489
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:23,667
Right, now, it's seven and a half percent,
all right?

490
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,753
- Yes.
- Now, that is seven pounds, ten shillings...

491
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:28,464
in every hundred pounds, right?

492
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:32,092
2,730 hides...

493
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,261
at two shillings a hide —

494
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,140
Sargy, the total is...

495
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:40,643
273 pounds.

496
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,604
What? You sure?

497
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,231
Yes, Sargy. Net.

498
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,067
Yes. Oh, yes.

499
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,736
That's what I thought.

500
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:53,989
Get on with it.

501
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:58,786
This your <i>fata</i> away. They try and sell me.

502
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,371
- No they good, oh.
- They good, oh.

503
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,373
- They no good.
- They good.

504
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,042
They good. They good.

505
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,169
Look, only fit give you sixpence.

506
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,004
- No, no, shilling.
- Shilling?

507
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:11,131
- No be give you shilling for this —
- No, shilling.

508
00:43:11,215 --> 00:43:12,508
- Shilling for what?
- Yes.

509
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:16,679
Sixpence. Look, if you no like 'em,
make you they come, carry your thing, then go.

510
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:19,348
- Hmm.
- And take 'em now.

511
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,226
- Take 'em.
- Give me the sixpence.

512
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,311
Eh. Take 'em. Go.

513
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:31,860
You just bought them hides,
have you, Johnson?

514
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,613
Ah, yes, sir.

515
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,116
One shilling a hide, sir.

516
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,451
Very good, sir.

517
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,038
Come here, lad.

518
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,541
Come on, come on, come closer.

519
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:48,711
Here, take hold of those.

520
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:56,719
I did not touch you, did I?

521
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:58,804
No, sir.

522
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,307
I was in the store, wasn't I?

523
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,351
Yes, sir. In the store.

524
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:07,688
- So, what happened to you?
- My face got a blow.

525
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:08,981
It what?

526
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:11,400
No! I had an accident.

527
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:14,528
You are a very clever geezer, Johnson.

528
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,740
You had a accident to your nose.

529
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,613
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning, Sargy.

530
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:01,658
Lovely day. Real nice one. Oh, yes.

531
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,701
Come here, lad.

532
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,707
Well, come on then.
I'm not gonna bite ya.

533
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:14,880
So, how are things with you today,
Mr. Johnson?

534
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:18,133
Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.
I feel most well.

535
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:20,719
Oh, that's good. That is good.

536
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,431
I like you, Johnson,
but I had to thump you...

537
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:27,518
because I know you are making
a tidy profit off of them hides.

538
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,895
Now, that's all right,
because so am I.

539
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,773
- But, Sargy, I never —
- You're a good sort, Johnson.

540
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:35,567
Well, I mean, you know,
for a nigger, that is.

541
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,861
But I mean, you can't help
what you are, can you?

542
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:39,738
I mean, God made niggers, didn't he?

543
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:43,158
Just the same way that he made warthogs
and dog-faced baboons.

544
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:45,577
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

545
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,461
Matumbi!

546
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:57,840
Get your fat bum in here,
at the double!

547
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:04,680
You're just a cow, aren't ya?
An ungrateful cow.

548
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,683
I mean, I'm looking after you!

549
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,393
What?

550
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,438
You no watchum.

551
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:15,816
Pay no attention. He's been drinking.
He's not an educated man.

552
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:18,485
Let me tell you!

553
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:21,447
- But he kill her!
- Oh, no. He will just break her arm.

554
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,949
Or smash her face little. That's all.

555
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,330
I'll knock your block off, sweetheart!

556
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:32,416
Oh!

557
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:35,169
Get out of here!
Get out of my bloody sight! Go on!

558
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,059
You bloody nigs!

559
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:55,230
You don't know what it costs us
to live here.

560
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:58,817
Of course, then you ain't —

561
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:01,236
you ain't got
the same kind of feelings, have ya...

562
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,282
as a white man?

563
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,410
Bloody nigs.

564
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:38,690
Got him!

565
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,530
Ah.

566
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,573
My Bobby...

567
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:49,159
my boy back home in England...

568
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:52,120
I tell you, Johnson...

569
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:54,456
he's gonna join the army like his dad...

570
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,208
or I'll know the reason why.

571
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,751
Oh, yes.

572
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,921
I think he be a general, sir.
Marry a princess.

573
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:04,883
He won't! Bloody brass hats? Oh!

574
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:08,303
No, he'll stick with his regiment,
my Bobby...

575
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:09,888
like his old dad.

576
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:15,227
I mean — I mean, look what the regiment
has done for me, you know?

577
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,480
That's right, Sargy.
You a fine man.

578
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:21,316
Oh, yeah, yeah.

579
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:25,654
Come and have a drink. Come on.
Come sit down and have a drink.

580
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,824
You see, the whole trouble —
the trouble with old England is...

581
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,077
is too much snobs with money.

582
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:35,831
And the workers don't stand a chance.

583
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:39,585
Mmm. Poor Mr. Rudbeck, he work.

584
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:42,504
He build that great road.

585
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:44,631
But that treasurer, that Mr. Tring...

586
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:46,758
who got all those millions of gold —

587
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:51,263
I mean, look. Just look what the army's
done for England, right?

588
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,599
I mean, there's not
a bloody country in this world...

589
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:57,352
where we have not laid down
our lives for the empire.

590
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,771
God mind you, not that I'm complaining.

591
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:01,440
Oh, no, no.

592
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:03,442
No, it-it's our duty...

593
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,445
laid down by — by God Almighty.

594
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,282
To freedom.

595
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:12,242
The empire.

596
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,786
We English people...

597
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:18,123
make freedom for all the world.

598
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:21,710
Make them good schools for all people.

599
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,754
All people learn book.

600
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:25,922
Learn to agree for each other.

601
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:29,635
I say it again to you, Johnson.

602
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,512
You're too good for a nig.

603
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:35,140
It is a pity you're a nig.

604
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:40,812
I mean, you should have been born
one of them higher races...

605
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:42,147
with intelligence.

606
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,234

00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:58,880
Clerk Johnson has killed
the merchant Gollup.

662
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:08,890
You aren't murdered then?

663
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:11,768
No, I — I ain't.

664
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,397
Well, did Johnson attack you?
Do you want to charge him?

665
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,484
No. Oh, everything's
all right here, Mr. Rudbeck.

666
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:22,487
I had a... accident.

667
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,073
A accident to my nose.

668
00:55:28,785 --> 00:55:32,831
Ah, well, ah, well, uh —
That's all right then.

669
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:34,416
That's all right.

670
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,167
Good night.

671
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:46,261
Well, old son.

672
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,929
That's it, innit?

673
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,565
I mean, I-I can't have this sort
of thing happening, can I?

674
00:55:58,648 --> 00:56:00,358
I mean, not in public.

675
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:03,695
I mean, I've got to maintain
discipline here, haven't I?

676
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,613
Otherwise, where would we be?

677
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,245
I'm giving you a month in lieu.

678
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:22,464
There you are.

679
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:26,593
I'm-I'm real sorry about this, Johnson.
I really am.

680
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,845
You was the best nig I ever had.

681
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:33,391
I mean, treat 'em right,
I always say...

682
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,644
and they ain't half
as black as they look.

683
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,901
You weren't never afraid
of me, were you?

684
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:47,822
No. Never afraid of you, Mr. Gollup.

685
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:30,550
How many miles
had you done before the rains?

686
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,135
Oh, about 30, sir.

687
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:34,971
Um, Fada is here...

688
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,182
- Mm-hmm?
- and we're about at this point now, sir.

689
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:38,850
Well, that's very good.

690
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,853
And trade has gone up, Harry, just as
you predicted, even though it's not finished.

691
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,564
Uh, well, the trouble is, sir,
it looks like it might stay that way.

692
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,025
- Hmm?
- What with that, um...

693
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,652
- Tring controlling the vote.
- Ah.

694
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:52,071
You'd think we were asking him
to spend his own bloody money.

695
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:54,282
Yes. Pity.

696
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:57,785
Thing is, it's the ones who can
recite the rule book in their sleep...

697
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:59,871
that get the promotion.

698
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,789
We're gonna have to be careful.

699
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,126
Mrs. Rudbeck.
Cheers.

700
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:27,190
Judge Rudbeck,
God grant you long life!

701
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:30,068
How do you do, sir?

702
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:33,071
The clock —
I think it fast when it stop.

703
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,410
My God.

704
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:41,621
Johnson. Ha!

705
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,707
Mr. Johnson.

706
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,253
What the devil have you been doing
to yourself? Lion taming?

707
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:50,672
Oh, no, sir. I've been in business.

708
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:52,257
Oh, yes?

709
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,592
Tailoring business?

710
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:57,637
All kinds, sir.
Any kind of business.

711
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,056
But when I hear
the road start again...

712
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:03,726
sir, I think I come and see you.

713
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,063
Oh, yes, but I've only got laborers' jobs,
Mr. Johnson.

714
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:09,190
I mean, sixpence a day.
You can't work for that.

715
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:11,567
Oh, sir,
I like that very much.

716
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,530
Yeah.

717
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,657
Celia, look.

718
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:19,867
It's Mr. Johnson.

719
01:00:44,976 --> 01:00:46,769
I done tell you, Bamu.

720
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:50,189
- Mr. Rudbeck my friend.
- Mmm.

721
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:14,839
Judge Rudbeck,
I pray God you slept like a baby.

722
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:17,091
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

723
01:01:19,177 --> 01:01:21,596
You seem to get a lot
of work out of your gang.

724
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,600
They're good men, sir.
They want to make road too much.

725
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:30,688
Yeah. Drummers are a good idea.

726
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:32,482
Oh, thank you, sir.

727
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:37,570
Three shillings.

728
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:47,413
Three shillings.

729
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,541
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
- Good morning, ma'am.

730
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,210
And what's this? For cattle?

731
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,754
Oh, no, ma'am. This is a <i>zungo.</i>

732
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:58,341
A <i>zungo</i>? What is a <i>zungo</i>?

733
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:00,760
For people, ma'am.
Travelers on the road.

734
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,345
They stay here.

735
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,680
Oh, I see. It's like a hotel.

736
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:06,224
Yes, ma'am.

737
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:09,644
- I thought people just slept in the bush.
- Oh, no, ma'am.

738
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:12,438
The bush full of lions
and leopards and —

739
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:17,068
ghosts and werewolves.

740
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:18,986
Ghosts and werewolves?

741
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,531
Come now, Mr. Johnson,
you don't believe that.

742
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:25,451
Oh, no, ma'am.
I an educated man.

743
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,422
But it's going so bloody well.

744
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:41,843
Harry, if the vote is used up,
the vote is used up.

745
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:45,972
There's only enough money here
for another week or so.

746
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:49,434
We're in striking distance
of the Kano road.

747
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:56,774
Sir.

748
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:00,611
Better accept it, Harry.

749
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:02,905
There'll be another vote
for the road next year.

750
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:04,949
We mightn't be here.

751
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:08,202
We might be transferred
to another province.

752
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:10,997
Someone will finish the road.

753
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,625
And you started it, Harry.
It's your achievement.

754
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:19,297
Mm-hmm.
I suppose so.

755
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,758
Right. Well, I'm off.

756
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,553
I'll see you all next year.

757
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:28,890
Uh, full report's gone
to the governor, sir.

758
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,726
Fine. Enjoy yourself.

759
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:35,229
Absolutely.
Bye, Harry.

760
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:38,107
Safe journey.

761
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:41,194
Can't say I'm sorry to be getting out
of this place for a while.

762
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:44,489
Mrs. Rudbeck.

763
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,912
Bye, all.

764
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,052
Sorry, Harry.

765
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:25,738
What is it, Johnson?

766
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:27,657
I think we build road, sir.

767
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,867
It's not on, Johnson.

768
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,370
You heard him.

769
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:35,748
- Maybe we don't need money.
- Oh, don't be silly, Johnson.

770
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:38,543
These villagers around here aren't
gonna work for bloody nothing, you know.

771
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,503
They're not stupid.

772
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:47,426
And this great road
will make you all rich.

773
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:56,143
But to share in the riches,
you must help us finish it.

774
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:05,403
All workers will receive free beer.

775
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:29,802
The speech is good...

776
01:05:30,595 --> 01:05:31,971
but the day is very hot.

777
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,764
No one wants to work.

778
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:37,977
It's a shame. Then there is
no chance to win the prize.

779
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,605
Prize? What is this prize?

780
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:44,817
The village which clears
the most bush gets the prize.

781
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,777
Five pounds.

782
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:48,696
Five pounds?

783
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:52,450
- Who gets it?
- It is paid to the chief.

784
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,202
Oh.

785
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:11,469
Down there.

786
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:51,926
Get down! Get down!

787
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:47,314
Mr. Rudbeck! Mr. Rudbeck, look!

788
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,401
We done joined the mighty north road.

01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,682
Hello, Johnson.
What are you doing here?

802
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,768
I just looking at the road, sir,
like you.

803
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:49,353
Mmm.

804
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:52,606
Greetings, lords.

805
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:58,279
God prolong you, Waziri.

806
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,698
Come to admire our road?

807
01:10:00,781 --> 01:10:02,449
The road.

808
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:06,287
The road.

809
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,540
The emir, Lord Rudbeck,
does not like the road.

810
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:11,667
No? Why not?

811
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:19,466
People from far away
will travel down this road to Fada.

812
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,429
They will not know of our emir.
They will not salute him.

813
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:27,391
They will bring ideas
that the emir does not like.

814
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,187
Mmm.

815
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:34,899
Who knows when the spark will be lit...

816
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:37,651
or how dry it will find the grass?

817
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,239
You don't understand, Waziri.

818
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:45,242
The people must have roads.

819
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:48,996
But why?
Tell me why, Mr. Johnson.

820
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,665
Because it is civilized.

821
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:55,461
With a road,
we civilize the people.

822
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:59,006
But why should they be civilized,
Lord Johnson?

823
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:01,884
Because —

824
01:11:02,468 --> 01:11:05,804
Because all men like
to be civilized.

825
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:14,980
Amadu of Bauchi.

826
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:19,818
Refused to repair his house wall,
which overhangs the road.

827
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,695
Mmm?
What does he say?

828
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:24,406
He said he was away trading
and his sons neglected the wall.

829
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,659
All right.

830
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:29,203
Now that he's back,
he has a week to fix the wall.

831
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,338
Levi, a trader from Abakaliki.

832
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:44,468
Assaulted the police, who arrested him
for not paying in the <i>zungo.</i>

833
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,053
Yes?

834
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:49,056
He declared he has already paid
both his <i>zungo</i> fees.

835
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,685
Both fees?

836
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,145
- You mean in two <i>zungos.</i>
- No, lord.

837
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:57,398
Both fees in the Fada <i>zungo.</i>

838
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:00,192
You mean he had cattle.

839
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:04,405
No, lord. I mean the lodging fee
and the road fee.

840
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,158
What the devil is the road fee?

841
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,661
Ask him who he paid it to.

842
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,917
He paid it to the road boy.

843
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:19,253
Who the hell is the road boy?

844
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:22,214
Lord, the small boy
who works for Mr. Johnson.

845
01:12:23,424 --> 01:12:24,925
Johnson?

846
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,192
Judge Rudbeck.
Good evening to you, sir.

847
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:45,112
Have you been stealing <i>zungo</i> money?

848
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:48,699
Oh, no, sir.
I never think of such a bad thing.

849
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,953
This boy's been collecting
something called a road fee.

850
01:12:53,037 --> 01:12:55,039
A tax you invented yourself.

851
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,541
Oh, yes, sir.
He-He make a little collection.

852
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:59,626
But to buy beer
for laborers on the road.

853
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:03,380
- You never took any of that money?
- Oh, sir, I forget.

854
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:05,382
Maybe I borrow two or three shillings.

855
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:08,635
Here.
I put it all in my cashbook.

856
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:12,139
How did you pay your bill
at Gollup's store?

857
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:14,516
Oh, sir, out from my pay.

858
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:20,022
What about one pound, two
and sixpence for a canopy chair?

859
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:23,275
Uh, perhaps I borrow
small small to pay my chair.

860
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:26,028
And the suits? And that bed?

861
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:30,240
Oh, God, Johnson,
you'd steal the smell off a goat.

862
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:34,036
But I no steal, sir.

863
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:37,581
Maybe I borrow small small.
But I pay it back.

864
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,471
These are serious charges, Johnson.

865
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:54,723
Embezzlement and <i>sojan gwona.</i>

866
01:13:57,017 --> 01:13:58,727
You know what that is?

867
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:02,689
It's the collection of money by pretending
to be a government official.

868
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:06,360
You my good friend, Mr. Rudbeck.

869
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:08,904
I did it all for you.

870
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:15,661
I'm not arresting you...

871
01:14:17,037 --> 01:14:18,997
but I want you out of here.

872
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,209
Understand?

873
01:14:38,934 --> 01:14:42,688
- It's all that wretched road.
- Wretched road? What do you mean?

874
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:46,191
Well, it's changing everything.

875
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:49,403
Lorries, markets,
people flooding in.

876
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:52,239
Look at the pressure
it put on poor Mr. Johnson.

877
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,284
God, sleepy old Fada
will never be the same again.

878
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:56,827
- Probably just as well.
- Harry!

879
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:59,538
I mean it! Do you think
we should come here and say...

880
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,415
"How quaint,"
and leave it at that?

881
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:05,169
They were all happy enough.
Who asked you to change things?

882
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:12,176
What is the good of roads?

883
01:15:16,388 --> 01:15:18,348
I spent too long
on that road, Bamu.

884
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,232
But now...

885
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:30,194
I'll go into trade.

886
01:15:30,736 --> 01:15:33,447
I'm going to be a rich man.

887
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,824
I a bold and daring man.

888
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:41,038
Going to take care of you
and my little boy here.

889
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,418
I love you too much, Bamu.

890
01:15:47,628 --> 01:15:50,505
I love you stronger
than the tree grows.

891
01:15:51,006 --> 01:15:53,467
I love you more
than the sun fills the air.

892
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:10,901
Nothing has happened.

893
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:28,669
What are you doing?

894
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,423
- But she's my wife.
- She my sister.

895
01:16:33,507 --> 01:16:36,260
Bamu, you no want to go.

896
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:44,601
I'm just about to make you rich.

897
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:53,193
Stop! Stop.

898
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:54,820
Please, wait small small time.

899
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,447
I know how I go get
all the money where I owe you.

900
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,325
Brimah, please.

901
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:04,621
Bamu, I go buy you a-a new bed.

902
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:07,541
A bed of gold,
with silver legs.

903
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:11,878
And the net gonna be of fine silver thread,
all laced together.

904
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:15,424
Please, stay here.

905
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,836
They say Judge Rudbeck
has turned you out.

906
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:56,715
It is false. I left my work
on the road. That's all.

907
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,675
Is that so?

908
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:01,386
Waziri, I need small small money.

909
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,305
Money? From me?

910
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:07,559
Waziri,
after all I have done for you.

911
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:09,186
The judge's letters.

912
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:12,564
But the judge has dismissed you.

913
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:14,941
What can you do for me now?

914
01:18:20,072 --> 01:18:21,782
You rubbish.

915
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:24,201
Coming here so late
with such nonsense!

916
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:33,043
Beat him. Don't kill him.
Just cripple him.

917
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,123
You stay right where you are,
you thieving —

918
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:38,728
Here!

919
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:41,565
Here, what you... playin' at?

920
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:58,123
What on earth is it, Waziri?

921
01:21:58,206 --> 01:22:01,084
Clerk Johnson has killed
the merchant Gollup.

922
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,713
Oh, God. Not again.

923
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:07,841
Tell your men to contact —

924
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:09,926
and report any strangers in the area —

925
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:13,513
Yes, sir.

926
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:17,118
Bamu!

927
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,083
Bamu!

928
01:23:45,897 --> 01:23:48,817
Bamu, I'm hungry.

929
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,860
I haven't eaten anything for days.

930
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:06,126
Thank you.

931
01:24:27,147 --> 01:24:29,816
Mmm.
You're a good wife, Bamu.

932
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:32,652
The best wife in Africa.

933
01:24:32,736 --> 01:24:34,654
Okay, make you chow finish.
Make you the go.

934
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,537
I no want make my brother see you.

935
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,082
Waziri say he gonna give big money
to any person where find you gone.

936
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:51,129
- Bamu, one day I will —
- No, no, Mr. Johnson.

937
01:24:51,212 --> 01:24:52,714
Make you the go.

938
01:25:19,783 --> 01:25:22,744
- Get up, you son of a dog!
- I'm not the son of a dog.

939
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:24,579
I'm an English gentleman.

940
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:26,664
And no English gentleman
would walk barefoot...

941
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:28,708
through a disgusting town.

942
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:03,535
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

943
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:06,079
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

944
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:10,208
Mr. Johnson! Mr. Johnson!

945
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:13,336
- Mr. Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson.

946
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:16,756
Mr. Johnson!

947
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:21,177
- Mr. Johnson!
- Johnson!

948
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,808
Mr. Johnson.

949
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:14,480
Saleh. What do you do here?

950
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:18,735
That old man, the Waziri,
he was always touching me.

951
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,320
I pushed him away.

952
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:22,906
He got angry and says I am a thief.

953
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:24,490
It is all a lie.

954
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:26,409
Amazing.

955
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:30,371
The Waziri's friend.
Hey!

956
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:32,373
Wonderment.

957
01:27:32,457 --> 01:27:36,586
This boy used to possess such power,
and now —

958
01:27:37,712 --> 01:27:39,714
It makes you think, oh.

959
01:27:39,797 --> 01:27:41,758
Poor Saleh.

960
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:44,594
Johnson, my feet hurt
with the rough ground.

961
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:46,137
Give me your shoes.

962
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:50,016
- My best English shoes?
- Don't be so cruel and selfish.

963
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,435
What good are they to you?

964
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,604
In two days, they will hang you.

965
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:26,302
Quiet.

966
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,138
Quiet.

967
01:28:35,687 --> 01:28:37,146
Go on, Johnson.

968
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:40,858
Oh, sir, I guilty.
I kill poor Sargy Gollup.

969
01:28:40,942 --> 01:28:43,152
Don't write that, Muhammad.

970
01:28:43,236 --> 01:28:44,862
Don't plead guilty.

971
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:49,033
Not guilty.
We'll call it not guilty.

972
01:28:49,117 --> 01:28:52,412
I guilty.
I think I save you trouble.

973
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,831
- Did you mean to kill him then?
- Oh, no, sir.

974
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:56,499
I agree for him too much.

975
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,793
I didn't want to hurt Sargy one little bit.

976
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:02,296
But before,
you said you picked up the paper file...

977
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,424
and stabbed him.

978
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:08,052
Oh, sir, I just didn't think
what I was doing with that thing.

979
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:11,139
Johnson,
I want you to understand.

980
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:14,142
If you plead the killing was an accident,
that's one thing.

981
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:17,645
But if you lost your head,
that's another.

982
01:29:18,563 --> 01:29:20,773
A thief who kills
to get himself out of a corner...

983
01:29:20,857 --> 01:29:23,776
is still guilty
of murder in the first degree.

984
01:29:26,654 --> 01:29:29,615
♪ I got a little girl ♪

985
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:33,453
♪ I got a little girl ♪

986
01:29:33,995 --> 01:29:35,955
♪ She round like the world ♪

987
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:37,999
♪ She smooth like the water ♪♪

988
01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:14,160
All right, let me see.
Uh —

989
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:18,414
We know the coins
are 25 pounds each...

990
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:20,833
and the jam is—

991
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:23,086
Or what is it? Peas.

992
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,672
Peas are 11 pounds, so —

993
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:28,508
How much I weigh, sir?

994
01:30:29,092 --> 01:30:32,887
Fifteen —
Well, I make it, uh...

995
01:30:33,513 --> 01:30:35,348
10 stone, seven.

996
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:37,266
That looks about right.

997
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,851
Why you weigh me, sir?

998
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:41,062
Regulations, Johnson.

999
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:44,482
- Take those off, will you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

1000
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:46,109
Excuse me, sir.

1001
01:30:46,192 --> 01:30:48,319
I beg your pardon for troubling you.

1002
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:51,531
You gonna hang me, sir?

1003
01:30:51,614 --> 01:30:53,282
Who said anything about that?

1004
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:56,077
Nobody, sir.
I guessed myself.

1005
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,037
You my good friend.

1006
01:30:58,538 --> 01:31:00,540
You my father and my mother.

1007
01:31:01,207 --> 01:31:03,668
I think, perhaps, you shoot me.

1008
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,505
I no like hang.

1009
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:10,299
I'm sorry, Johnson.
I have to obey the law.

1010
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:13,886
I shall have to sign a piece of paper
to say that I carried it out exactly.

1011
01:31:16,556 --> 01:31:20,518
General salute, present... arms!

1012
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:37,660
Shoulder... arms!

1013
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:29,503
Ajali!

1014
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:32,215
Mr. Benjamin!

1015
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:36,135
- God give you health.
- Good day, Mr. Johnson.

1016
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:39,055
Morning, Mr. Johnson.
God prolong —

1017
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:42,016
God give you peace.

1018
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:47,104
Here.

1019
01:32:48,064 --> 01:32:49,565
Whiskey!

1020
01:32:49,649 --> 01:32:52,318
From England.
From home.

1021
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:56,989
The best whiskey in the world.

1022
01:32:57,073 --> 01:33:01,577
Uh —
Mr. Rudbeck, he-he came to the store.

1023
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:03,412
He said that
we should give that to you.

1024
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:05,248
But why should he —

1025
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:07,833
Of course,
he's going to hang me today.

1026
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:11,295
He is too good to me.

1027
01:33:11,379 --> 01:33:13,631
Uh, drink some whiskey, Mr. Johnson.

1028
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:16,759
No, no. You have it.

1029
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,344
You my friends.

1030
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:30,523
It will cheer you up.

1031
01:33:31,315 --> 01:33:32,900
But I'm cheerful.

1032
01:33:32,984 --> 01:33:34,944
I don't care to take anything.

1033
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:37,655
You have it.

1034
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:43,828
I say this, Mr. Johnson:
You brave.

1035
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:48,582
- Very sorry to say good-bye.
- I sorry too.

1036
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:50,960
I don't mind dying...

1037
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:54,297
but I don't want to say good-bye.

1038
01:34:15,735 --> 01:34:19,488
Sir, prisoner ready
and we dig a grave in the bush, sir.

1039
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:21,532
Very good, Sergeant.

1040
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,506
Good morning, Mr. Rudbeck.

1041
01:34:38,007 --> 01:34:39,633
God bless you.

1042
01:34:40,551 --> 01:34:42,136
I'm sorry about this, Johnson.

1043
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:46,682
Yes, all this make plenty trouble
