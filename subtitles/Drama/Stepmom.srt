1
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,763
Good morning, New York.
Scott Zoe here...

2
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:55,100
...at 102. 7, WNEW-FM,
where rock lives.

3
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:57,019
Beautiful autumn day
in the city...

4
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:00,147
...and a great record coming
your way too.

5
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,552
Ben!

6
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,514
Ben!

7
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:40,020
Get up, get up, get up!
Late, late, late!

8
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,356
Come on, honey. Get up.
We're seriously late.

9
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:49,029
You may think this is funny,
but this is so not...

10
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,197
...funny.

11
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,869
I'm not kidding anymore. You make
yourself appear right this instant.

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,586
The clock is ticking, Ben!
Come on now!

13
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,675
Anna?

14
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,385
Oh good, you're already up.

15
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:16,473
You forgot to wash my shirt.
Today is purple shirt day at school.

16
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:19,225
I didn't forget.

17
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,770
Actually, I was up half the night
thinking about it.

18
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:24,731
Yeah, right.

19
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:29,402
I concluded that you are too special
to look like everyone else.

20
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:32,989
So, orangey-red. That's your colour.
Few can carry it off.

21
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,826
-Help me find your brother.
-You lost Ben?

22
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:41,748
I didn't lose Ben.

23
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,341
All right, Ben, fine.

24
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,760
You explain to your teacher
why you're late.

25
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:59,182
Your daddy said he had an important
case and had to go to work early.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,643
And he left us here
to be responsible--

27
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,437
Shit!

28
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:06,939
You're so not funny.

29
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,107
Not funny.

30
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:11,569
You're also late, and that means
get dressed right now!

31
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,905
Stay. No, stay. Ben! Ben!

32
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:16,782
This is not funny!

33
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,493
We've got to get you dressed.
We're running so late.

34
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,620
This is not a game!

35
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:24,248
Come on. Help me out.

36
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,585
Come on! Really, we're so late.

37
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:29,837
But I don't want
to go to school.

38
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:32,882
Mommy!

39
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:34,091
Mommy!

40
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:35,926
Hi, sweetie!

41
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,930
You look like you're
having such a good time.

42
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:42,433
But we're running a little late.

43
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,061
-You're supposed to wear purple.
-She forgot to wash it.

44
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,774
What a hug!

45
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,904
I'll handle it from here, lsabel.

46
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,533
I'm sure you will, Jackie.

47
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,169
Oh, my gosh!
She made you a lunch?

48
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,801
Okay, come on.

49
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,860
Mom, why are we listening
to this classical stuff?

50
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,446
Because I like it,
and I'm driving.

51
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:40,365
When you get a car,
you can pick the music.

52
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:44,661
Why does lsabel wear Daddy's underpants?
Doesn't she have her own?

53
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:49,291
I saw a whopping pile of laundry
sitting on the washing machine.

54
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,128
-Perhaps her underpants are there.
-Right next to my purple shirt.

55
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,005
I'm never speaking to her again.

56
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,798
Never say never.
Here's your vitamins.

57
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,342
She's always messing up my life.

58
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,469
It's not fair to say ''always.''

59
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,555
I hate her. She's such a witch.

60
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,557
No name-calling.
Use your words.

61
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,309
I hate when you say that.

62
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,729
That's a beginning.
'' Hate'' is an acceptable word.

63
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,899
Just be careful to use it
only when you truly detest something.

64
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:16,192
Like what?

65
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:17,986
Well, like...

66
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:21,156
...Uranus. I hate that.
It's a terrible name for a planet.

67
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:23,575
Uranus!

68
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,286
And the hokey-pokey.

69
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:30,415
I hate it. Putting your foot in
and out at weddings. It's terrible.

70
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,838
I hate when you do that!
I can smell your breakfast.

71
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,923
Point well-taken.

72
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:46,597
Ladies, let's just calm down.
She'll be here.

73
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,975
Isabel, where are you?
Come on. Any word?

74
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,268
She's on her way.

75
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,645
-She's on her way. I promise.
-Oh, really?

76
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,021
How do you know?

77
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,065
I'm here! I'm sorry I'm late.

78
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,525
What a crisis!

79
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,611
White pants, black top?
And the white or black bra?

80
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,363
And then I picked this....

81
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,782
-All righty.
-I'm here. I'm lame.

82
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,951
You got a Froot Loop
in your hair.

83
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:20,923
Get me a digital camera right now.
Russell, get this out of here, please.

84
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,675
Come on, boys!

85
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,433
Why is she shooting this?

86
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,185
Isabel, we have been
waiting for an hour.

87
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,480
I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

88
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,524
Why are you shooting this?

89
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,818
Because I'm brilliant.

90
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,862
And I see something you don't.

91
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,239
So stand back and trust me,
why don't you?

92
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,742
I trust you. But why are you
shooting the craft service guy...

93
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:53,205
...when I've got 5 male models
in expensive suits over here?

94
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,001
Thank you, ladies. Lovely.
That's a wrap, everybody!

95
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,420
No, it's not a wrap!

96
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,465
She's kidding.
You were kidding, aren't you?

97
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,261
I'm not kidding. And if you
meet me here in an hour...

98
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,638
...l will prove to you
why you hired me...

99
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,391
...even though I wouldn't
sleep with you.

100
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,399
She's got such a
great sense of humor.

101
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,780
Wait.

102
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,243
Let's see...

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,828
...if I can save...

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,913
...both our jobs.

105
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,378
-Interesting.
-Look at that.

106
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,674
Wow! It's the
little guy in the suit.

107
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,592
-What do you think?
-I like it.

108
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,969
I like it. Good work.

109
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,096
I like it too. Very creative.

110
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,639
Thank you.

111
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,891
Congratulations, Duncan.

112
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,522
That suit takes
pounds off of him.

113
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,108
While change is exhilarating
for an adult...

114
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,986
...it can be quite a challenge
for a child.

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,948
I won't get that.

116
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,076
It's fine.

117
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,494
Change.

118
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,079
You were talking about change.

119
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,874
The fact that you two are remarrying
obviously has Anna overjoyed.

120
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,585
And she's excited about
the move to Switzerland.

121
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,630
She said we are remarrying?

122
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,676
My concern is that Anna seems
apathetic towards her work...

123
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,137
...knowing she's leaving
before this semester.

124
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,014
-Mrs. Franklin, we are not--
-No plans on getting....

125
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,518
-Remarried. There's no move--
-To Switzerland.

126
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,770
Really?

127
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,938
Really.

128
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,068
Well, then, my concern
for Anna is that she--

129
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,862
-Are you here?
-I'm here.

130
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,365
-You don't seem like you're here.
-I'm here.

131
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,077
The judge is ruling on a motion
that could make or break my case.

132
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,414
-But have I answered my beeper?
-So turn it off.

133
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,626
I'm wondering if anything
at home could be...

134
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,380
...intensifying Anna's need
to create this fantasy.

135
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,924
I've been seeing another woman.

136
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,426
He's seen a number of women.

137
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,180
But I've been seeing one woman
for the past year.

138
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,476
After discussing it with her
and the kids, she moved in last month.

139
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,936
She's half his age.

140
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,356
-Isabel's not half my age.
-We're not discussing your age.

141
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,859
When the children visit,
they want to be with their father.

142
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,238
They want to be a part of my life.
Isabel's part of my life.

143
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,909
Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking
about your life, your needs.

144
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,662
But are you in touch
with what Anna needs?

145
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,291
Anna needs a safe and loving home.
What I'm trying to give her.

146
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,170
-That's what she already had.
-I'd walk through fire for Anna.

147
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,756
Gladly. Any day of the week.

148
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,217
Except Thursday, when lsabel
forgot to pick them up.

149
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,928
Jackie, she was 5 minutes late,
for chrissakes!

150
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:58,180
She was 5 minutes late!

151
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:02,393
I wonder if Anna could be
responding to the hostility...

152
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,646
...between your girlfriend
and Mrs. Harrison.

153
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,732
Well, of course she's
responding to it.

154
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:13,404
Do you think this is easy for us?
Do you think it's easy for Jackie...

155
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,365
...to see her kids looked after
by another woman?

156
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:20,911
Not to mention, a woman who really has
no experience being a mother.

157
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,248
Of course Jackie's
going to be irrational...

158
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,541
...hostile...

159
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,167
...defensive.

160
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,087
Thank you, Luke.

161
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,969
Why would I say...

162
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,804
...you're getting back together?

163
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,766
People make up stories about
things they wish would happen.

164
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,143
Why would I want that to happen?

165
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,230
Okay, pick a card. Any card.

166
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,648
Because you're upset.

167
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,858
Because lsabel moved in and--

168
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,362
I'm not upset. I won't
get myself upset over her.

169
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,030
Tear it in half.

170
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,657
Look, sweetie.

171
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,075
-If it means--
-Again.

172
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,160
Again.

173
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,162
If you want--

174
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:05,497
And again.

175
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,249
Time out.

176
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:12,504
If you don't want to talk
about this now, you don't have to.

177
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,131
But don't look at me and lie.

178
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,634
It hurts my feelings,
I get angry....

179
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,680
You're only allowed so many lies
before it shows in your face...

180
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,682
...and you wind up looking like....

181
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:25,892
Like who?

182
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,312
He's not President anymore,
so why be petty?

183
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,858
I'm sorry I said it.

184
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,528
I guess sometimes I just....

185
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:40,865
Sometimes I do wish
you and Daddy would....

186
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,367
Well, you know.

187
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:48,706
I figured if I said it out loud,
it just might come true.

188
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,708
Yeah, I know.

189
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,396
It's not that I can't cook.
It's that I choose not to cook.

190
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:15,316
-There's a big difference.
-You don't have to cook.

191
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,860
Could we save some
of the wine?

192
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,615
-I need it for the sauce.
-Too late.

193
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:24,867
Hi, honey.

194
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:37,838
You better get it.

195
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:47,431
-Who's there?
-Nobody there.

196
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:53,521
I missed you today.

197
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:56,190
I missed you too.
I miss you every day.

198
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:57,525
How was your day, baby?

199
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,527
It was pretty good, except
I got to go back to Pittsburgh.

200
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,405
Yeah, I got to go
tomorrow till Sunday.

201
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:06,325
But I'll have to order in.

202
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,745
Well, we got the kids
for the weekend, so I figured...

203
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:11,997
...that you and the kids...

204
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,792
...and me could all go...

205
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,336
...to Pittsburgh together.

206
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,254
Never going to happen.

207
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:23,133
No? Come on! We could get
a great hotel room.

208
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,636
We could take in
a baseball game or something.

209
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,138
-What do you think?
-Pass.

210
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,850
All right. Then I'll
call the babysitter.

211
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,352
What for?

212
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,480
Well, I don't expect you
to handle them yourself.

213
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:41,735
What?

214
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:46,323
Can't handle them myself.
That's what you mean, isn't it?

215
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:48,492
No.

216
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:09,095
You don't trust me to be
alone with your kids.

217
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,388
Yes, I do.

218
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,474
Of course I do.
It's just that--

219
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:14,643
-What?
-They're a handful.

220
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:18,688
Luke, keeping me apart from them
is like saying...

221
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,191
...'' Kids, this is fun.
Keep on hating her.''

222
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:24,110
-They don't hate you.
-Really?

223
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:27,447
Look in their eyes.
Look in your ex-wife's eyes.

224
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:31,368
Jackie's just protecting her kids.
What do you expect?

225
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,747
It's complicated. You don't
understand. You don't have kids.

226
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:42,045
So it's just complicated
for you and Jackie.

227
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:46,841
For me, it's pretty simple
because I don't have kids.

228
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:51,721
I'm just trying to give you guys
time to get used to living together.

229
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,847
All right then.

230
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:57,226
Back off just a little bit
and give me a chance, okay?

231
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,949
What is your problem, asshole?

232
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,118
You are my problem!

233
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:21,584
You're absolutely right, baby.

234
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:26,631
Your kids don't hate me.
I'm just paranoid. Call your daughter.

235
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,179
I trust you.

236
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:35,014
Really?

237
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,391
I'll give you a chance
if you still want it.

238
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:40,936
-I do.
-Are you sure?

239
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:42,104
Yes.

240
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,357
Okay.

241
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,196
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

242
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,324
Don't fight with me
when I'm hungry.

243
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:58,370
How long will you be out of town?

244
00:15:58,621 --> 00:15:59,914
Till Sunday morning.

245
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:01,624
I'm worried.

246
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:02,791
About what?

247
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,711
About being alone
with her all weekend.

248
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:07,463
What if she burns the place down?

249
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,757
Just keep an eye on her...

250
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,968
...and make sure the
fire extinguisher's handy.

251
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:14,595
You ready to launch her?

252
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,681
Let's give her a good push.

253
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:23,103
Why did she move
in with you?

254
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:29,151
Because we love each other
and want to share our life together.

255
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:31,612
You already had
a life with Mommy.

256
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:35,282
But Mommy and I weren't
getting along very well.

257
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:39,411
And it wasn't fair to you guys,
us fighting all the time.

258
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,830
I fight with Anna all the time.

259
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,665
Can I move out?

260
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,668
No. But you guys
are brother and sister.

261
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:50,922
You were husband and wife.
Doesn't that mean something?

262
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:54,426
It does.

263
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:02,809
When you get older...

264
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:06,104
...your relationships get
a lot more complicated.

265
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,942
All kinds of feelings are
flying around.

266
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,737
And sometimes...

267
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:17,240
...some of those feelings change.

268
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,456
But did you fall
out of love with Mommy?

269
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,465
Yeah.

270
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,009
I guess I did.

271
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,638
I still love your mom.

272
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:46,728
It became a different
kind of love, that's all.

273
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:50,732
We're still really good friends,
and we always will be.

274
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:55,069
Can you ever fall out of love
with your kids?

275
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:56,529
No.

276
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,783
That is impossible.

277
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:03,161
Like Mission.: lmpossible.

278
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,914
Exactly like Mission.: lmpossible.
Get over here.

279
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,922
Powdered lizard brains.

280
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,011
Crushed werewolf ears.

281
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:22,722
And vampire eyes.

282
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,563
God!

283
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,487
Cool!

284
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,961
Check it out. Magic potion.

285
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,629
It's cocoa.

286
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:58,299
I put a spell on it.
Whoever drinks it...

287
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,634
...will go to sleep for 1 000 years.

288
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,012
Whatever.
Spill any on my drawing...

289
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:05,431
...l'll put you to sleep
for 1 000 years.

290
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:09,643
You guys. I have a surprise
for you. Come over to the sofa.

291
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:11,228
Please.

292
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,983
With a little enthusiasm.

293
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,484
Sit down.

294
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,070
All right.

295
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,655
And close your eyes.

296
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:22,865
Please.

297
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:24,533
Okay.

298
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,328
Okay, now.

299
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,998
Don't open them until
I tell you to, okay?

300
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,333
And open.

301
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:36,336
What do you think?

302
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:38,005
Will he eat my bunny?

303
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:40,257
Puppies don't eat bunnies.

304
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:41,967
What do you think?

305
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:44,970
I'm allergic to dogs.

306
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:48,849
Your daddy didn't tell me that.

307
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,893
He doesn't know much about me.
He's never around.

308
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,150
Why don't we name the puppy?
Puppy needs a name.

309
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,277
I know. Isabel.

310
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:02,446
I beg your pardon?

311
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:04,322
He smells like you.

312
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:07,325
And I'm allergic to you too.
It fits perfectly.

313
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,963
Why don't you name that puppy?
I'll be right back.

314
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,969
Young lady, let's get
one thing straight.

315
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:27,470
Don't touch my things!

316
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,056
I would really like it
if we could get along.

317
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,392
-I don't have to listen to you.
-Yes, you do.

318
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:34,060
No, I don't.
You're not my mother.

319
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,229
Thank God for that!

320
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:48,783
What I meant, and perhaps
I didn't say it well...

321
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,454
...is you have a great mom.
You don't need another one.

322
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:56,040
But I would like to be treated
with some respect...

323
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:58,251
...when you are in this house.

324
00:20:58,543 --> 00:20:59,711
It's my dad's house.

325
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:01,838
Well, it's my house too.

326
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,967
This is my room.
Treat it with respect and get out.

327
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,016
All right.

328
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:32,285
'' Run, run, run as fast as you can.

329
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:35,788
You can't catch me,
I'm the Stinky Cheese Man.''

330
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:39,876
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?
I made it especially for you.

331
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,836
Yes, of course.

332
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:44,130
The special cocoa.

333
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:55,808
Delicious.

334
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:00,771
''A little boy looked up
and sniffed the air and said--''

335
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:04,733
No, now you're cheating.
You skipped the part about the cow.

336
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:10,239
It's bedtime.
Can't we finish in the morning?

337
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,741
No. We have to start
from the beginning...

338
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:17,329
...and you have to read the whole thing.
I can't sleep otherwise.

339
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:18,747
Okay.

340
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,376
''Once upon a time...

341
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:26,797
...there was a little old woman
and a little old man....''

342
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,717
''Who lived together
in a little old house.''

343
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,971
You're onto something.
Why don't you read to me?

344
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:37,349
''They were lonely.

345
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,103
So the little old lady
decided to make a man...

346
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:43,105
...out of stinky cheese.

347
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:47,651
She gave him a piece of bacon for
a mouth and two olives for eyes....''

348
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,793
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

349
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:09,131
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

350
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,844
Oh, my God!

351
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,724
What's the matter?

352
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:20,976
I...

353
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:22,394
...killed her.

354
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:27,440
Killed her! Killed her!

355
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:28,859
Killed her!

356
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,934
-Good morning.
-It is 7:23.

357
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:07,522
You were supposed to be here at 6:30.
She missed her riding lesson.

358
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:10,191
It's Monday.
Her riding lesson's on Tuesday.

359
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:14,445
Except for the third Tuesday of
the month, which switches to Monday.

360
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:17,448
And in November,
when she rides on Thursdays.

361
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,283
It's not that difficult.

362
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:23,496
Don't you have an agenda book
you can write all this down in?

363
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:26,624
May I have a cup
of coffee, please?

364
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,626
We don't have coffee.

365
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,087
Good morning, Betty Ford.

366
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:34,757
Hey, monkey man. Hi, sweetie.
How are you doing?

367
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:42,014
Sweetie, go change your shirt.

368
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:46,435
-What did you do to Anna?
-Could you just back off a bit?

369
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:47,895
What happened?

370
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,274
Nothing happened.

371
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,902
Luke was in the shower
this morning...

372
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,613
...and Anna sort of...

373
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,574
...walked in without
even knocking.

374
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:03,577
I don't see why
that would upset her.

375
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,955
I mean, people in our family...

376
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,707
...have taken showers before.

377
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,335
Well, I was in there with him.

378
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:18,801
And did either of you...

379
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:21,845
...talk to her
about it afterwards?

380
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,347
No.

381
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:25,975
I thought it would be
uncomfortable for her.

382
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,103
You mean for you.

383
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,315
A 1 2-year-old girl is coping
with the fact...

384
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,778
...that her father is never moving back
in here with his family.

385
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:42,699
She sees her father naked with
another woman for the first time...

386
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,911
...and you think it would
be better for her...

387
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,080
...if everyone pretends
nothing happened?

388
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,459
I am so unbelievably sick
of your imperious bullshit.

389
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:56,088
-I'm not June fucking Cleaver.
-Don't use that language.

390
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:59,925
If life hits her hard and you
want to have a 1 2-hour conversation...

391
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:04,179
...every third Tuesday of the month,
go ahead, lady. I have a life.

392
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,224
And I don't?
Because I have children?

393
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:14,648
Your problem is
you are so self-involved...

394
00:26:14,898 --> 00:26:16,608
...you couldn't be a mother.

395
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,778
Maybe the problem here
is your daughter.

396
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:22,447
And that she is a spoiled,
wiseass little brat.

397
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:24,241
Get out of my house.

398
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,159
Get out.

399
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,913
Are you sure?
I didn't see that on the schedule.

400
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,678
I've got your Halloween costume.
Let's see if it's the right size.

401
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,721
A hippie?

402
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:49,724
Didn't you say you
wanted to be a hippie?

403
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,685
That was last month.

404
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:55,730
Okay, what do you
want to be this month?

405
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:57,857
Elvis.

406
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,193
Elvis. What kind of Elvis?

407
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:02,779
You mean, like,
black leather jacket Elvis?

408
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,531
Gold lamé Elvis.

409
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:05,865
Gold lamé Elvis.

410
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:09,118
That's pre-drugs, pre-chubby,
pre-army, pre-bad movie...

411
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,995
...all of that Elvis?

412
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:12,121
Honey...

413
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,169
...when Daddy was...

414
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:20,088
...washing lsabel...

415
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,466
...in the shower, what did
you think that was about?

416
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,136
Well, sex, of course.

417
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:35,686
Why does lsabel scream?

418
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:36,729
Scream?

419
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:38,314
During sex.

420
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,525
How do you know she screams?

421
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:42,944
I live in the same country.

422
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:51,369
-Why are you asking me?
-Just checking.

423
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,412
I like to talk to you
about stuff.

424
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,040
I like talking to you
about stuff too.

425
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,960
So since Daddy's working...

426
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:02,171
...you want to do something on Saturday,
just you and me?

427
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:04,965
Sure, but it'll have to be
in the evening.

428
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,469
I'm helping Bonnie Lyons
move into her apartment.

429
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,680
So you're going to be with...

430
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,516
...lsabel.

431
00:28:14,183 --> 00:28:15,184
Again?

432
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:16,936
That really sucks!

433
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:21,398
You'll be at a professional
photo shoot in Central Park.

434
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,151
You guys are going to
have a lot of fun.

435
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:28,155
Switch your hands.
Top hand down, bottom hand up.

436
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:31,825
Dylan, can you take one step up?
Just one big step.

437
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,412
Rapunzel, reach your hand
out again.

438
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:39,291
Wouldn't it be cool if
her hair came out of her armpits?

439
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,210
Sick!

440
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,421
I think we can get this
finished before lunch.

441
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,384
We like this light. We'll try
and get this in before lunch.

442
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,969
Come on! It's been 5 hours.
We're hungry.

443
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,388
Yeah, we're starving.

444
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:58,352
Get yourself another ice cream.
And I'll be done soon.

445
00:28:58,644 --> 00:28:59,853
I promise.

446
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:02,523
We're rich!

447
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:14,701
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

448
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,411
Where's your brother?

449
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:20,624
I don't know.

450
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:30,342
-What if he's kidnapped?
-He's not kidnapped!

451
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:31,885
He's hiding!

452
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,679
-Maybe he's in the castle.
-Good idea!

453
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:37,557
Don't touch me!
You bring bad luck.

454
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:10,715
Okay, watch very carefully.

455
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:33,321
-Mommy!
-Hi, sweetie!

456
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:40,078
-Are you all right?
-I knew where I was.

457
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:43,414
-We found him in the zoo.
-In the zoo? My God!

458
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,751
Hold his hand. Don't let him
out of your sight.

459
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:48,169
I am so sorry.

460
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:51,547
I'm going to say this one time,
so listen carefully.

461
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:56,177
That woman is to have nothing more
to do with my children.

462
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:57,720
Our children.

463
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,181
Do you realize what
could've happened?

464
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:04,268
How lucky we are the police found
him, instead of some lunatic?

465
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,439
Don't make it any worse.
Isabel feels terrible.

466
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:10,358
-It could've happened to anyone.
-Not to me!

467
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:12,526
You've made mistakes.
People make mistakes.

468
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,570
I won't watch our children...

469
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,364
...fall through the cracks
of this arrangement.

470
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:18,574
Just calm down.

471
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:20,785
I won't calm down!
I'm going to a lawyer!

472
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:22,745
We promised we'd never do that.

473
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:24,830
We've broken a lot of promises.

474
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:26,916
Don't take this out on him.

475
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:28,501
It's my fault.

476
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,794
I'm so sorry.

477
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:33,964
But you're not making
this easier on anybody.

478
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:36,717
It is not my job to
make it easier for you.

479
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:41,597
My job is to care for the children,
and they don't want to be with you!

480
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:44,892
I'm getting a court order,
and you will never...

481
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:48,812
...be with these children again alone.
Do you understand? Ever!

482
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:11,543
Mommy, it's not lsabel's fault
that I ran away.

483
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:13,670
No, you're right.
That was your fault.

484
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:17,758
It's her fault for not taking care of
my son as if it was a priority.

485
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:20,552
Which means, her
most important job.

486
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:23,263
Isabel's job is she works.

487
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,640
Mommies work too.
They work very hard.

488
00:32:25,932 --> 00:32:30,479
I work harder as a mommy than I ever
did when I had an outside job.

489
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,355
Does lsabel make a lot of money?

490
00:32:33,106 --> 00:32:37,569
People who think only about themselves
often do make a lot of money.

491
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:41,323
I think she's pretty.

492
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:44,242
If you like big teeth.

493
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:47,787
What, sweetie?

494
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:51,416
If you want me
to hate her, I will.

495
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,444
What do you want?

496
00:33:20,153 --> 00:33:24,282
Anna left her soccer stuff at the loft.
I figured she might need it.

497
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:25,658
Thanks.

498
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,123
Did you talk to the lawyer?

499
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:34,959
I have an appointment
for the day after tomorrow.

500
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:38,046
Don't do this.

501
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,591
You'll tell me not to put the kids
in the middle of a war.

502
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,093
I'm doing this for
their well-being.

503
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:45,344
Partly.

504
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,181
And partly you're doing it
because you're mad.

505
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,434
You know the kids
aren't in any real danger.

506
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,811
This is about lsabel
and you know it.

507
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,440
She made one mistake, but she's trying.
She's learning.

508
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:02,528
Slugs have a faster
learning curve. Trees, clams....

509
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,198
Give her some time, will you?
Don't drive her away.

510
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,202
I'm supposed to care about her?

511
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:12,788
You're supposed to care about me,
like I care about you.

512
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:14,957
Like you cared about me
when you walked out?

513
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:16,292
You kicked me out!

514
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:18,544
You were gone before
I asked you to leave.

515
00:34:18,794 --> 00:34:21,964
Don't give me this shit!
I was working, for God's sake!

516
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:26,552
I'm sorry. Look, wait a second.

517
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,723
Please don't do this thing
with the lawyers.

518
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,603
The kids will be okay
if we're okay.

519
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:40,190
I'd do it for you.

520
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,583
Okay. I'm going to give you
one last chance.

521
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,335
Thanks.

522
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,922
Thanks.

523
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:07,968
Good night.

524
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,327
This is the one I like the best.

525
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:36,121
She's got a longing look.

526
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:38,790
-She's great.
-He couldn't be more flexed.

527
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:41,293
He's holding his breath. C-1 4.

528
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:45,630
Don't you think this one is?
The way he's leaning back?

529
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,716
Kill that music, please.

530
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,720
That's passive. This is dynamic.
He's going to get that girl.

531
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,639
You're the photographer.
You're the genius.

532
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,892
Anna's school is looking for Luke.

533
00:36:04,107 --> 00:36:06,067
No, he's not here.
This is--

534
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,613
Are you sure you have
the right kids?

535
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,369
Because Jackie Harrison would
never forget to pick up her kids.

536
00:36:18,037 --> 00:36:19,998
Are you absolutely sure it's them?

537
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,419
I'll be right there.

538
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:26,880
I will pick them up. Thank you.

539
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:28,506
What?

540
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:31,092
The clients will be here at 4:30.

541
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:34,429
I know, so I have to hurry.
Don't worry. I'll be back.

542
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:38,224
And I will dazzle you with
my punctuality. To the button.

543
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,768
Isabel, don't do this!

544
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:57,535
Hi, guys.

545
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:02,206
Barbecue. I know they're your fave.

546
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,963
How could she just forget us?
I mean....

547
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:12,216
That's something you would do.

548
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,430
To tell you the truth...

549
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:21,976
...l did.

550
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,897
Your mother had to help
a friend with...

551
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:28,858
...this emergency.

552
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:31,318
So she called me to switch days.

553
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:35,948
But I got caught up at work
and just forgot all about you.

554
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,952
My little chick!

555
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:44,164
How are you, sweetie? I'm sorry
you got stuck. Were you scared?

556
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,001
You must be starving.

557
00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:49,211
You hungry?

558
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,671
You want a good meal?

559
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:52,589
How'd you do on your math?

560
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,384
Was it hard?

561
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:11,108
Who is it?

562
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:13,944
It's Jackie. May I come in?

563
00:38:14,736 --> 00:38:15,821
Sure.

564
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:27,624
I have another appointment
this afternoon, and l....

565
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,544
I need somebody...

566
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,130
...to take the children
to the park.

567
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:35,465
And have federal agents
jump from the bushes...

568
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,759
...and serve me
with a court order?

569
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:41,054
What's the sentence for giving
second-rate care to minors?

570
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:43,181
Whatever it is, it's not enough.

571
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,143
I'm on thin ice already
with my boss.

572
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:50,021
When I ran out yesterday,
I thought he'd fire me.

573
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,274
I can get somebody else.

574
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:54,359
Wait. God!

575
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:59,489
I'll figure something out.
I'll do it.

576
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:05,662
After-school snack.

577
00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:07,580
Refrigerate, if possible.

578
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:10,917
Band-Aids, Neosporin, hand-wipes,
Kleenex, Tylenol.

579
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,378
Why not just bring
the whole pharmacy?

580
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:16,631
Ben likes to be read to.
You know Dr. Seuss?

581
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:17,882
Not personally.

582
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:24,639
Do you have a word limit you have to
hit every day, or may I finish?

583
00:39:26,307 --> 00:39:29,394
Here's their schedule, my beeper
number in case of emergency.

584
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:32,146
If not, I'll see you
at 5 o'clock at the park.

585
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:35,567
All I ask is that they
are alive when I get there.

586
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:39,028
Jackie, I wanted to ask you...

587
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:40,196
...something.

588
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:46,577
There's a Pearl Jam concert on the 5th.
I'd like to take Anna.

589
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:48,997
Is that a weekday?

590
00:39:51,332 --> 00:39:53,376
I think it's a Thursday.

591
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:57,588
You want to take a 1 2-year-old
to a concert on a school night?

592
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:04,303
I thought it would be something nice
we could do together.

593
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:06,305
It's ridiculous.

594
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,932
She's too young.

595
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,469
It spread?

596
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,929
But I did--

597
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:51,183
I did everything right.
Everything I was supposed to do.

598
00:40:51,392 --> 00:40:55,312
We found some cells in your
lymph nodes. In three of them.

599
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,609
But you said last time
that you got it all.

600
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,445
If you were wrong last time,
you could be wrong--

601
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:07,157
The last time was a year ago.

602
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:11,036
We found a tiny lump, we treated it.
We thought we got it all.

603
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,997
We were hopeful, but there
were no guarantees.

604
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,793
But people--

605
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:22,631
We can beat it. I mean,
people beat it all the time, right?

606
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,551
-Every day, more and more.
-So what's the plan?

607
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:28,345
What do we do?
Another round of radiation?

608
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,390
Chemotherapy.

609
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:35,143
That's necessary?

610
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:39,106
Let's give it our best shot.

611
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:42,984
Right. Okay.

612
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:45,904
I got to get the kids.

613
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:48,281
We'll discuss this at
your next appointment.

614
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:51,618
You should share this with
your kids and ex-husband.

615
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:54,621
How would their worrying
make any difference?

616
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:56,498
Sooner than later...

617
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,000
...you need to.

618
00:42:02,295 --> 00:42:03,588
Think about it.

619
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:22,607
I see her.

620
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,493
-Thanks for coming.
-You're welcome.

621
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,119
You look pretty.

622
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:36,579
Thanks.

623
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,874
Listen--

624
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:43,294
I'm glad you called.
I want to tell you something too.

625
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:45,588
You go first.

626
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:47,632
Let me have a drink here.

627
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:59,352
I'm going to ask lsabel
to marry me.

628
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,945
I know you don't
think much of her.

629
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:11,989
She's a special person.

630
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,367
She really is, Jackie.

631
00:43:17,078 --> 00:43:18,621
Why are you telling me?

632
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,957
I want your okay.

633
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,209
-You don't need my approval.
-The kids do.

634
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,837
Good evening. Would you and
your wife care to look at the menu?

635
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,714
I'm not his wife.

636
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:30,508
No, thank you.

637
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:34,720
Give me a drink though, please.
Whatever this is.

638
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,017
I think it's going to be
hard for the kids.

639
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:43,813
I was hoping we could
tell them together.

640
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,774
And that'd make it easier for the kids?
Or for you?

641
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:51,445
You can't just decide to be a
''we'' and '' us'' whenever it's convenient.

642
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,739
-We are--
-We're over. We are over.

643
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:56,909
We are still their parents
for the next 1 00 years.

644
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,760
Why?

645
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:20,182
Just tell me why you
think this marriage...

646
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:23,811
...is going to work
and ours didn't.

647
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:47,209
-What did you want to talk to me about?
-Nothing. It's--

648
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:50,670
I think we have...

649
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:55,092
...quite enough to deal with
just with your news.

650
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:16,279
Good morning.

651
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:18,073
Good morning, baby.

652
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:21,785
I've got something for you.

653
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:23,244
You do?

654
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,709
But you have to wake up
to get it.

655
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:46,684
I'm awake.

656
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:12,710
You shouldn't have?

657
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:17,215
The first time I got married...

658
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:20,384
...we'd been together since college.

659
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:22,929
Marriage...

660
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:25,556
...just seemed like the next step.

661
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:29,310
It was just something
that happened.

662
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:33,898
But I think for two people
to really love each other...

663
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:38,152
...to really commit to each other...

664
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:40,196
...it has to be...

665
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:44,533
...an act of will.

666
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:47,369
Or a decision.

667
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,374
And I think two people have to
live that decision every day.

668
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:57,463
Even when things are hard
and you feel like giving up...

669
00:46:57,796 --> 00:46:59,256
...you have to...

670
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:02,635
...hang on to that decision...

671
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:07,681
...that choice...

672
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:09,808
...to love each other.

673
00:47:10,434 --> 00:47:12,811
Even if it's only by a thread.

674
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:19,985
I let that thread break once.

675
00:47:21,653 --> 00:47:23,363
This time, it won't.

676
00:47:33,373 --> 00:47:34,666
Will you marry me?

677
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,418
Yes.

678
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:38,086
Yes, I will.

679
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:53,310
-Sweetheart, don't get upset.
-I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?

680
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:56,730
No one asked me
when you got a divorce.

681
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,940
No one asked if
I wanted a new mother.

682
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:01,610
No one even asked me
if I liked her.

683
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,614
If you don't care about keeping our
family together, why should l?

684
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:08,742
Daddy and I tried very hard.
Really, we did.

685
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,786
No, you didn't! All you did
was name-call. I heard you.

686
00:48:11,995 --> 00:48:15,248
You didn't even try to
use real words.

687
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:21,588
Baby, lsabel's not going
to take my place as your mom.

688
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:26,551
It's just that lsabel's
going to be in your life...

689
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:29,804
...and hopefully, you can
learn to accept her.

690
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,728
Sweetheart.

691
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:39,647
Honey.

692
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:45,111
You know, life is
full of hard things.

693
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:47,572
Sometimes it isn't fair.

694
00:48:48,823 --> 00:48:50,200
But you have a choice.

695
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:54,621
You can either take the hard things
and make your life better...

696
00:48:54,871 --> 00:48:56,748
...or you can make it worse.

697
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:58,416
Like how?

698
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:03,504
Like...

699
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:07,425
...trying to see
the good side of lsabel...

700
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:11,012
...and what she brings
to your father's life.

701
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:12,805
And to yours.

702
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:17,018
There comes a time
in every family...

703
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,520
...when you've got to be there
for each other.

704
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:24,609
I'll be there for you.

705
00:49:26,986 --> 00:49:28,696
How about you, buddy?

706
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:30,948
Yeah.

707
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:32,992
You'll be there?

708
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:47,882
Damn it!

709
00:49:57,725 --> 00:49:58,809
What's the problem?

710
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:01,896
Nothing.

711
00:50:11,155 --> 00:50:12,865
It looks good.

712
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:15,409
I can't get the trees
to look real.

713
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:19,913
Mind if I try?

714
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:24,084
I already messed it up anyway.

715
00:50:27,129 --> 00:50:28,088
Let's see.

716
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:31,008
First a little brush smooshing.

717
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:32,926
''Smooshing.''

718
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:34,887
Very technical term.

719
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:52,654
Cool! Where'd you learn
how to do that?

720
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:55,782
I took an art class
when I was at NYU.

721
00:50:59,328 --> 00:51:01,288
Why don't you give it a try?

722
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:06,251
It helps if you make
that little....

723
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,555
Thanks.

724
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:21,391
You're welcome.

725
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,446
I was thinking about
what you said about lsabel.

726
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:36,823
You know, seeing
the good side of her.

727
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,825
And you're right.

728
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:41,036
She knows all about
clothes and stuff.

729
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:44,664
And she knows every
rock and roll song ever written.

730
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:47,125
She's like a kid herself.

731
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:49,043
Like a big sister.

732
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:52,505
She knows the cool
junk food places.

733
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:53,673
I'll bet.

734
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:57,135
Once you get to know her,
she's kind of cool.

735
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:02,473
But don't tell her I told you.

736
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:05,685
It's our secret.

737
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,396
Thanks.

738
00:52:09,522 --> 00:52:11,399
Ben, wait up!

739
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:16,589
Did you have a good day?

740
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:18,549
You're lucky because...

741
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:22,386
...you get to watch a tape.
I'm going out. Colleen's baby-sitting.

742
00:53:22,636 --> 00:53:23,887
Yeah! Cool!

743
00:53:24,388 --> 00:53:25,222
And you...

744
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,141
...are wearing makeup.

745
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,269
Well, no.
Isabel gave it to me.

746
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:34,273
She put it on in the car,
playing around.

747
00:53:35,858 --> 00:53:40,237
You don't see that color in the
afternoon, except on working girls.

748
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,949
Anyway, wash your face, because...

749
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:46,410
...you and I are going out.

750
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:48,495
On a school night?

751
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:51,206
Pearl Jam?!

752
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:56,211
-Mom, you are the coolest!
-You only live once, right?

753
00:53:57,129 --> 00:53:59,172
Isn't my mom the coolest?

754
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:04,428
It was a great idea. Thanks.

755
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:07,681
Have fun.

756
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:22,404
Chemotherapy. There's
a day's dose stored here.

757
00:54:22,612 --> 00:54:25,365
This is a portable IV. Feel it.

758
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:27,742
It's pretty light.

759
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:31,788
Nice and slim. You can wear it
everywhere, play tennis, jogging....

760
00:54:32,163 --> 00:54:34,833
-You can hide it under your clothes.
-That's cool.

761
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:38,211
Side effects?

762
00:54:39,129 --> 00:54:42,215
Some days you'll experience
drowsiness, nausea...

763
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:44,884
...and other days you'll
feel perfectly fine.

764
00:54:45,927 --> 00:54:47,637
Am I going to lose my hair?

765
00:54:48,138 --> 00:54:48,972
Maybe.

766
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:52,350
Maybe not. It varies
with each person.

767
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:54,644
Let's do it.

768
00:54:55,645 --> 00:54:56,688
Good.

769
00:54:57,438 --> 00:54:58,356
When?

770
00:54:59,607 --> 00:55:01,901
I'm available tomorrow evening.

771
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:04,904
Tomorrow's bad.
Spaghetti and meatball night.

772
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:06,948
Ben really looks forward--

773
00:55:07,198 --> 00:55:09,409
Okay, tomorrow's good. Fine.

774
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:21,587
Hi, honey. How you doing?

775
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:24,465
Mom, I've been
waiting for your call.

776
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:27,301
-You won't believe it.
-What?

777
00:55:27,552 --> 00:55:30,388
-I'm telepathetic.
-You mean telepathic.

778
00:55:30,638 --> 00:55:32,265
That's what I said.

779
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:36,102
I just discovered it today.
I can read minds.

780
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,395
No way.

781
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:40,898
I just tried it with Dad
and lsabel, and guess what.

782
00:55:41,148 --> 00:55:42,149
What?

783
00:55:42,483 --> 00:55:45,152
I always knew exactly
what they were thinking.

784
00:55:45,778 --> 00:55:47,405
That is incredible.

785
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:49,615
-Want me to read yours?
-Absolutely.

786
00:55:49,865 --> 00:55:53,035
-Think real hard about something.
-I'm thinking.

787
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:55,246
Close your eyes.

788
00:55:56,288 --> 00:55:58,332
Concentrate.

789
00:55:58,749 --> 00:56:00,459
I am concentrating.

790
00:56:03,712 --> 00:56:05,840
You're thinking about me!

791
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,426
That is amazing.

792
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:11,011
What else?

793
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:15,057
You're wishing you were
here instead of where you are.

794
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,310
That's for sure.

795
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:20,229
Where are you, anyway?

796
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:23,566
I'm in bed, with the flu.

797
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:26,110
And I'm green and barfing.

798
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,736
I knew that.

799
00:56:28,279 --> 00:56:30,572
You're wishing you were here
making me spaghetti...

800
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:33,659
...so I wouldn't have to eat
Daddy's sucky lamb chop.

801
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,619
You're right about that.

802
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:38,580
-See? I'm pathatelic.
-Telepathic.

803
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:40,833
That's what I said.

804
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:46,797
-When am I going to see you?
-Tomorrow after school.

805
00:56:48,132 --> 00:56:50,342
I was wishing I'd see you tonight.

806
00:56:52,094 --> 00:56:56,390
We'll have to have one of our
dream dates and meet somewhere special.

807
00:56:56,682 --> 00:57:00,978
In our dreams. Where haven't we been
in a while? How about Disneyland?

808
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:03,814
Last time, the lines
were too long.

809
00:57:06,608 --> 00:57:07,818
The beach.

810
00:57:10,404 --> 00:57:12,447
On a hot summer day.

811
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:15,158
With gigantic waves.

812
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:17,035
And boogie boards.

813
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:18,495
And corn dogs.

814
00:57:19,204 --> 00:57:20,497
Awesome.

815
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:24,835
Cool! All right, don't forget
to put on your sunblock, okay?

816
00:57:26,419 --> 00:57:28,922
It's a dream.
You don't need sunblock.

817
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,050
That's right. I forgot.

818
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:36,012
Mommy, you still there?

819
00:57:36,972 --> 00:57:38,515
Ben? Time for dinner.

820
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:40,433
I got to go.
See you tonight, okay?

821
00:57:40,684 --> 00:57:41,851
All right.

822
00:57:42,352 --> 00:57:44,396
I'll see you in my dreams.

823
00:57:45,063 --> 00:57:46,231
I love you.

824
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:12,674
She doesn't have
that killer instinct.

825
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:14,133
Defense, fall back!

826
00:58:33,861 --> 00:58:35,154
You feeling all right?

827
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:37,156
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm great.

828
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,450
You look a little tired.

829
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:44,205
I hate when people say that. It's a
polite way to say you look like shit.

830
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:49,126
-I didn't mean it like that.
-I just have some things on my mind.

831
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:56,550
You've been really busy lately.

832
00:58:58,678 --> 00:58:59,679
Are you...

833
00:59:00,554 --> 00:59:02,014
...seeing somebody?

834
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:08,813
No. I wish that was
the reason I was tired.

835
00:59:12,399 --> 00:59:14,693
I've been spending time
with my old boss...

836
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:18,239
...trying to decide whether I'll
go back to Random House.

837
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,449
Really? That would be great.

838
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:23,577
Oh, Ben. Easy, easy, easy.

839
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:28,582
Ben, Ben, be careful.

840
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:31,710
You're a dead man, Captain Blood!

841
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,890
That was cool.

842
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,810
Sweetie, can you move your leg?

843
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:49,186
Does it hurt?

844
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:50,479
Are you okay?

845
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:54,191
Yeah. Can I still go
to Tucker's party tomorrow?

846
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:59,488
Probably. But we must
have somebody look at it.

847
00:59:59,821 --> 01:00:02,032
We'll go to the emergency room.

848
01:00:14,127 --> 01:00:15,837
-Five stitches.
-Is he okay?

849
01:00:16,088 --> 01:00:17,798
-He's fine.
-He's not crying?

850
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:21,468
-Can I see my son now?
-I need your insurance information.

851
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,928
I'll do this.

852
01:00:23,136 --> 01:00:24,930
He's in 1 52.

853
01:00:31,144 --> 01:00:34,147
-I don't see any broken bones.
-You don't have any.

854
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,651
I'm very proud of you.
You were awfully brave today.

855
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:42,322
It didn't hurt that bad. Besides,
it'll be cool to show my friends.

856
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,283
Would you do me a favor?

857
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,203
Maybe. Depends what it is.

858
01:00:48,703 --> 01:00:51,873
Will you ask Dad to give me
a white dove for Christmas?

859
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,083
We'll see.

860
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,250
Come on!

861
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:58,129
Every magician needs a white dove.
A real one. They do.

862
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,215
That's a long way off.

863
01:01:00,465 --> 01:01:03,885
I think we should talk
to your mom and just see, okay?

864
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:06,262
Does it hurt again?

865
01:01:07,138 --> 01:01:08,139
Lay back.

866
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:09,891
Take a deep breath.

867
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,063
Will you sing me a song?

868
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,399
My mom always sings to me
when I get hurt.

869
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,659
Hard to think of
a song on the spot.

870
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:35,333
If I needed you

871
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,170
Would you come to me

872
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,757
Would you come to me

873
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,344
And ease my pain?

874
01:01:47,762 --> 01:01:49,555
If you needed me

875
01:01:50,932 --> 01:01:52,892
I would come to you

876
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,521
I would swim the sea

877
01:01:59,023 --> 01:02:01,150
For to ease your pain

878
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:05,863
Feel better?

879
01:02:06,197 --> 01:02:07,365
A little bit?

880
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:13,996
It puts a girl on the spot.

881
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:17,267
Hi. It's Jackie.

882
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:19,645
I just got a call
from Random House.

883
01:03:19,936 --> 01:03:22,606
They want me to meet
an editor this afternoon.

884
01:03:22,814 --> 01:03:27,027
But I won't get back in time
to pick up Ben at Tucker's party.

885
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:30,072
Good. Great.

886
01:03:33,158 --> 01:03:35,202
Ben will be happy too.

887
01:03:36,077 --> 01:03:37,787
That you'll pick him up.

888
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:39,372
It's 4:30.

889
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:43,251
At 22 Williams Road.

890
01:03:46,046 --> 01:03:46,880
Great.

891
01:03:49,299 --> 01:03:50,216
Thanks.

892
01:04:36,971 --> 01:04:38,765
How hard can this be?

893
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:55,865
It's going to be okay.

894
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:04,999
-Directory assistance. What city?
-Manhattan.

895
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:08,169
-What listing?
-The number for Random House.

896
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:14,592
May I speak with
Jackie Harrison?

897
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:16,552
Mrs. Harrison's not here.

898
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:19,055
She has a meeting
with the editor.

899
01:05:19,305 --> 01:05:22,725
I'm picking up Benjamin from
a party and I lost the address.

900
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:24,977
I need to speak to her a second.

901
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:26,687
I'm the senior editor.

902
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:30,232
I haven't seen Mrs. Harrison
since she left Random House...

903
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:31,942
... eleven years ago.

904
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:38,115
Okay. Thanks anyway.

905
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:39,199
Balloons.

906
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:40,534
I beg your pardon?

907
01:05:40,784 --> 01:05:43,454
Look for a house with balloons.
It never fails.

908
01:05:43,704 --> 01:05:45,331
The kids will be there.

909
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,833
Thanks very much.

910
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,298
Look at you.

911
01:06:37,174 --> 01:06:38,300
Come here.

912
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:39,885
Can you see me?

913
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:42,846
You had a good time?

914
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:48,518
Let's clean your shirt.
How was Tucker's party?

915
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:49,644
Good.

916
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:53,899
-Did he like the present?
-Yeah.

917
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,902
Did they have the snake guy
or the magician?

918
01:06:58,153 --> 01:06:59,529
Snake guy.

919
01:07:00,864 --> 01:07:01,781
It bit Tucker.

920
01:07:02,282 --> 01:07:04,326
It bit Tucker? Did it eat him?

921
01:07:38,401 --> 01:07:41,404
Did you have trouble
finding the place?

922
01:07:41,654 --> 01:07:42,488
No.

923
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:44,782
Well, thanks.

924
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:52,373
I know your secret.

925
01:07:55,918 --> 01:07:58,212
I saw the tickets and note
from your new boss.

926
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:01,757
You're not working at Random House
in New York. I talked to them.

927
01:08:01,966 --> 01:08:04,719
You're taking the kids
and moving to Los Angeles.

928
01:08:04,969 --> 01:08:07,263
What the hell are you doing,
reading my mail?

929
01:08:07,513 --> 01:08:09,640
Snooping around like some...

930
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:10,933
...little dishonest--

931
01:08:11,183 --> 01:08:12,435
Dishonest?!

932
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:16,188
I wouldn't have to snoop around
if you were honest with Luke.

933
01:08:17,773 --> 01:08:20,276
I'd have thought this
answered your prayers.

934
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:24,363
You lose the witch and her two
little brats in one swoop.

935
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:26,866
Simplifies everything.
You get your life back.

936
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:30,744
There's lots of publishing houses.
Surely you can get a job in New York.

937
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:35,291
I'm supposed to rearrange my life
to accommodate your schedules?

938
01:08:35,499 --> 01:08:38,669
If you're concerned,
why don't you get a new career?

939
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:41,005
Why don't you and Luke
move to Los Angeles?

940
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:44,717
You can rearrange everyone's life
without consulting us.

941
01:08:44,925 --> 01:08:47,595
Bi-coastal parenting.
People do it all the time.

942
01:08:47,845 --> 01:08:49,972
Luke gets the kids one month
during the summer...

943
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:52,182
...and every other holiday.
It's not ideal but it works.

944
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:53,809
No, you can't do that.

945
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:56,020
You can't take
the kids away from him.

946
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,522
-We can't live like that!
-We?!

947
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:02,192
Luke has a problem,
tell him to talk to me.

948
01:09:02,443 --> 01:09:04,945
This is not about you.
This is not your problem.

949
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:07,030
It is my problem.

950
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:08,407
Why's that?

951
01:09:09,616 --> 01:09:11,410
Because I'm marrying him.

952
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:15,455
We're going to share our
life together. I love him.

953
01:09:16,748 --> 01:09:20,085
His kids are everything to him,
and he would be devastated...

954
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:22,045
...not to be near them.

955
01:09:47,362 --> 01:09:49,573
You guessed the wrong secret.

956
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:56,621
Charlie Drummond...

957
01:09:57,664 --> 01:10:01,167
...is a colleague of mine from
Random House in New York.

958
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:06,214
She moved to the West Coast office.
I'll crash with her...

959
01:10:06,423 --> 01:10:08,633
...while I get protein injections...

960
01:10:08,883 --> 01:10:11,386
...that are recommended
by my oncologist.

961
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,514
You can only get them
in Los Angeles.

962
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:16,182
Oncologist?

963
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:19,185
Life's a tradeoff.

964
01:10:19,394 --> 01:10:22,730
It's finally legal to smoke dope,
but you got to have cancer.

965
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:30,363
Are you dying?

966
01:10:36,244 --> 01:10:37,704
Not today.

967
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,464
We'll beat it.

968
01:10:49,298 --> 01:10:51,092
It's a walk in the park.

969
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:55,138
Thanks for the ''we.''

970
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,894
You're not alone
in this, you know.

971
01:11:03,312 --> 01:11:05,356
You don't have
to go through this alone.

972
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:07,608
You know that.

973
01:11:08,818 --> 01:11:10,862
You understand what I'm saying?

974
01:11:21,289 --> 01:11:23,249
What will we tell the kids?

975
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:28,963
We should tell them the truth.

976
01:11:31,757 --> 01:11:33,384
They can handle it.

977
01:11:39,765 --> 01:11:42,309
It should've been me instead of you.

978
01:11:46,522 --> 01:11:48,399
I'll go along with that.

979
01:12:04,665 --> 01:12:05,874
Look out.

980
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:08,419
You didn't see.

981
01:12:09,461 --> 01:12:10,921
Gotcha!

982
01:12:13,549 --> 01:12:16,009
Did he beat you?
Here, 35 marshmallows.

983
01:12:16,343 --> 01:12:18,804
35.
Your sister put them in.

984
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:23,100
What's going on?
Who's marrying who this time?

985
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:24,810
Mommy's marrying lsabel.

986
01:12:25,018 --> 01:12:26,311
So cute.

987
01:12:29,982 --> 01:12:32,234
-Guys, Mommy's sick.
-You still have the flu?

988
01:12:33,277 --> 01:12:36,697
I have cancer.
Do you know what that is?

989
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,159
It's what Aunt Mary died from.

990
01:12:42,786 --> 01:12:44,746
Aunt Mary had a different kind.

991
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:47,207
There's different kinds.
Hers was very...

992
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:48,875
...very bad.

993
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:53,713
Is yours bad?

994
01:12:54,673 --> 01:12:57,425
I've been working with a doctor...

995
01:12:57,676 --> 01:13:00,762
...and she says we have
every reason to hope...

996
01:13:01,054 --> 01:13:03,014
...that I'm going to be fine.

997
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,187
Check this out. Look at this.

998
01:13:09,437 --> 01:13:10,438
So cool.

999
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:11,982
It's okay.

1000
01:13:12,774 --> 01:13:13,525
Look at this.

1001
01:13:13,775 --> 01:13:15,986
I don't have to go to
the hospital for medicine.

1002
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,363
It looks like Game Boy.

1003
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:20,156
It kind of is.

1004
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:22,742
It'll make me strong,
so I can fight the disease.

1005
01:13:22,992 --> 01:13:23,910
Cool.

1006
01:13:25,703 --> 01:13:27,080
Can I catch cancer?

1007
01:13:27,413 --> 01:13:29,958
No, sweetie.
It's not contagious.

1008
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:33,044
So you've known about this
for a long time.

1009
01:13:34,504 --> 01:13:35,421
Yeah.

1010
01:13:36,464 --> 01:13:37,924
And you never told me.

1011
01:13:38,258 --> 01:13:39,342
Sweetheart...

1012
01:13:39,884 --> 01:13:42,262
...your mom wanted to wait
until the right time.

1013
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:44,264
Guys, I'm sorry.

1014
01:13:44,514 --> 01:13:45,765
Look, I just....

1015
01:13:47,183 --> 01:13:48,893
I know how scared
I get when you're sick.

1016
01:13:49,143 --> 01:13:52,313
I thought it would be best
to wait until it got smaller.

1017
01:13:52,855 --> 01:13:55,692
So you lied.
You lied when you never told me.

1018
01:13:55,942 --> 01:13:59,278
Maybe you're lying now.
I can never believe you again!

1019
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:00,446
I made a mistake.

1020
01:14:00,696 --> 01:14:02,156
People make mistakes.

1021
01:14:03,282 --> 01:14:04,408
Where's lsabel?

1022
01:14:04,784 --> 01:14:06,077
-What?
-It's Thursday.

1023
01:14:06,327 --> 01:14:08,287
She should've picked us up.

1024
01:14:08,538 --> 01:14:09,622
I'd rather be with Mommy.

1025
01:14:09,872 --> 01:14:12,792
Well, she's dying.
Isabel's your mother now.

1026
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:14,001
Don't say that.

1027
01:14:20,341 --> 01:14:22,051
Don't run out on your mother.

1028
01:14:23,302 --> 01:14:25,096
No, that's your job.

1029
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,687
-I'm sorry you're sick.
-What?

1030
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:17,856
I said I'm sorry you're sick.

1031
01:15:18,065 --> 01:15:19,525
I can't hear you.

1032
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:21,110
Turn down the music!

1033
01:15:26,073 --> 01:15:26,990
What?

1034
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:29,034
I said...

1035
01:15:29,368 --> 01:15:31,245
...l'm sorry you're sick.

1036
01:15:32,913 --> 01:15:34,957
That's what I thought you said.

1037
01:15:37,209 --> 01:15:38,377
So what are you guys doing?

1038
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:41,755
Marvin and I are getting
our act together, right?

1039
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:43,173
Right, Tammi.

1040
01:15:45,425 --> 01:15:47,219
That's one of lsabel's songs.

1041
01:15:47,511 --> 01:15:52,140
Isabel might know the words, babe,
but I invented the moves.

1042
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:53,350
Right, Marvin?

1043
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,434
Right, Tammi.

1044
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:55,894
In fact...

1045
01:15:57,229 --> 01:16:00,482
...we're looking for somebody
to do backup with us.

1046
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:02,692
-Right, Marvin?
-Yeah, Tammi!

1047
01:16:49,864 --> 01:16:50,782
Oh, my God!

1048
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:53,743
Cool!

1049
01:17:08,382 --> 01:17:09,217
Sing it!

1050
01:17:45,377 --> 01:17:47,505
This land is your land

1051
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:49,924
This land is my land

1052
01:17:50,174 --> 01:17:51,967
From California

1053
01:17:52,593 --> 01:17:54,303
To the New York islands

1054
01:17:54,762 --> 01:17:56,555
From the redwood forests

1055
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:59,016
To the Gulf Stream waters

1056
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,103
This land was made
for you and me

1057
01:18:05,272 --> 01:18:08,525
As I was walking
That ribbon of highway

1058
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,903
I saw above me

1059
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,447
That endless skyway

1060
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,866
I saw below me

1061
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,993
That golden valley

1062
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:22,873
This land was made
For you and me

1063
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:38,013
You look great!

1064
01:18:39,264 --> 01:18:42,351
Your dad's meeting's running
late so I came to watch.

1065
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,271
I have to tell you something.

1066
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:48,023
You're having
Michael Jackson's baby.

1067
01:18:48,315 --> 01:18:50,817
That, and Anna is over her head...

1068
01:18:51,068 --> 01:18:53,111
...for Brad ''The Flame'' Kovitsky.

1069
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,781
No way!
I can't believe she would....

1070
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:58,408
After how he was with all
the girls in class!

1071
01:18:59,284 --> 01:19:01,328
I didn't know anything about this.

1072
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:04,623
She was afraid you'd make a big deal.
They've been going out for 2 weeks.

1073
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:06,791
Which, in the 6th grade,
doesn't mean anything.

1074
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:10,629
They don't ''go'' anywhere.
It's just their declaration--

1075
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,589
I know. I had kids of my own once.

1076
01:19:12,839 --> 01:19:15,508
Anyway, today, in the lunchyard...

1077
01:19:15,759 --> 01:19:19,471
...he announces publicly
that he's breaking up with her.

1078
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:22,891
In front of everybody?
That little shit!

1079
01:19:23,183 --> 01:19:24,643
Not you. Just go.

1080
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:27,479
That's the point of going out.

1081
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,856
So one of them can dump the other...

1082
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:33,193
...and they can act out
this passionate adult...

1083
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:34,235
...soap opera tragedy.

1084
01:19:34,694 --> 01:19:35,612
She must be devastated.

1085
01:19:35,862 --> 01:19:39,282
She cried in the girls' room.
You think you've got problems.

1086
01:19:39,532 --> 01:19:40,909
This is serious.

1087
01:19:47,248 --> 01:19:48,249
So, my point.

1088
01:19:48,499 --> 01:19:50,043
I pick her up from school.

1089
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:53,338
She tells me the whole story
and asks me what to do.

1090
01:19:53,546 --> 01:19:55,673
-What did you say?
-'' Beats me. Ask your mom.''

1091
01:19:56,507 --> 01:19:58,384
So she's going to. Tomorrow.

1092
01:19:58,718 --> 01:20:00,345
-Be ready.
-I'm ready. I'm ready.

1093
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,598
What is this?

1094
01:20:03,806 --> 01:20:07,226
Thanksgiving dinner. These are
the Clintons. We're having dinner.

1095
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,103
That is my son...

1096
01:20:09,353 --> 01:20:11,147
...the turkey.

1097
01:20:33,502 --> 01:20:34,337
Did they...?

1098
01:20:34,587 --> 01:20:37,757
Yeah. They killed him.
But he does it so great.

1099
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:50,227
But did you really think,
at 1 2...

1100
01:20:50,436 --> 01:20:53,939
...you'd meet someone you'd
want to spend your life with?

1101
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:55,441
No.

1102
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,860
Every time I'm on the lunchyard...

1103
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:00,779
...and he's with 1 0 of his
butt-kissing little weasels--

1104
01:21:00,988 --> 01:21:02,865
You don't like his friends.

1105
01:21:03,115 --> 01:21:06,118
They yell, ''There goes the Virgin Queen''
or ''The lce Princess'' ...

1106
01:21:06,368 --> 01:21:09,705
...or some clever cut like that.
Like it hurts me.

1107
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:11,874
You didn't let him kiss you.

1108
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,543
Not with my mouth open.

1109
01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:18,797
That's my girl. Good for you.

1110
01:21:19,131 --> 01:21:22,968
Does that mean you let him kiss
you with your mouth shut?

1111
01:21:25,179 --> 01:21:27,222
Sorry. Okay. Right.

1112
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:30,601
What do you say to him when
he says something like that?

1113
01:21:30,893 --> 01:21:34,313
I call him a fart-face or
a pervert or something equally lame.

1114
01:21:34,563 --> 01:21:37,232
Sweetheart, you have
to just ignore him.

1115
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:40,360
He doesn't exist. You don't
see him, you don't hear him.

1116
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:42,738
He's just nothing. He's not there.

1117
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:45,115
You are too much of a woman...

1118
01:21:45,365 --> 01:21:46,533
...to even...

1119
01:21:46,783 --> 01:21:48,410
...bother with such a little...

1120
01:21:48,702 --> 01:21:50,245
...boy as him.

1121
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:52,205
You're kidding.

1122
01:21:52,414 --> 01:21:54,708
No. I mean, all he
wants is the attention.

1123
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:56,752
Once he doesn't get it,
he might try harder...

1124
01:21:57,044 --> 01:21:59,463
...but then he'll get
frustrated and give up.

1125
01:21:59,713 --> 01:22:01,673
So I ignore him.
Keep my mouth shut.

1126
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:06,428
You think lsabel would do that?

1127
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:13,518
It's just, she's younger.
Maybe she remembers how to do this.

1128
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:16,521
So this will work?

1129
01:23:08,072 --> 01:23:09,282
Sweetie.

1130
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:11,200
What's wrong?

1131
01:23:11,451 --> 01:23:12,285
Nothing.

1132
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:14,245
Is it time for you
to go to L.A.?

1133
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:18,207
No, it's still nighttime.
And it's snowing.

1134
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,710
I got a babysitter for Ben.

1135
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:23,296
Do you want to go
someplace special with me?

1136
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:24,755
Right now?

1137
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:26,048
Yes.

1138
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:28,467
Okay. Just you and me.

1139
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:08,716
I'm never going to forget this.

1140
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:10,259
Never say never.

1141
01:24:12,303 --> 01:24:13,137
Well...

1142
01:24:13,387 --> 01:24:16,473
...there's a loophole.
You can say '' never, never'' ...

1143
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:20,227
...if you mean it enough
to say it twice.

1144
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:29,987
I'll remember always, always.

1145
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:34,366
Promise, promise?

1146
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:05,105
Move that carriage to the end
of the street and start again.

1147
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,025
Everybody keep moving.

1148
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,115
Go back to the starting point.

1149
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:16,241
1 :45.

1150
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:20,745
Want a lens?

1151
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,956
Thanks, everybody!
That's a wrap!

1152
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:25,917
Thank you for a great day, folks.

1153
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:31,298
It's 1 :45. I told you, I have to
pick up Anna and Benjamin.

1154
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:33,675
You have to finish.

1155
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:37,178
I've got it in the can.
Coop can wrap the equipment.

1156
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:38,722
This is my star account.

1157
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:42,017
These clients need choices.
They need variety.

1158
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:46,271
I shot it 20 different angles.
They'll have variety. Trust me.

1159
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:47,981
I don't.

1160
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:52,402
What are you saying?

1161
01:25:54,946 --> 01:25:57,365
I'm saying that you're
the best I've got.

1162
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:01,119
Probably the best
I've ever worked with.

1163
01:26:01,494 --> 01:26:04,998
But these last couple of months,
your work is slipping.

1164
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:09,127
It's still fine,
but you've lost your edge.

1165
01:26:09,335 --> 01:26:10,169
Your focus.

1166
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:12,005
Your dedication.

1167
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:14,424
And your attitude...

1168
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:17,385
...is very disappointing.

1169
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,056
You're making
a career decision here.

1170
01:26:24,016 --> 01:26:26,686
If you walk now,
I'll have to let you go.

1171
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:38,072
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1172
01:26:48,332 --> 01:26:49,292
Damn.

1173
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:55,339
It's okay. Don't worry.
It's going to be fine.

1174
01:27:14,608 --> 01:27:15,818
Hey, guys.

1175
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,987
Sorry I'm late.

1176
01:27:25,327 --> 01:27:27,705
Why don't you go
sit in the car, buddy?

1177
01:27:28,247 --> 01:27:30,207
-Don't drive away.
-I won't.

1178
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:32,710
What happened?

1179
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:39,675
You know that boy I was telling
you about, Brad Kovitsky?

1180
01:27:40,801 --> 01:27:44,638
He's been a real jerk lately,
and my mom told me to ignore him.

1181
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:46,306
So today...

1182
01:27:46,515 --> 01:27:47,683
...l did.

1183
01:27:48,183 --> 01:27:49,893
You know what he called me?

1184
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:54,940
He called me '' Frosty the Snow-bitch.''
ln front of everyone.

1185
01:27:57,734 --> 01:27:59,528
Men can be scum.

1186
01:27:59,778 --> 01:28:00,779
Yes, they can.

1187
01:28:01,029 --> 01:28:03,156
Is that little bastard here?
I'll kick his ass.

1188
01:28:03,407 --> 01:28:05,867
No, his mother's always on time.

1189
01:28:11,415 --> 01:28:12,582
I have an idea.

1190
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:16,044
No, thanks. I don't need
advice from a stepmother.

1191
01:28:24,344 --> 01:28:28,098
I can see how sitting out here
in the cold and snow, crying...

1192
01:28:28,348 --> 01:28:32,018
...seems like a far superior
idea to listening to...

1193
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:33,812
...a stepmother.

1194
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:37,649
But for kicks,
let's lose the title.

1195
01:28:38,858 --> 01:28:42,737
Seems to me you have a choice:
You can pretend to be an adult...

1196
01:28:42,988 --> 01:28:44,781
...or you can actually be one.

1197
01:28:45,115 --> 01:28:45,949
So...

1198
01:28:48,034 --> 01:28:51,788
...sit here in the cold,
crying...

1199
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:54,582
...by yourself...

1200
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,084
...or...

1201
01:28:57,585 --> 01:28:59,212
...do something about it...

1202
01:29:00,046 --> 01:29:01,047
...together.

1203
01:29:03,383 --> 01:29:04,634
Crying.

1204
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:07,220
Do something.

1205
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:12,850
What's it going to be?

1206
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:17,772
Do something.

1207
01:29:23,444 --> 01:29:26,364
Can we start by covering up
my stepmother wart?

1208
01:29:26,614 --> 01:29:28,658
Because it must be showing.

1209
01:29:30,993 --> 01:29:31,953
Punk.

1210
01:29:32,662 --> 01:29:34,288
It's cold. Let's go.

1211
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,290
Benjamin will drive us home.

1212
01:29:41,712 --> 01:29:44,090
Okay, come on!
Come on! Come on!

1213
01:29:47,593 --> 01:29:49,720
Next week, after school...

1214
01:29:50,721 --> 01:29:52,181
...you walk up to him...

1215
01:29:52,556 --> 01:29:53,474
...with...

1216
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:54,850
...attitude.

1217
01:29:55,393 --> 01:29:56,560
You hear me?

1218
01:29:57,561 --> 01:29:58,604
And you say:

1219
01:29:59,105 --> 01:30:00,981
'' Listen up, limp-dick...

1220
01:30:04,402 --> 01:30:07,988
...because I'll only say this once:
As far as your...

1221
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,490
...pitiful...

1222
01:30:09,782 --> 01:30:13,536
...knowledge of what a woman
really wants goes...

1223
01:30:13,744 --> 01:30:17,790
...l am not going to waste my time
with some loser...

1224
01:30:18,082 --> 01:30:20,751
...who doesn't even know
what snowblowing is.''

1225
01:30:23,504 --> 01:30:24,338
What is it?

1226
01:30:30,052 --> 01:30:33,639
It's a disgusting and
not even remotely sexy thing...

1227
01:30:33,847 --> 01:30:37,101
...l heard described in a movie
I'd never take you to.

1228
01:30:37,976 --> 01:30:39,228
But it is real.

1229
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,270
Now...

1230
01:30:41,605 --> 01:30:42,856
...the clincher:

1231
01:30:44,483 --> 01:30:46,026
You walk away...

1232
01:30:46,985 --> 01:30:48,529
...then you...

1233
01:30:49,363 --> 01:30:50,197
...whip around...

1234
01:30:51,865 --> 01:30:53,075
...and say:

1235
01:30:54,576 --> 01:30:56,703
''The guy I see is in high school...

1236
01:30:56,912 --> 01:30:59,331
...and it has to be said...

1237
01:30:59,581 --> 01:31:03,335
...he laughs his ass off
whenever we talk about you.''

1238
01:31:04,086 --> 01:31:05,963
I don't know anyone in high school.

1239
01:31:07,464 --> 01:31:10,050
There will be a suitable boy...

1240
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:14,596
...outside your school
on Monday at 2:30 with...

1241
01:31:14,846 --> 01:31:16,473
...a very expensive bike.

1242
01:31:16,723 --> 01:31:21,186
And he will be a stone fox, even if
I have to call an escort service.

1243
01:31:23,063 --> 01:31:24,773
I've had the worst day.

1244
01:31:25,482 --> 01:31:26,775
Until now.

1245
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:31,029
Me too.

1246
01:31:34,115 --> 01:31:37,953
United Airlines announces
the arrival of Flight 86...

1247
01:31:38,245 --> 01:31:39,955
...service from Los Angeles.

1248
01:31:40,205 --> 01:31:43,959
Deplaning passengers may be met
at gate number 12.

1249
01:31:46,962 --> 01:31:48,505
I'll get your bags.

1250
01:31:48,713 --> 01:31:50,924
The taxis are just over there.

1251
01:31:51,758 --> 01:31:52,967
Surprise!

1252
01:31:57,347 --> 01:31:59,224
Why is she in a wheelchair?

1253
01:31:59,599 --> 01:32:03,728
She's traveled a long way. She's tired.
Give her a hug. Be gentle.

1254
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,730
Look at this guy.

1255
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:08,608
Let's go home.

1256
01:32:10,276 --> 01:32:13,863
-Welcome back.
-Thanks. What a great surprise.

1257
01:32:27,418 --> 01:32:28,961
Hey, let me out!

1258
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:31,339
Your brother's got to get out.

1259
01:32:32,173 --> 01:32:33,383
Sorry.

1260
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:37,095
I'm in the family too, you know.

1261
01:32:46,938 --> 01:32:49,232
-What's up?
-We have a surprise for you.

1262
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:50,650
No way.

1263
01:32:50,942 --> 01:32:53,194
-What is it?
-We can't tell you. It's a surprise.

1264
01:32:53,444 --> 01:32:54,362
Come on, tell me.

1265
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:56,322
-Ben, tell me.
-No way!

1266
01:32:56,572 --> 01:32:57,949
-Come on. Tell me.
-No way.

1267
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:00,326
Close your eyes.

1268
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:03,204
Step.

1269
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:07,458
You're almost there.
Don't open your eyes.

1270
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,710
Just a little peek?

1271
01:33:09,919 --> 01:33:10,836
Gosh!

1272
01:33:12,421 --> 01:33:14,048
Come in! Come in!

1273
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:17,092
All right, ready?
One, two, three...

1274
01:33:17,343 --> 01:33:18,469
...open!

1275
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:47,373
Isn't it great?

1276
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,416
Isabel did it.

1277
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:09,144
I'm working on a Christmas project
for Ben and Anna...

1278
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:12,731
...and there aren't any recent photos
of me with the kids.

1279
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:14,900
I was just wondering...

1280
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,527
...if you'd take some.

1281
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:20,238
Sure. Love to.

1282
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,908
Thanks.

1283
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:32,000
Hey, guys, wait up.
Wait up for me!

1284
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:39,758
Stop there for a second.

1285
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:40,967
Great!

1286
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:43,136
Perfect.

1287
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,722
Benjamin, that's a dazzling
display of horsemanship.

1288
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:47,933
Come on, you lazy horse, get up!

1289
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,823
''One day, five men came
in funny hats...

1290
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:07,160
...to pick the biggest, fastest,
roughest bull to fight...

1291
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,746
...in the bullfights in Madrid.''

1292
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,106
Hi, Mom!

1293
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:48,743
Are you okay?

1294
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:50,453
There we go.

1295
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:52,788
Almost.

1296
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:57,335
Well, almost not falling.
That was the first time he fell.

1297
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,086
Awesome fall.

1298
01:35:59,378 --> 01:36:01,505
Are you going to try it again?

1299
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,299
One over here. Everybody.

1300
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:05,676
Cheese!

1301
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,097
Are you going back?

1302
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:11,182
More?

1303
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:12,975
All right!

1304
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:15,352
Go for it. I'm watching.

1305
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,487
Ben was born in 2 hours,
went to the breast...

1306
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,323
...and camped there
for the next four days.

1307
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:29,200
Always with this...

1308
01:36:29,533 --> 01:36:33,913
...mischievous look on his face.
Like he had a secret or something.

1309
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,457
And his...

1310
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:37,666
...blanket...

1311
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:41,045
...always looked like a cape.
Even the nurses said so.

1312
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:45,090
He loves hearing that story
over and over.

1313
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,593
About how he was born a magician.

1314
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,512
And her?

1315
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:52,639
Twenty-eight hours.

1316
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:56,894
The doctors wanted
to go in and get her.

1317
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:01,648
But I knew she'd come in her own time.
That's just the way she is.

1318
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:04,693
Can't let anybody rush her.

1319
01:37:06,445 --> 01:37:08,238
I'll keep that in mind.

1320
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:31,970
It didn't work, did it?

1321
01:37:33,221 --> 01:37:34,222
I'm sorry.

1322
01:37:35,557 --> 01:37:37,684
You did everything you could.

1323
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,812
There are still options.

1324
01:37:41,062 --> 01:37:45,108
There's a treatment in Paris, one in
Switzerland, both recommended--

1325
01:37:45,358 --> 01:37:46,818
Thanks, but...

1326
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:50,530
...l think I want to spend...

1327
01:37:50,864 --> 01:37:52,490
...my time at home...

1328
01:37:52,866 --> 01:37:54,326
...with my family.

1329
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:04,335
Christmas will be here
before you know it.

1330
01:38:45,501 --> 01:38:49,881
-I thought you might need one of these.
-I do. It looks great.

1331
01:39:01,058 --> 01:39:02,226
A little more.

1332
01:39:02,602 --> 01:39:03,686
A little more.

1333
01:39:03,936 --> 01:39:04,937
Okay.

1334
01:39:05,187 --> 01:39:07,231
I think that's fine. Stop.

1335
01:39:07,732 --> 01:39:09,108
Perfect.

1336
01:39:10,401 --> 01:39:12,194
Smells great too.

1337
01:39:14,488 --> 01:39:15,573
Thanks.

1338
01:39:29,462 --> 01:39:31,922
What are we supposed to do
without you?

1339
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:35,759
You'll be fine.

1340
01:39:37,553 --> 01:39:39,430
You're a great father.

1341
01:39:44,727 --> 01:39:46,520
I just never really....

1342
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:49,523
I didn't give you
the chance to realize it.

1343
01:39:56,655 --> 01:39:57,573
Thank you.

1344
01:40:02,995 --> 01:40:04,371
Merry Christmas.

1345
01:40:24,891 --> 01:40:27,978
As for your pitiful knowledge
of what a woman really wants...

1346
01:40:28,228 --> 01:40:30,480
...l'm not wasting my time
on some loser...

1347
01:40:30,731 --> 01:40:33,233
...who doesn't even know
what snowblowing is.

1348
01:40:33,775 --> 01:40:34,735
Good one.

1349
01:40:35,402 --> 01:40:36,862
And the guy I see...

1350
01:40:37,154 --> 01:40:39,614
...is in high school, and
it has to be said...

1351
01:40:39,865 --> 01:40:43,285
...that every time we talk about you,
he laughs his ass off.

1352
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:44,870
Yeah, right.

1353
01:40:45,537 --> 01:40:48,707
You don't believe me?
He's standing right over there.

1354
01:41:01,219 --> 01:41:02,304
No way.

1355
01:41:03,263 --> 01:41:04,723
Well, believe it.

1356
01:41:13,857 --> 01:41:15,567
You rule, Anna!
You rule!

1357
01:41:15,775 --> 01:41:16,860
You blew it!

1358
01:41:17,068 --> 01:41:18,111
Loser!

1359
01:41:26,911 --> 01:41:30,081
-What are you doing here?
-Picking up my kids from school.

1360
01:41:31,624 --> 01:41:32,875
Who is that?

1361
01:41:34,085 --> 01:41:37,922
He looks like that guy in his
underwear for Calvin Klein.

1362
01:41:38,172 --> 01:41:40,383
Fully dressed for Ralph Lauren.

1363
01:41:47,473 --> 01:41:49,267
He's such a loser!

1364
01:41:50,601 --> 01:41:51,519
Moron!

1365
01:41:57,358 --> 01:41:59,152
It worked, it worked, it worked!

1366
01:42:02,155 --> 01:42:06,033
Did you see the look on Brad's face?
Thank you so much!

1367
01:42:12,582 --> 01:42:14,917
Okay. ''Limp-dick'' I know.

1368
01:42:15,293 --> 01:42:17,336
What exactly is ''snowblowing''?

1369
01:42:19,213 --> 01:42:20,840
It doesn't matter.
I didn't explain it.

1370
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:25,386
But I'll have to explain it to the
20 or 30 parents who call...

1371
01:42:25,678 --> 01:42:27,221
...in the next half-hour.

1372
01:42:27,513 --> 01:42:28,514
Give them my number.

1373
01:42:28,723 --> 01:42:31,392
I think they'll want to
talk to Anna's mother.

1374
01:42:31,642 --> 01:42:35,229
What are you worried about?
Looking bad at the PTA?

1375
01:42:35,896 --> 01:42:37,439
You defend what you did?

1376
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:40,776
-Right to the ground.
-You put filth in my child's mouth.

1377
01:42:41,026 --> 01:42:42,820
You had her lie about that model.

1378
01:42:43,028 --> 01:42:45,364
And it worked like a charm.

1379
01:42:45,614 --> 01:42:48,617
And you became a hero,
and I became I schmuck.

1380
01:42:50,077 --> 01:42:53,080
Basically, you taught my child...

1381
01:42:53,455 --> 01:42:54,999
...that I am a loser...

1382
01:42:55,291 --> 01:42:57,251
...who doesn't care about her pain.

1383
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:01,630
-That's not what I tried to do.
-That's what you did.

1384
01:43:02,131 --> 01:43:05,801
Did you think I didn't have some dirty
words for that little putz?

1385
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:07,928
That I couldn't figure out
some low blows?

1386
01:43:08,178 --> 01:43:09,304
You weren't passing them out.

1387
01:43:09,555 --> 01:43:13,142
I believe, in a crisis, you have an
opportunity to learn something.

1388
01:43:13,392 --> 01:43:14,643
That's deep.

1389
01:43:15,477 --> 01:43:17,020
It was a lie.

1390
01:43:17,396 --> 01:43:20,732
Winning without dignity or grace
is not winning.

1391
01:43:20,983 --> 01:43:24,861
She has to figure out who she is,
so she can stand up to peer pressure...

1392
01:43:25,112 --> 01:43:26,822
...and steer her own course.

1393
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:29,408
She wasn't steering
her own course.

1394
01:43:29,658 --> 01:43:31,785
She was steering yours.

1395
01:43:31,994 --> 01:43:34,746
That's what parenting
is all about, little girl.

1396
01:43:34,955 --> 01:43:38,542
They are pleading for you to
tell them how to do the right thing.

1397
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:40,502
Sure as hell, that's
what you've done.

1398
01:43:40,752 --> 01:43:43,755
The next time something happens,
and the stakes are high...

1399
01:43:44,005 --> 01:43:48,135
...she'll look back and remember
how easy it was and how good it felt.

1400
01:43:48,385 --> 01:43:52,013
And she'll stand up for herself.
Dear God, what have I done?

1401
01:43:52,264 --> 01:43:54,599
You have turned her into you.

1402
01:43:57,769 --> 01:43:59,563
That's what this is about.

1403
01:44:00,564 --> 01:44:01,940
That's all it's about.

1404
01:44:02,148 --> 01:44:04,359
How would you know
what this is about?

1405
01:44:04,651 --> 01:44:06,194
You haven't been here
from the beginning...

1406
01:44:06,444 --> 01:44:09,614
...worrying every day that
the decisions you're making...

1407
01:44:09,864 --> 01:44:12,283
...will shape the people
they're going to be.

1408
01:44:12,742 --> 01:44:16,246
And you are not what
I want my children to be.

1409
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:22,669
I don't want that, either.

1410
01:44:24,838 --> 01:44:28,883
This isn't about me or you.
It's about them.

1411
01:44:29,425 --> 01:44:32,178
And believe it or not,
I am trying.

1412
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:36,891
And I do have their very...

1413
01:44:37,517 --> 01:44:40,019
...best interests at heart.

1414
01:46:10,317 --> 01:46:13,153
-Would you like a drink?
-Patrón, please. Double.

1415
01:46:15,656 --> 01:46:16,740
What's up?

1416
01:46:25,207 --> 01:46:27,876
Last year, I lost Ben.

1417
01:46:29,002 --> 01:46:29,836
What?

1418
01:46:30,045 --> 01:46:31,838
In the supermarket.

1419
01:46:34,424 --> 01:46:35,968
You're lying.

1420
01:46:36,218 --> 01:46:37,594
It's true.

1421
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:41,556
That's impossible. You could
never lose that kid for one second.

1422
01:46:46,103 --> 01:46:47,270
I did.

1423
01:46:49,022 --> 01:46:50,899
Ben never mentioned it.

1424
01:46:51,817 --> 01:46:54,111
He just remembers I found him.

1425
01:46:55,821 --> 01:46:57,531
Why didn't you tell me?

1426
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:02,661
You know why.

1427
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:12,295
I never wanted to be a mom.

1428
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,301
Well, sharing it with you
is one thing.

1429
01:47:20,428 --> 01:47:23,264
Carrying it alone
the rest of my life...

1430
01:47:25,183 --> 01:47:28,186
...always being compared to you....

1431
01:47:30,021 --> 01:47:30,980
You're perfect.

1432
01:47:32,524 --> 01:47:34,317
They worship you.

1433
01:47:35,568 --> 01:47:39,322
I just don't want to be looking over
my shoulder for 20 years...

1434
01:47:39,822 --> 01:47:41,199
...knowing...

1435
01:47:43,034 --> 01:47:45,411
...that someone else
would've done it right.

1436
01:47:46,496 --> 01:47:47,747
Done it better.

1437
01:47:48,665 --> 01:47:50,541
The way that I can't.

1438
01:47:51,918 --> 01:47:53,961
What do I have that you don't?

1439
01:47:56,089 --> 01:47:58,383
You're Mother Earth incarnate.

1440
01:47:58,925 --> 01:47:59,842
You're...

1441
01:48:00,551 --> 01:48:02,261
...hip and fresh.

1442
01:48:02,512 --> 01:48:03,513
You ride with Anna.

1443
01:48:03,763 --> 01:48:05,139
You'll learn.

1444
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:12,730
You know every story.

1445
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:15,233
Every wound.

1446
01:48:16,526 --> 01:48:18,152
Every memory.

1447
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:24,951
Their whole life's happiness
is wrapped up in you.

1448
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:28,579
Every single moment.

1449
01:48:31,874 --> 01:48:33,250
Don't you get it?

1450
01:48:36,087 --> 01:48:39,006
Look down the road
to her wedding.

1451
01:48:42,802 --> 01:48:44,261
I'm in a room...

1452
01:48:44,887 --> 01:48:46,514
...alone with her.

1453
01:48:50,309 --> 01:48:51,852
Fitting her veil.

1454
01:48:53,729 --> 01:48:55,439
Fluffing her dress.

1455
01:48:57,358 --> 01:48:58,651
Telling her...

1456
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:02,947
...no woman has ever
looked that beautiful.

1457
01:49:12,373 --> 01:49:14,416
And my fear is...

1458
01:49:16,377 --> 01:49:18,253
...that she'll be thinking:

1459
01:49:22,841 --> 01:49:25,177
'' I wish my mom was here.''

1460
01:49:28,805 --> 01:49:29,973
And mine is...

1461
01:49:31,391 --> 01:49:32,684
...she won't.

1462
01:49:39,358 --> 01:49:40,817
But the truth is...

1463
01:49:42,444 --> 01:49:44,655
...she doesn't have to choose.

1464
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:47,991
She can have us both.

1465
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:51,536
Love us both.

1466
01:49:53,538 --> 01:49:56,792
And she will be a better
person because of me...

1467
01:49:58,001 --> 01:49:59,711
...and because of you.

1468
01:50:03,298 --> 01:50:05,342
I have their past...

1469
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:10,555
...and you can have their future.

1470
01:50:30,909 --> 01:50:32,786
Guys, it's Christmas!

1471
01:50:33,036 --> 01:50:33,870
Wake up!

1472
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,581
I hope there's a white dove.

1473
01:50:39,876 --> 01:50:41,669
There has to be a white dove.

1474
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,590
Hark, I hear the gentle
sounds of Benjamin.

1475
01:50:47,175 --> 01:50:50,595
We better get out there before
he opens all the presents.

1476
01:50:54,933 --> 01:50:56,643
Have a little patience.

1477
01:50:58,978 --> 01:51:01,105
Can I open my presents now?

1478
01:51:02,315 --> 01:51:06,235
Your mom wants you to go upstairs
and open presents with her first.

1479
01:51:06,486 --> 01:51:08,696
Then we'll open presents down
here, okay?

1480
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:12,575
Okay. Me first.

1481
01:51:34,096 --> 01:51:35,973
Merry Christmas.

1482
01:51:36,891 --> 01:51:39,810
Sweetie, I think this
has your name on it.

1483
01:51:52,948 --> 01:51:55,326
A real magician's cape.

1484
01:51:55,534 --> 01:51:56,744
Awesome!

1485
01:51:58,204 --> 01:52:00,080
Come here, I'll help you with it.

1486
01:52:00,289 --> 01:52:02,499
What does it have all over it?
Could you see?

1487
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:04,376
Pictures of me and you.

1488
01:52:04,668 --> 01:52:06,045
And this one right here?

1489
01:52:06,253 --> 01:52:07,087
See that one?

1490
01:52:07,296 --> 01:52:10,466
That's our first official photo
of you and me as a couple.

1491
01:52:10,841 --> 01:52:11,842
See that?

1492
01:52:12,051 --> 01:52:14,553
Did you know I was
good-looking right away?

1493
01:52:14,845 --> 01:52:18,349
Everybody in the hospital talked
about it. Are you kidding?

1494
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:22,102
But this good-looking
was beyond my imagination.

1495
01:52:26,982 --> 01:52:28,525
Are you dying?

1496
01:52:34,656 --> 01:52:35,949
What do you think?

1497
01:52:36,575 --> 01:52:37,659
Yes.

1498
01:52:38,619 --> 01:52:40,495
Then I won't see you anymore.

1499
01:52:42,289 --> 01:52:44,625
Well, you won't
see my body, but....

1500
01:52:46,084 --> 01:52:49,254
You know how a caterpillar
becomes something else?

1501
01:52:52,174 --> 01:52:53,133
A butterfly.

1502
01:52:54,926 --> 01:52:57,304
You just have to think of me...

1503
01:52:58,263 --> 01:53:00,307
...as off flying somewhere.

1504
01:53:00,974 --> 01:53:03,351
And, of course, the magician...

1505
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:05,604
...knows the secret...

1506
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:09,232
...that just because
you don't see something...

1507
01:53:10,275 --> 01:53:12,777
...doesn't mean it's not there.

1508
01:53:15,447 --> 01:53:16,907
So even though it might...

1509
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,700
...seem like I'm gone...

1510
01:53:19,951 --> 01:53:21,828
...the magician knows better.

1511
01:53:24,247 --> 01:53:25,790
So where will you be?

1512
01:53:30,962 --> 01:53:32,130
Right here.

1513
01:53:32,464 --> 01:53:35,467
Right here, inside the magician.

1514
01:53:37,135 --> 01:53:38,928
Can I talk to you
when you're there?

1515
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:40,555
Always.

1516
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,850
You won't hear my voice...

1517
01:53:44,058 --> 01:53:45,935
...but deep inside...

1518
01:53:46,478 --> 01:53:48,271
...you'll know what I'm saying.

1519
01:53:51,316 --> 01:53:52,775
It's not good enough.

1520
01:53:56,237 --> 01:53:59,324
Of course it isn't,
because it isn't everything.

1521
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:01,909
And we want everything, don't we?

1522
01:54:05,538 --> 01:54:07,582
But we still have one thing.

1523
01:54:07,915 --> 01:54:10,752
One of our greatest things
we'll always have.

1524
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,587
You know what that is?

1525
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:15,840
Our dreams.

1526
01:54:16,549 --> 01:54:19,218
We can still meet in our dreams.

1527
01:54:20,303 --> 01:54:22,263
We can talk to each other there...

1528
01:54:22,763 --> 01:54:25,433
...and go for walks together
in the summer...

1529
01:54:25,641 --> 01:54:27,351
...and in the winter,
and in the rain...

1530
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,187
...and in the sun...

1531
01:54:30,354 --> 01:54:33,941
...and I can come and pick you up
and we can go flying.

1532
01:54:38,237 --> 01:54:40,573
Nobody's loved you like I do.

1533
01:54:42,491 --> 01:54:44,035
Nobody ever will.

1534
01:54:57,089 --> 01:54:59,925
-I brought you some tea.
-Merry Christmas, baby.

1535
01:55:00,176 --> 01:55:01,635
Merry Christmas.

1536
01:55:02,636 --> 01:55:04,597
Look what Mom made me.

1537
01:55:06,849 --> 01:55:08,893
I'll go show Dad and lsabel.

1538
01:55:09,101 --> 01:55:10,811
-Here.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

1539
01:55:13,939 --> 01:55:16,442
Will you make sure Dad knows
how to double-knot...

1540
01:55:16,692 --> 01:55:18,652
...my sneakers for school
in the morning?

1541
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:20,654
Yes.

1542
01:55:21,697 --> 01:55:22,906
Thanks.

1543
01:55:26,702 --> 01:55:28,078
That's yours.

1544
01:55:38,005 --> 01:55:39,464
It's a quilt.

1545
01:55:40,007 --> 01:55:43,010
-And it has our pictures on it.
-Put it here.

1546
01:55:47,764 --> 01:55:50,434
It's like a scrapbook
you can keep warm with.

1547
01:55:51,643 --> 01:55:54,479
It's so beautiful. I've never
seen anything like it.

1548
01:55:54,688 --> 01:55:57,190
See the horse?
And your medals that you got?

1549
01:55:57,566 --> 01:56:01,611
Remember this dress you wouldn't
take off in Pre-K for 3 weeks?

1550
01:56:01,862 --> 01:56:03,113
Remember that?

1551
01:56:03,655 --> 01:56:06,116
Your first step.
Look at your foot.

1552
01:56:06,992 --> 01:56:10,662
Look at that little
chubby-cheeked thing. Look at you.

1553
01:56:15,542 --> 01:56:16,835
Are you scared?

1554
01:56:18,545 --> 01:56:19,754
A little.

1555
01:56:21,047 --> 01:56:22,674
Mostly, I was scared...

1556
01:56:22,924 --> 01:56:24,467
...for you...

1557
01:56:24,926 --> 01:56:28,013
...but I'm not anymore
because I know you'll be okay.

1558
01:56:31,057 --> 01:56:34,561
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'm going to miss you so much.

1559
01:56:35,687 --> 01:56:36,980
It's okay.

1560
01:56:39,024 --> 01:56:41,067
My sweetie. It's okay.

1561
01:56:42,444 --> 01:56:44,821
It's okay to miss me. It's okay.

1562
01:56:46,614 --> 01:56:48,158
You can miss me...

1563
01:56:48,366 --> 01:56:50,577
...and you can take me with you.

1564
01:56:51,202 --> 01:56:52,036
You can.

1565
01:56:52,453 --> 01:56:54,497
And when you're in trouble...

1566
01:56:54,831 --> 01:56:56,374
...l'll be there.

1567
01:56:56,749 --> 01:56:59,502
When you fall in love,
I'll be there.

1568
01:57:00,044 --> 01:57:01,337
You can.

1569
01:57:01,796 --> 01:57:03,172
I mean, that's how...

1570
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:05,383
...people go on forever.

1571
01:57:05,592 --> 01:57:08,136
Because somebody takes them along.

1572
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:11,639
On your graduation...

1573
01:57:11,889 --> 01:57:13,057
...and your wedding...

1574
01:57:13,349 --> 01:57:15,560
...and when you have your babies.

1575
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:20,148
Take me along, will you?

1576
01:57:21,399 --> 01:57:23,651
Always, always and always.

1577
01:57:28,906 --> 01:57:31,159
You have made my life...

1578
01:57:31,659 --> 01:57:33,452
...so wonderful.

1579
01:57:34,704 --> 01:57:36,998
Take that with you too, okay?

1580
01:57:54,015 --> 01:57:56,142
Wow, Mom! It's so cool!

1581
01:57:57,852 --> 01:57:59,979
See what you got there, Ben.

1582
01:58:08,529 --> 01:58:11,115
What's the matter?
You look disappointed.

1583
01:58:12,741 --> 01:58:14,785
No, everything is great, Mom.

1584
01:58:16,078 --> 01:58:17,538
I love my presents.

1585
01:58:17,746 --> 01:58:18,872
Hey, guys!

1586
01:58:19,707 --> 01:58:21,333
Looks like we forgot one.

1587
01:58:24,169 --> 01:58:26,213
It's got your name on it, buddy.

1588
01:58:26,714 --> 01:58:28,257
Abracadabra!

1589
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:31,844
What a beautiful cage.

1590
01:58:34,346 --> 01:58:35,389
It's empty.

1591
01:58:37,266 --> 01:58:38,559
Let's try it again.

1592
01:58:41,019 --> 01:58:42,396
I think maybe this time...

1593
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:45,149
...you should say the magic words.

1594
01:58:45,691 --> 01:58:48,068
Abracadabra! Allakazam!

1595
01:58:48,277 --> 01:58:49,903
Allakazoom. Boom!

1596
01:58:52,364 --> 01:58:53,740
It worked!

1597
01:59:28,316 --> 01:59:31,903
Why doesn't everybody get
on the sofa for a picture?

1598
01:59:32,529 --> 01:59:35,448
Baby, can you put that birdcage
on the floor?

1599
01:59:39,369 --> 01:59:41,079
And I'll set up here.

1600
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:51,631
On the count of 3,
I want to see big Christmas smiles.

1601
01:59:51,923 --> 01:59:52,841
One...

1602
01:59:53,216 --> 01:59:54,300
...two...

1603
01:59:56,511 --> 01:59:57,554
...three.

1604
01:59:58,638 --> 01:59:59,722
Excellent.

1605
02:00:00,765 --> 02:00:04,269
Good one. Now let's get one
with the whole family.

1606
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:13,152
Okay. Let me just...

1607
02:00:13,653 --> 02:00:15,279
...reset this.

1608
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:20,076
Get ready.
