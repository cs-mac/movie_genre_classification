<i>Everybody wants to get
on the Van Gogh boat.</i>

2

<i>There's no trip so horrible
that someone won't take it.</i>

3
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,069
<i>The idea of the unrecognized genius...</i>

4
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:14,006
<i>slaving away in a garret
is a deliciously foolish one.</i>

5
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,067
<i>We must credit the life
of Vincent van Gogh...</i>

6
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,442
<i>for really sending
this myth into orbit.</i>

7
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:22,281
<i>l mean, how many pictures
did he sell? One?</i>

8
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:24,444
<i>He couldn't give them away.</i>

9
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,089
<i>He has to be the most modern
artist, but everybody hated him.</i>

10
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,516
<i>We're so ashamed of his life
that the rest of art history...</i>

11
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:34,619
<i>will be retribution
for Van Gogh's neglect.</i>

12
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:38,689
<i>No one wants to be part of a generation
that ignores another Van Gogh.</i>

13
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:44,034
<i>ln this town, one is at the mercy
of the recognition factor.</i>

14
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:47,200
<i>One's public appearance
is absolute.</i>

15
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:50,971
<i>Part of the artist's job is
to get the work where l will see it.</i>

a metaphor of the public.</i>

a witness, a critic.</i>

a new picture...</i>

19
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,593
<i>you don't want
to miss the boat.</i>

20
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,222
<i>You have to be very careful.</i>

21
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,563
<i>You might be staring
at Van Gogh's ear.</i>

What do ya hear? What do ya say?

Hide it.

39

Now, that's entertainment.

Pancake table drawing.

41
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:44,550
You know, l'm a little busy

You nuts? Out.

drum mode on it...

82
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,647

You need the music, man.

91

You need sound.

00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,816
l'm gonna be 40 in July,
and you know, man...

159
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,688
l'm glad
l never got any recognition.

160
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,784
lt's given me time to develop.

161
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:37,160
- Can we lose some of this shit?
- No, no. You don't do it.

162
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:40,029
- l can't see this.
- Excuse me, you. What's your name?

163
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,264
Could you come over here
and move some of this stuff, please?

164
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,446
My name's Jean Michel Basquiat.
Have you heard of me?

165
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:59,953
- No. Should l have?
- l'm a painter too.

166
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:02,216
Really? Too bad.

167
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,349
No, l'm kidding.

168
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:08,555
Whoever you are, could you please
move that stuff someplace else?

169
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,688
We can't see the painting.

170
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,306
That told you.

171
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:16,620
- Come on, man.
- No, man.

172
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,852
Put out that cigarette, man.

173
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:27,760
Benny, man, l didn't think
we were actually gonna do this.

174
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:30,235
My goodness, you're shattering
all my myths, man.

175
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:32,238
- About what?
- Play some D.

176
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,706
About you being the first
half-Rican to play for the Knicks.

177
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,608
- Play some D. Open your arms.
- l'm open.

178
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,669
Open them up.
Look down. There you go.

179
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:46,245
Hey, Benny, man, how long
you think it takes to get famous?

180
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,449
For a musician or a painter?

181
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:52,082
Whatever. Famous.

182
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,460
Four years.

183
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,263
Six to get rich.

184
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,294
First you're gonna have
to dress right, you know?

185
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:04,099
Then you're gonna have
to hang out with famous people.

186
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,867
You know? Make friends
with the right blond people.

187
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:10,707
Go to the right parties, yeah.
Socialite.

188
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:18,012
Then you gotta do your work all the time
when you're not doing that.

189
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:21,145
But l'm talking about the same
kind of work, the same style...

190
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:25,591
so people can recognize it and
don't get confused, you know?

191
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,187
Then once you're famous--
airborne, you know--

192
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:32,460
you gotta keep doin' it
in the same way...

193
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,495
even after it's boring--
unless you want people...

194
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:39,505
to really get mad at you,
which they will anyway.

195
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:44,603
- Come on, man, let's go.
- Shoot! Come on.

196
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,479
l mean, famous people
are usually pretty fuckin' stupid.

197
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,642
You're too smart.

198
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:53,949
You don't wanna end up like John Henry,
you know, fighting the machine.

199
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:56,182
- John Henry?
- Absolutely.

200
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:59,954
John Henry was a steel-driving man
that worked the railroad...

201
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:03,853
pounding in the spikes
and laying down the track.

202
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:07,867
Then one day they invented
a machine to do his job, right?

203
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:10,062
And he says...

204
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:13,766
''Fuck that.
l'm a man, right?''

205
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:18,335
So he challenges the machine to a race
to lay down a mile of track, right?

206
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,008
lt takes two days.

207
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,278
They go neck and neck
the whole time--

208
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:29,345
l mean, right to the end--
and he beats the machine by one spike.

209
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:33,052
But he dropped dead,
you know, see?

210
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,687
- Boom, but he beat it.
- Boom, but he dropped dead.

211
00:23:35,763 --> 00:23:39,221
- But he beat it.
- You gotta do stuff like you do it.

212
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,497
lt's about integrity, you know.
l mean, your friends like you.

213
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,038
l mean, you pound the pussy.
What else do you want?

214
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,938
l mean, everyone walks by,
sees your stuff.

215
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,171
- Warhol!
- What?

216
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:54,237
That's Andy Warhol.

217
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:57,079
He's a fucking homo.

218
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:59,142
He's the greatest painter
in the world.

219
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,213
No, he paints by numbers.
You don't. What're you doing?

220
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,258
l'm giving him one of these, man.
He should have one.

221
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,317
No, don't give him anything, man.
Trade, trade.

222
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:10,022
Yeah. That's what real artists
do with each other.

223
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:14,033
Besides, he'll just use you, man.
He's famous for it.

224
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:31,274
- Can l help you?
- You wanna buy some ignorant art?

225
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:35,345
- Ten bucks apiece.
- No, l think it's okay.

226
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:39,153
- Of course, Mr. Bischofberger.
- Gee, ignorant art, Bruno.

227
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:43,726
Yeah, you know, like stupid,
ridiculous, crummy art.

228
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:48,800
- That sounds good. That's new.
- Ten bucks.

229
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,031
Gee, you didn't work
very much on these.

230
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:55,337
l can give you, like, five.

231
00:24:56,243 --> 00:25:00,202
Come on, Bruno, you're rich.
Maybe you should talk to Bruno.

232
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,942
You don't even work
on your stuff.

233
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:05,918
No, it's not how much you work
on something that matters.

234
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:08,978
- lt's how much you get for them.
- l can get ten.

235
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:13,992
These are great, Bruno.
Maybe l'll take two.

236
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,494
l'll take--

237
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:21,061
Let me see these.
l'll take this one and--

238
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:22,864
l don't know.

239
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:25,667
Bruno, can l borrow
some money?

240
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,104
Yeah.

241
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,571
Here. You have change?

242
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:36,741
You made a good deal.
Here, you can have those too.

243
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,919
Let me look at those, Bruno.

244
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:44,287
Yeah, but they're
mine now, Andy.

245
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:48,021
Sure, they're yours, Bruno.
Everything good's yours.

246
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,550
Hi. Are those for me?

247
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,358
Bye, Benny.

248
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:40,837
Which island of Hawaii you
want our house to be on?

249
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:44,817
Maui? Kauai? Oahu?

250
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:48,112
l don't know.
l hadn't thought about it.

251
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:49,587
Maui!

252
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:54,083
Staten lsland would be fine.

253
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:57,288
Maybe Oahu.

254
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:08,298
No, definitely Maui.

255
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:15,881
Oh, man.

256
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:23,556
Hey, Gina.

257
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,389
Do you wanna marry me?

258
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:49,399
What did you do to my dress?

259
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:51,444
Jean, what the fuck
have you done to my dress?

260
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,810
l painted it for you.
lt's beautiful, baby.

261
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:56,042
l was wearing this to see
my parents this weekend, Jean!

262
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:57,879
You can still wear it.

263
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:02,250
That's great, Jean.
Painting all over my fucking paintings.

264
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:05,052
l couldn't look at them anymore.
They're kind of impersonal.

265
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,320
- Oh, great.
- You're more complex than that.

266
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:10,557
That's really nice.
How do you like it?

267
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:12,861
How do you like it if l paint
all over your goddamn paintings?

268
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,924
- That looks good.
- How do you feel about that?

269
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:18,062
Do you like me doing that
to your fucking paintings?

270
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:20,470
Do you? Oh, fuck you!

271
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,738
Get off me!
Fucking get off me!

272
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:29,647
Come here. Listen.
Do you know what he's saying?

273
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:33,152
Who? Get off me!

274
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,519
He says l'm jealous of the moon,
because you look at it.

275
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,457
He's jealous of the sun,
because it warms you.

276
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:43,087
He says l feel you,
even when l'm not feeling you.

277
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:46,360
l talk to you when
l'm not talking to you.

278
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:50,498
l love you even
when l'm not loving you.

279
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,031
You know l love you, Gina.

280
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:59,541
Willie Mays! Willie Mays!

281
00:30:09,256 --> 00:30:11,053
Hey, come on up, man.

282
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,579
l heard you
the first seven times.

283
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:36,115
l'm just saying we got some
rehearsal space tonight.

284
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,174
lt can happen
Friday night, right?

285
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:40,152
We got some people
coming to see us.

286
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,211
Some people always
come and see us.

287
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,425
Bye.

288
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,287
Hey, Mike.

289
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:57,303
Benny, man, be more careful!
Damn!

290
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:04,443
What?

291
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:12,208
No, come on. Stop it.

292
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:15,016
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

293
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,920
What would you do
if l kiss you?

294
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:24,758
You're out of your mind, Benny.
You should take more drugs.

295
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:41,339
- Hey, Rockets!
- Hey, man.

296
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,752
- Hey, Rockets, can l have this?
- Yeah.

297
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:51,252
You got the key?
Yeah, l got it.

298
00:31:53,393 --> 00:31:55,190
Hang on a second.

299
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:15,977
Did you do this, man?

300
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,677
Yeah, l gave that to Maripol.
She let me stay here for a while.

301
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:21,482
You do one for me, and it's free.

302
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:48,080
Rene, look.
Quick, check him out.

303
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:50,708
He's right there, look.
He's kind of cute, right?

304
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:56,217
Those silver things
on his cowboy boots.

305
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,088
No, honey, l don't think so.
l gotta take a pee.

306
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:06,731
Amazing.

307
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:11,595
Who did this?

308
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,765
How the fuck should l know?

309
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:18,076
That's Samo, the dude
that was just here. Yo, Benny, where--

310
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,552
Come here, man!
He's right there. Look!

311
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:31,217
- Here, give me that.
- Right there, right there.

312
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:40,129
- Keep your eyes on him. Don't lose him!
- Yo, Samo!

313
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:56,849
Excuse me!

314
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,875
That's your painting up there,
back at that loft?

315
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:03,150
Oh, at the party at Maripol's.
Yeah. You like it?

316
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:05,951
You know Albert Milo?

317
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,516
Of course.

318
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,995
l made that nigga.
Rene Ricard.

319
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:13,862
<i>You didn't read
Not About Albert Milo?</i>

320
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:16,835
Listen, l know who to hype.

321
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:19,098
l will make you a star.

322
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:21,436
You can put me
in the ring with Milo?

323
00:34:21,508 --> 00:34:24,170
l can put you in the ring with him.
l can set the dates.

324
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:27,171
But the big boys
know how to fight.

325
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:29,272
Make you look real sissy.

326
00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:33,681
God, l saw that painting.
lt made me ashamed to own anything.

327
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:37,485
So, Samo.

328
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:41,854
You got a real name?

329
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:44,725
Jean Michel Basquiat.

330
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:47,164
Well, that sounds
famous already.

331
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,461
You want some coffee?
Come on.

332
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,775
Come on.

333
00:34:57,644 --> 00:35:00,909
Hey, who are those fools
with the binoculars?

334
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:18,289
Child, you got
no respect at all.

335
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:22,363
Nobody taught you
how to mount paintings?

336
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:25,599
You know me. lt comes
to a mounting, the rougher, the better.

337
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:29,298
A very important season
in New York, Jean.

338
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:32,937
One's public appearance
is absolute.

339
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:55,229
Geez, Louise!
Come here, doll.

340
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:58,494
This is Jean Michel Basquiat,
Henry.

341
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:02,372
- Hi. This is my friend Rob.
- Hi, Rob. Jean Michel.

342
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:07,243
- So, you're Samo.
- ''Say-mo'', darling.

343
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:10,750
- l really like your graffiti.
- l was a kid then.

344
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,944
How much for that one?

345
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:15,146
That one?
For you or the museum?

346
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:17,884
lt's for me.

347
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,324
- Two.
- l'll take it.

348
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:22,224
Darn right you'll take it.

349
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:24,320
- Come on, Rob.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.

350
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,230
That's $2,000.

351
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:31,463
And he's from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

352
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:33,438
So suck my pussy, you star.

353
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:38,640
Gina, you look
fucking beautiful.

354
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:42,113
Yeah? Really?
lt looks good.

355
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,210
Ages! Come here, l want you
to meet somebody.

356
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,277
Jean, this is Annina.
Annina, this is Jean Michel Basquiat.

357
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:51,347
l am so happy to meet you. Rene refused
to give me your telephone number.

358
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:53,187
Finders, keepers, doll.

359
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,923
My next show is called ''Public Address'',
but you don't fit.

360
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,227
What do you mean,
l don't fit? l fit.

361
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,790
l can't show you in a gallery
because you don't have any paintings.

362
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:04,098
Hello! Hello!

363
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,798
Well, give me some money,
l'll make you some.

364
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:09,865
Would 300 do?

365
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:13,276
Yeah, sure,
but l don't have a space.

366
00:37:13,346 --> 00:37:15,678
l could find a place
for you to work.

367
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,475
Hey, do you want a taste?

368
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:20,383
No, thanks.

369
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:25,190
You're doing very well.
Very well.

370
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,122
Who is that?

371
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:34,393
Okay. You are
so full of shit, you.

372
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,458
How do you know
Bruno Bischofberger?

373
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,968
- l had lunch with him once.
- Oh, did we?

374
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:54,013
Kind of a family portrait.
lt looks done.

375
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:57,914
You think so?

376
00:37:57,991 --> 00:38:00,118
l think it could use
some babies.

377
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:05,128
Babies with you?

378
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:08,558
What's wrong with me?

379
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,860
You're your own baby.

380
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,442
- Who is it?
- Annina Nosei.

381
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:21,770
- Who?
- Annina.

382
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:26,076
- Hello? Oh, it's you.
- ls Jean Michel here?

383
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:29,713
- No.
- l'm here to see some work.

384
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,786
There's some right there.

385
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:43,894
- These are great.
- Aren't they?

386
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:47,540
l like these.
l'll take these.

387
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:50,132
l think you should probably
talk to him about that.

388
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,803
Do Rene and Jean
have a contract together?

389
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,553
- l don't know.
- l think he's ready for a show.

390
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,555
- Really? When?
- Next month.

391
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:07,818
You know, l think you should probably
talk to him about all this.

392
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:13,930
When?

393
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:16,931
How about right now?

394
00:39:17,003 --> 00:39:21,463
Well, l'll go get ready.
l'll be ready in one minute.

395
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:39,152
This is it.

<i>ln the background we have the choicest
collection of modern musicians...</i>

399
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:28,805

l really love this.

410
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:54,152
Never tell a painter you like anything.
They'll invariably change it.

411
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:00,764
Hello?

412
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:04,463
He's not here right now.
Hang on a second.

413
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:07,606
lt's Benny. He wants to know
why you're not at band practice.

414
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:10,199
Fuck!
l forgot about that.

415
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:12,176
Are you Tony Bennett?

416
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:15,339
Are you Tony Bennett? You sing on stage?
You paint in your spare time?

417
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:17,815
- l didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
- That's my point exactly.

418
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:20,352
Hello. Hello?

419
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:26,250
Rene, if you're so smart, what are you
doing down in this basement with me?

420
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:29,454
You are the news,
and l want the scoop.

421
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:32,697
Look...

422
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:35,928
when l speak,
no one believes me.

423
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:39,335
When l write it down,
people know it's true.

424
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:42,732
There's never been
a black painter in art history...

425
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:46,040
who's been considered
really important, you know that?

426
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:48,603
Are you a writer
or a white writer?

427
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,672
l may be white,
but l'm a nigga.

428
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,411
You ask anybody.

429
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:01,349
- What time is it?
- lt's 5:11.

430
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:27,316
That one's for you.

431
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:40,829
Hey, it's the big a.m.

432
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:45,430
Rene's been telling me
about your work.

433
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:50,004
ls that finished yet?

434
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:52,805
l don't know.

435
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,078
When's your show?

436
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,878
Two weeks.

437
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:05,482
- How was yours?
- l haven't decided yet.

438
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:09,484
This is nice. l like that.

439
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:13,088
Hey, baby. Come on over.

440
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,929
l wanna make a painting of you.

441
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:17,196
- You got any coffee?
- Yeah, l've got...

442
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,329
coffee, cream cheese, bagels.

443
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:21,396
Thanks for lettin' me stop by.

444
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:24,740
That could use
a little bit more pink.

445
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:26,972
lt doesn't need the pink.
See ya.

446
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:37,479
Albert Milo, what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

447
00:44:37,557 --> 00:44:39,718
This is my friend,
Rene Ricard.

448
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,852
- We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
- lt's a pleasure.

449
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:44,794
lt's very nice to have met you.

450
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,291
This is Tom and Cynthia Kruger.

451
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:50,802
l heard.

452
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,737
- This is Jean Michel Basquiat.
- Hi.

453
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:56,604
You've seen the Samo graffiti
everywhere. That's his.

454
00:44:56,676 --> 00:44:59,236
This is the true
voice of the gutter.

455
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,414
l've seen the graffiti, and l've heard
wonderful things about your paintings.

456
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:07,419
Everybody's talking about you.
Your ears must be burning.

457
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,853
Most of these
are reserved already.

458
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:12,584
After Thursday, this work
will not be available.

459
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:15,320
lt's a beautiful painting,
and it's still free.

460
00:45:15,395 --> 00:45:18,796
l don't know. l don't know if l could
live with this one. lt's--

461
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:22,858
l like it, but the green
is sort of institutional.

462
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:26,928
Sweetheart, have you been
in an institution lately?

463
00:45:28,274 --> 00:45:29,969
Boom! Jean-Claude Killy!

464
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:33,012
There's my motherfucker.
What's up, man?

465
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:38,808
You's a lucky-ass nigga
to be gettin' paid for this shit.

466
00:45:38,885 --> 00:45:40,682
- You like it, man?
- Not bad.

467
00:45:41,354 --> 00:45:43,015
Yeah, l do.

468
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:46,820
lt's fascinating, his choice
of crossing out words that way.

469
00:45:46,893 --> 00:45:50,351
Yes, well, they are more meaningful
in their absence, no?

470
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,058
Yeah, J M,
what does it mean?

471
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:56,329
l don't know. l just don't know
if l can live with the green.

472
00:45:56,402 --> 00:45:58,927
You want me to make it
a nice shit brown?

473
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:02,497
l beg your pardon?
Nobody makes fun of my wife but me.

474
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:04,736
l don't know.
l just can't make up my mind.

475
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:08,144
l really like this one,
but it's just--

476
00:46:08,214 --> 00:46:10,045
lt's the green.

477
00:46:10,116 --> 00:46:12,380
Get a fucking decorator.

478
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,943
These paintings
aren't even done yet.

479
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,754
We'll take the green one.

480
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:42,347
- How can l thank you?
- Maybe l can squeeze your titties?

481
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:46,913
- Want a Mac? Have a Mac.
- No. l want my scarf.

482
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:48,977
No, l don't want a Mac.
Give me my scarf.

483
00:46:49,055 --> 00:46:51,922
Sweetheart, l dare you
to break my heart.

484
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:55,222
- Oh, man!
- l dare you to break my heart.

485
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,285
Have a Mac.
No. l don't eat junk food.

486
00:46:57,363 --> 00:46:59,524
- Let's go to Lutece.
- What, you're paying?

487
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,965
- You coming?

488
00:47:02,034 --> 00:47:04,502
- l'm gonna keep the scarf anyway.
- No, you're not. lt's mine.

489
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,801
- What's your name?
- l ain't tellin' you. Too fast.

490
00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:09,535
- No name?
- No.

491
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:12,635
How about if l call you Big Pink?

492
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,210
Come on!

493
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:20,408
Hurry up!

494
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:22,113
Baby, l'm coming.

495
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:27,252
What are you doing?

496
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:31,693
Fuck, you're so loaded!
What'd you do, rob a bank?

497
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:34,995
- Where are you taking me?
- We're going, like l said.

498
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,467
Yeah, right.

499
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:50,605
You want a tuna fish sandwich?

500
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:52,082
Yeah.

501
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:02,355
- Fuck!
- Where'd you get the scarf?

502
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:06,263
Oh, it's a present
l picked up for you.

503
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:18,504
Let me see.

504
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:25,714
You look like an angel.

505
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:02,330
Wake up.

506
00:51:20,126 --> 00:51:21,787
Jean, wake up.

507
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:21,312
Honk the horn again, please.

508
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:26,315
Look at him.

509
00:52:28,461 --> 00:52:29,894
What?

510
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:37,892
There are sick people
living in this building.

511
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,870
What time is it, Benny, man?

512
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:42,066
Thompson and Spring, please.

513
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:44,200
What time is it, man?

514
00:52:44,276 --> 00:52:46,267
You're fuckin' late!
That's what time it is!

515
00:52:47,513 --> 00:52:49,538
What's the rush, John Henry?

516
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:51,515
lt's Jean Michel.

517
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:52,983
Toke?

518
00:52:57,456 --> 00:52:59,686
What the fuck's
your problem, man?

519
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:03,987
l don't have
any fuckin' problems.

520
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:06,725
Then what do you have?
Give me my joint, man!

521
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:08,994
Check you out!

522
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:13,027
You get a little attention, you start
acting all uppity and shit with me.

523
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:16,935
What's that about?

524
00:53:17,009 --> 00:53:19,671
- About what?
- What's that about?

525
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:21,736
- What?
- What just--

526
00:53:21,814 --> 00:53:23,577
You mean like uppity nigga?

527
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:27,613
What gives you the audacity...

528
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:29,881
to even think that, man?

529
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:34,952
Hey, for all you know, you might
just be a flash in the pan, man.

530
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:37,188
And let me tell you,
you can never tell.

531
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:39,424
You're just jealous 'cause
it ain't happening to you.

532
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:42,296
Think what you want, man.

533
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:46,765
Fuck you.
Making me feel bad, man.

534
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:50,536
Yo, pull over. Pull over.

535
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:42,884
- Yo, Andy, man.
- Jean.

536
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:45,487
Boom, that jacket.
Can l paint that?

537
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:48,499
Wow, you look great.
Your show looks great.

538
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:53,567
l can't believe you did
all these in your basement.

539
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,732
You kids can do anything.

540
00:54:55,808 --> 00:54:58,936
Oh, Mary, this is Jean.
Jean, this is Mary Boone.

541
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:00,945
She's showing
all the great new painters.

542
00:55:01,013 --> 00:55:03,504
- Yeah, l met her already.
- You should be very pleased.

543
00:55:03,582 --> 00:55:06,278
- lt's a very handsome show.
- Yeah.

544
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:08,081
lt's just in the wrong gallery.

545
00:55:08,153 --> 00:55:11,020
Yeah. l'll see you later
at dinner, though.

546
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:13,615
Are you coming?

547
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:15,421
Jean, your parents are here.

548
00:55:17,029 --> 00:55:18,758
Those aren't my parents.

549
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,190
Those are not his parents?

550
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,567
- Well, one of them is.
- Which one?

551
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:28,869
- Hey, Dad.
- You must be very proud.

552
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:32,240
Very proud.
Quite a production.

553
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:35,439
So tell me, how does it feel
to have a genius in the family?

554
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:36,606
Good.

555
00:55:36,682 --> 00:55:38,877
Lucky for you.
l only have convicts in my family.

556
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:55,293
- Jean, great show, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

557
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:58,131
- Hey, step into the office.
- That's mine.

558
00:55:58,203 --> 00:56:00,433
- l can't.
- Hey, it's a gift, man!

559
00:56:00,506 --> 00:56:02,030
lt's a gift!

560
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,478
Jean, come on.
This guy wants to take a picture.

561
00:56:11,817 --> 00:56:14,786
Come on, come on.
He won't bite.

562
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:18,683
Oh, wow.

563
00:56:18,757 --> 00:56:20,884
Twisted his arm, but here he is.

564
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,825
Gentlemen, a little tighter.

565
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:27,297
- Hey, Albert, get in the picture, man.
- Come on, beautiful.

566
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:30,665
- Still a great suit.
- Of the painters, please.

567
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:32,931
- The painters.
- Yeah, no, that's better. Go on.

568
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:34,870
Mr. Bischofberger, please.

569
00:56:36,308 --> 00:56:38,708
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mom, Dad.

570
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:40,938
Jackie. Andy.
You know Andy.

571
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:43,675
- How are you?
- Hi. Yeah. Great color.

572
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:45,740
This is Jean Michel.
This is my wife.

573
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,809
This is Jack. That's Esther.
My mom and dad.

574
00:56:47,886 --> 00:56:49,717
Are your folks here?

575
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:54,257
My dad's here with his wife,
but my mom couldn't make it.

576
00:56:54,326 --> 00:56:57,659
On such a special occasion?
Why?

577
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:02,862
- She's sick.
- l'm sorry.

578
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:05,802
- l don't indulge. Thank you.
- That's cool.

579
00:57:05,871 --> 00:57:08,772
Jean Michel, may l
talk to you, please?

580
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:12,572
Andy, you want
to take my picture?

581
00:57:13,712 --> 00:57:14,906
Yeah.

582
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:19,512
l hear you're leaving Annina.

583
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:24,684
Now, you know
l love your painting.

584
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:28,691
l would like
to represent you worldwide.

585
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:32,094
We start with a show
in Zurich.

586
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:33,654
And later...

587
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:38,161
l get us a partner in New York.

588
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:40,034
Maybe Mary Boone, huh?

589
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:46,941
Now, l especially
like this painting.

590
00:57:47,012 --> 00:57:50,846
l would like to have that
for my own private collection.

591
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,214
No, l wasn't
gonna sell that one.

592
00:57:53,285 --> 00:57:57,016
No? Well,
you shouldn't have shown it.

593
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:01,082
l mean, this is the one.
l absolutely have to have this one.

594
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:05,187
l mean, this is super-fantastic.
Oh, Jean Michel, l must have it.

595
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:08,461
Hey, l absolutely
must have this painting.

596
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:11,800
Okay, sure.

597
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:14,529
Thank you.

598
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:21,002
Can l borrow your limousine?
l'll bring it back to you in an hour.

599
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:22,478
lt's okay.

600
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:24,539
Just have them
drop you at Mr. Chow's.

601
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,481
- We'll all be there.
- Cool, cool.

602
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:28,213
lt's a great show.

603
00:58:37,563 --> 00:58:40,031
Fucking little whore,
you sold my painting?

604
00:58:40,098 --> 00:58:42,862
- l can make you another one.
- You sold my fucking painting?

605
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:46,302
Let me tell you something.
When climbing that ladder of success...

606
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:49,272
you do not kick out the fucking rungs,
and you believe that shit!

607
00:58:51,343 --> 00:58:53,573
- Rene!
- Fuck off!.

608
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:59,780
<i>What is it about art anyway that
we give it so much importance?</i>

609
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:02,218
<i>Art is so respected by the poor
because what they do...</i>

610
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:04,278
<i>is an honest way
to get out of the slum...</i>

611
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:07,291
<i>using one's sheer self
as the medium.</i>

612
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,793
<i>The money earned,
proof, pure and simple...</i>

613
00:59:09,862 --> 00:59:12,922
<i>of the value of that
individual, the artist.</i>

614
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,600
<i>The picture a mother's son does
in jail hangs on her wall...</i>

615
00:59:16,668 --> 00:59:20,001
<i>as proof that beauty is possible
even in the most wretched.</i>

616
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:22,063
<i>And this is
a much different idea...</i>

617
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,598
<i>than the fancier notion that art
is a scam and a rip-off.</i>

618
00:59:26,378 --> 00:59:30,314
<i>But you could never explain to someone
who uses God's gift to enslave...</i>

619
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:33,647
<i>that you have used
God's gift to be free.</i>

620
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:38,421
Hey, man, turn that up.

621
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:41,754
''Bird'', man.

622
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:46,889
l really, really...

623
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,332
really admire you, man.

624
00:59:50,402 --> 00:59:51,994
Me? Why?

625
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,164
l mean, you did it.
l mean, you made it.

626
00:59:59,311 --> 01:00:00,369
You know...

627
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:03,471
l'm a painter too.

628
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,414
Oh, yeah?

629
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:13,185
Come check out my studio
sometime?

630
01:00:14,426 --> 01:00:15,893
Sure.

631
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:18,486
l love it, man.

632
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:24,563
''Plush, safe he think''.

633
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,367
What's your name, man?

634
01:00:30,442 --> 01:00:33,639
They call me Steve, man,
but l prefer Shenge.

635
01:00:33,712 --> 01:00:34,770
Shenge.

636
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:38,209
You want a job?

637
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:46,928
Good evening.
Annina's waiting for you.

638
01:00:56,216 --> 01:00:58,684
Mr. Chow, a chair, please.

639
01:01:00,754 --> 01:01:02,449
To a great show, Jean.

640
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:04,683
- Cheers.
- Here's to you.

641
01:01:05,892 --> 01:01:07,484
You finish it.

642
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:14,496
He used to. Nixon used to have
a place at the Waldorf-Astoria.

643
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:17,365
But then he moved
to Saddle River, New Jersey.

644
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:19,302
Saddle River, New York.

645
01:01:19,372 --> 01:01:23,331
- Saddle River's in New Jersey.
- Saddle River's in New York.

646
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:25,343
- lt's in New Jersey.
- lt's in New York!

647
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:28,972
- Saddle River's in New Jersey.
- New York!

648
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:31,073
l hear your show
already sold out.

649
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:36,220
There is a very important collector
interested in buying some of your work.

650
01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:38,223
- lt's in New Jersey.
- New York!

651
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:40,555
Bring him by the studio sometime.
l have some other stuff to show him.

652
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:42,094
Saddle River's in New York!

653
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:46,031
l didn't know that,
did you, Henry?

654
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:54,133
A bottle of your
best champagne, darling.

655
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:55,765
Hi, Michael. Hello.

656
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,743
Hi, darling.

657
01:01:58,812 --> 01:02:01,474
Well, you cannot buy
advertising like this.

658
01:02:01,548 --> 01:02:05,245
This will be the most glamorous party
you'll have here all fall, guaranteed.

659
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,948
Oh, my. Could l get some
of that imitation crab?

660
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:13,720
l am just famished.
And a chair, please! Dominic, chair.

661
01:02:13,793 --> 01:02:15,852
Well, that was a lovely show.

662
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:19,592
Absolutely lovely, but hey,
we're no longer collecting art...

663
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,566
we're buying people, aren't we?

664
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:23,124
Shut up, Rene.

665
01:02:23,203 --> 01:02:26,866
Oh, Andy, please. Everything's
over your head, we all know that.

666
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,807
Even Mr. Chow's menu's
over your head.

667
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,867
God, that's beautiful.

668
01:02:35,048 --> 01:02:36,913
Look at that.

669
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:40,919
Gorgeous. Gorgeous.
Look at that, is he not great?

670
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:45,287
That is an absolutely
stupendous piece of work.

671
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:47,292
Thank you. He owes me one.

672
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,760
- Doesn't he, Bruno?
- You're too much, Rene.

673
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:53,230
- Get this guy out of here.
- Oh, come-- Please!

674
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:56,359
Relax.
Can l have my chair, please?

675
01:02:56,436 --> 01:02:58,370
<i>- You'll never miss me
- Oh, come on!</i>

676
01:02:58,438 --> 01:03:01,896
l haven't eaten a thing.
l am starved to death, darling.

677
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:05,843
Please, get your hands off me.
lt's okay, we're friends.

678
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:08,278
We're friends--
please fuck off.

679
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:12,045
Get your fucking hands off me,
you faggots! l want a chair!

680
01:03:12,118 --> 01:03:15,519
<i>- Why must we say adieu
- l want a chair! All right, l'm going.</i>

681
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:19,718
Get your fucking hands off me!

682
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:22,659
We're friends!
Fuckers!

683
01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:25,789
Fuck off. Get your fucking
hands off, you faggot!

684
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:28,493
Okay, l'm going!

685
01:03:28,568 --> 01:03:30,832
l've left Diana Vreeland
waiting long enough.

686
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:36,698
lt was such a good drawing, Jean Michel.
You should do another one for Michael.

687
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:39,142
Perhaps some other time, Andy.

688
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:43,376
<i>...there and un petit Manet there.</i>

689
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:46,646
<i>- l lost my station
- lt's great that people are interested.</i>

690
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:49,950
But if anyone's going to buy anything,
l'll handle it for you.

691
01:03:50,023 --> 01:03:53,823
Everything goes through the gallery,
even if they come to your studio.

692
01:03:53,893 --> 01:03:56,487
<i>- Oh, Paris, please
- Sure, sure.</i>

693
01:03:58,698 --> 01:04:03,067
<i>Stay the same.</i>

694
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:08,196
<i>You've had 23 one-man shows.</i>

695
01:04:08,274 --> 01:04:12,472
<i>You've been in 43 group shows
from Zurich to Tokyo.</i>

696
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:14,911
You've had over 50 articles
written about you.

697
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:18,747
You've switched galleries
how many times?

698
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:20,809
You've deejayed
in the hottest clubs.

699
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:27,524
One of the youngest artists
ever to be included...

700
01:04:27,593 --> 01:04:29,527
in the Whitney biennial.

701
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:31,722
Produced a rap record.

702
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:33,823
lt's said you're quite
the ladies' man.

703
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,731
You dated Madonna...

704
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:42,468
a couple of months, right?

705
01:04:42,542 --> 01:04:46,137
All this at the
ripe old age of 24.

706
01:04:46,212 --> 01:04:48,840
One might ask,
is there anything left...

707
01:04:48,915 --> 01:04:52,112
for Jean Michel Basquiat to do?

708
01:04:52,185 --> 01:04:54,346
Bottom line:

709
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,354
What is it...

710
01:04:56,422 --> 01:04:58,356
gets you out of bed
in the morning?

711
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,690
l hate this, man.
Turn that off.

712
01:05:03,763 --> 01:05:05,958
Oh, come on.
No, it's all right.

713
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:08,364
Look, come back.
l can do better.

714
01:05:08,434 --> 01:05:10,368
Please, please.

715
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:13,971
Thank you.

716
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,905
Okay. Ready?

717
01:05:18,511 --> 01:05:21,275
You ready?

718
01:05:21,347 --> 01:05:23,815
Can you decipher this for us?

719
01:05:26,252 --> 01:05:29,983
Decipher?
Just words.

720
01:05:30,056 --> 01:05:32,752
Yeah, l understand,
but whose words are these?

721
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:34,759
l mean, where do you
take them from?

722
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:39,930
l don't know. Would you ask a musician--
would you ask Miles...

723
01:05:39,999 --> 01:05:41,864
where'd you get that note from?

724
01:05:42,935 --> 01:05:46,336
l mean--
Where do you take your words from?

725
01:05:46,406 --> 01:05:48,840
- You know?
- Right.

726
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:51,399
Everywhere.

727
01:05:51,477 --> 01:05:55,277
What's that?
The three circles.

728
01:05:55,348 --> 01:05:56,838
- Here?
- Yeah.

729
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:59,510
- lt's a flea.
- Looks like a chicken.

730
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:02,311
Trust me, it's a flea.

731
01:06:02,388 --> 01:06:06,256
And that, in the black box?

732
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:08,520
Those are parasites.

733
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,358
Flea, parasite, and 46 and 47?

734
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:13,365
lt says leeches.

735
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:16,493
lt's number 46 and 47
in a list of thousands...

736
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:19,834
of leeches on this planet.

737
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:22,340
What's the difference between--

738
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:24,433
Between a flea, parasite and a leech?

739
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:27,479
- Hardly any.
- Why are people...

740
01:06:27,547 --> 01:06:30,983
so crudely drawn?

741
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:34,952
Well, most people tend to be pretty--
generally pretty crude.

742
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:37,182
l really don't know
that many refined people.

743
01:06:43,196 --> 01:06:45,994
Yeah, that looks good like that, man.

744
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:50,331
- What's that?
- Oh, it's...

745
01:06:50,403 --> 01:06:52,871
a pile of tires l painted.

746
01:06:52,939 --> 01:06:54,839
l knew that.

747
01:06:58,277 --> 01:07:01,212
Do you consider yourself
some kind of primal expressionist?

748
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,977
You mean a primate?
Like an ape?

749
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:07,645
Do you consider yourself a painter,
or a black painter?

750
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,712
l use a lot of colors,
not just black.

751
01:07:16,696 --> 01:07:19,256
lt's more a creole, you know?

752
01:07:20,533 --> 01:07:22,694
And what l mean by creole
is that...

753
01:07:22,768 --> 01:07:25,931
it's a mix of Africa and Europe...

754
01:07:26,005 --> 01:07:29,805
in much the same way that an African
in Haiti speaks French.

755
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:31,901
Your father's from Haiti.

756
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:36,446
How do you respond
to being called...

757
01:07:36,516 --> 01:07:39,246
''The pickaninny of the art world''?

758
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:46,022
<i>- Who said that?
- That's from Time magazine.</i>

759
01:07:46,092 --> 01:07:48,754
No, they said l was the Eddie Murphy
of the art world.

760
01:07:51,063 --> 01:07:52,496
My mistake.

761
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:58,467
Let me just
open something up here.

762
01:07:58,538 --> 01:08:02,770
You come from a middle class home.

763
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:04,776
Your father's an accountant.

764
01:08:06,579 --> 01:08:10,606
Why did you live in a cardboard box
in Tompkins Square?

765
01:08:13,986 --> 01:08:18,548
Do you feel that you're
being exploited or...

766
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:23,289
are you yourself exploiting...

767
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:28,390
the white image of the black artist
from the ghetto?

768
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:30,435
Ghetto?

769
01:08:30,503 --> 01:08:33,233
l don't exploit it, no.

770
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,069
Other people--

771
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:45,239
See, you make me
put my foot in my mouth.

772
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,757
Other people, it's possible, other
people might exploit it, it's possible.

773
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:54,990
ls it true?

774
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:03,034
Your mother resides in
a mental institution? ls that right?

775
01:09:10,243 --> 01:09:12,040
You angry?

776
01:09:21,487 --> 01:09:23,114
Now, right now?

777
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:27,455
No, as an artist.
ln general.

778
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:39,671
Okay.
Good, that's good.

779
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,141
Thank you.

780
01:11:04,857 --> 01:11:07,587
- l'm home.
- Hi, Jean.

781
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:12,256
That's great, Frank.
Can you, l don't know, whiz over here?

782
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:16,267
More that way.

783
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:18,303
What's with the wigs?

784
01:11:18,371 --> 01:11:20,771
l'm gonna give 'em
to people for Christmas.

785
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,241
You think that's a good present?
Who wants an old wig?

786
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,278
Yeah, sure.

787
01:11:27,046 --> 01:11:28,980
Oh, piss painting.

788
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:31,608
Not piss painting, Jean.
Oxidation art.

789
01:11:31,684 --> 01:11:34,414
Yeah, l hate
cleaning brushes too.

790
01:11:34,487 --> 01:11:38,583
l'm going to do some more of these.
Frank's been drinking this beer...

791
01:11:38,657 --> 01:11:41,057
and it makes it go
this great green.

792
01:11:41,127 --> 01:11:44,392
Why aren't you peeing
on them yourself?

793
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:46,727
l don't like beer.

794
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:01,710
Can l get some caviar, please?

795
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,017
Oh, can l taste it first?

796
01:12:18,864 --> 01:12:23,233
- ls that the best you have?
- Yes, it's the best.

797
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:27,398
- l'll take the whole tin.
- That's $3,000.

798
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:29,998
Hey, Andy.
Can l get $3,000?

799
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:32,373
For this caviar?

800
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:37,512
Jean, we could go
to Russia for that.

801
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:40,916
Put the caviar on the card
and l'll get the rest.

802
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,154
Do you check everybody's bills
or just mine?

803
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:51,321
Just yours.

804
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:56,059
Just gimme my shit, man.

805
01:12:56,135 --> 01:12:58,262
Yeah, but what he said
was locked in the basement...

806
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:00,532
you know, l mean,
it had such a nasty ring to it.

807
01:13:00,606 --> 01:13:04,940
lf l was white, they would have
just said ''artist in residence''.

808
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,104
l just wish they'd quit
writing shit about me.

809
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,946
No, Jean, that's good.
At least they're interested.

810
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:14,076
And then,
everyone's payin', like...

811
01:13:14,153 --> 01:13:16,485
top dollar for...

812
01:13:16,555 --> 01:13:18,489
anything with Samo on it.

813
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:22,789
- Scraps of paper, refrigerator doors.
- Sure, yeah.

814
01:13:22,862 --> 01:13:26,093
The other day, l wanted to buy
a pack of cigarettes...

815
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:28,258
so l did this drawing
for two dollars...

816
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:31,030
and this gallery called me
a week later said...

817
01:13:31,103 --> 01:13:34,903
''Somebody's offering us $5,000
for the same drawing, should l buy it?''

818
01:13:34,974 --> 01:13:38,102
l said, ''Yeah, sure, buy it.
lt sounds like a good deal to me''.

819
01:13:38,177 --> 01:13:40,611
Sure, buy it,
that's a good deal, yeah.

820
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:42,943
But you've got to stop
giving them away!

821
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:47,611
You know? Oh, Comme Des Garcons
want me to, like, model for them.

822
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:49,984
Maybe you could do that with me.

823
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:52,080
Yeah, yeah. l could do that.

824
01:13:52,157 --> 01:13:54,990
You could teach me.

825
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,620
l couldn't teach you anything.

826
01:13:57,696 --> 01:13:59,630
You're a natural.

827
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:01,825
You kidding me?

828
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:04,734
Maybe you could join
my modeling agency.

829
01:14:06,171 --> 01:14:09,265
They asked me to do the Mike Todd Room
at the Palladium. Should l do that?

830
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:11,536
lsn't Albert Milo doing that?

831
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:14,078
- They asked him before they asked me?
- Gee, l don't know.

832
01:14:14,146 --> 01:14:16,614
Shit, l'm not doing that.

833
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:20,108
l gotta get out of New York.

834
01:14:21,887 --> 01:14:26,586
Hey, we could go to Pittsburgh!
l kinda grew up there.

835
01:14:26,659 --> 01:14:30,186
They have this room there with
all the world's famous statues in.

836
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,321
So you don't even have
to go to Europe anymore.

837
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:34,559
Just go to Pittsburgh.

838
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:37,295
- Boom! Duckman!
- Oh, yeah.

839
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:44,071
When l was little,
my brother and l had two pet ducks.

840
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:45,974
We called them
the Garcia brothers.

841
01:14:49,214 --> 01:14:52,706
Jean, did you see
my dermatologist yet?

842
01:14:54,954 --> 01:14:56,444
Say, Gina, Gina!

843
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:02,024
l'm sorry.
l thought you were a friend.

844
01:15:04,697 --> 01:15:08,690
Welcome back to Barbetta, maestro.

845
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:12,225
Haven't seen you in long time.
How was your show in Europe?

846
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:14,704
- lt was good.
- Good.

847
01:15:18,744 --> 01:15:21,304
We have an excellent
Brunero Di Mont-al-Cino.

848
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,905
- What year? Sure.
- '73.

849
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:28,816
So how are you doing?

850
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:31,515
l was gonna get you some flowers.
l forgot.

851
01:15:35,628 --> 01:15:38,392
So, l hear you've been
hanging out with Andy.

852
01:15:38,464 --> 01:15:40,557
He seems like
he's pretty weird.

853
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:43,101
He's not, you know. He calls me
every day when he's out of town.

854
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:44,999
What's weird about him?

855
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:47,937
Well, you know, a lot of people
think that he's using you.

856
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:52,602
Why does everyone say that?
He's the only person who doesn't need--

857
01:15:54,947 --> 01:15:56,881
Never mind.

858
01:16:13,032 --> 01:16:14,966
So, what have you been up to?

859
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:20,094
Well, l'm starting med school
at Columbia in the fall.

860
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:21,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

861
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,707
Pretty excited about it, actually.

862
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:27,940
And Rene hired me as his secretary.
He's getting his poems published.

863
01:16:28,013 --> 01:16:31,710
l hate that asshole.
How is he?

864
01:16:31,784 --> 01:16:33,979
He's the same.

865
01:16:46,065 --> 01:16:47,498
That's fine.

866
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,145
- Giorgio?
- Yes, Mr. Basquiat?

867
01:17:07,219 --> 01:17:09,551
- You see this table behind me?
- Yes.

868
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,589
Put their bill on my tab.

869
01:17:11,657 --> 01:17:13,989
All right.

870
01:17:14,059 --> 01:17:16,550
- Giorgio.
- Yes, Mr. Basquiat?

871
01:17:16,628 --> 01:17:18,687
Don't tell them anything.
Just do it, please.

872
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:20,925
Of course not, Mr. Basquiat.

873
01:17:22,034 --> 01:17:25,128
- Why?
- l mean, what year is this?

874
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,006
l think about you a lot, you know.

875
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:42,679
And me, and the future 'cause--

876
01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:47,692
l'm gonna--

877
01:17:51,029 --> 01:17:53,998
ln my head, l had all these things
l was gonna say...

878
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,334
but they don't work.

879
01:18:03,842 --> 01:18:06,242
l'm sorry--

880
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:10,805
- l'm sorry--
- You don't need to be sorry.

881
01:18:16,155 --> 01:18:19,750
Well, you know, one good thing
came out of it.

882
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:23,124
l realized
l'm a really bad painter.

883
01:18:23,195 --> 01:18:26,096
lt was a relief.

884
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,060
l'm glad l could help.

885
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:37,840
l have to go to the bathroom.

886
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:39,393
Well, gee, Jean.
That was my favorite part.

887
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:49,312
lt needed more white.
That's better.

888
01:19:49,381 --> 01:19:53,613
You make me feel so worthless.

889
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:56,313
You're so famous now.

890
01:19:57,756 --> 01:19:59,951
Famous.

891
01:20:00,025 --> 01:20:03,859
l don't even have any friends anymore,
aside from you.

892
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:06,796
And everyone says...

893
01:20:06,865 --> 01:20:09,129
''Warhol, that...

894
01:20:09,201 --> 01:20:13,365
death-warmed-over person on drugs,
he's just using you''.

895
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:39,819
Well, maybe you just shouldn't
take things so seriously.

896
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,827
Bruno called.

897
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,837
He said people in Europe are saying
you're burning your candle at both ends.

898
01:20:46,905 --> 01:20:50,204
Well, l think it's awful
people are talking like that.

899
01:20:50,275 --> 01:20:54,541
l think you should, like, l don't know,
stick around, prove them wrong.

900
01:20:55,447 --> 01:20:58,280
No one thought l could make it
in the first place.

901
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:03,883
Then when it happened, they said,
yeah, but he'll never keep it up.

902
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:08,217
Now they say l'm killing myself.
Stuff like this.

903
01:21:10,095 --> 01:21:14,259
But then when l clean up,
they say, look, his art's dead.

904
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:23,771
l don't care anyway, because,
you know, l'm clean now. l'm healthy.

905
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:28,836
That's just not true, Jean.
You phone me at 4:00 in the--

906
01:21:28,914 --> 01:21:33,112
What are you doing?
You're painting out everything l do!

907
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:38,251
Wow.

908
01:21:38,323 --> 01:21:42,020
Oh, that's great.
System with just the ''M''.

909
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:53,694
Yeah, it's better.

910
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:58,741
You really think so?

911
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:00,243
God.

912
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:07,076
l can't even see
what's good anymore.

913
01:22:09,354 --> 01:22:12,152
Okay, l see what you mean
about that white.

914
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,749
After the show,
let's take a nice long vacation.

915
01:22:14,826 --> 01:22:17,317
Go to Hawaii.
You want to go to Hawaii?

916
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:25,136
That's what l'm gonna do.
l'm gonna go to Maui...

917
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:27,330
open a tequila factory...

918
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:30,534
write poetry,
play music again.

919
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,879
Give up this painting shit.

920
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,377
l wanna sing.

921
01:22:40,452 --> 01:22:43,114
Boy, that would be a pity.

922
01:22:43,188 --> 01:22:45,315
You're a real painter.

923
01:22:55,133 --> 01:22:58,967
Poster came out great.
Jean Michel sent this.

924
01:23:00,605 --> 01:23:02,197
Great.

925
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:35,733
Hey, that's mine.

926
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:39,072
- What's up?
- Mind your own fuckin' business.

927
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:42,079
Yeah, my man Samo
gonna make us rich.

928
01:23:43,915 --> 01:23:47,351
Hey, what the fuck?
What the fuck is your problem?

929
01:23:47,419 --> 01:23:49,353
Now it's worth more.

930
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:03,032
- l'm Samo.
- What did he say?

931
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:05,160
- He says he's Samo.
- l'm Samo.

932
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:56,320
Jean Michel...

933
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:59,414
crawling from the wreckage.

934
01:24:59,491 --> 01:25:02,892
- l need a dealer.
- Don't you have a bunch of them already?

935
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:09,566
Hey, Mary Boone, did l ever tell you
my grandfather was an oyster man?

936
01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:11,625
You know what that means?

937
01:25:11,703 --> 01:25:13,830
Mary, can we switch these?

938
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:15,839
This should be here.

939
01:25:15,907 --> 01:25:18,842
You should see it when you walk in.
That should be there.

940
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:22,038
- Hi, Jean. You know?
- l like it there.

941
01:25:22,113 --> 01:25:25,105
- Could we switch 'em? Yeah?
- Well, yes.

942
01:25:25,183 --> 01:25:28,914
- We'll rehang them.
- That's good. That's good there.

943
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:38,996
So what do you think?
l said l need a dealer.

944
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:41,032
- We could talk about it.
- Here l am.

945
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:45,433
No. l'll come by your studio.
Thursday at 3:30.

946
01:25:45,503 --> 01:25:47,437
What are you doin'?

947
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:50,235
- Nothin'.
- Wanna come over?

948
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:53,539
- What for?
- l'm your friend.

949
01:25:57,048 --> 01:26:00,643
- See you in an hour.
- Good. All right.

950
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:08,350
- So, what's wrong with tomorrow?
- l'm busy! l'm busy!

951
01:26:08,426 --> 01:26:10,360
Okay?
l'll come by your studio.

952
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:12,521
- Thursday at 3:30.
- 3:30. Yeah, yeah.

953
01:26:12,597 --> 01:26:15,225
l'll fit you in.

954
01:26:17,435 --> 01:26:19,528
Yeah, l might even
make you some gumbo.

955
01:26:25,577 --> 01:26:29,069
Excuse me.
ls this gallery open?

956
01:26:29,147 --> 01:26:33,709
Yeah.
No, please come back later.

957
01:26:39,391 --> 01:26:42,849
You like that painting?

958
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:45,395
l painted that for a friend
of mine who died.

959
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:51,260
Okay, that's good,
that's good.

960
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,677
Hey, Jean.
Hang on. Jean.

961
01:27:01,746 --> 01:27:06,945
This is a backdrop
for the Kabuki theater in Japan.

962
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:08,610
Sort of a...

963
01:27:09,487 --> 01:27:10,954
rebirth painting.

964
01:27:11,022 --> 01:27:14,048
l painted it forJoseph Beuys.

965
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:15,717
Felt like maybe he could
have painted it...

966
01:27:15,794 --> 01:27:19,594
or someone else was painting it
instead of me.

967
01:27:19,664 --> 01:27:21,461
l like it, it's good. Thanks.

968
01:27:23,802 --> 01:27:25,429
l'll be up in about ten minutes.

969
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,366
- Cortes.
- l know it.

970
01:27:30,442 --> 01:27:32,239
- You know? You know Cortes?
- Of course.

971
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:36,076
Here. You know
the Chinese calligraphers?

972
01:27:36,147 --> 01:27:39,082
They used to change
their name mid-career...

973
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:41,744
so they could start over
as someone else.

974
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:12,010
- Do you ever get sick of it?
- What, spaghetti?

975
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:15,917
No, the whole thing.
Painting.

976
01:28:19,324 --> 01:28:21,792
That's one of the few things
that makes me happy.

977
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,953
- Spaghetti?
- No, painting.

978
01:28:24,028 --> 01:28:28,124
l used to cook for a living.
That l got sick of.

979
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:30,861
You know, l still have a rash
from those white bucks?

980
01:28:34,906 --> 01:28:39,366
Hey, Eddie,
are we still on the lapdog remark?

981
01:28:39,444 --> 01:28:42,072
That's completely different, though.
l think Eddie Murphy's cool, you know?

982
01:28:42,147 --> 01:28:45,048
Yeah, but he can't paint.
Not that l know of.

983
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:48,745
- What about the shit they write?
- Let me tell you something.

984
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:51,288
There's about ten people
on the planet...

985
01:28:51,356 --> 01:28:55,690
who know anything about painting,
and Andy is one of them.

986
01:28:57,295 --> 01:29:00,787
You know, your audience
isn't even born yet.

987
01:29:03,168 --> 01:29:07,798
Personally, l'm surprised
when anybody comes to my openings.

988
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:13,270
l haven't felt like talking to him
since that thing came out.

989
01:29:13,344 --> 01:29:15,869
l mean, l'm nobody's mascot, you know?

990
01:29:15,947 --> 01:29:18,177
- Did he say that?
- As long as l've known Andy...

991
01:29:18,249 --> 01:29:21,047
he never asked me for a thing,
except to speak to you...

992
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:22,984
about getting off drugs.

993
01:29:23,054 --> 01:29:26,717
And he's painted my picture,
l've painted his picture...

994
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:29,351
you know,
we've eaten dinner together.

995
01:29:29,427 --> 01:29:31,554
He doesn't care about me.
He cares about you.

996
01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:34,063
You're the one he cares about.
You're his friend.

997
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:37,363
- Did he say that?
- Listen, fuck that article!

998
01:29:37,435 --> 01:29:41,064
lt doesn't matter.
Forget about it.

999
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,233
Come on, eat.

1000
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,578
Good conversation is hard to find
in this town.

1001
01:29:56,387 --> 01:29:58,912
Papa, the TV's broken.
Can you fix it?

1002
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:02,785
Sure, honey.
l'll be there in a minute.

1003
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:09,956
She knows more about painting
than Eddie Murphy.

1004
01:30:26,351 --> 01:30:28,376
Your hair was different
the last time l saw you.

1005
01:30:29,521 --> 01:30:31,921
lt's nice.

1006
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:33,548
Do you like your dad's paintings?

1007
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,559
Some of'em.

1008
01:30:41,533 --> 01:30:43,626
Stand still, Stella.

1009
01:30:47,505 --> 01:30:49,598
You can keep it.

1010
01:30:49,674 --> 01:30:51,107
Thanks.

1011
01:31:11,696 --> 01:31:13,527
You're much prettier than that.

1012
01:31:15,733 --> 01:31:18,531
- Where'd Jean go?
- He just left.

1013
01:31:18,603 --> 01:31:20,036
He did?

1014
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:43,593
He's pissing in our hall.

1015
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:46,855
Really.

1016
01:32:07,285 --> 01:32:11,244
Hey, Duckman.
Can l get two ducks, man?

1017
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:40,443
- No, please, please, go away.
- Baby, it's me. lt's me.

1018
01:32:40,518 --> 01:32:44,682
- Oh, it's you. What a day.
- What's this mean?

1019
01:32:44,756 --> 01:32:48,055
Do l look that bad?
What's the matter?

1020
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:50,060
You haven't heard.

1021
01:32:51,763 --> 01:32:55,028
Andy is dead.
Wait for me.

1022
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,300
Come here, please.

1023
01:36:27,044 --> 01:36:30,480
Come here.
Come here, just f--

1024
01:36:30,548 --> 01:36:34,143
Just for a second.
Just come here.

1025
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,612
Please.

1026
01:36:40,358 --> 01:36:43,452
My mom's in here.

1027
01:36:43,527 --> 01:36:46,121
Matilde Basquiat.
l want to take her home.

1028
01:36:46,197 --> 01:36:47,994
Visiting hours are over.
Come back tomorrow.

1029
01:36:48,065 --> 01:36:49,999
Yeah, but l'm not here to visit.
l want to take her home.

1030
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:52,058
Look, don't cause me any trouble.
Do me the favor?

1031
01:36:52,136 --> 01:36:55,162
l don't want to--
l just want to take her home.

1032
01:36:55,239 --> 01:36:59,073
Open up, please.
Open up.

1033
01:36:59,143 --> 01:37:02,044
- Please, just open up.
- l said, don't cause me any trouble.

1034
01:37:02,113 --> 01:37:07,016
- l asked you nicely.
- And l asked you nicely. Open up.

1035
01:37:08,152 --> 01:37:10,086
l said, open up.

1036
01:37:11,389 --> 01:37:15,792
Open up.
Open up! Open up!

1037
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,987
Open up!

1038
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:48,207
<i>Willie Mays. Willie Mays.</i>

1039
01:38:51,989 --> 01:38:53,923
Hey, Willie.

1040
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,794
Come on, Willie.

1041
01:39:02,767 --> 01:39:04,701
Come on.

1042
01:39:14,745 --> 01:39:16,679
Hey, Willie.

1043
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,284
Come on, Willie.

1044
01:40:28,819 --> 01:40:31,549
Hey, Benny.
My mom told me this story.

1045
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:34,624
Or was it a dream?

1046
01:40:36,093 --> 01:40:39,153
There was this little prince
with a magic crown.

1047
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:43,064
<i>And this evil warlock
kidnapped him.</i>

1048
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:47,503
<i>Locked him in this cell in this
huge tower. Took away his voice.</i>

1049
01:40:47,571 --> 01:40:50,972
<i>There was a window with bars...</i>

1050
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:53,737
<i>and the prince kept smashing his head
against the bars...</i>

1051
01:40:53,811 --> 01:40:57,713
<i>hoping that someone
would hear the sound...</i>

1052
01:40:57,781 --> 01:41:00,215
<i>and find him.</i>

1053
01:41:02,453 --> 01:41:06,014
<i>The crown made the most beautiful sound
that anyone had ever heard.</i>

1054
01:41:08,259 --> 01:41:11,558
<i>You could hear it ringing for miles.</i>

1055
01:41:11,629 --> 01:41:13,824
<i>lt was so beautiful.</i>

1056
01:41:13,898 --> 01:41:16,059
<i>The people wanted
to grab the air.</i>

1057
01:41:18,469 --> 01:41:20,767
<i>They never found the prince.</i>

1058
01:41:22,006 --> 01:41:25,032
<i>He never got out of the room.</i>

1059
01:41:25,109 --> 01:41:28,840
<i>But that sound he made...</i>

1060
01:41:28,913 --> 01:41:31,211
<i>filled everything up with beauty.</i>

1061
01:41:36,654 --> 01:41:38,918
<i>lt's definitely time
to get out of here.</i>

1062
01:41:44,728 --> 01:41:47,162
Benny, fuck Hawaii.

1063
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:49,165
Let's go to lreland.

1064
01:41:49,233 --> 01:41:51,997
We'll stop in every bar
and have a drink.
