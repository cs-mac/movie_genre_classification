1
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,242
Senator Samuel Foley died a minute ago
here at St Vincent's.

2
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,197
At the bedside was political sidekick
Senator Joseph Paine.

3
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,521
Senator Joseph Paine speaking. I want
the Governor's residence, Jackson City.

4
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,805
Hello?

5
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,006
Oh, Joe! Oh no!

6
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:49,447
It couldn't have happened at a worse
time. Tell Jim Taylor I'm coming home.

7
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,077
- Yes, Joe. Right away.
- What is it?

8
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:57,642
Sam Foley's dead. Of all times...
Foley had to go and die on us.

9
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:00,881
- Who are you calling this late?
- Taylor, my dear.

10
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,007
- What's up?
- Sam Foley died tonight.

11
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:08,685
That's too bad.
Don't get excited. Is Paine coming?

12
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,603
Yes, Jim. Yes, Jim. Yes, Jim.

13
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,488
He'd drop dead
if you ever said no to him.

14
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:19,961
This is no time for jokes.
I've got to appoint a new senator.

15
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:23,167
The Governor will see all committees.

16
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,321
Tell the governor
I won't wait any longer.

17
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,878
I guess Taylor's telling him what to do.

18
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,962
Tell them to wait.
I'll see them immediately.

19
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,442
I've got to see those citizens. They
want a say in who goes to the Senate.

20
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:42,807
- Ten to one they've got a man.
- Relax, Happy. Stop having kittens.

21
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,679
Tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine they have
one more minute to make up their minds.

22
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,966
- You go and tell Jim Taylor.
- I will tell him.

23
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,246
It's high time
I told Jim Taylor a thing or two.

24
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:59,767
If you and Joe'll gab on about this
appointment, I'll see the committees.

25
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:04,047
- See them when we're finished.
- Yes, Jim. But hurry, will you?

26
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,040
We'll hurry.

27
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:10,448
That's telling him, old boy.

28
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:14,805
With this Willet Creek dam coming up. -

29
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,123
- The man who goes to the Senate can't
ask any questions or talk out of tone.

30
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,202
- We have to be absolutely sure of him.
- I say Horace Miller.

31
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,678
He'll take orders all right.

32
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,602
Suppose we don't
go through with this dam?

33
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,206
Postpone it until next session
of Congress. Or drop it all together.

34
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:39,159
That would be a crime, Joe...
After all the work we put in on it.

35
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,322
Burying it in this deficiency bill
as nice as you please. -

36
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,244
- Having it approved. It's rolling
along... like taking candy from a baby.

37
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,606
Is it worth the risk of a scandal?

38
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:57,241
What's the matter with you?
I wouldn't take the slightest risk -

39
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:01,960
- Now you've made such a great
reputation for yourself in the Senate.

40
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,122
Look at the campaign I've started
for you in all of my papers

41
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:11,924
- It's a little obscure, isn't it?
- I don't know... Maybe.

42
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:17,087
But after all, you're the logical man
from the West for the national ticket.

43
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:20,047
At the convention anything can happen.

44
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,522
If what you say about the future is
possible, why not drop this dam?

45
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:30,968
We can't do it. We've been quietly
buying up all the land around it.

46
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,041
Holding it in dummy names.

47
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:37,804
If we drop it now,
it'll bring about an investigation.

48
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:42,963
It will show that we were going to sell
it to the state under phoney names.

49
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:48,567
The smartest thing for us to do is
to push it through the way it's going.

50
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,517
All right. Appoint Miller
if you are sure he will take orders.

51
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:55,806
Don't worry. He'll take orders.
Come on.

52
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,039
- Just one more minute.
- Happy, we've got your man.

53
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,165
- Horace Miller.
- Horace Miller?!

54
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,719
A born stooge!
Horace'll perform like a trained seal.

55
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,199
- What did I tell you, Joe?
- But if I throw a party man like...

56
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:13,918
For reasons I can't go into now,
it has to be Horace Miller.

57
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:17,001
I've given you the man,
make out your ticket.

58
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,560
But I have to see those angry
committees first! Work for harmony!

59
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,757
Considering the candidates who answer to
the high qualifications of senators. -

60
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:29,568
One name shone out like a beacon.

61
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,358
- The honourable Horace Miller.
- No!

62
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:36,601
- He's Taylor's stooge!
- The veterans'll have no part of him!

63
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,681
The New Citizens Committee
won't stand for him!

64
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,842
So... they named their own candidate.
Who?

65
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,569
- You won't like him.
- Who?

66
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,960
- Henry Hill.
- That crackpot, that longhead!

67
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:53,519
- You should have killed that so fast.
- I couldn't. Those men...

68
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,203
Never mind. Forget it.

69
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,564
That bunch is out for blood...

70
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,961
I said: Forget about them.
Horace Miller goes to the Senate.

71
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,360
- I won't send Horace Miller.
- Oh, you won't?

72
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,645
No, I won't.

73
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:12,768
I won't let you stand there callously
and wreck my political future.

74
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:15,966
Your political future?
I gave it to you as a present.

75
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,768
I can grab it back so fast
it'll make your head swim.

76
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:23,400
You've got a nerve worrying about
your future when we're in this spot.

77
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,639
The man is Miller.

78
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,680
Hello, Dad.

79
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,484
Is it getting you down?

80
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,561
- Is what getting me down?
- You're in a pickle, Pop.

81
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,519
- Looks like Henry Hill or else...
- No, it's Horace Miller or else!

82
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,126
I wouldn't appoint an old twerp
like Miller. Taylor or no Taylor.

83
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,407
- What's Taylor got to do with this?
- He's still running the show, ain't he?

84
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,164
I won't have this conversation
carried on by the children.

85
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,240
Won't you listen to them for a change?

86
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,242
No doubt my children
could make this appointment.

87
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:05,642
- That's easy, Dad. Jefferson Smith!
- He's the only senator to have.

88
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,006
- He ought to be president.
- I like Jeff Smith.

89
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,320
- Me too.
- Now everybody's been heard from.

90
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:16,368
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't
know him from a hole in the ground.

91
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:19,407
- Head of the Boy Rangers.
- A boy?

92
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,644
No, Jeff's a man. Biggest expert we got
on wild game, animals and rocks.

93
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:29,882
Right now he's the greatest hero.
It's all over the headlines.

94
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:34,440
Didn't you see about the forest fire
all around Sweetwater?

95
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:37,169
Jeff put that out. Himself.

96
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,401
- If you really want a senator...
- I do not want a senator.

97
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,039
- No more of this nonsense!
- He's the greatest American we got.

98
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:48,760
He knows what George Washington said
by heart and Boy Stuff is swell.

99
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:53,241
- What stuff?
- That's the name of Jeff's paper.

100
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:57,925
Look, here's one. It's great!
Everybody reads it. A million kids.

101
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:02,367
- Let me read you...
- I'm in no mood for childish prattle.

102
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:06,078
- Prattle! You're all wet.
- You couldn't do better.

103
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,286
- Better than what?
- Jeff for senator!

104
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,679
You want to get out of your pickle.

105
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,761
50,000 kids with two folks a piece!
And they vote!

106
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,763
- You want to do some good.
- If you'll ever stand up like a man...

107
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:22,717
That settles it. I will not
be belittled by my own children.

108
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,438
All my nerves are strained
to the breaking point.

109
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:32,206
Henry Hill, Horace Miller...
Miller, Hill... Hill, Miller.

110
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,926
Heads Hill, tails Miller.

111
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,758
That's good enough for me.

112
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,241
- Good evening.
- Is Jefferson Smith at home?

113
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:28,128
Yes. Won't you step in?

114
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,727
A boy ranger to the Senate?

115
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,280
A simpleton. A big-eyed patriot.
Knows Lincoln and Washington by heart.

116
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,758
Stands at attention
in the Governor's presence.

117
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:55,568
Even collects stray boys and cats.

118
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,517
You know what I mean. A perfect man.
Never in politics in his life.

119
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:03,728
Wouldn't know what it was all about
in two years, let alone two months.

120
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,404
This was the genius of the stroke:
It means votes.

121
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,959
The hero of 50,000 boys
and 100,000 parents.

122
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:15,407
Just look over those congratulations.
I tell you, gentlemen...

123
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,357
- You made the appointment without me.
- When the lightning struck...

124
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,123
You didn't ask me!

125
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,529
Wait a minute, Jim. Happy may have
hit on something tremendous here.

126
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,883
Do you really think you can handle him
in Washington? That it's all right?

127
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:41,679
I think it's all right. A young patriot.
Recites Lincoln and Jefferson.

128
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:47,560
Turned loose in our nation's capital.
Yes... I think it's all right.

129
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:55,921
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose.
It's the greatest appointment ever made.

130
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,718
- Give a banquet and declare a holiday.
- A star-spangled banquet!

131
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,718
Who did your governor grant that honour?

132
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,484
Some wealthy, influential citizen
merely to curry favour?

133
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,401
No!!

134
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:19,687
Did he give it
to some unworthy political hireling?

135
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:24,639
No! What did he do?
He went down among the people.

136
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:29,724
And there he found...
a nugget.

137
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:37,282
We are gathered here tonight -

138
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:42,842
- To acclaim and wish God's speed
to Senator Jefferson Smith.

139
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,440
Thank you, I...

140
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:04,607
I can't help feeling
there's been a big mistake somehow.

141
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:12,603
Of course I never could see why we
needed two senators from this state -

142
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:17,524
- When we have a man like Joseph Paine
representing us already.

143
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:25,448
He probably doesn't remember me.
He knew my father well. Clayton Smith.

144
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:31,159
They went to school together
and were very good friends.

145
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,605
Just to sit here with him
is a very great honour for me.

146
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:45,083
Because Dad used to tell me Joe Paine
was the finest man he ever knew.

147
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:52,528
Get up, Joe. Take a bow.

148
00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:02,128
I don't think I'll be much help to you
down in Washington, Senator.

149
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,598
I'll do my best.

150
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,684
Although, with all my might...
I can promise you one thing:

151
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:15,845
I'll do nothing to disgrace the office
of United States Senator.

152
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,844
Senator Jefferson Smith.

153
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:51,481
The boy rangers are very proud
to take this oppor... occasion...

154
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,528
We are happy
to take this opportunity...

155
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,486
To present.

156
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:03,246
...to resent this... small token
of our affection and esteem.

157
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,242
- To the best...
...friend, friend!

158
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,401
Oh, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.

159
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,324
To carry your laws
when you get to Washington.

160
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:52,080
It isn't much, but if you insist.
Here's this week's.

161
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:56,083
Boy Stuff.
Printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff.

162
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,399
You're just like your father.
Even to the hat.

163
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,403
Same old dreamer too.
One look at you and I can see him.

164
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,925
Back at his old desk, hat and all,
getting out his paper.

165
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,525
Always kept his hat on,
so he was ready to do battle.

166
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:16,001
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.
Champion of lost causes.

167
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:20,003
Dad always said
those were the only worthy causes.

168
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,127
You don't have to tell me.
We were a team.

169
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,247
The struggling editor
and the struggling lawyer.

170
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:31,085
- The twin champions of lost causes.
- Ma has told me a thousand times.

171
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:33,809
His last fight was his best.

172
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:38,679
He and his little four page paper
against that mining syndicate.

173
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:43,240
And all to defend the right of
one small miner who stuck to his claim.

174
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:49,767
They tried everything.
Bribery, intimidation...

175
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,365
And then...

176
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,239
Yes, Ma found him
slumped over his desk that morning...

177
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:05,200
Shot in the back.
I was there... I can see him.

178
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:11,126
At that old roll-top desk,
still with his hat on.

179
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,084
Still with his hat on.

180
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,847
I know...

181
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,129
I suppose when a fellow bucks up
against a big organisation like that. -

182
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:29,565
One man by himself can't get very far.

183
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,481
No.

184
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:37,037
- Washington, huh?
- Yes, Senator, for the fifth time.

185
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:41,600
- I'd better see about my pigeons.
- They're coming along.

186
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,725
My head is like a balloon.

187
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,768
Two whole days! I never knew
there was so much American history.

188
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:53,844
- I got them. They're all right.
- That ends that crisis. Come along.

189
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,159
Hello, father.

190
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,603
Let me get to him.

191
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:05,362
- Susan, this is Jefferson...
- I don't care, I want my money now.

192
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,884
One dollar each for the milk fund.

193
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,483
- That's five dollars.
- Yes.

194
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,804
- You've got five dollars?
- Can't seem to find anything but keys.

195
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:22,247
- Jeff, this is my daughter Susan.
- Not the new senator?

196
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,320
He's marvellous.

197
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,684
What have you got there, Senator?

198
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,443
They're pigeons
to carry messages back to Ma.

199
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:33,807
The one that makes it home in the best
time I'll enter in the naionals.

200
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:38,485
- Hello, Joe!
- I'm glad to see you.

201
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:44,521
Meet Mr Cook and Mr Griffith,
members of our state headquarters here.

202
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,487
A pleasure. You'll do the state proud.

203
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,528
Welcome. The wildlife here
is not like you're used to.

204
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,725
They wear high heels.

205
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,643
We must see a lot of you
and your little feathered friends.

206
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,084
Thank you very much.

207
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,326
- Come on, father.
- Chick.

208
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:08,198
- I've got him. We'll be along.
- Good luck, Senator.

209
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:14,928
- Things sure happen fast around here.
- You must get yourself out of low gear.

210
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:18,604
Let's get these bags
and livestock together.

211
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:23,126
- Look! There it is!
- Who? What?

212
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,885
- The capitol dome.
- It's been there a long time, sir.

213
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,121
Yes, sir. This way, Senator.

214
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:44,960
Maybe we ought to meet him
in short pants with hatchets.

215
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:48,041
What did he bring his pigeons for?

216
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:52,999
Suppose there's a storm, all the lines
are down, how will you reach Ma?

217
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:58,562
This way, Senator. Where is he?
I told that cookie to...

218
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,402
Come along. Let's find him.

219
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,399
- Positively not in the station.
- What happened to him?

220
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:09,560
Did you look in the inn?

221
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,324
I'll brain that guy.
Call Paine, call Saunders.

222
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,607
Call the marines, call somebody.

223
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:20,524
Saunders, it's McGann.
Has Smith shown up at his office yet?

224
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:25,763
- What do you mean? What's so funny?
- Nothing. Try a butterfly net.

225
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,604
If he does show up,
Paine's waiting with the newspaper men.

226
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,839
Let him know right away.

227
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:36,446
Sure, I'll hang a light in the belfry.
One, if by land. Two, if by sea.

228
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:52,406
Diz, what do you think?
Daniel Boone's lost.

229
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:55,402
Lost in the wilds of Washington.

230
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,481
If your boyfriend'll blaze trails,
I'll go to the press club.

231
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:03,120
Stick around. He might want to go
hiking. Don't miss out on the exercise.

232
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,487
Every time I think of exercise, I have
to lie down until the feeling leaves me.

233
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:11,562
- Wouldn't it be fun if he was lost?
- The boy ranger? He'll show up.

234
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,720
He must have a compass with him.

235
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,244
Where would I go if I was a boy ranger?

236
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,197
- Boy, am I tired!
- Call all the hospitals. Hurry up.

237
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:24,840
- Get me a bed while you're at it.
- Will you hold this a minute, please?

238
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,485
Come back, here!

239
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:13,758
"...that from these honoured dead
we take increased devotion -

240
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:19,606
- To that cause for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion -

241
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:26,322
- That we here highly... resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain.

242
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:31,517
That this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of -

243
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:34,279
Freedom -

244
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:38,806
- And that government of the people,
by the people, for the people -

245
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,767
Shall not perish from the earth."

246
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:53,208
Why don't they try the police, call out
some bloodhounds or Indian guides?

247
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,406
The one place he knows is the office.
You stay there and wait.

248
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,118
All right, Senator.
Just one half hour more.

249
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:06,082
- Why don't I quit?
- Eight to five he's plastered.

250
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:10,800
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out?
I'm fed up with politics -

251
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:14,803
- And now I've let them
talk me into staying.

252
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,927
Secretary to a leader of squirts.

253
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,968
Because I need the job
and a new suit of clothes.

254
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,804
- Would you settle for a husband?
- I sure would.

255
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:33,362
You know my standing offer. Diz Moore,
poet of Washington correspondents.

256
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,841
- That again.
- I'd cherish you and I'd stay sober.

257
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:44,881
Diz, you're a wonderful egg. Maybe if
I saw you once with your hair combed.

258
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:50,925
- I don't think even that would do it.
- No point in combing my hair then.

259
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:57,881
Honorary appointment. They just need
a dope here for a couple of months.

260
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,005
Yes?

261
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:02,205
Yes!

262
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:05,520
- What do you want?
- Office of Jefferson Smith?

263
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:07,645
No.

264
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,562
- The man downstairs...
- No!

265
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:23,406
They must have picked the prize dummy.
Say, wait a minute.

266
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:26,003
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?

267
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,518
- Say, mister. What's your name?
- Jefferson Smith.

268
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:34,522
Come right in, Mr Smith.
Right this way.

269
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:38,318
Hold everything. Stay there.
Now don't move!

270
00:25:38,489 --> 00:25:42,004
Helen, get me the Madison.
Senator Paine. Hurry up.

271
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,478
- Is anything the matter?
- Oh, no. No!

272
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:51,724
Dear Senator, it may be customary on the
prairie to not show up for five hours.

273
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:56,280
I'm very sorry about that, Miss...
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?

274
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:59,600
Yes, I'm Saunders.
This is Mr Moore, member of the press.

275
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:02,727
- Meet the senator.
- I'm very happy to know you, sir.

276
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:05,562
You cut your way through that forest.

277
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,248
Senator Paine, we've got him.
He's right here and he's sober.

278
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,969
Yes, I'll have him right over there.

279
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,325
I'm awfully sorry. It wasn't until
I was fairly well along on the bus...

280
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:25,801
- Did you say bus?
- It was one of those sightseers.

281
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:32,643
I've never been called
absent-minded before.

282
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:38,327
But there it was all of a sudden.
Staring right at me at the station.

283
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:42,562
- There what was?
- The dome. The capitol dome.

284
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:46,517
Big as life.
Sparkling away under the old sun.

285
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:53,759
I just started to go towards it,
and there was a bus outside. -

286
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,318
And I just naturally got aboard.

287
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,162
Most natural thing in the world.

288
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,122
I don't think I've ever been
so thrilled in my life.

289
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,087
And that Lincoln memorial...

290
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,319
Gee whiz!

291
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:11,644
Mr Lincoln, there he is.

292
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,287
He's just looking straight at you
as you come up those steps.

293
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:22,239
Just... sitting there like he was
waiting for somebody to come along.

294
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,448
- Well, he's got nothing on me.
- I'm sorry.

295
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:31,478
If you're ready, we'll go over
to the hotel. Paine's waiting for you.

296
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:46,118
- Is this my office?
- No, you have a private office.

297
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,359
A private office, huh?

298
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,440
In there?

299
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,679
Right in this door?

300
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:05,201
All right, Senator. Where is he?
Has he gone out again?

301
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,079
He's in there. See you later.
I'll go out and drink this over.

302
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,047
- Whose statue is that?
- I wouldn't know in the daytime.

303
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:21,360
Look, the capitol dome!
It's all lighted up!

304
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,920
You better relax, Senator.
You'll get yourself plumb wore out.

305
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,638
Gee whiz,
so many things happening all at once.

306
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:34,846
- What time does the Senate...
...convene.

307
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:37,443
Twelve noon.

308
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,043
Boy, that'll be something.

309
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,519
- You know what I'll do in the morning?
- What will you do?

310
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:47,887
I'll go out to Mount Vernon.
It will be a fine thing to do.

311
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:52,679
Visit Washington's home before walking
into the Senate for the first time.

312
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,398
Wonderful.
It'll put you right in the mood.

313
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,321
What's that?!

314
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:01,003
Oh, movie houses...

315
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,605
I'm still asking myself? What is he:
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

316
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,365
Me sitting around playing straight
for that phoney patriotic chatter.

317
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,805
Carrying bibs for an infant
with little flags in his fist.

318
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:23,645
- I can't take it. I quit.
- Take it easy, simmer down.

319
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,164
Here. Take this.

320
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,878
You know what he'll do tomorrow
before taking that Senate seat?

321
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:33,803
Go to Mount Vernon to get in the mood.
A warm-up.

322
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:37,564
Your boss? A nut?
I knew there was a story in that guy.

323
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:39,845
Go chase an ambulance.

324
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:43,968
Let me at him, five minutes.
I'll make it right with you.

325
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:46,040
Here's what I'll do.

326
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:50,248
A World Series pass. In a month
it'll be worth 15 bucks.

327
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:52,604
- Well...
- You're not talking to this guy.

328
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:54,441
What do you say?

329
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,840
- Your pals want to get in on this?
- I want a scoop.

330
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,604
Either it's lots of reporters
and lots of tickets or...

331
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,797
- Call them before I change my mind.
- Okay. I'll see you right here.

332
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:12,602
- What are you gonna do?
- Get my fall outfit and quit in style.

333
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,920
You've got more sense
than to put Nosey on to that guy.

334
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:18,678
That's it! Open your eyes!

335
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:24,039
- Tell us about yourself.
- I hear you've got a boys club.

336
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:26,518
Have you got any special axe to grind?

337
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,601
Pet idea...
Save the buffalo, pension bill?

338
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:32,761
You must have one idea
for the good of the country.

339
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:35,443
Well, I have got one idea...

340
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:39,122
I think it would be a wonderful idea -

341
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:42,998
- To have a national boys camp
out in our state.

342
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:48,084
If we could get the poor kids off the
streets for a few months every summer -

343
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:53,243
- And let them learn something
about nature and American ideals.

344
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,798
What would this set the government back?

345
00:30:55,969 --> 00:31:01,202
Nothing at all. My idea is
that the government lends us the money -

346
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:06,762
- And then the boys pay it back
by sending pennies and nickels.

347
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,998
The government's got enough
on its hands already without...

348
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:15,923
That's great. The government's
putting dough in too many places.

349
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:19,923
Senator, what do you think of
the girls in this town?

350
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:24,526
Four of them came up and kissed me
when I got off the train.

351
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,321
Were they pretty?

352
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:31,687
That Miss Susan Paine is about
the prettiest girl I ever did see.

353
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:35,604
How about some more pictures?

354
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,318
You're a nature lover.
Can you handle some sign language?

355
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:41,798
Do you know any bird calls?

356
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:45,882
- Can you make a sound like an eagle?
- Well, here's one...

357
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,519
I'm the only one in the state
who knows this one.

358
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,562
His first whiff of Washington?

359
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,281
- Do I actually see this?
- What is it?

360
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:24,285
- Did you want to see me?
- What's this about you quitting?

361
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:28,044
- I'm not a registered nurse.
- How did this happen?

362
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:31,758
The ranger's notices.
I haven't the slightest idea.

363
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,241
I merely took him home.
It's not my job to tuck him in.

364
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:39,446
McGann's out of his mind.
Smith's gone again.

365
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:43,204
He went to Mount Vernon
to give himself a patriotic address.

366
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,167
Stop this nonsense.
Go back to Smith's office -

367
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,479
And get him to the Senate by twelve.

368
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:52,767
I wasn't given a brain
to tell a boy ranger what time it is.

369
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,957
If certain things happen, you'll get
one of the biggestjobs in Washington.

370
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:01,838
When I came here,
my eyes were big blue question marks.

371
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:05,001
- Now they're big green dollar marks.
- Smart girl.

372
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:08,844
Finish this job properly
and you'll get a handsome bonus.

373
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,718
Keep Smith away from anything
that smacks of politics.

374
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:15,403
Including Willet Creek dam?

375
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:20,598
Including Willet Creek dam.
Go back to your work.

376
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:29,399
- This is it, Senator.
- The United States Senate.

377
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:37,198
- Mr Carson, this is Senator Smith.
- How do you do, Senator?

378
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:41,078
Glad to see you.
Show Senator Smith to his seat.

379
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,205
Yes, sir. Right this way, sir.

380
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:46,759
- Well, goodbye.
- Wish me luck.

381
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:17,518
- That's the boy wonder?
- What is the Senate coming to?

382
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,884
- You got Daniel Boone in all right.
- Daniel in the lion's den.

383
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:31,486
Nice job you and the ambulance chasers
did in the papers this morning.

384
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,363
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk.
Daniel Webster used to use it.

385
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:41,838
Daniel Webster sat here?

386
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:45,524
Give you something to shoot at.
If you'll do any talking.

387
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:49,045
- I'll just sit around and listen.
- That's the way to get re-elected.

388
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:53,441
This is the calendar for the day.
You'll find the Senate manual in here.

389
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:56,328
Anything else you want,
just snap for a page.

390
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:01,404
- Where's the majority leader?
- Right over there. Senator Agnew.

391
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:04,367
Next to Senator Barnes,
the minority leader.

392
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:08,647
- Where's the press gallery?
- Above the Vice- President's chair.

393
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,688
- Front row is the big news services.
- What's that up there?

394
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:17,969
That corner is for guides and sightseers
who come in to rest their feet.

395
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,597
Over there the Senators' friends sit.

396
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:25,081
Front row, the empty one, is for
the president and White House guests.

397
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:28,321
Back there is the diplomatic section.

398
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:34,408
They and the page boys
are the only real class in the place.

399
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,005
- I'll take your hat to the cloak room.
- I'll give you a boy ranger button.

400
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,046
- Swell!
- What's your name?

401
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:42,882
- Richard Jones.
- Dick, thanks ever so much.

402
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:44,926
Good luck, Senator.

403
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:49,360
- See you in the White House, Joe.
- No kidding.

404
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:51,565
Sorry, I was in committee.

405
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:57,519
I see you had a little publicity...
Have you got your credentials?

406
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:04,839
- Saunders gave them to me.
- That's... that's fine.

407
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:10,723
When the Vice-president calls you,
I'll meet you in the centre aisle.

408
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:13,687
This is Daniel Webster's desk.
Did you know that?

409
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,760
He won't mind.

410
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,487
Well...

411
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:48,163
The Senate will come to order.
The chaplain will pray.

412
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:51,679
Oh, God, our heavenly Father.

413
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:54,602
In these critical days,
when our beloved country labours with -

414
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:58,318
- Such grave and disturbing problems,
look upon us, we beseech Thee. -

415
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,925
- And give us the light and strength
to be just and merciful.

416
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:07,243
So that we may best serve our people
and our fellow men everywhere. Amen.

417
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,887
I ask that the reading of the journal
be dispensed with and stand approved.

418
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:24,325
Is there objection?
The journal stands approved.

419
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:27,640
Mr President...
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

420
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,404
- The clerk will call the roll.
- Mr Agnew? Mr Albert?...

421
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:37,082
88 senators answered.
A quorum is present.

422
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,325
I present the credentials of
honourable Jefferson Smith -

423
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:45,447
- Who has just been appointed senator
by the governor of my state.

424
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,761
The senator is present. I ask that the
oath of office be administered to him.

425
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:52,807
If the senator designate
presents himself at the desk. -

426
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:55,483
The oath will be administered.

427
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:14,241
Mr President,
I rise to a question of order.

428
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:18,084
I seek to ascertain if the gentleman
about to be sworn in -

429
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:21,605
- Is fully aware of the responsibilities
of his high office.

430
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,920
I refer to his shameless performance
for the newspapers.

431
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:29,241
A performance that his party
no doubt will applaud.

432
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,684
But one that brings him down to
the level of a sideshow entertainer -

433
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,559
- And reflects on the sincerity and
sanity of the highest body of lawmakers.

434
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:45,200
Is this the gentleman's conception of
the nature of his office?

435
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:47,041
I don't understand...

436
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:51,088
The designate has no voice until
the oath of office has been administered.

437
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:55,367
I will answer. My colleague was innocent
in the matter referred to.

438
00:38:55,529 --> 00:39:00,444
He was completely misquoted. I know
Mr Smith and personally vouch for him.

439
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:04,124
He has the greatest possible respect
for his office.

440
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:06,200
Mr President...

441
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:09,679
The swearing in of the senator
is the order of business.

442
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,204
The gentleman will raise his right hand.

443
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:15,998
Do you solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the USA -

444
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:19,047
- Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic. -

445
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:22,758
- And that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same?

446
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:27,366
That you take this obligation freely
without mental reservation -

447
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:31,317
- And that you will faithfully discharge
the duties of the office -

448
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:35,164
- Upon which you are about to enter,
so help you God?

449
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,365
I do.

450
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,645
You can talk all you want to now.

451
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:46,245
Meet the majority leader.
He'll be a good friend.

452
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:49,242
Any friend of Joe's is a friend of mine.

453
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:53,197
Don't worry about the others,
they're just senators.

454
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:58,800
The shameless way in which the
deficiency bill has been delayed -

455
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:01,278
Is nothing short of criminal.

456
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:05,078
The country agencies
are in desperate need of these funds.

457
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:08,764
The prime business of this body
is the immediate passage of...

458
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:50,605
- Who let you in?
- Why aren't you chasing ambulances?

459
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:53,329
Smith is punching everybody he meets.

460
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,480
Oh, Tarzan!

461
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,085
Boys, meet Senator Smith.

462
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:11,324
- You have something on your mind?
- Why don't you tell the truth for once?

463
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:14,799
- The truth!
- The man wants the truth!

464
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:18,803
"What is the truth?" said jesting pilot
and would not stay for an answer.

465
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:23,087
- You want it dished out or in a bottle?
- What do people read in the paper?

466
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:27,447
This morning they read
that an incompetent clown had arrived. -

467
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:30,362
Parading like a member of the Senate.

468
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:36,080
If you thought as much about being
honest as you do about being smart...

469
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:39,082
We're the only ones
who can afford to be honest.

470
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,286
We don't have to be re-elected.

471
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,964
We tell them when phoneys come
to make their laws.

472
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:50,759
- You don't get the truth in the Senate.
- What do you know about making laws?

473
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:54,319
- I don't pretend to know.
- Then what are you doing in the Senate?

474
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:56,844
Honorary appointment!

475
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:01,048
When the country needs men
who have courage like never before. -

476
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:04,918
- He's just gonna decorate a chair
and get himself honoured.

477
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,445
He'll vote, sure.
Just like his colleague tells him to.

478
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:13,239
Yes, sir! Like a Christmas tiger.
He will nod and vote yes.

479
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:17,038
You're not a senator!
You're an honorary stooge.

480
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:19,006
You ought to be shown up.

481
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:23,321
- Have a drink, Senator?
- It will taste better than the truth.

482
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:35,157
Hey, Senator...
don't let it get you down.

483
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:38,366
A hundred years from now,
nobody will know the difference.

484
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:42,764
The point is, they're right.
I'm just decorating a chair.

485
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:47,639
If I'm going to vote,
I ought to study some of the bills.

486
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:53,202
- The bills?
- Otherwise I'm just a Christmas tiger.

487
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:57,521
These bills are put together
by legal minds after long study.

488
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:01,204
I can't understand half of them
and I used to be a lawyer.

489
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:05,078
Forget it.
I'll advise you how to vote.

490
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,242
I know you will, that's just the point.
There's no reason for me to be here.

491
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:15,325
Didn't you talk about a boys camp?
You were earnest about that.

492
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:18,128
- Yes.
- Why don't you do it?

493
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,201
Get a bill started.
Present it to Congress.

494
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:23,485
It'll be great experience for you.

495
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:26,163
I've been aching to mention it to you.

496
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:29,799
If I could just do that one thing...
I'd feel...

497
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:32,483
What's to stop you? Saunders'll help.

498
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:36,927
I will do it. I knew that
if anyone could help me, you could.

499
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:39,762
Thank you again for your time, sir.
Good night.

500
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:43,968
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm anxious to get back to the office.

501
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:51,804
- Oh, the man on the front page.
- He just dropped in for a minute.

502
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:55,200
How do you do, Miss Paine?
I'm on my way to the office.

503
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:58,566
- How are the pigeons?
- They're fine.

504
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:04,008
I released one this morning.
He flew straight up in the air -

505
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:09,289
- And went around the capitol dome
and then he headed west like a bat...

506
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:15,319
Just like a rifle shot. By this
time he's probably over Kentucky.

507
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:19,368
Isn't that wonderful, father?
And was the letter to your girl?

508
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:23,522
Oh, no...
I don't have a girl.

509
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:28,604
- I'd better hold this for you.
- No, I'd better go. Good night.

510
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,641
Doggone!...I'm sorry, sir.

511
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:37,198
That's all right.

512
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:48,767
- Gee, I'm sorry. Good night.
- Good night, Jeff.

513
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,917
Oh, father. Oh, dear me.

514
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:06,479
At the expense of the furniture,
you've made another conquest.

515
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:10,119
- Not old Honest Abe.
- And with Honest Abe's ideals.

516
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:13,486
A rare man these days, Susan.

517
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:20,039
We're going right ahead with
my bill for a national boys' camp.

518
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:24,248
- Where's my briefcase?
- You're going to present a bill?

519
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:28,118
- Yes, Senator Paine and I decided...
- Senator Paine decided this with you?

520
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,007
It was his idea.

521
00:45:30,169 --> 00:45:34,321
Dear Senator, have you got any idea
what it takes to get a bill passed?

522
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:38,038
- No. You're going to help me.
- If I were triplets I could.

523
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:42,088
Senator Paine said you'd help me.
Now, what books do we have to have?

524
00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:46,720
May I give you a rough idea of
what you're up against?

525
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:53,806
A senator has a bill in mind.
Now, what does he do?

526
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:58,247
He has to sit down and write it up.
Why, when, where, how?

527
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:02,084
- That takes time.
- But this one is so simple.

528
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:04,240
And with your help...

529
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,320
It's simple and I'm helping. -

530
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:09,606
- So we knock it off
in three or four days.

531
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,078
- A day.
- A day?!

532
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:14,922
Just tonight.

533
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:21,005
I don't want to complain, but there's
an institution called dinner.

534
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:23,524
I'm sort of hungry myself.

535
00:46:23,689 --> 00:46:28,319
Couldn't we have something brought in
on trays like big executives?

536
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:34,564
Sure. Dinner comes in on trays.
We're big executives.

537
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:37,084
We finish the bill before morning.

538
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:40,958
It's dawn. Your bill is ready.
You introduce it.

539
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:45,202
You get to your feet in the Senate,
take a long breath and start spouting.

540
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,964
Not too loud, a couple of the Senators
might want to sleep.

541
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:52,963
Then a pageboy takes it to the desk
where a long-faced clerk reads it. -

542
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:55,689
Refers it to the right committee.

543
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,840
Why?

544
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:04,005
Committees are small groups of senators
who sift a bill down and report back.

545
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:08,845
You can't take a bill nobody's heard of
and discuss it among 96 men.

546
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,523
- I see that.
- Good.

547
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:14,487
- Where are we?
- Some committee's got it.

548
00:47:14,649 --> 00:47:18,403
Days are going by, Senator.
Days, weeks.

549
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:22,960
Finally they think it's quite a bill. It
goes to the House of Representatives -

550
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,565
- For debate and a vote. But it has to
wait its turn on the calendar.

551
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:30,483
That's the order of business.
Your bill has to stand in line -

552
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:33,925
- Unless the steering committee
thinks it's important.

553
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:36,205
What's the steering committee?

554
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:41,166
- Do you think we're getting anywhere?
- Oh, yes, Miss Saunders.

555
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:44,685
- What's the steering committee?
- Committee of the majority leaders.

556
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:47,727
They decide if it's important
and should be moved up on the list.

557
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:50,847
- This is.
- Pardon me... this is.

558
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:54,604
- Where are we now?
- Over in the House.

559
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:58,478
More amendments
and the bill goes back to the Senate.

560
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:01,561
The Senate doesn't like
what the House did.

561
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:04,960
The House doesn't like
what the Senate did... stymied.

562
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:08,405
They appoint men from each House
to go into conference.

563
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:13,165
They battle it out.
Finally, if your bill is still alive. -

564
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:18,449
- It comes to a vote.
Yes, sir. The big day finally arrives -

565
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:21,487
And Congress adjourns.

566
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:26,884
Catching on, Senator?

567
00:48:29,049 --> 00:48:31,847
Shall we start right away
or order dinner first?

568
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,477
- Pardon me?
- I said, shall we start...

569
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:39,518
Sure. Why not? Do you mind if I take
the time to go and get a pencil?

570
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:42,362
- Go right ahead.
- Thank you very much.

571
00:48:42,529 --> 00:48:44,440
And lots of paper too.

572
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:50,008
Have you ever had so much to say
you just couldn't say it?

573
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:52,637
Try sitting down.

574
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:58,486
Let's get down to particulars. How big
is this thing? Where should it be?

575
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:02,483
- You have to have all that in it.
- Yes, and something else.

576
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:08,281
The spirit of it.
The idea... how do you say it?

577
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:14,764
That's what has got to be in it.
The capitol dome.

578
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:19,400
- On paper?
- It should come to life for every boy.

579
00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:22,686
All lighted up too.

580
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,966
Boys forget what their country means -

581
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,087
- By just reading "Land of the Free"
in history books.

582
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:32,002
Men forget even more.

583
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:36,242
Liberty is too precious a thing
to be buried in books.

584
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:40,846
Men should hold it up in front of them
every single day and say:

585
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:45,048
"I'm free... to think and to speak.

586
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:49,407
My ancestors couldn't. I can.
And my children will."

587
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:54,601
Boys ought to grow up remembering that.

588
00:49:54,769 --> 00:50:00,241
That steering committee have to see it
like that. I know Senator Paine'll help.

589
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:06,568
He's a wonderful man.
He knew my father very well.

590
00:50:06,729 --> 00:50:10,881
We need a lot more like him.
His kind of characters, his ideals.

591
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,722
Let's get on with this.

592
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:19,600
- This camp is gonna be in your state.
- About 200 of the most beautiful acres.

593
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:23,842
You've never been there, Miss Saunders?
I've been over every single foot.

594
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:29,322
You have to see it for yourself.
The prairies, wind leaning on the grass.

595
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:33,960
Lazy streams, angry little midges
of water up in the mountains...

596
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:40,762
Cattle moving down the slope against
the sun, campfires and snowdrifts...

597
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:47,119
Everybody ought to have some of that.
My dad had the right idea.

598
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:50,645
He had it all worked out. He said:

599
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:54,518
"Son, don't miss the wonders
that surround you.

600
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:58,443
Every tree, every rock,
every anthill, every star -

601
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:01,760
Is filled with the wonders of nature."

602
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:06,400
He said, "Have you ever noticed
how grateful you are to see daylight -

603
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:10,244
- After coming through
a long dark tunnel?"

604
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:16,564
"Well," he said, "always try to see life
as if you'd just come out of a tunnel."

605
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:24,600
- Where do you come from?
- I've always lived in a tunnel.

606
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:28,762
- You mean here?
- Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

607
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:32,842
- You've always had to work?
- Since I was about sixteen.

608
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,761
Your parents couldn't...?

609
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:38,888
No, father was a doctor. He thought
more about ethics than collections.

610
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:44,248
Speaks well for father, but it wasn't
so... We'd better get back to this.

611
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:47,287
- It hasn't been easy, has it?
- No complaints.

612
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:51,408
- For a woman you've done awfully well.
- Have I?

613
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:56,881
I've never known anyone
as capable and intelligent.

614
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:04,641
I don't know where I'd be with this bill
if it wasn't for your help.

615
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:10,918
- I don't know where you are with it...
- Oh, yes. Gee whiz, we gotta get going.

616
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,683
All right, now. Let's see.

617
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:19,405
Everybody calls you plain Saunders,
why can't I?

618
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:25,326
Saunders... Hello, Saunders.
Good morning, Saunders. Much better.

619
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:28,561
- How's the bill coming, Saunders?
- Terrible.

620
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:32,768
I've got that Saunders business
straightened out now.

621
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:37,083
- What's your first name?
- Why?

622
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:41,686
- Everybody just calls you Saunders.
- I also answer to whistles.

623
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:46,445
- You have a first name, haven't you?
- Yes, but we'd better forget about it.

624
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:50,845
Darn it... I was just curious.

625
00:52:51,009 --> 00:52:55,525
A picture popped into my mind
of a pump without a handle.

626
00:52:55,689 --> 00:53:00,604
- I know what it is... Violet.
- No, it isn't.

627
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:02,999
- Abigail?
- No.

628
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:05,444
Letitia? Lena?

629
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:08,681
- No, stop it.
- You might as well tell me.

630
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:11,807
All right. You win.
It's Clarissa.

631
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:20,159
All right, Saunders. Let's go.

632
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:27,520
- Susan's an awfully pretty name.
- Susan Paine? Oh, that's beautiful.

633
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:31,242
She's a beautiful woman.

634
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:36,608
She's probably the most beautiful girl
I've ever... No, Saunders.

635
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:41,763
We've got to get started on this. Get
set, I'll talk faster than you write.

636
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:43,965
Are you ready?

637
00:53:44,129 --> 00:53:48,839
The location of this camp. About 200
acres situated in Terry Canyon -

638
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:52,524
- Running on either side
of Willet Creek.

639
00:53:52,689 --> 00:53:56,523
- What?
- Willet Creek. Just a little stream.

640
00:53:56,689 --> 00:54:01,240
- In Terry Canyon?
- You don't know it, do you?

641
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:07,200
- You couldn't. You've never been there.
- You've discussed this with Paine?

642
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,280
No. Why?

643
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:13,078
Nothing. There's no reason
to talk it over with him.

644
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:17,208
"A quarter of a mile
on either side of Willet Creek..."

645
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:21,157
The land to be bought
by the contributions from the boys. -

646
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:25,288
- The money to be loaned
by the government of the United States.

647
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,921
- What did you get me out of bed for?
- The show is about to commence.

648
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:41,527
- Mind telling me what's going on?
- There's the principal actor.

649
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:44,157
Don Quixote Smith. Man with a bill.

650
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:49,164
Over here, one of the supporting actors.
That gorilla in man's clothing, McGann.

651
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:53,641
- You mean puss in boots?
- Yes, mostly puss.

652
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:57,119
Another prominent character.
The Silver Knight.

653
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:01,805
- Soul of honour on a tight rope.
- You wouldn't be a little bit goofy?

654
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:06,360
Don Quixote with bill will speak
two important words: Willet Creek.

655
00:55:06,529 --> 00:55:11,319
The knight will fall off his tightrope;
Puss will jump out of his boots.

656
00:55:15,129 --> 00:55:18,485
Introduction of new bills
and joint resolutions.

657
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,446
Mr President!

658
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:34,324
The chair recognises the...
rather strong-lunged junior Senator.

659
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:36,844
Mr Smith.

660
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:40,638
- I'm sorry, I have a bill...
- Speak a little louder, Senator.

661
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:43,039
But not too loud.

662
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:48,721
I have a bill to propose, sir.

663
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:58,125
Order, gentlemen. Ourjunior senator
is about to make a speech.

664
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,724
You may proceed, Senator.

665
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:14,165
Be it enacted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives -

666
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:19,367
- That there be appropriated
as a loan a sum sufficient -

667
00:56:19,529 --> 00:56:22,839
- To create a national boys' camp
to be paid back -

668
00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:27,525
- To the United States Treasury
by contributions from boys of America.

669
00:56:27,689 --> 00:56:33,798
This camp, to be situated on the land
at and adjacent to the stream -

670
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:37,484
- Known as Willet Creek
in Terry Canyon -

671
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:43,522
- For the purpose of bringing
together boys of all walks of life. -

672
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:47,079
From various parts of the country.

673
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:51,322
Boys of all creeds,
kinds and positions -

674
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:56,165
- To educate them in American ideals
and to promote mutual understanding -

675
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:01,687
- And to bring about a healthful life
to the youth of this beautiful land.

676
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:47,683
The Senator'll make a good orator
when his voice stops changing.

677
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:53,127
I'm getting leery of this guy.
He keeps winding up in our hair.

678
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:56,645
When he finds out our dam
is at his boys camp -

679
00:57:56,809 --> 00:57:59,448
He'll start asking questions.

680
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:04,763
Quiet. I have to think. This deficiency
bill will be read tomorrow.

681
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:09,207
He'll hear that section on
the Willet dam. He can't be there!

682
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:13,521
I'm taking him out to see monuments.
Might hit him on the head with one.

683
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:17,159
It won't work.
This boy's honest, not stupid.

684
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:18,921
Susan.

685
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:22,604
My daughter doesn't carry out
assignments like that.

686
00:58:39,969 --> 00:58:43,484
Senator Smith,
if you'll let me handle publicity...

687
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:47,077
Sit down, everybody.

688
00:58:52,489 --> 00:58:57,643
- Who are all those people?
- Washington plagues, office seekers...

689
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:02,200
Now, this machine creates a fever
ten miles away, it'll make your fortune.

690
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:04,405
Long distance fevers...

691
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:08,608
A woman out there has composed a song
to replace "The Star-spangled Banner".

692
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:12,478
I feel like a house on fire.
Even went down to see Mr Lincoln again.

693
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:16,403
How did I do?
My heart was right up to here.

694
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:21,120
- What do you think Paine thought?
- He must have been tickled pink.

695
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:24,565
- What's all this?
- Contributions from boys.

696
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:26,640
Already?

697
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:30,927
Those are local. Wait till they start
pouring in from all over the country.

698
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:34,764
We'd better open one up.
What does it say here?

699
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:37,799
Look, money!

700
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:42,679
"Dear Senator Smith.
I would like to come to your camp.

701
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:46,319
I shine shoes at the station
and here's nine cents."

702
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:49,799
Isn't that wonderful?
And he signs it:

703
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:53,518
"Yours truly, Stinky Moore".
Isn't it marvellous?

704
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:57,125
If there's money in each one...
What are we going to do with it?

705
00:59:57,289 --> 01:00:00,361
- Here you are.
- That's perfect.

706
01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:03,362
You see how important
this bill's going to be?

707
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:07,044
- Do I have any paper around here?
- Second drawer.

708
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:10,565
- I'll be pretty busy tonight.
- Not another bill?

709
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:15,359
No, letters. I'm busting with news!
I introduced a bill!

710
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:19,283
- I got up and spoke in the Senate!
- You want to dictate them?

711
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,806
No, I couldn't talk letters, I have to
sit here and scratch them down.

712
01:00:24,969 --> 01:00:27,642
I'm going to tell Ma all about you.

713
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:32,439
If I tell it right, you'll get the best
jar of preserves you ever tasted.

714
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:35,726
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, and Saunders...

715
01:00:37,049 --> 01:00:41,201
- Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.
- Don't mention it.

716
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:46,124
No, no, without you I couldn't have...
I mean...

717
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:54,597
- Who?
- Susan Paine.

718
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:57,522
How do you do?
I can talk. Go right ahead.

719
01:00:57,689 --> 01:01:03,719
Sorry to bother you, but I'm elected to
snatch Smith from the Senate tomorrow.

720
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:13,719
I'm to take him out
and turn my glamour on for him.

721
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:19,202
Take him out and buy some clothes
and a hat that he can hang on to.

722
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:22,327
A manicure and a haircut
wouldn't do any harm.

723
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:25,925
I hate to ask you to do this,
but...

724
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:29,240
- As one woman to another, of course.
- Thanks, Saunders.

725
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:35,359
- Just a minute. Miss Paine.
- Susan Paine?

726
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,402
- She wants to talk to me?
- Yes.

727
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:45,246
Holy mackerel.

728
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:50,201
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?

729
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:53,803
Yes... Fine.

730
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:57,921
What?

731
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:03,359
Would escort you?

732
01:02:06,049 --> 01:02:10,998
Yes, I'd be... delighted.
Yes, all right.

733
01:02:12,249 --> 01:02:15,127
Reception for a princess.
She wants me to...

734
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:17,359
Goodbye, Miss Paine.

735
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:23,048
She wants me to go to a reception
for a princess. Imagine her asking me!

736
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:27,168
Get your hat, Senator.
We have a lot of shopping to do.

737
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:32,927
- Where are your bitters?
- Behind the sink.

738
01:02:33,089 --> 01:02:36,126
I don't mind who gets licked
in a fair fight.

739
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:43,642
It's the clouts below the belt I can't
take. Sicking that horrible dame on him.

740
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:47,040
- When he's goofy about her.
- What dame?

741
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:49,279
Paine.

742
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:55,007
Be nice to that girl. Her old man is
the party choice for the White House.

743
01:02:55,169 --> 01:02:57,637
She may be the next first lady.

744
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:02,121
Imagine reading "My Day"
by Susan Paine-in-the-Neck.

745
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:07,488
As if he isn't going to be hurt enough,
she has to twist a knife in him too.

746
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:11,483
- "I'll turn my glamour on him."
- What's it to you?

747
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:14,846
- Nothing.
- Then stop worrying.

748
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:17,967
The dopes are going to
inherit the earth anyway.

749
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:22,407
Maybe this Don Quixote has got
the jump on all of us.

750
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:26,164
I wonder if it isn't a curse
to be wised up like you and me.

751
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:30,402
If you're going to wonder,
let's go and do it over a steak.

752
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:35,359
Snap out of it. Drink up.
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

753
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:38,439
And to Don Quixote.

754
01:03:39,689 --> 01:03:42,920
- Do you know how I felt?
- How did you feel? Quick!

755
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:49,642
I felt just like a mother sending the
kid off to school for the first time.

756
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:55,247
Watching her little fellow toddling off
in his best bib and tucker.

757
01:03:55,409 --> 01:03:59,322
Hoping he can stand up
to the other kids.

758
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:06,283
Say, who started this?

759
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:11,805
- I'm just waiting for a streetcar.
- Cut it out.

760
01:04:13,769 --> 01:04:17,682
- Who cares anyway?
- I apologise.

761
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:22,365
All right, then.
After all, what's it to me?

762
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:26,886
They drop him out of a balloon.
I just don't want to be around.

763
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:29,802
I'm squeamish.
That's what I am.

764
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:37,241
I won't be party to no murder.
I quit. I'm through!

765
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:40,685
Again? It's a good idea.

766
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:52,249
- Diz...
- Yes.

767
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:57,324
- Let's get married.
- It's a good idea. When?

768
01:04:57,489 --> 01:05:00,799
- Any time.
- Tonight?

769
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:05,679
- Okay, you don't mind?
- I'd cherish you.

770
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,881
- You're a good egg, Diz.
- I know.

771
01:05:11,049 --> 01:05:15,918
Maybe we could clear out of this town.
Get to feel like people.

772
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:21,528
- Live like we just got out of a tunnel.
- A tunnel?

773
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:30,241
You've never seen prairie grass
with the wind leaning on it, have you?

774
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:33,207
Does the wind get tired out there?

775
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:41,564
Or angry little mountain streams,
or the sun moving against the cattle.

776
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:47,678
- You've never seen anything like that?
- Have you?

777
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,999
No.

778
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:54,963
Do we have to?

779
01:05:55,929 --> 01:06:00,207
- I can't think of anything more sappy.
- Okay, then let's get going.

780
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:03,805
- Where?
- We're getting married.

781
01:06:03,969 --> 01:06:06,164
Yes, that's right.

782
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:12,006
In case you don't know, you get the
chance to back out if you don't like it.

783
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:15,366
- My first name is Clarissa.
- I know, it's okay.

784
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:21,718
- Don't say "okay", say it's beautiful.
- Okay. I mean...

785
01:06:21,889 --> 01:06:25,484
You don't know any name
offhand you like better?

786
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:29,927
- No, not offhand.
- Nothing like Susan or any of that?

787
01:06:30,089 --> 01:06:32,762
Susan? Nah!

788
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:36,968
I won't take it!
I won't be party to murder!

789
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:41,680
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys
for that grafting Taylor mob is enough.

790
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:44,841
But helping that dame
cut him in little pieces...

791
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:48,524
- Nobody's gonna make me do that!
- You said it.

792
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:53,160
I want to get out of there right now.
Bonus or no bonus.

793
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:57,288
I'm clearing out of that office
everything I own.

794
01:06:57,449 --> 01:07:01,203
Hey, wait a minute!
We're getting married!

795
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:03,806
See you later.

796
01:07:18,649 --> 01:07:21,800
- What do you want?
- Boy, you should have been there.

797
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:27,168
It was a wonderful party. Your suit
went over big, she looked beautiful.

798
01:07:27,329 --> 01:07:30,765
When you left, she said,
"Thank you, Mr Smith."

799
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:35,081
But it was the way she said it.
You nearly fell through the floor.

800
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:37,285
Horseradish!

801
01:07:45,049 --> 01:07:48,280
What are you looking at?
Did you think I was a lady?

802
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:52,840
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.
Even I can't take this. I quit!

803
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:57,400
There are a lot of things I can't take.
Can't take a simple...

804
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:05,521
Why don't you go home?
Tell your little streams about the camp.

805
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:08,965
This is no place for you.
You're halfway decent.

806
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:12,724
Go home!
That's all I want to tell you.

807
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,608
Meet the man I'm going to marry.

808
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:20,764
That's me.

809
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:24,799
Say something.
Don't just stand there like a...

810
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:29,605
Wait a minute.
Why don't I do this right?

811
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,640
You want to be a senator
and build a camp on Willet Creek.

812
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,563
See this? Deficiency bill.
Section number 40.

813
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:40,402
A dam where you think
your camp's going to be.

814
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:44,562
Ever hear of it? No. They read
all about it in the Senate today. -

815
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:48,642
- But you weren't suppose to hear.
That's why that dame took you in tow.

816
01:08:48,809 --> 01:08:53,007
That's why they sent you here.
You don't know a dam from a bathtub.

817
01:08:53,169 --> 01:08:57,481
Go ahead, be a senator.
Mess up Mr Taylor's little graft.

818
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:02,279
But if you can't...
and you can't in nine million years. -

819
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:07,760
- Go home! Don't stay around here
making people feel sorry for you.

820
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,566
Come on, Diz.

821
01:09:15,169 --> 01:09:17,125
Hey, this way!

822
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:23,760
Come on, kid. We'll dig up a preacher.

823
01:09:25,089 --> 01:09:29,241
- We're gonna get married.
- Oh, yeah.

824
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:37,318
Okay. Come on, I'll take you home.

825
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:49,722
There are a hundred other places
that really need the water!

826
01:09:49,889 --> 01:09:54,041
I talked to the owner of the land.
He didn't say anything about a dam.

827
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,643
Doggone, I know there's something wrong!

828
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:59,846
I won't vote on it
until I get my questions answered.

829
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:02,045
You're fighting windmills.

830
01:10:02,209 --> 01:10:06,964
You try to understand a project it took
two years to set up. The benefits.

831
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:10,201
- The benefits... Who's Taylor?
- What?

832
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:13,839
- What's he got to do with this thing?
- Why should he be involved?

833
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:18,082
I've been told the whole thing
is his idea to get graft.

834
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:25,928
Are you accusing me of helping to
frame a bill for the benefit of one man?

835
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:29,240
To put through a scheme for graft?

836
01:10:29,409 --> 01:10:33,687
Long distance?
Get me Mr James Taylor, Jackson City.

837
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:38,240
Boy ranger, answer to our prayer.
Didn't even know the time of day, huh?

838
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:40,240
Exactly what has he done?

839
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:44,368
He's about to blow the whole machine
to smithereens and you with it!

840
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:46,918
- How?
- You wouldn't understand that.

841
01:10:47,089 --> 01:10:50,479
In about half an hour
I'll be on my way to Washington. -

842
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:55,086
- And I'm all ready for that boy ranger.
Never mind how.

843
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:59,925
You take your instructions from Allen.
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp!

844
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,842
Use your high office
to help Allen get things done.

845
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,000
- Understand?
- Yes, Jim.

846
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:06,682
I doubt it.

847
01:11:07,169 --> 01:11:11,048
I haven't been able to
show him a single monument!

848
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:14,360
He's been on our tail.
You've got to keep him off us.

849
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:18,363
Since he found out we're behind it,
he's been running us ragged.

850
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:21,919
I told you I'd handle him.
I object to you coming here.

851
01:11:22,089 --> 01:11:26,241
You proved how you can handle him.
You started him writing bills.

852
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:30,479
- That's him. Let him in.
- You didn't ask Smith here?

853
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:34,244
- What do you think?
- Don't open that door, Chick.

854
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:37,924
- You can't do this.
- Let him in, Chick.

855
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:41,240
All right, Jim. Count me out.

856
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:47,607
Good morning, Senator. Come right in.

857
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:55,169
What did you mean "count me out"?

858
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:59,766
You can't pull that steamroller stuff.
Your methods won't do here.

859
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:04,127
However it happened, this boy's
a Senator. This is Washington, Jim!

860
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:09,409
My steamroller methods don't go here?
They've done pretty well by you.

861
01:12:09,569 --> 01:12:12,527
This boy is different.
He's honest.

862
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:15,965
He thinks the world of me.
We can't do this to him!

863
01:12:16,129 --> 01:12:19,519
Should I just stand around
and let that drooling infant -

864
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:23,204
- Wrap that Willet Creek dam
appropriation around my neck?

865
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:25,678
Not me.

866
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:31,640
Either he falls in line or I'll break
him so open they won't find the pieces.

867
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:36,166
- Jim, I won't stand for it.
- You won't stand for it?

868
01:12:36,329 --> 01:12:41,278
I don't want any part of
crucifying this boy.

869
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:47,797
Our steamroller methods are getting
too hard for your sensitive soul?

870
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:51,564
The Silver Knight
is getting too big for us.

871
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:55,647
My methods have been all right
for the past twenty years.

872
01:12:55,809 --> 01:12:58,369
Since I picked you out
of a hole in the wall -

873
01:12:58,529 --> 01:13:02,647
- And blew you up to look like
a senator. And now you can't stand it.

874
01:13:02,809 --> 01:13:08,281
Maybe you don't have to. You and
the boy ranger can go home together.

875
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:12,124
- Jim, you don't have to...
- It's all right.

876
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:16,760
Seems a shame to part company
after all these years.

877
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:21,366
Especially now
with a national convention coming up.

878
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:27,398
I put everything I have behind you
and so did all of our friends.

879
01:13:28,889 --> 01:13:33,883
We'll survive. We just have to find
someone else with more sense.

880
01:13:34,049 --> 01:13:38,440
You go in and explain to Mr Smith
about Willet dam.

881
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:41,328
It's your bill. It's your reputation.

882
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:46,768
If he can't find enough facts to
break you with, I'll give him a couple.

883
01:13:46,929 --> 01:13:50,842
I'm taking the next plane home.
So long.

884
01:13:58,089 --> 01:14:00,284
Come here, will you.

885
01:14:08,089 --> 01:14:13,288
It's just that I like the kid. I don't
want to see you get rough on him.

886
01:14:14,809 --> 01:14:19,678
I'm glad to see you come to your senses.
You had me scared for a minute.

887
01:14:19,849 --> 01:14:23,922
You go back to your office.
I'll call when I'm through with Smith.

888
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:38,122
The Silver Knight!

889
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:48,357
Senator, I was just passing through
I thought I'd like to meet you.

890
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:50,804
You've met all the boys, I suppose?

891
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:55,485
They tell me you've been on your toes
since you got here.

892
01:14:55,649 --> 01:15:00,598
Some people told me you were dumb.
I think you're smart.

893
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:05,479
Smart enough to understand a situation
when it's explained to you.

894
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:09,198
For instance,
building a dam on Willet Creek.

895
01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:12,520
What's your interest in this?

896
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:17,968
Anything that benefits the state
is mighty important to me.

897
01:15:18,129 --> 01:15:21,439
Owning a lot of its industry
and newspapers.

898
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:25,318
If you had the welfare of the state
at heart, like I have. -

899
01:15:25,489 --> 01:15:28,401
I'd say you were a man to watch.

900
01:15:29,209 --> 01:15:31,803
What do you like? Business?

901
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:36,008
If you like business, you can pick
any job and go right to the top.

902
01:15:36,169 --> 01:15:39,320
Or politics.
If you like being a senator. -

903
01:15:39,489 --> 01:15:43,767
- You can come back to the Senate
and stay there as long as you want to.

904
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:48,081
If you're smart.
Take the boys here or Joe Paine.

905
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:53,642
They're doing all right.
They don't worry about being re-elected.

906
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:57,484
They're smart.
They take my advice.

907
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:01,039
You tell these men and
Senator Paine what to do?

908
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:06,158
Joe Paine has been taking my advice
for the past twenty years.

909
01:16:07,969 --> 01:16:10,767
You're a liar.

910
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:21,959
- I have to see Senator Paine.
- Senator Paine is out of town.

911
01:16:22,129 --> 01:16:24,245
He couldn't be.

912
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:32,359
Hello, Jeff. Come in.
Did you have a talk with Taylor?

913
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:37,284
He said he'd told you what to do
for twenty years. I called him a liar.

914
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:42,482
- Come over here and sit down, son.
- I don't feel like sitting down.

915
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:47,484
I know how you feel.
I was hoping you'd be spared all this.

916
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:53,882
That you'd see the sights, absorb a lot
of history and go back to your boys.

917
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:57,678
You've been living in a boy's world.
For heaven's sake, stay there!

918
01:16:57,849 --> 01:17:01,125
This is a man's world, a brutal world.
You have no place in it.

919
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:06,317
You'll only get hurt. Forget Taylor
and what he said about the dam.

920
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:12,200
But you still haven't answered me.
Can Taylor tell you what to do?

921
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:18,807
Now... listen, please.
And try to understand.

922
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:21,199
It's tough to run head-on into facts. -

923
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:26,602
- But you must check your ideals outside
the door like you do your rubbers.

924
01:17:28,289 --> 01:17:33,602
Thirty years ago, I had your ideals.
I was you.

925
01:17:33,769 --> 01:17:37,682
I had to make the same decision
you were asked to make today.

926
01:17:37,849 --> 01:17:41,364
I made it. I compromised.

927
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:47,206
So that I could sit in that Senate
and serve the people in an honest way.

928
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:51,840
You've gotta face facts.
I've served our state well, haven't I?

929
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:56,002
We have the lowest unemployment
and the highest federal grants, but -

930
01:17:56,169 --> 01:18:00,640
- I've had to compromise.
You can't count on people voting.

931
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,879
Half the time they don't vote.

932
01:18:03,049 --> 01:18:06,837
That's how states and empires
have been built since time began.

933
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:15,844
You can take my word for it.
That's how things are.

934
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:23,605
I've told you all this because...
I've grown very fond of you.

935
01:18:23,769 --> 01:18:29,719
About like a son, in fact.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

936
01:18:31,889 --> 01:18:36,007
When that deficiency bill
comes up tomorrow, don't say a word.

937
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:39,445
There are great powers behind it.
They'll destroy you.

938
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:44,319
For your own sake, and for the sake
of my friendship with your father. -

939
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:48,164
Please... don't say a word.

940
01:18:55,569 --> 01:19:00,245
Owing to the urgency of the deficiency
bill, there's a unanimous agreement -

941
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:05,278
- That no senator will speak for more
than five minutes on any section.

942
01:19:06,249 --> 01:19:08,285
The clerk will read.

943
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:12,124
The bill providing for deficiency
appropriations for the fiscal year.

944
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:16,077
Section one: Emergency relief.
To create public improvements -

945
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:19,559
- On rivers, harbours and roadways.
150 billion dollars.

946
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:23,039
Section 40: An appropriation for
diverting and impounding -

947
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:27,122
- The headwaters of Willet Creek
in Terry Canyon. 5 million dollars.

948
01:19:27,289 --> 01:19:28,722
Mr President.

949
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:32,245
Senator Smith desires to be heard
on Section 40?

950
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:36,288
Does the Senator understand
he's limited to five minutes?

951
01:19:36,449 --> 01:19:39,168
You may proceed, sir.

952
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:44,323
Mr President, this section on the dam
on Willet Creek is nothing but...

953
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:48,562
Does Senator Smith wish to
yield to his colleague Senator Paine?

954
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:51,527
- Yes, sir.
- You may proceed, Senator.

955
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:54,761
I have risen to a difficult task.

956
01:19:54,929 --> 01:19:57,568
Evidence has come to our attention -

957
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:01,927
- That Senator Smith is unworthy
to address this body.

958
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:05,399
Get the senators.

959
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:10,049
Something's going on inside. Come on.

960
01:20:13,369 --> 01:20:17,203
The Senator will please suspend
until order is restored in the chamber.

961
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:19,837
All the senators
are wanted on the floor.

962
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:26,600
What's going on, Joe?

963
01:20:37,889 --> 01:20:39,686
You may proceed, Senator.

964
01:20:39,849 --> 01:20:44,161
I refer to the bill he has introduced
for the creation of a boys' camp.

965
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:47,560
He named a certain portion of land -

966
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:51,927
- To be bought by contributions
from boys all over America.

967
01:20:52,089 --> 01:20:58,562
Senators, I have evidence that he owns
the very land described in his bill.

968
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:06,605
He bought it the day following
his appointment to the Senate -

969
01:21:06,769 --> 01:21:10,523
- And is using his privileged office
for his own personal profit!

970
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:19,846
- Boy ranger had a racket.
- This doesn't make sense.

971
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:25,767
Accordingly, I offer a resolution
for an immediate inquiry -

972
01:21:25,929 --> 01:21:31,526
- As to the fitness of my colleague
to continue to sit in this chamber.

973
01:21:32,529 --> 01:21:34,565
Mr President, I...

974
01:21:38,249 --> 01:21:42,845
Order... The chair will clear the
galleries unless order is restored.

975
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:49,888
Ranger Senator branded
by colleague Senator Paine!

976
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:52,643
Senator Paine to expel Senator Smith.

977
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:54,800
Saunders must have the low-down on this.

978
01:21:54,969 --> 01:21:57,358
She packed up and left town.

979
01:21:57,529 --> 01:22:02,603
Paine accuses Smith of introducing
a boys camp bill for his own profit!

980
01:22:02,769 --> 01:22:08,719
Paine's asked for a hearing before the
Committee of Privileges and Elections.

981
01:22:08,889 --> 01:22:10,720
Frankly, my dear Senators. -

982
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:13,881
- When Mr Kenneth Allen
burst into my office -

983
01:22:14,049 --> 01:22:19,043
- And proved that Jeff Smith had
a deed to that site, I was dumbfounded.

984
01:22:19,209 --> 01:22:22,804
What did you do
when it was brought to your attention?

985
01:22:22,969 --> 01:22:27,201
I consulted with the head of the
Department of Records, Mr Arthur Kim.

986
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:30,486
Mr Kim,
do you remember recording such a deed?

987
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:35,882
Yes. On the date set forth here,
Mr Allen came to record this deed. -

988
01:22:36,049 --> 01:22:39,405
- Setting over these 200 acres
in the name of Jefferson Smith.

989
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:44,518
- How long have you known Senator Smith?
- A good many years.

990
01:22:44,689 --> 01:22:48,762
He used my land up around Willet Creek
for his boy rangers.

991
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:50,920
Seemed like a nice fellow.

992
01:22:51,089 --> 01:22:55,480
One day he said he had a great chance
to sell that land for 500 an acre.

993
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:59,005
I'd be glad to get 25 for it.
So we set it up like this:

994
01:22:59,169 --> 01:23:03,367
I deeded him the land and
he guaranteed me half of what he got -

995
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:08,364
- If he made the sale. The whole thing
sounded fishy at the time.

996
01:23:08,529 --> 01:23:11,839
Have you got that document?

997
01:23:12,009 --> 01:23:16,525
The land wouldn't be in his name if I
didn't. Yes, sir, signed and delivered.

998
01:23:16,689 --> 01:23:21,399
- I never signed any contract!
- He certainly did.

999
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:29,161
After a long study of this signature,
it is my professional opinion -

1000
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:33,083
- That it is definitely
in Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.

1001
01:23:33,249 --> 01:23:36,639
As an expert on handwriting,
I'd say the name Jefferson Smith -

1002
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:39,277
- On this contract...
has been forged.

1003
01:23:39,449 --> 01:23:43,237
I would stake my whole
twenty year professional career -

1004
01:23:43,409 --> 01:23:46,481
- On the fact that
this is not a forgery. -

1005
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:50,244
But is Mr Smith's own signature.

1006
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:54,687
This is a very painful duty for me.
This boy is the son of my best friend.

1007
01:23:54,849 --> 01:23:57,761
I sponsored him in the Senate.
I helped him frame his bill.

1008
01:23:57,929 --> 01:24:00,648
On the day he presented it,
I congratulated him.

1009
01:24:00,809 --> 01:24:05,564
But I pointed out that a dam was
going up on the very site he had chosen.

1010
01:24:05,729 --> 01:24:10,325
There are a hundred good campsites.
I suggested he choose another.

1011
01:24:10,489 --> 01:24:13,686
He became furious and said,
"Move the dam!"

1012
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:16,522
I was amazed at his violent reaction -

1013
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:20,807
- Until the evidence came to me
that he owned those very 200 acres.

1014
01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:26,999
He'd laid plans to make an enormous
profit out of the nickels and dimes -

1015
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:30,286
- Scraped together by the boys
of this country.

1016
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:35,318
Faced with that... regardless of
my personal feelings for the boy. -

1017
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:39,004
- My sense of duty told me
that his expulsion from the Senate -

1018
01:24:39,169 --> 01:24:40,966
Was the only possible answer.

1019
01:24:41,129 --> 01:24:43,165
Beautiful, that Taylor machine...

1020
01:24:47,329 --> 01:24:49,285
Senator Smith, please.

1021
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:55,761
Will you take the chair, please?

1022
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:08,879
The committee is ready to hear you now,
Senator Smith.

1023
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:20,198
Keep your seats, gentlemen.
The committee is not adjourned yet!

1024
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:22,087
Quiet, please!

1025
01:25:25,369 --> 01:25:29,362
That ranger never knew what struck him
when Jim Taylor opened up on him.

1026
01:25:29,529 --> 01:25:31,804
Which one of you girls wants this?

1027
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:37,199
- Do you want it?
- Oh, yes!

1028
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:10,440
Hello.

1029
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:15,518
- Hello, Saunders.
- I had a hunch I'd find you here.

1030
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,998
When you weren't any place else.

1031
01:27:21,049 --> 01:27:24,485
- How have you been, Saunders?
- All right.

1032
01:27:24,649 --> 01:27:29,769
- How is your husband?
- What? Oh, old Diz? We're not married.

1033
01:27:34,489 --> 01:27:38,641
It's a good thing I got back now.
You know what I found waiting for me?

1034
01:27:38,809 --> 01:27:42,882
- A jar of preserves from your mother.
- You did, huh?

1035
01:27:44,249 --> 01:27:48,401
Was it strawberry?
It's the best kind.

1036
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:54,041
Well, I... see by the papers
you certainly got to be a Senator.

1037
01:27:55,249 --> 01:27:59,447
You had the right idea about me
when you told me to go back home -

1038
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:02,077
And fill those kids full of hooey.

1039
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:06,289
Just a simple guy,
still wet behind the ears.

1040
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:12,445
Full of a lot ofjunk about American
ideals. A lot of junk all right...

1041
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:17,603
- Now look, Senator...
- This is a whole new world to me.

1042
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:22,769
What are you going to believe in?

1043
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:26,239
When a man like Senator Joseph Paine
gets up and swears -

1044
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:30,038
- That I've been robbing kids
of nickels and dimes.

1045
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:33,804
A man I've admired and worshipped
all my life.

1046
01:28:33,969 --> 01:28:37,325
There are a lot of fancy words here.

1047
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:41,721
Some of them are carved in stone, some
of them men like Taylor put up there. -

1048
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:44,608
So suckers like me could read them.

1049
01:28:44,769 --> 01:28:48,079
Then you find out
what those men actually do.

1050
01:28:48,249 --> 01:28:50,683
I'm getting out of this town so fast.

1051
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:54,637
Away from all the words, the monuments,
the whole rotten show.

1052
01:28:54,809 --> 01:28:57,039
I see.

1053
01:28:57,209 --> 01:29:02,237
- What will you tell the kids back home?
- The truth.

1054
01:29:02,409 --> 01:29:06,641
They might as well
find out now as later.

1055
01:29:06,809 --> 01:29:09,004
I don't think they'll believe you.

1056
01:29:09,169 --> 01:29:12,400
They're liable to look at you
with hurt faces and say:

1057
01:29:12,569 --> 01:29:16,926
"Jeff, what did you do? Quit?
Didn't you do something about it?"

1058
01:29:17,089 --> 01:29:19,967
What do you expect me to do?

1059
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:23,883
An honorary stooge like me
against the Taylors and Paines. -

1060
01:29:24,049 --> 01:29:26,244
The machines and the lies.

1061
01:29:26,409 --> 01:29:29,287
Your friend Mr Lincoln
had his Taylors and Paines.

1062
01:29:29,449 --> 01:29:33,158
So did every man who ever tried
to lift his thought up off the ground.

1063
01:29:33,329 --> 01:29:36,719
Odds against them didn't stop them,
they were fools that way.

1064
01:29:36,889 --> 01:29:41,280
All the good in this world
came from fools with faith like that.

1065
01:29:41,449 --> 01:29:45,328
You can't quit now. Not you.

1066
01:29:45,489 --> 01:29:50,768
They aren't all Taylors and Paines,
that kind just throw big shadows.

1067
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:56,481
You didn'tjust have faith in Paine or
any other man. It was bigger than that.

1068
01:29:56,649 --> 01:30:01,165
You had plain, decent,
everyday common rightness.

1069
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:04,002
This country could use some of that.

1070
01:30:04,169 --> 01:30:08,162
So could the whole cock-eyed world.
A lot of it.

1071
01:30:08,329 --> 01:30:12,527
Remember the first day you got here?
What you said about Mr Lincoln?

1072
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:15,761
You said he was sitting there
waiting for someone.

1073
01:30:15,929 --> 01:30:20,878
You were right. He was waiting for a man
who could see his job and sail into it.

1074
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:24,883
A man who could tear into the Taylors
and root them out into the open.

1075
01:30:25,049 --> 01:30:29,964
I think he was waiting for you, Jeff.
He knows you can do it, so do I.

1076
01:30:30,129 --> 01:30:32,199
Do what, Saunders?

1077
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:37,204
Say you won't quit and I'll tell you.
I've been thinking about it all day.

1078
01:30:37,369 --> 01:30:42,443
It's a forty foot dive into a tub
of water, but I think you can do it.

1079
01:30:49,209 --> 01:30:53,725
- Clarissa... where can we get a drink?
- Now you're talking.

1080
01:30:53,889 --> 01:30:56,164
Come on over to my place.

1081
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:12,924
Mr Dearborn?
Mr Durnell? Mr Dwight?

1082
01:31:13,089 --> 01:31:16,604
So they'll expel Smith today.
Where's the guillotine?

1083
01:31:16,769 --> 01:31:18,760
In fact, where's Smith?

1084
01:31:18,929 --> 01:31:22,558
Smith hasn't stopped running
since he left that committee room.

1085
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:24,924
- Mr Smith?
- Here!

1086
01:31:33,089 --> 01:31:38,322
- That guy's batty!
- The clerk will continue the roll-call.

1087
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:50,124
Is this one of your shenanigans?
What's the matter?

1088
01:31:50,289 --> 01:31:55,079
- Pray, Diz. If you know how.
- Did you bring that guy in here?

1089
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:57,319
Are you crazy?

1090
01:31:59,289 --> 01:32:02,167
90 senators
have answered to their names.

1091
01:32:02,329 --> 01:32:05,719
A quorum is present.
Proceeding now to the regular order.

1092
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:20,048
- Mr President.
- Senator McPherson.

1093
01:32:20,209 --> 01:32:23,918
I desire to call up the report of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections -

1094
01:32:24,089 --> 01:32:26,762
On the expulsion of Jefferson Smith.

1095
01:32:29,969 --> 01:32:31,960
The clerk will read the report.

1096
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:36,247
The Committee
on Privileges and Elections reports -

1097
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:40,527
- After hearing a number of witnesses,
thatjustice to the Senate requires -

1098
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:44,398
- That Jefferson Smith no longer
continue as a member of this body.

1099
01:32:44,569 --> 01:32:48,164
They therefore recommend
that the same do pass.

1100
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:53,084
Resolved, that Jefferson Smith be
expelled from his seat in the Senate.

1101
01:32:57,049 --> 01:33:01,918
Mr President... I move for the
immediate adoption of the resolution.

1102
01:33:02,089 --> 01:33:05,001
- Mr President!
- I have the floor!

1103
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:09,048
I'm about to ask for a roll-call
on the passage of the resolution.

1104
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:12,007
The Senator has nothing to say
at this time!

1105
01:33:13,529 --> 01:33:16,043
Senator Smith is still a member -

1106
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:19,963
- And as such has an equal claim
on the attention of this chair.

1107
01:33:20,129 --> 01:33:23,280
You were about to recognise me, sir.

1108
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:25,519
Let him speak!

1109
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:33,402
Before proceeding further,
I'll remind the visitors in the gallery -

1110
01:33:33,569 --> 01:33:37,608
- That they are here as our guests
and should conduct themselves as such.

1111
01:33:37,769 --> 01:33:42,684
Their sentiments will in no way affect
the judgement of this chair.

1112
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:50,924
The chair recognises -

1113
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:54,847
Senator Smith.

1114
01:33:57,089 --> 01:33:58,317
Here we go.

1115
01:33:58,489 --> 01:34:02,118
The gentlemen are in a hurry
to get me out of here.

1116
01:34:02,289 --> 01:34:06,123
The way the evidence is piled up
against me, I can't say I blame them.

1117
01:34:06,289 --> 01:34:08,200
I will go when they vote it that way.

1118
01:34:08,369 --> 01:34:11,998
But before that happens
I have a few things to say.

1119
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:17,118
I've tried to say them before,
and I'd like to get them said this time.

1120
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:20,008
I won't leave this body
until they're said.

1121
01:34:20,169 --> 01:34:24,287
- President, will the Senator yield?
- No, sir, I'm afraid not!

1122
01:34:25,929 --> 01:34:30,366
I yielded once before and was
practically never heard of again.

1123
01:34:32,769 --> 01:34:37,445
We might as well get together on
this yielding business right off the bat.

1124
01:34:39,889 --> 01:34:41,925
I had some good coaching last night -

1125
01:34:42,089 --> 01:34:45,843
- And if I yield only for a question
or a personal privilege -

1126
01:34:46,009 --> 01:34:48,921
I can hold this floor until doomsday!

1127
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:53,321
I've got a piece to speak and
blow hot or cold, I'm gonna speak it!

1128
01:34:53,489 --> 01:34:56,208
- Will the Senator yield?
- Yield how?

1129
01:34:56,369 --> 01:34:58,519
- Yield for a question?
- All right.

1130
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:02,045
I wish to ask
if this piece he intends to speak -

1131
01:35:02,209 --> 01:35:05,281
- Concerns Section 40,
that dam on Willet Creek?

1132
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:09,761
Every aspect of this matter
was dealt with in committee hearing.

1133
01:35:09,929 --> 01:35:13,604
I wish to ask my colleague if he has
one scrap of evidence to add now -

1134
01:35:13,769 --> 01:35:16,761
- To the defence
he could not give at that hearing?

1135
01:35:16,929 --> 01:35:20,717
- I have no defence against forgery!
- The committee ruled otherwise!

1136
01:35:20,889 --> 01:35:25,201
The gentleman stands guilty as charged.
I believe that no member -

1137
01:35:25,369 --> 01:35:28,679
- Cares to hear
what a man of his condemned character -

1138
01:35:28,849 --> 01:35:32,558
- Has to say about any section
before this House!

1139
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:38,644
I stand guilty as framed
because Section 40 is graft!

1140
01:35:38,809 --> 01:35:43,599
I was ready to tell you that a certain
man in my state, a Mr James Taylor. -

1141
01:35:43,769 --> 01:35:49,048
- Wanted this dam for his own profit.
A man who controls a political machine!

1142
01:35:49,209 --> 01:35:51,803
He controls everything else in my state!

1143
01:35:51,969 --> 01:35:54,802
He's powerful enough
to control congressmen.

1144
01:35:54,969 --> 01:35:57,244
I saw three of them in his room.

1145
01:35:57,409 --> 01:36:00,640
- Will the Senator yield?
- No, sir, I will not yield!

1146
01:36:03,249 --> 01:36:07,959
James Taylor offered me a seat in
this Senate for the next twenty years. -

1147
01:36:08,129 --> 01:36:11,758
- If I voted for a dam
that he knew, and I knew, was a fraud.

1148
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:16,081
If I dared to speak against that dam,
he promised to break me in two.

1149
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:21,198
I got up and started to speak
and the long powerful arm of Taylor -

1150
01:36:21,369 --> 01:36:25,442
- Reached into this sacred chamber
and grabbed me by the neck.

1151
01:36:25,609 --> 01:36:27,600
- Mr President, a point of order.
- Mr President...

1152
01:36:27,769 --> 01:36:31,642
- Senator Paine will state it.
- I rose in this chamber to accuse him.

1153
01:36:31,809 --> 01:36:34,926
He's saying
I carried out criminal orders!

1154
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:39,162
He accuses me of unworthy conduct!
He should be made to yield the floor.

1155
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:42,241
I did not say that Senator Paine was
one of the Congressmen in that room!

1156
01:36:42,409 --> 01:36:44,525
I was in that room!

1157
01:36:48,529 --> 01:36:52,283
I accuse this man.
By his tone, by his careful denials. -

1158
01:36:52,449 --> 01:36:55,919
- He has been trying to plant
damaging impression of my conduct.

1159
01:36:56,089 --> 01:37:00,844
I'll tell you why we were in that room.
Mr Taylor, a respected citizen. -

1160
01:37:01,009 --> 01:37:05,241
- Had brought the evidence against
this man and we urged him to resign.

1161
01:37:05,409 --> 01:37:09,288
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace upon
a clean and honourable state.

1162
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:11,724
- But he refused.
- Mr President, have I...

1163
01:37:11,889 --> 01:37:15,245
There was only one answer
to a man like him. The truth.

1164
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:17,718
Which I rose and gave to this body.

1165
01:37:17,889 --> 01:37:22,280
He is trying to blackmail this Senate
as he tried to blackmail me.

1166
01:37:22,449 --> 01:37:25,919
To prevent his expulsion,
he'll hold up this deficiency bill. -

1167
01:37:26,089 --> 01:37:29,365
- Vital to this country,
which must be passed today!

1168
01:37:29,529 --> 01:37:33,442
- Have I the floor?
- I have lost all patience with him.

1169
01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:36,681
I apologise for his appointment.

1170
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:40,285
I am sick and tired of
this contemptible young man!

1171
01:37:40,449 --> 01:37:43,088
I refuse to stay here and listen to him!

1172
01:37:43,249 --> 01:37:46,400
I hope every member of this body
feels as I do.

1173
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:48,446
Yield the floor!

1174
01:37:50,769 --> 01:37:54,682
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please address the chair!

1175
01:37:54,849 --> 01:37:57,443
What does the gentleman want?

1176
01:37:57,609 --> 01:38:01,443
I want a chance to talk to people
who'll believe me.

1177
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:04,362
The people of my state
know me and Mr Taylor.

1178
01:38:04,529 --> 01:38:08,920
When they hear my story, they'll kick
Mr Taylor's machine to kingdom come.

1179
01:38:09,089 --> 01:38:11,319
I want one week to bring you proof -

1180
01:38:11,489 --> 01:38:16,688
- And your promise that I will not be
expelled and the bill won't be passed.

1181
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:18,919
- Will the Senator yield?
- For a question.

1182
01:38:19,089 --> 01:38:22,365
You have the effrontery
to stand there convicted -

1183
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:26,442
- And try to force postponement
of the deficiency bill?

1184
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:29,248
I appeal to the Senator.
Is he fully aware -

1185
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:33,368
- That this bill has been months
in both Houses, delayed and delayed?

1186
01:38:33,529 --> 01:38:39,047
- Many'll be without food and shelter.
- Shall we keep relief from the country?

1187
01:38:39,209 --> 01:38:42,997
The people of my state
need permanent relief from crooked men!

1188
01:38:43,169 --> 01:38:47,162
If we yield to blackmail from this man,
we'll become a laughing stock!

1189
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:51,322
It is an insult to this body
to have to listen to this.

1190
01:38:51,489 --> 01:38:55,482
I will follow the Senator's example
and refuse to remain in this chamber -

1191
01:38:55,649 --> 01:38:58,721
As long as that man holds the floor!

1192
01:39:08,049 --> 01:39:10,440
Order, gentlemen.

1193
01:39:10,609 --> 01:39:14,443
I guess I have to speak to the people
of my state from right here!

1194
01:39:16,129 --> 01:39:20,407
Wild horses won't drag me off this floor
till those people have heard me -

1195
01:39:20,569 --> 01:39:22,924
Even if it takes all winter.

1196
01:39:28,769 --> 01:39:30,885
Filibuster!

1197
01:39:44,129 --> 01:39:46,643
Well, Mr President, we seem to be alone.

1198
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:51,161
I'm not complaining
for social reasons. -

1199
01:39:51,329 --> 01:39:55,083
- But it's a pity if these gentlemen
missed any of this.

1200
01:40:00,409 --> 01:40:02,365
And...

1201
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:12,127
I call the chair's attention to -

1202
01:40:15,169 --> 01:40:19,924
- Rule 5 of the standing rules
of the Senate, Section 3.

1203
01:40:20,089 --> 01:40:22,808
"If it shall be found
that a quorum is not present. -

1204
01:40:22,969 --> 01:40:27,485
- A majority of the senators present...
and that looks like me. -

1205
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:34,283
- May direct the serjeant-at-arms
to request, and if necessary, compel -

1206
01:40:34,449 --> 01:40:37,407
- The attendance of
the absent senators."

1207
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:39,639
Mr President, I so direct.

1208
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:47,918
The absence of a quorum
being suggested.

1209
01:40:48,089 --> 01:40:50,398
Ring the call to quorum.

1210
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:55,678
There's no hurry, Mr President.
I've got plenty of time.

1211
01:40:57,689 --> 01:41:00,408
Quorum called! Quorum called!

1212
01:41:13,289 --> 01:41:15,120
The clerk will call the roll.

1213
01:41:15,289 --> 01:41:19,567
Mr Agnew? Mr Albert? Mr Alford?

1214
01:41:23,609 --> 01:41:26,407
Get this:
Smith got the floor and is holding it!

1215
01:41:26,569 --> 01:41:29,641
- Just as they were to kick him out!
- Isn't it wonderful?!

1216
01:41:29,809 --> 01:41:33,518
It's terrific! A filibuster!
This is the miracle I wanted.

1217
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:36,840
Get everything he's saying
back to that home state!

1218
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:42,003
They're going to hear this in Patagonia!
In protest the Senate walked out...

1219
01:41:42,169 --> 01:41:45,844
No, not that straight stuff!
Kick it up! Get on his side!

1220
01:41:46,009 --> 01:41:50,127
- You love this monkey, don't you?
- What do you think? Now go to work.

1221
01:41:50,289 --> 01:41:54,885
It's the most titanic battle of modern
times! A David without a slingshot -

1222
01:41:55,049 --> 01:41:58,598
- Rises to battle the mighty Goliath,
the Taylor machine. -

1223
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:03,638
- Allegedly crooked inside and out!...
For my money, cut out "allegedly".

1224
01:42:03,809 --> 01:42:07,518
We're bringing everybody up
from state headquarters.

1225
01:42:10,209 --> 01:42:12,962
- Did you get Hendricks?
- They're looking for him.

1226
01:42:13,129 --> 01:42:17,008
Why isn't he at his desk?
Don't you think you'd better get back?

1227
01:42:17,169 --> 01:42:21,720
The boy is talking to the state.
He can raise public opinion against us.

1228
01:42:21,889 --> 01:42:25,643
He'll never get started.
I'll make public opinion out there.

1229
01:42:25,809 --> 01:42:29,597
I've done it all my life.
I'll blacken this punk so he'll...

1230
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:34,399
You leave public opinion to me.
You better go back into the Senate.

1231
01:42:34,569 --> 01:42:37,720
I hit him from the floor
with everything I knew.

1232
01:42:37,889 --> 01:42:40,926
I haven't got the stomach for it.

1233
01:42:41,089 --> 01:42:45,605
If he starts convincing those senators,
you might as well blow your brains out!

1234
01:42:45,769 --> 01:42:50,479
This is the works! Either we're out of
business or bigger than ever before.

1235
01:42:50,649 --> 01:42:54,278
We can't stop at anything
until we've smashed this yokel...

1236
01:42:54,449 --> 01:42:57,327
Go back to the Senate, Joe.

1237
01:42:57,489 --> 01:43:02,244
The chips are down. I want you
to keep everything that Smith says -

1238
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:07,278
- Out of all our newspapers and all the
others you can line up in the state.

1239
01:43:07,449 --> 01:43:12,000
Those broken-down opposition papers
who don't want to play ball with us. -

1240
01:43:12,169 --> 01:43:15,684
I want you to tie up for 24 hours.

1241
01:43:15,849 --> 01:43:19,125
Stall their deliveries,
push them off the streets!

1242
01:43:19,289 --> 01:43:24,044
Bury them for 24 hours, give me time!
You defend the machine. Hit this guy!

1243
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:27,918
The usual thing, criminal,
blocking a relief bill. -

1244
01:43:28,089 --> 01:43:32,207
- Starving the people.
Joe, will you get back into that Senate!

1245
01:43:34,649 --> 01:43:39,040
Get the hoi polloi excited.
Have them send protests, letters...

1246
01:43:39,209 --> 01:43:42,406
Buy up every minute
of every radio station in the state -

1247
01:43:42,569 --> 01:43:45,037
And keep them spouting against Smith.

1248
01:43:45,209 --> 01:43:48,485
I don't care what it costs!
Get the whole state moving!

1249
01:43:53,969 --> 01:43:59,566
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt to
turn your attention from the true facts.

1250
01:43:59,729 --> 01:44:02,687
Smith was caught red-handed
stealing from boys.

1251
01:44:02,849 --> 01:44:05,283
Relief will be stopped.

1252
01:44:15,089 --> 01:44:18,161
- I've seen filibustering...
- This can't go on, it's ridiculous.

1253
01:44:18,329 --> 01:44:20,524
We've got to get this man off the floor.

1254
01:44:20,689 --> 01:44:25,399
As long as Mr Smith holds that floor
legitimately, he'll continue to hold it.

1255
01:44:25,569 --> 01:44:28,208
That fellow is making a lot of sense.

1256
01:44:28,369 --> 01:44:30,929
You call blackmail sense, Henry?

1257
01:44:31,089 --> 01:44:35,526
I didn't like this boy to begin with,
but no man that wasn't sincere -

1258
01:44:35,689 --> 01:44:39,204
- Could stage a fight like this
against all odds.

1259
01:44:39,369 --> 01:44:43,965
After twenty years work with you
you take his word against mine?!

1260
01:44:44,129 --> 01:44:47,838
That's what it means.
If he's just a bit right, then I'm wrong.

1261
01:44:48,009 --> 01:44:51,445
Can't we work out some deal
to pull that Willet dam out -

1262
01:44:51,609 --> 01:44:53,600
And let the deficiency bill go through?

1263
01:44:53,769 --> 01:44:57,239
It isn't a question of Willet dam.
It's a question of my honour. -

1264
01:44:57,409 --> 01:45:01,846
- The integrity of the committee
and the integrity of the Senate!

1265
01:45:02,009 --> 01:45:05,319
If you want to throw out Section 40,
I'll resign.

1266
01:45:05,489 --> 01:45:09,084
Wait a minute. This is nonsense.
Joe is right.

1267
01:45:09,249 --> 01:45:13,959
A deal is impossible. We have to keep on
what we've been doing and break him.

1268
01:45:14,129 --> 01:45:18,008
Keep him talking, no relief.
Maintain a quorum in relays.

1269
01:45:18,169 --> 01:45:20,205
Is that how you feel, John?

1270
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:22,883
Let's relieve the men on the floor.

1271
01:45:23,049 --> 01:45:26,200
- A man as green as that...
- He can't go on much longer.

1272
01:45:27,889 --> 01:45:29,925
"...with certain unalienable rights.

1273
01:45:30,089 --> 01:45:33,286
Among these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of..."

1274
01:45:35,649 --> 01:45:38,607
Looks like the night shift's coming on.

1275
01:45:40,929 --> 01:45:45,161
The Senator will please suspend
until order is restored in the chamber.

1276
01:45:51,769 --> 01:45:54,806
Half of official Washington
is here to see -

1277
01:45:54,969 --> 01:45:58,803
- Democracy's fine show: the filibuster.
The right to talk your head off.

1278
01:45:58,969 --> 01:46:02,279
Free speech in its most dramatic form.

1279
01:46:02,449 --> 01:46:06,681
The least man in that chamber,
once he gets and holds that floor. -

1280
01:46:06,849 --> 01:46:09,682
- Can talk as long
as he can stand on his feet.

1281
01:46:09,849 --> 01:46:12,443
Providing that he does not sit down. -

1282
01:46:12,609 --> 01:46:15,521
- Does not leave the chamber
or stop talking.

1283
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:17,600
The galleries are packed.

1284
01:46:17,769 --> 01:46:21,159
In the diplomatic gallery
are the envoys of two dictator powers.

1285
01:46:21,329 --> 01:46:25,322
They have come to see what they can't
see at home: democracy in action.

1286
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:27,923
"...the pursuit of happiness.

1287
01:46:28,089 --> 01:46:31,638
That, to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men. -

1288
01:46:31,809 --> 01:46:34,607
- Deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; -

1289
01:46:34,769 --> 01:46:38,444
- That whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends. -

1290
01:46:38,609 --> 01:46:42,124
- It is the right of the people
to alter or abolish..."

1291
01:46:42,289 --> 01:46:45,201
How am I doing?

1292
01:46:46,969 --> 01:46:48,960
Quit stalling and move!

1293
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:52,480
- Mr Taylor.
- Wait a minute.

1294
01:46:52,649 --> 01:46:54,446
Tell Senator Paine.

1295
01:46:54,609 --> 01:46:57,043
About this Smith filibuster.

1296
01:46:57,209 --> 01:47:01,441
Your chain of newspapers must realise
that this bill he is trying to block -

1297
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:03,486
Will affect your section.

1298
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:07,119
It's the patriotic duty
of every newspaper in the country!

1299
01:47:07,289 --> 01:47:10,486
We've got to keep hammering at this man
until we smash him!

1300
01:47:10,649 --> 01:47:15,120
I always get a great kick out of that
part of the Declaration of Independence.

1301
01:47:15,289 --> 01:47:18,565
You're not gonna have a country that
can make these kinds of rules work. -

1302
01:47:18,729 --> 01:47:23,007
- If you haven't got men who can tell
human rights from a punch in the nose.

1303
01:47:27,969 --> 01:47:29,448
That's the headline.

1304
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:33,921
It's a funny thing about men.
They all start life being boys...

1305
01:47:34,089 --> 01:47:38,002
I wouldn't be surprised if some of
these senators were boys once.

1306
01:47:38,169 --> 01:47:42,128
That's why it's a good idea to get boys
out of the crowded cities -

1307
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,280
For a couple of months of the year.

1308
01:47:44,449 --> 01:47:47,725
Build their bodies and minds
for man-sized jobs.

1309
01:47:47,889 --> 01:47:52,679
They'll be behind these desks some day.
It seemed like a pretty good idea.

1310
01:47:52,849 --> 01:47:57,718
Boys from all over the country,
of all nationalities and ways of life.

1311
01:47:57,889 --> 01:48:02,360
Getting them together to find out
what makes different people tick.

1312
01:48:02,529 --> 01:48:05,680
I wouldn't give two cents
for all your fancy rules -

1313
01:48:05,849 --> 01:48:10,320
- If behind them they didn't have
plain, ordinary everyday kindness.

1314
01:48:10,489 --> 01:48:14,198
And... a little looking out for
the other fellow too.

1315
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:25,644
That's pretty important,
all that.

1316
01:48:25,809 --> 01:48:28,642
It's the blood, bone and sinew
of this democracy -

1317
01:48:28,809 --> 01:48:31,642
- That great men handed down
to the human race!

1318
01:48:31,809 --> 01:48:35,165
But if you've got to build a dam
where that boys camp ought to be. -

1319
01:48:35,329 --> 01:48:39,322
- To get some graft
to pay off some political army...

1320
01:48:39,489 --> 01:48:43,118
If you think I'll go back
and tell those boys in my state:

1321
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:47,282
"Forget it. All this stuff I've been
telling you about this land -

1322
01:48:47,449 --> 01:48:51,044
- Is a lot of hooey!
This country belongs to the Taylors."

1323
01:48:51,209 --> 01:48:55,805
Not me! Anybody who thinks I'll do that
has another think coming!

1324
01:49:05,329 --> 01:49:09,845
That's all right. I just wanted
to find out whether you still had faces.

1325
01:49:14,529 --> 01:49:16,440
I'm sorry, gentlemen...

1326
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:21,887
I know I'm being disrespectful
to this honourable body...

1327
01:49:22,049 --> 01:49:26,167
A guy like me should never be allowed
to get in here in the first place!

1328
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:29,765
I hate to stand here
and try your patience. -

1329
01:49:29,929 --> 01:49:33,319
- But either I'm dead right
or I'm crazy!

1330
01:49:33,489 --> 01:49:37,687
You wouldn't care to
put that to a vote, Senator?

1331
01:49:39,009 --> 01:49:41,523
- Will the Senator yield for a question?
- I yield.

1332
01:49:41,689 --> 01:49:44,328
In view of the gentleman's concern
for the senators -

1333
01:49:44,489 --> 01:49:48,846
- And the fact that he's been talking
for 71/2 hours and must be tired. -

1334
01:49:49,009 --> 01:49:52,285
- Would he permit a motion
to recess until the morning. -

1335
01:49:52,449 --> 01:49:56,124
- At which time he may be better able
to continue his profound babbling?

1336
01:49:56,289 --> 01:49:57,961
No, don't.

1337
01:50:01,449 --> 01:50:04,168
Ask him.

1338
01:50:09,569 --> 01:50:12,402
Mr President,
what happens to me in the morning?

1339
01:50:12,569 --> 01:50:16,847
I mean, about my having this floor
to go on with my babbling.

1340
01:50:17,009 --> 01:50:19,682
If the Senator permits this motion. -

1341
01:50:19,849 --> 01:50:23,603
- He won't have the floor
to babble with or anything else.

1342
01:50:23,769 --> 01:50:28,081
Unless he's recognised first
by this chair.

1343
01:50:34,849 --> 01:50:39,604
As I was saying, gentlemen...
I'm either dead right or I'm crazy.

1344
01:50:39,769 --> 01:50:44,047
- I feel fine. What have you got?
- From Miss Saunders.

1345
01:51:09,689 --> 01:51:12,362
Is the Senator yielding the floor?

1346
01:51:13,529 --> 01:51:18,603
Yield the...? Oh, no.
I feel fine.

1347
01:51:21,369 --> 01:51:24,406
"The Constitution of the United States".

1348
01:51:30,289 --> 01:51:32,484
Page one, top left-hand corner:

1349
01:51:32,649 --> 01:51:36,688
"We, the people of the United States,
in order to form a more perfect union."

1350
01:51:36,849 --> 01:51:38,726
Yeah? Buy it or wreck it!

1351
01:51:40,489 --> 01:51:42,684
- Holy smoke!
- What's the matter?

1352
01:51:42,849 --> 01:51:46,683
This is murder. You've got to
call him off. He's getting nowhere.

1353
01:51:46,849 --> 01:51:50,444
Not one word of what he's saying
is being printed in that state!

1354
01:51:50,609 --> 01:51:54,921
Taylor has every paper lined up
and he's feeding them doctored-up junk!

1355
01:51:55,089 --> 01:51:58,240
- One man muzzling a whole state?
- And how!

1356
01:51:58,409 --> 01:52:00,684
Freedom of the press!

1357
01:52:02,369 --> 01:52:04,883
I've got an idea! Come on.

1358
01:52:05,569 --> 01:52:09,608
- Jeff has a paper there. Boy Stuff.
- Terrific!

1359
01:52:09,769 --> 01:52:13,205
They aren't letting what Jeff says
get printed in the state.

1360
01:52:13,369 --> 01:52:16,884
If I give you a raft of it now
over the phone. -

1361
01:52:17,049 --> 01:52:21,327
- Can you print it up
and spread a billion copies of it?

1362
01:52:21,489 --> 01:52:25,198
Swell!
Get ready to take it down, Mrs Smith.

1363
01:52:26,209 --> 01:52:29,645
Everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!

1364
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:32,004
Here we go.

1365
01:52:32,169 --> 01:52:35,718
- All ready, Clarissa.
- She called me Clarissa!

1366
01:52:36,409 --> 01:52:39,003
Okay, Ma.

1367
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:42,878
Jeff tells truth.
Shows up Taylor.

1368
01:52:43,049 --> 01:52:47,679
I want the whole morning edition
a blast to push him off the floor.

1369
01:52:47,849 --> 01:52:51,125
Willet dam is a fraud to line
the pockets of the Taylor machine.

1370
01:52:51,289 --> 01:52:53,280
Here's your front page editorial:

1371
01:52:53,449 --> 01:52:57,362
A convicted thief representing you
holds the floor of the U. S. Senate.

1372
01:52:57,529 --> 01:52:59,679
All right, boys, hurry up.

1373
01:53:10,009 --> 01:53:12,079
Come on, bring on the paper.

1374
01:53:49,009 --> 01:53:51,921
...charity waters not itself. -

1375
01:53:52,089 --> 01:53:55,240
Is not puffed up -

1376
01:53:56,649 --> 01:54:02,167
- And now abideth
faith, hope, charity.

1377
01:54:03,049 --> 01:54:04,880
These three.

1378
01:54:06,649 --> 01:54:09,880
The greatest of these is charity.

1379
01:54:45,529 --> 01:54:47,759
Read about Jeff Smith!

1380
01:54:51,089 --> 01:54:56,561
- Distributed by nine millions kids!
- Get the boys out. Do it!

1381
01:55:07,729 --> 01:55:09,845
Look out, fellows.

1382
01:55:10,009 --> 01:55:12,921
Come on, get these papers out of here.

1383
01:55:17,769 --> 01:55:20,522
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!

1384
01:55:40,409 --> 01:55:45,722
Are we going to let a man like that
throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?

1385
01:55:45,889 --> 01:55:48,608
Are you for Joe Paine?

1386
01:55:49,769 --> 01:55:52,363
Hurrah for Jeff Smith!

1387
01:56:07,249 --> 01:56:10,321
Children hurt all over the city!
Tell Jeff to stop!

1388
01:56:10,489 --> 01:56:14,277
Yes, all right.
Yes, goodbye.

1389
01:56:16,809 --> 01:56:20,165
Senator Smith has now talked
for 23 hours and 16 minutes.

1390
01:56:20,329 --> 01:56:22,968
It is the most spectacular thing
in the Senate annals.

1391
01:56:23,129 --> 01:56:26,121
One simple American
holding the greatest floor.

1392
01:56:26,289 --> 01:56:29,201
What he lacked in experience,
he's made up in fight.

1393
01:56:29,369 --> 01:56:32,008
But those tired
boy ranger legs are buckling. -

1394
01:56:32,169 --> 01:56:35,479
- Bleary eyes, voice gone,
he can't go on much longer.

1395
01:56:35,649 --> 01:56:38,561
All Washington is here
to be in on the kill.

1396
01:56:39,769 --> 01:56:44,797
There's no compromise with the truth.
That's all I got the floor to say.

1397
01:56:45,649 --> 01:56:49,005
When was it?
A year ago, it seems like...

1398
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:53,526
- Diz, terrible things are happening.
- They're listening to him now.

1399
01:56:53,689 --> 01:56:56,726
Just get up off the ground.

1400
01:56:56,889 --> 01:57:00,404
Get up there with that lady
on top of the Capitol dome. -

1401
01:57:00,569 --> 01:57:02,605
That lady that stands for liberty.

1402
01:57:02,769 --> 01:57:06,398
Take a look at this country
through her eyes.

1403
01:57:07,409 --> 01:57:09,559
You won'tjust see scenery.

1404
01:57:09,729 --> 01:57:12,482
You'll see
what man's carved out for himself -

1405
01:57:12,649 --> 01:57:17,643
- After centuries of fighting
for something better than jungle law.

1406
01:57:17,809 --> 01:57:21,848
Fighting so he can stand
on his own two feet, free and decent.

1407
01:57:22,009 --> 01:57:26,525
Like he was created. No matter
what his race, colour or creed.

1408
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:30,524
That's what you'll see.

1409
01:57:30,689 --> 01:57:34,921
There's no place out there
for graft or greed or lies. -

1410
01:57:35,089 --> 01:57:37,762
Or compromise with human liberties.

1411
01:57:37,929 --> 01:57:41,080
If that's what the grown-ups
have done with this world. -

1412
01:57:41,249 --> 01:57:45,765
- We have to start those boys' camps
and see what the kids can do.

1413
01:57:45,929 --> 01:57:48,204
It's not too late.

1414
01:57:48,369 --> 01:57:53,523
This country is bigger than the Taylors,
you or me or anything else.

1415
01:57:55,249 --> 01:57:58,446
Great principles don't get lost
once they come to light.

1416
01:57:58,609 --> 01:58:02,568
They're right here.
You just have to see them.

1417
01:58:05,929 --> 01:58:09,558
Mr President...
will the Senator yield for a question?

1418
01:58:09,729 --> 01:58:13,847
- Will Senator Smith yield?
- Yes, I yield for a question.

1419
01:58:14,009 --> 01:58:17,604
The Senator says he is speaking
to the people of his state.

1420
01:58:17,769 --> 01:58:22,479
He has been waiting for them
to come marching here in droves.

1421
01:58:22,649 --> 01:58:26,244
Is the gentleman interested
in knowing what those people say?

1422
01:58:26,409 --> 01:58:30,880
- Here it comes, Diz.
- Yes, sir. You bet I am.

1423
01:58:31,049 --> 01:58:36,169
Have I permission to bring
evidence of the response from my state?

1424
01:58:36,329 --> 01:58:40,288
Is there objection?...
You may proceed, Senator.

1425
01:58:40,449 --> 01:58:43,247
Come on, pageboys. All of you.

1426
01:59:15,889 --> 01:59:19,245
I can't stand to see him hurt.

1427
01:59:19,409 --> 01:59:22,526
- Public opinion made to order.
- Taylor-made.

1428
01:59:23,129 --> 01:59:26,360
There it is. The gentleman's answer.

1429
01:59:26,529 --> 01:59:30,761
50,000 telegrams demanding
that he yield this floor.

1430
01:59:30,929 --> 01:59:34,399
I invite the Senate to read them.
I invite my colleague to read them.

1431
01:59:34,569 --> 01:59:37,845
The people's answer
to Mr Jefferson Smith.

1432
02:00:19,089 --> 02:00:21,125
Stop, Jeff, stop!

1433
02:01:04,129 --> 02:01:07,678
I guess this is just another lost cause,
Mr Paine.

1434
02:01:12,489 --> 02:01:15,686
All you people
don't know about lost causes.

1435
02:01:15,849 --> 02:01:17,919
Mr Paine does.

1436
02:01:18,929 --> 02:01:23,241
He said once they were
the only causes worth fighting for.

1437
02:01:23,409 --> 02:01:28,324
And he fought for them for the only
reason any man ever fights for them.

1438
02:01:32,809 --> 02:01:37,837
Because ofjust one plain, simple rule:
Love thy neighbour.

1439
02:01:39,609 --> 02:01:44,922
In this world full of hatred a man who
knows that one rule has a great trust.

1440
02:01:45,089 --> 02:01:50,846
You know that rule, Mr Paine. I loved
you for it, just as my father did.

1441
02:01:51,009 --> 02:01:54,684
You know that
you fight harder for the lost causes.

1442
02:01:54,849 --> 02:01:57,602
You even die for them.

1443
02:01:59,249 --> 02:02:02,559
Like a man we both knew, Mr Paine.

1444
02:02:04,729 --> 02:02:10,520
You think I'm licked.
You all think I'm licked.

1445
02:02:11,729 --> 02:02:16,723
Well, I am not licked!
I'll stay and fight for this lost cause.

1446
02:02:16,889 --> 02:02:20,199
Even if this room
gets filled with lies like these -

1447
02:02:20,369 --> 02:02:25,284
- And the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

1448
02:02:26,409 --> 02:02:29,082
Somebody will listen to me.

1449
02:02:51,209 --> 02:02:53,279
He's okay. He just fainted.

1450
02:03:06,049 --> 02:03:09,121
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!

1451
02:03:09,289 --> 02:03:12,599
Expel me! Expel me, not him!
Willet dam is a fraud.

1452
02:03:12,769 --> 02:03:16,205
It's a crime against the people
who sent me here! I committed it!

1453
02:03:16,369 --> 02:03:19,998
Every word that boy said
about Taylor and me and graft -

1454
02:03:20,169 --> 02:03:23,718
- And the rotten political corruption
