1
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:20,672
She'll be comin' round
the mountain when she comes

2
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:23,010
- She'll be comin'
- Can't you sing in tune?

3
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,949
Round the mountain when she comes

4
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,023
Hey, Ben, you know I was just thinkin'.

5
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:36,926
Back home they wouldn't let me drive
a scooter without taking a test.

6
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:40,762
<i>Marvelous, isn't it?</i>

7
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,767
Marvelous.

8
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,469
Here, Ben, look.

9
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,976
Get out of here, you bunch of stupid-

10
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,620
Blimey. He was exceeding
the speed limit.

11
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:07,886
Hey, watch the road!

12
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:48,959
You say there's reckless abuse of power!

13
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,553
And to free ourselves.
To free ourselves from-

14
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:28,730
Sorry, gents, no passengers allowed.

15
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,042
Hey, Ben, what do you
reckon they're up to?

16
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,050
I don't know.

17
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:41,052
They got rid of our government.

18
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,179
Perhaps they wanna get rid of their own.

19
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:27,790
- Come on, lads. Let's be havin' ya.
- Good trip, Sergeant?

20
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,427
Dusty. Get 'em cracking
with the unloading, Corp.

21
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:32,437
- Yes, Sergeant. Hurry up!
- Corporal. Corporal.

22
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,439
When you've done that, here's
the mail for the officers' mess.

23
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,441
Right. Hurry up.

24
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,206
- You got any mail for me?
- Who'd write to you, Dig?

25
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:47,309
Blimey, I'd forgotten what women
smelled like. Where's it from?

26
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:50,719
Sydney.

27
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,987
One, two, one
- Ben?

28
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,552
- Ben!
- Nothing this time, Muscles. Sorry, mate.

29
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,622
Come on! Louder yourselves
up! One, two! One, two!

30
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,363
So, our head man is the prime minister.

31
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:07,565
- Your head man is
the- - President.

32
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,108
Now, our prime minister
works in Parliament.

33
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,940
- Your head man works
in- - House of Assembly.

34
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:17,381
Good. Splendid. Now, one of our members
of Parliament is coming to this camp.

35
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,078
- I'm sure she'll want to talk to you.
- She, sir?

36
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,245
Oh, yes, a woman. A woman member.

37
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:25,119
Oh, women in Parliament
have their uses, you know.

38
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,183
What uses, sir? To carry water?

39
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,229
Yes, well, uh, we won't
go into that one now.

40
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,356
Class dismissed.

41
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,801
<i>Fire.!</i>

42
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:46,508
- Hey, Ben, is that for me?
- Yeah. What is it then?

43
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,013
Good, that's my degree course.

44
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:50,208
Oh, blimey, haven't
you had enough education?

45
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,341
Come on, Abou. What
about that dirty pint?

46
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:55,216
I got a mouth on me like a
gorilla's armpit. Ben? Schoolie?

47
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,221
- No, thanks.
- All right. Just a quick one.

48
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:00,190
- Been down to the railhead?
- Eighty miles of dust track.

49
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,497
Enough to boil your brains.

50
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:03,888
And there's something
queer going on down in Batasi.

51
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,591
When we came through the
main square just now...

52
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:09,156
it was choked up with Africans
running all ways and hollering.

53
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,260
- Yeah?
- Fill 'er up, Abou.

54
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:14,329
Ta. Some of them tried
to stop us and all.

55
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,636
Probably celebrating something.
Maybe one of those durbars.

56
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,837
No, these characters were dead serious.

57
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:23,404
They were really giving it big
licks. Banners and drums and all.

58
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:27,316
Look out, here comes the R. S. M.
We'll have to get changed.

59
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,650
If he comes in and catches us
like this, he'll do his tank.

60
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:49,437
Remain there!

61
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,869
Come here!

62
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:03,917
When you pass a commissioned officer...

63
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:08,289
you don't wave your end
about like a pregnant penguin.

64
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,420
You execute a salute
in the following manner.

65
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:13,431
Raise the right hand
by the longest route...

66
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,433
till the second finger rests
one inch above the right eye.

67
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,435
Turn your head and eyes in
the direction of the officer.

68
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,488
When past the officer,
return eyes to the

69
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,803
front and hand to the
right side. Is that clear?

70
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:26,942
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

71
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:30,311
Let's see you do it then,
lad. Come along. Come along!

72
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:34,648
Salute me by numbers
- One!

73
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,654
Two!

74
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:39,987
<i>One.! Two.!</i>

75
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,994
Put that in the file, will you?

76
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:49,030
- A message from Command, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

77
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,035
- You'd better wait.
- Sir.

78
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,971
<i>Come in.</i>

79
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,947
<i>Priority signal from Command, sir.</i>

80
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,110
Oh, read it out, Tony, will you?

81
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:11,816
Yes, sir. "Serious political
riots reported in the capital.

82
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,825
"For the duration of
these disturbances...

83
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:16,487
"British personnel will retire
to their respective messes...

84
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,928
"and take no part in
regimental activities.

85
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:21,330
"British officers commanding
African formations...

86
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,801
"will hand over command forthwith
to senior African officer...

87
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,498
and await further
instructions from this H. Q."

88
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,342
It's all right. We made
it. He's still at it.

89
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:36,973
One! Two!

90
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,983
<i>- What'll you have, Dodger?
- A pint, please, Digger.</i>

91
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,985
Right. And the usual for Ben.

92
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:44,682
Well, this will be my last
queen's birthday dinner.

93
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,857
So, you're really off?
They won't let you extend?

94
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:47,988
No, mate. Too bloody old.

95
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,994
Ah, we'll come and see
you off at the airport.

96
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:51,996
We'll sink a few pints that day.

97
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:54,259
I reckon old Ben's got himself
a smashing job out there.

98
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,767
No, they've got no time for hairy
old soldiers in civvy street.

99
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:59,827
Now, mate, you'll be all right. Once
they see you standing up there...

100
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:02,999
straight as a ramrod, holding your gut
in, slammin' your feet down, they'll say-

101
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,635
Give this man a kick in
the crotch out of here.

102
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:09,044
Why don't you become a doorman, Ben? I
know blokeys knockin' off 16 pounds a week.

103
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,807
Right. Stand around a
doorway all day, saluting

104
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,108
every stray bastard that comes and goes?

105
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:16,484
Not likely I'm chucker
with that bloody lot.

106
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:20,548
Never mind, Ben. The great British
public will see that you get your reward.

107
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:24,653
Slap your foot down. Slap it down hard.

108
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,698
R. S. M.'s getting carried away out there.

109
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:28,790
He's three and a half minutes late.

110
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,801
Must have fractured his elbow by now.

111
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:32,803
He wouldn't let a little
thing like that hold him up.

112
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,772
You won't get away with that.
He'll spot it in two minutes.

113
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,041
You want a bet? Pints all around.

114
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:45,174
- You're on.
- Right.

115
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,550
- There's nothing for you, old man
of muscle. - Now leave off.

116
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,784
- Why don't you call me Muscles
like everybody else? - Muscles?

117
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:55,190
- Yeah?
- You notice anything different?

118
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,956
Why? What's going on?

119
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:02,097
<i>- Evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.</i>

120
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:16,009
What's it gonna be, sir?

121
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,049
<i>- I'll have a whiskey for me.
- Sir.</i>

122
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,051
How's the marriage
prospects, Corporal Abou?

123
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,883
Oh, very fine. Thank
you, sir. Very fine.

124
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:25,287
- Dodger, weren't you supposed to have
the lawn mower repaired? - Yes, sir.

125
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:29,817
I tried it this afternoon. I regret
to say it wouldn't cut up butter.

126
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,159
We'll have to get some more table
mats. Down at Command H. Q...

127
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,825
they've got some new ones
stamped with the regimental crest.

128
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,301
These old ones are
shabby. They're a disgrace.

129
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:42,306
Silver could do with a
polish too, Corporal Abou.

130
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:45,537
- Sir.
- Anybody got a light?

131
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:47,545
Yes, sir.

132
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:54,480
Now tell me which bloody fool among
you removed Her Majesty's portrait?

133
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,319
I'm afraid that was me, sir.
I bet Ben pints all around...

134
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,018
- you wouldn't spot it under
two minutes, sir. - Put it back!

135
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:03,960
Yes, sir.

136
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,328
I'll have proper respect
shown in this mess.

137
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,163
You may think you know me, gentlemen.
You may think you can see me coming.

138
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,601
But let me tell you this.

139
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,799
There's no alteration
celebration, no argumentation...

140
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:19,810
and no qualification in this
mess that escapes my little eye.

141
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:25,145
Read, learn, and inwardly bloody
digest, I've seen Calcutta!

142
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:27,651
I've eaten camel dung,
my knees are brown...

143
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:31,120
my navel is central,
my conscious is clear.

144
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,751
And my will is with my
solicitors, short and curly.

145
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:40,162
I believe you're on the chair, Dodger.

146
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,470
Guard, stand at ease!

147
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,084
<i>Come in.</i>

148
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:05,453
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Captain Abraham.

149
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,458
Take a look at that.

150
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:12,829
"Serious political riots in capital.

151
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:17,995
British personnel will take no
part in regimental activities."

152
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,006
Few political hotheads, sir.
"Will hand over command...

153
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:25,874
to senior African officer."

154
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:28,640
You will assume command
of this battalion...

155
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:32,115
as of now, 1900 hours.

156
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,516
This is quite a shock, sir.

157
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:39,250
- I'll, uh, call my officers together.
- Right.

158
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:42,088
I would, uh, welcome your advice, sir.

159
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,493
Of course. Anything I can do.

160
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:47,088
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, Abraham.

161
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,467
Come on, Charlie.

162
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,398
Move!

163
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:26,661
Come on! Move! Move!

164
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:38,546
- Ah, get stuffed!
- Don't seem to like us very much.

165
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:41,140
Of course they do. It's just
their way of expressing themselves.

166
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:58,261
Proud as a peacock, he was.
Saluted like a guardsman.

167
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,634
Thought I was back at the depot for a
minute. Except for his color, of course.

168
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:05,141
That's what you need in the
army. Isn't that so, Ben? Pride.

169
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:09,076
- Remember the church parades
in Singapore before the war?

170
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,205
Everybody marching through
the town on Sunday morning...

171
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,114
beyond the band and
drums, bags of swank.

172
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:19,247
Siamese, Catholics, anti-Baptist,
everything bloody thing.

173
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:23,316
There was a man name of Smith, 279.

174
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,884
<i>Refused to go to church on
the grounds he was an atheist.</i>

175
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:28,329
<i>I had to whip him up in front
of the colonel, of course.</i>

176
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:31,424
Old Colonel Killinback, it was.
He was a wicked old bastard.

177
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,435
When Smith said he was an atheist...

178
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,801
old Killinback looks at his documents.

179
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:37,806
You stated you were ch-

180
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:44,775
"You stated you were Church of
England when you enlisted," he says.

181
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:48,544
Smith says, "I know, sir...

182
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:50,883
but I've changed my
mind in the meantime."

183
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,218
"In this regiment,"
says old Killinback...

184
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,554
"only the officers change their mind...

185
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,823
and even they have to get
permission in writing."

186
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:01,295
- Twenty-eight days glasshouse
they gave him- - The best station-

187
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,697
which was something to
shout about in those days.

188
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:05,826
Wonderful station
- Singapore.

189
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,836
- What was your favorite station, Muscles?
- Sir?

190
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,668
The best station I ever knew
was mortared before the war.

191
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:14,643
The navy used to go on fleet
maneuvers and leave their wives behind.

192
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:17,373
All soft and pink... and willing.

193
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:21,178
We made sure they never got lonesome.

194
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:27,914
You didn't have time to wipe your boots.

195
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:31,859
You couldn't beat India
though, you know, Ben.

196
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:35,455
"Jewel of the East" they used to call
it. What a pity they had to give it away.

197
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:39,024
<i>Well, gentlemen, do you all
understand the new situation?</i>

198
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:41,696
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

199
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:44,900
I just want to remind you of one thing.

200
00:16:44,975 --> 00:16:48,433
It is your duty to carry out the
orders of the elected government.

201
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:52,573
<i>It is not for us to concern
ourselves with politics.</i>

202
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,674
- Is that quite clear?
- Yes, sir.

203
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:59,688
Very well. I shall want to see you all
again at 9:00 sharp tomorrow morning.

204
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:01,815
That is all.

205
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:10,296
<i>- Boniface.
- Sir?</i>

206
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,926
Boni, your company's on duty tonight.

207
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:17,064
- Yes, sir.
- Treble all pickets...

208
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,439
put guards on the arms
and ammunition stores.

209
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,537
Don't issue any ammo
except on my instructions.

210
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:26,605
Somebody might shoot somebody.

211
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:31,647
Recall "A" and "B"
Companies. Here's the signal.

212
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,182
- Will that be all, sir?
- For the moment.

213
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,423
- You'll come back later, we'll
do rounds together. - Sir.

214
00:17:57,013 --> 00:18:00,505
Well, the battalion seems
to be in very capable hands.

215
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,950
I'll put Mr. Lauderdale
in the picture...

216
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:06,716
and then we can get changed
for the party and relax.

217
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,351
Hello?

218
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,725
Yes, yes, he's here right
now. It's for you, sir.

219
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,094
Oh, thank you.

220
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:18,532
Colonel Deal speaking.

221
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:21,730
Yes, well, I could be there
in a couple of hours, sir, but-

222
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:24,069
Well, won't he wait until morning?

223
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:29,309
Very well, Sir William.

224
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:31,574
- Damn.
- What's the trouble, sir?

225
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:35,584
The deputy commissioner
wants to see me... tonight.

226
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:39,383
Oh, uh, phone Mr. Lauderdale
and say I'll call in on my way.

227
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:42,653
- Right, sir.
- Oh, blast.

228
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:47,220
I nearly forgot. The Barker-Wise woman.

229
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:51,324
She wants to spend an evening
in the sergeants' mess.

230
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:54,529
- Lay on the transport, will you?
- With pleasure, sir.

231
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:58,199
What bad luck, sir, you
having to go off this evening.

232
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:01,369
I mean, with the nurses coming
to dinner and everything.

233
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:04,709
Yes, it is bad luck.

234
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:07,147
For you too, Tony.
You're coming with me.

235
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:12,687
Now you wouldn't credit a
sausage fly had brains, would you?

236
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:15,224
But this little beast landed on
my shoulder three times running.

237
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,726
- Real tame, sir.
- How do you know it's the same one?

238
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:19,728
<i>Well, I can tell, can't I, sport?</i>

239
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:22,629
<i>Sergeants'mess. One moment, sir.</i>

240
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:25,065
Sergeant Major Lauderdale,
it's for you, sir.

241
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,330
Here, let's try and see if we
can get him plastered, shall we?

242
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:29,338
Regimental Sergeant Major.

243
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,340
Get your laughing
gear around that, mate.

244
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:33,740
Very well, sir. C. O.'s on his way over.

245
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,210
Ben, be ready to offer him a drink
as soon as he comes through this door.

246
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,304
<i>Yeah.</i>

247
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,543
Good evening, Mr. Lauderdale.

248
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,350
Evening, sir. Would you care
to come in for a drink, sir?

249
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:49,085
Well, there's nothing I'd like better,
but I'm afraid it'll have to keep.

250
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,892
- The war office have got a flap on.
- What, again, sir?

251
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:02,036
Squad, halt!

252
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,973
In the meantime, you
will be responsible...

253
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,339
for the safety of the
members of your mess.

254
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,470
There shouldn't be any complications
if we keep our heads down...

255
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,741
until this little spot
of bother blows over.

256
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:49,774
- And then we can carry on as usual.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:53,482
Oh, and don't forget what I
told you about Miss Barker-Wise.

258
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,490
She's a member of Parliament...

259
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,654
so tell your chaps to
be a bit, uh, diplomatic.

260
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,697
I'll tell them, sir.

261
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:10,004
Ah, look, he can hardly walk straight.

262
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:12,473
He's got the hiccups now.

263
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:16,478
- Oh! The little bastard bit me.
- Oh.

264
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:20,209
What the hell's going on? If I had
the colonel with me, I'd have bit you.

265
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:22,478
You were so long, sir, we
couldn't think what was happening.

266
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:24,782
Does the gallant colonel bring
good news from the front, sir?

267
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:27,721
He has marvelous news. News to
set your little ears a-tingling.

268
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,557
Pay attention!

269
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:35,587
- You're all confined to the mess until
further notice. - What have we done, sir?

270
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:38,361
Nothing you've done. It's due
to the political situation.

271
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,801
- Well, how long's till further
notice, sir? - In this case...

272
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,100
till order's restored down in the town.

273
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:46,165
Marvelous, isn't it? Bloody marvelous.

274
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:48,233
Two hot chocolate mechanics
chuck bricks at each other...

275
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:52,042
- and the whole British Army's immobilized.
- May I remind you, Sgt. Brown...

276
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:54,845
they are not hot chocolate
mechanics, they're Africans.

277
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:58,012
And you're not the whole of
the British Army. Thank God.

278
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:00,022
- Corporal Abou.
- Sir.

279
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,854
I want an extra place laid for dinner.
We shall be entertaining a lady.

280
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:04,359
- Yes, sir.
- A lady?

281
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:06,725
- Blimey, a woman? - Not one of those
nursing bits from the hospital.

282
00:22:06,796 --> 00:22:09,196
We're entertaining a member of the
House of Commons, Miss Barker-Wise.

283
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,199
- Oh, blimey.
- Right. I want this place tidied up.

284
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,633
<i>- Digger, sling those empties over
the bar. Muscles? - Sir.</i>

285
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:18,231
Get rid of these pinups. Schoolie,
hide these disgusting magazines.

286
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:21,744
- Dodger, make yourself useful.
Come along. Come along. - Sir?

287
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:25,212
Now remember this. If I catch
any member of this mess...

288
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:27,442
drifting about the hardships
of a soldier's life...

289
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:30,315
into the ear of a certain member
of Her Majesty's government-

290
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:32,321
You're sure she's not a
member of the opposition, sir?

291
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,550
I don't care if she's a
member of the Royal Ballet.

292
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:38,617
If I catch anybody belly
- bellyaching...

293
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:40,686
it'll be harder after she's gone.

294
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:42,664
The army's a great life,
and don't you forget it.

295
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:46,525
<i>Right. Here she is.</i>

296
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:49,299
Now, I want you all behaving
like Little Lord Fauntleroy.

297
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:51,932
No blasphemy. No obscenity.

298
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:54,306
And above all, no bad language.

299
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:01,512
Who the bloody hell are you?

300
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,814
Evening, Sergeant Major.

301
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:05,821
Step inside. Let's have a look at you.

302
00:23:14,064 --> 00:23:16,191
Evening, all.

303
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:26,598
- What's your name, lad?
- Wilkes. Private Wilkes.

304
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:31,113
- I shan't be Private Wilkes
for much longer. - Oh, really?

305
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:33,809
What will you be then?
Field Marshal Montgomery?

306
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:36,545
Stand at attention!

307
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:40,989
Identification card.

308
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:50,061
Yes, well, Private Wilkes 714.

309
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,534
- What are you doing here?
- In transit, back to England for demob.

310
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,662
- Sir!
- Sir!

311
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:01,777
What's this?

312
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:03,904
Hello.

313
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:09,514
Uh, this is Miss
Eriksson, sir. She's, um-

314
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:13,386
She's on her way back to Paris. She
got stranded at the airport. Same as me.

315
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:17,587
- No planes taking off.
- That's right.

316
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,629
Mr. Wilkes was kind
enough to look after me.

317
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:26,298
Well, this is, uh, all highly irregular.

318
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:29,463
This is a military
establishment, not a hotel.

319
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,599
I couldn't do much else,
could I, sir? She's, uh-

320
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:35,371
She's with the United Nations.

321
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:37,538
We're supposed to keep in with them.

322
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:41,414
Well, they are on our side.

323
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:43,748
Aren't they?

324
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,779
I came out as a secretary with a
team of United Nations observers...

325
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:50,553
and I stayed on for a little holiday.

326
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:55,920
Yes, well, we'll talk about that later.

327
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,524
- Perhaps you'd like a
clean-up. - Oh, yes, please.

328
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,535
Then we'll see what we can arrange.

329
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:04,004
- Ben? Ben!
- Sir.

330
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:06,007
Show her the ablutions.

331
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:11,203
This way, miss.

332
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:13,806
<i>The rest of you stand fast.</i>

333
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:17,114
- When are you due for discharge?
- Day after tomorrow.

334
00:25:17,187 --> 00:25:19,587
Doesn't look as though you're
gonna make it, lad, does it?

335
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:23,422
It's all highly irregular having a
private soldier in the sergeants' mess.

336
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:25,893
You'd better kip down in the
rations store through there.

337
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:29,731
Yes, sir.

338
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,335
<i>- Wilkes.!
- Sir?</i>

339
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,065
Hang on to your card, lad.
Never move without your B2601.

340
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,630
Chin up, chin up!

341
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,903
Now understand this, Wilkes.

342
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:44,208
I can always stomach a good
soldier, whatever his faults.

343
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,714
What I can't stomach
are Bolshies, skivers...

344
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:49,308
scrimshankers and bughouse barristers.

345
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:53,321
I've broken more of them than
you've had eggs for breakfast.

346
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:55,880
If I take a liking to you, lad...

347
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,757
I'll be your good friend and counselor.

348
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,762
If you offend me...

349
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,993
<i>I'll pull out your
sausage-like intestines...</i>

350
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:07,935
hang 'em round your neck and prick 'em
every so often like they do real sausages.

351
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:09,972
Good evening.

352
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,443
Good evening, ma'am. Regimental
Sergeant Major Lauderdale.

353
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:19,379
- You're Miss Barker-Wise. - I do
hope I'm not interrupting anything.

354
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:24,182
No, ma'am. We were just having
a discussion on discipline.

355
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:26,620
- May I introduce Sgt. Prideaux.
- How do you do?

356
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:29,783
Sgt. Brown. Sgt. Drake. Sgt.
Dunn. Color Sergeant Smith.

357
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:33,420
- How do you do? - And
this is Pri-At ease!

358
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:35,430
- Private Wilkes.
- How do you do?

359
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,728
Take your cap off. Won't
you sit down, ma'am?

360
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,893
- Thank you.
- What about a noggin?

361
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,699
- May I have a whiskey?
- Corporal Abou.

362
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:44,637
<i>Large whiskey. What about you, Wilkes?</i>

363
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:49,906
That's very kind of you, sir. I'll
have a large whiskey too, please.

364
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:52,345
- And the usual, Corporal.
- Sir.

365
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:54,315
<i>Come on, lads. Quite informal.</i>

366
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:58,514
This is the first time we've had the
honor of entertaining ladies in this mess.

367
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:01,056
- Ladies.
- All right, sit down. Sit down.

368
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:03,285
Yes, there'll be another
one out in a minute, typist.

369
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,851
Got stranded at the airport.
This is quite an occasion.

370
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,090
Indeed. Well, it's an
occasion for me too.

371
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:12,191
It's not often one gets the chance
of seeing things for one's self.

372
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:14,327
Especially the new African Army.

373
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:18,841
Perhaps after dinner we could all sit
round and I'll fire questions at you.

374
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:20,850
Yes, well, as long as we don't come

375
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:23,402
against the Official
Secrets Act, of course.

376
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:26,346
<i>Oh, I don't think we shall do that.</i>

377
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:30,546
No, what I'm most interested in is how
you get along with your African colleagues.

378
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,420
<i>How soon they'll be ready to take over
completely. You know, that sort of thing.</i>

379
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:50,572
Sir.

380
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,074
<i>Come in.</i>

381
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:58,309
Boni, ready for rounds?

382
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,880
What the-

383
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:11,054
Captain Abraham, you are under arrest...

384
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,061
in the name of the new government.

385
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:18,724
He's got it - discipline. You can't
run anything without discipline...

386
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:20,735
from an army down to a coffee store.

387
00:28:20,803 --> 00:28:22,737
That's the trouble with the
world today, isn't it, Ben?

388
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:24,322
They don't know the meaning of the word.

389
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:26,104
Why, the first church
parade I was ever on...

390
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,643
<i>I fainted, dropped down
in front of General Arnott.</i>

391
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,645
<i>What does the general do?
Has me charged with leaving...</i>

392
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:33,807
the appointed place of parade without
permission - Section 40 of the Army Act.

393
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,817
I never fainted again.

394
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:43,823
<i>Well, now they've abolished church parade,
the general must feel quite frustrated.</i>

395
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:47,351
Oh, he's dead. Got blown off the
sea wall at Ramsgate in a gale.

396
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,364
Broke his neck. Very sad.

397
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:16,491
It's a bit cooler out here, isn't it?

398
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,119
Mm-hmm.

399
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:21,925
- Get over that taxi ride yet?
- Just about.

400
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:24,296
But I'm glad you were with me.

401
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:28,929
I couldn't have done much if they'd got the
door open except - except bark at them.

402
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:31,599
They were very angry, weren't they?

403
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:35,303
Yeah. And laughing their
heads off the next minute.

404
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:40,213
<i>I take it, Sergeant Major, that you
do not believe that all men are equal.</i>

405
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,217
Equal, ma'am, but different.

406
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:44,947
Now...

407
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:48,787
you take the horse and zebra.

408
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:51,691
They're equal in a manner of speaking.

409
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:54,889
But if you was to plunk
them down, side by side...

410
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:58,365
feed 'em on the same grub,
in the same climate...

411
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:01,198
one of them would turn his
toes up, wouldn't he, ma'am?

412
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,898
But there are thousands of
Africans living in our climate...

413
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,271
eating our food, and they
don't turn their toes up.

414
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:09,903
My group entertains dozens
of them every weekend.

415
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:13,915
Your own Lieutenant Boniface has
been to my house on many occasions.

416
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:18,044
And you'd hardly suggest he was
incapable of inventing the wheel.

417
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,958
No one is allowed to leave
the confines of the mess.

418
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:35,469
- Is that understood?
- Who the hell are you to issue orders?

419
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:38,098
I have an armed platoon
surrounding the building.

420
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:42,868
I don't have to remind you of the
penalty for armed mutiny, Mr. Boniface.

421
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:46,403
No, you don't. But this isn't mutiny.

422
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,416
Let's us call it a change of structure.

423
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:51,351
You can call it what you like!

424
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,083
I advise you to go back to your
party and await further orders.

425
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:06,327
What do you think?

426
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:08,336
Get on the sergeants' mess.

427
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:28,447
Hello? Line's dead.

428
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:32,083
They've got us. Not
a gun in the place...

429
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:35,289
and cordoned all around and
a dozen nurses on our hands.

430
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:38,128
They might keep us here for days.

431
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,566
<i>Now that's a thought.</i>

432
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:47,804
Young Masai, this one, ma'am. Lives on
milk and bull's blood. Damn good fighter.

433
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:50,778
This chap, he comes from the northern
district. One of the Turkana chiefs.

434
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:53,280
And this-

435
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:55,749
Yes, well, time for dinner.

436
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:58,480
Dodger, tell the bugler
to sound the mess call.

437
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:00,613
Sir.

438
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:04,817
That's a good one,
Wilkie. What's his name?

439
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:09,058
- It's Archie, our company mascot.
- Go on, make him talk.

440
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:17,295
<i>I don't wish to interrupt
the entertainment, Wilkie...</i>

441
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:21,070
but you haven't seen a bugler
anywhere about, have you?

442
00:32:21,143 --> 00:32:25,011
- A what? - A bugler, Wilkie.
You know, a man that plays the bugle.

443
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,245
There's been no one here but Wilkie
- Private Wilkes and myself, Sergeant.

444
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,846
Right. Well, thank you, miss. Thank you.

445
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:41,522
That private's gonna get there
first if somebody doesn't watch it.

446
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,622
The bugler hasn't reported, sir.

447
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:46,691
Hasn't reported? Put him on
company orders in the morning.

448
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:49,761
- Yes, sir.
- Ah, Private Wilkes.

449
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,593
You don't, amongst your many other

450
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,276
accomplishments, happen
to play the bugle, do you?

451
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:56,811
- No, sir.
- No.

452
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,938
I'm pretty good on the harmonica though.

453
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,409
Are you having me on?

454
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,488
- No, sir.
- The prestige of the British Army...

455
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:10,423
has taken a bit of a pasting
in the last few years...

456
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:14,657
but it's not going to think to having
its bugle calls played on a spittle trap!

457
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:19,728
Still, we can't go into
dinner without a mess call.

458
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:24,597
- Muscles!
- Sir.

459
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:26,607
Put on that record "Bugle
Calls of the British Army."

460
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:29,473
- It's got the mess call on that.
- There's a lot of others, sir.

461
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,513
- "Last Post" and- -
Never mind. Turn it on.

462
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,514
Sir.

463
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:39,346
- My handbag.
- There.

464
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:44,290
Marvelous, isn't it? The privates
get the crumpet. The officers get it.

465
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,294
Look what we get.

466
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:52,893
<i>Oh, I don't know. She's
looking better every minute.</i>

467
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,240
Nothing to be ashamed of, Muscles.

468
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:01,776
Turn it up so people can hear it.

469
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,409
- Sergeant Major, take these men
to the guard room. - Sir!

470
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:46,750
Keep them under double guard. Tomorrow
they'll be taken to Batasi and charged.

471
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:49,347
- Charged with what, Mr. Boniface?
- Treason...

472
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,359
against the new people's government.

473
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:53,452
Sergeant.

474
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,814
Everybody got a little
something in their glass?

475
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,189
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.

476
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,162
Well, this is a very
special occasion, you know.

477
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:13,224
Still!

478
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,203
Sit down.

479
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:23,310
What's going on out
there, Sergeant Major?

480
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:28,141
Night firing exercise
on the range, ma'am.

481
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:33,019
Well, uh, as I was saying...

482
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:36,285
this is a very special occasion.

483
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:40,556
This is the first time that we've had
the company of ladies in the mess...

484
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:42,563
on the occasion of
Her Majesty's birthday.

485
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:55,675
Yes, well, we mustn't let the talking
interfere with the eating, as they say.

486
00:37:55,744 --> 00:37:59,544
But, um, before we get down to it...

487
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:02,277
as president of this mess...

488
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:05,809
it falls to me to have the
honor to propose the loyal toast.

489
00:38:05,888 --> 00:38:08,755
Therefore, if your
glasses are charged...

490
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,384
uh, perhaps you'd all
care to be up standing.

491
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,858
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Her Maj-</i>

492
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:34,415
- Do what you can for him, Ben.
- Right.

493
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,350
- Give him a hand, Muscles.
Schoolie, first-aid kit. - Sir.

494
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,723
Abou, you and your boys
out of sight. Stay there.

495
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:45,521
- Come along then. Come along.
- Sir.

496
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:49,963
- Digger. Gentle with him, lads.
- Sir?

497
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:52,398
- See if it's clear out the back.
- Can I help, Sergeant Major?

498
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:54,458
- I've had training.
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much.

499
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:58,199
- Dodger, those lights in there.
- Sir.

500
00:38:58,273 --> 00:39:00,207
- Wilkes?
- Sir?

501
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,368
Get your rifle.

502
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:05,345
- Got a pair of glasses in my kit bag.
- Right. Get 'em.

503
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,576
Good. Follow me.

504
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:22,062
Hmm.

505
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:27,699
I can't recognize the bastards.

506
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,901
<i>Going back the way it came.
Probably to Company H. Q.</i>

507
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:42,808
All right, Wilkes, you stay out here.

508
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:44,819
If you see anything moving, yell.

509
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:48,550
You don't have to be polite and
wait for me to stop speaking, yell.

510
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:51,792
Right, sir.

511
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,556
- Dodger, your truck still out in the back?
- Yes, sir.

512
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,157
Get away from that window. Get
it started as quiet as you can.

513
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:00,258
- What's going on out there, sir?
- Did you spot anything, sir?

514
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:02,269
- See anything out in the back, Digger?
- No, sir, nothing.

515
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:04,271
- Hello?
- He's pretty rough.

516
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,273
- Hello. Say who did it?
- Not a dicky bird.

517
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:08,275
Still unconscious.

518
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:17,413
Mutiny, Ben.

519
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:19,420
It's like the Loch Ness Monster.

520
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:21,718
Heard of it, but never
actually ran across it.

521
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,815
What are you going to do, sir?

522
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:30,056
Well, before I do anything, we're
gonna get a hold of some weapons.

523
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:32,225
How are we going to do that?

524
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,735
Drive up to the arms store and draw 'em.

525
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:36,737
- Just like that?
- Just like that. Fluff it out.

526
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,830
Truck started up, sir, but I
don't understand what you want-

527
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:40,898
You don't have to
understand. You have to drive.

528
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:43,308
<i>- How are we for spud bags, Ben?
- Plenty in the storeroom.</i>

529
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:46,006
Take 'em out to the sand bunker and get
'em filled. Schoolie will give you a hand.

530
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,845
Private Wilkes! Oh, Ben, before
you go, I'll need your keys.

531
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,442
Muscles, Digger, you're coming with me.

532
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,184
Now then, lad, keep your eyes
skinned. You're on your own for a bit.

533
00:40:57,526 --> 00:41:00,188
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you know how to use that thing.

534
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:03,993
Well, I know how to use it, but I've
never yet fired one in anger, as they say.

535
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,395
God, what an army.

536
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:09,403
- You're with me, lads.
- Sir.

537
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,407
Oh, get it in the sack. We're
not building sand castles.

538
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:16,808
Come on.

539
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:20,143
Come on. Get a move on. We'll be
here all bloody night with you.

540
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,543
Oh, give us that before
you rupture yourself.

541
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:26,553
I'll shovel and you grunt.

542
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:50,210
Let's slow down, Dodger.

543
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,816
Come on then, get out of the
way. You've seen my face before.

544
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,954
<i>- Lieutenant Boniface said
no- - Come on. Come on!</i>

545
00:42:10,232 --> 00:42:11,893
Right.

546
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,231
Hmm, that was Corporal Ntimba.

547
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:20,740
Never make a sergeant
- no initiative.

548
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:46,625
Halt! Who goes there?

549
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,999
Stay! Open up, Digger.

550
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:51,062
Take your thumb off
the bolt, PrivateJuma.

551
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:54,165
How many times have I told
you? Right, stand at ease, lad.

552
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:57,109
You cannot go in there, sir.
Lt. Boniface gave me orders.

553
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,170
Here. Let's have a look at that.

554
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:02,216
- How's- - It doesn't look clean
to me. Did you oil this bolt?

555
00:43:06,354 --> 00:43:08,413
You'll have to do
better than that, Juma.

556
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:15,653
Corporal Ntimba!

557
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:22,231
Rifles, Digger. Three of
them. Muscles, see to the ammo.

558
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:25,171
- Done.
- Keys?

559
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,074
- Here you go, Sterlings.
- Digger, magazines.

560
00:43:29,144 --> 00:43:31,237
Dodger.

561
00:43:33,582 --> 00:43:35,573
Give me one.

562
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:05,636
<i>Quiet a minute.</i>

563
00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:10,946
Right. You two carry on.
And lock up after you.

564
00:44:36,678 --> 00:44:38,179
<i>Watch your back.</i>

565
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:38,736
<i>Watch your back.</i>

566
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:45,381
<i>Corporal Ntimba, come any closer
you get brambles up your pipe.</i>

567
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:50,453
Right, lads. Let's get back.

568
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:13,412
Oh, then.

569
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:19,249
The old man missed the Siege
ofTobruk. That's his trouble.

570
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,488
Don't hang around
doing nothing. Get those

571
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,757
bags and start setting
up some firing posts.

572
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:27,988
This isn't a holiday camp, you
know. Right, get a wiggle on.

573
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:30,155
Come on. Come on.

574
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:35,431
<i>Here they are.</i>

575
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:40,131
- Stay with him, will you, Miss Eriksson?
- Yes, of course.

576
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,901
- Don't strain yourself.
- Oh, so you're back.

577
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:47,971
Get these guns cleaned, lads.
Dodger, I want that one first.

578
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:50,175
- Muscles, get the grenades
out of the truck. - Sir.

579
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:52,446
Well, ma'am, how's Captain Abraham?

580
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:55,750
I demand to know what's going
on? What exactly are you doing?

581
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:59,486
Well, at this precise moment, ma'am,
I'm charging an S. M. G. magazine.

582
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,393
Has it occurred to you that the rebels,
or whatever you choose to call them...

583
00:46:02,463 --> 00:46:05,193
were leaving us alone
because we were unarmed?

584
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:08,235
That what you are doing can
only provoke more bloodshed.

585
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,236
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

586
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:13,330
I'm surprised at you, ma'am. I thought
you believed in all men being equal.

587
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:16,399
- Of course I do. That's exactly the point.
- Dodger!

588
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:19,105
Well, they had guns and we didn't.

589
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,147
- That wasn't very equal, was it?
- Sir?

590
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:24,275
Private Wilkes? Put the safety
catch on next time, Dodger.

591
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,751
- Know what this is?
- Yes, sir. It's a Sterling S. M. G.

592
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,845
- I've even fired one.
- Well, that doesn't make you unique.

593
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:31,288
Everyone in this room's fired one,
except Miss Barker-Wise, of course.

594
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,691
- Take it and get back on guard. - There
must be some way to stop this madness.

595
00:46:34,762 --> 00:46:37,060
Why don't you at least make an
attempt to contact the other side.

596
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:39,065
I've already done that, ma'am.

597
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:41,067
- You have?
- Give me another box of nine millimeter.

598
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:43,262
- Why didn't you tell me? What happened?
- What's the matter with that?

599
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:46,773
- This barrel's in a hell of a state, sir.
- Let's have a look.

600
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,332
- Give it another pull through and take a
chance. - Will you tell me what happened?

601
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:54,507
Nothing much, ma'am. We ran into Lt.
Boniface's party down at the ammo dump.

602
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,572
Boni? Is he in charge?

603
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,211
Rust. I'll have somebody on a
fizzle when this lot's over. Dodger!

604
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:02,619
Is Lt. Boniface in charge?

605
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,624
Well, he gave me that
impression, ma'am, yes.

606
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:08,025
- Thank God. Thank God.
- I wouldn't be too hasty about doing that.

607
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:11,360
Let me go and talk to him. He's
a civilized and cultured man.

608
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:13,457
He'll listen to me. Please
arrange the transport.

609
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:15,764
You'll be safer here
for the moment, ma'am.

610
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:20,239
Safer? In the middle of this
gunpowder plot you're organizing?

611
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:23,003
- Very well, I'll walk.
- Muscles, stand by the door.

612
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:29,204
Do you intend to keep me here by force?

613
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:35,855
Now listen to me, ma'am.

614
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:38,084
You're not in Parliament now.

615
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:41,059
This isn't England. And I know
more about these people than you do.

616
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:43,193
And don't run away with
the idea I've got a down

617
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,258
on them because their
skin isn't the same color.

618
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:47,857
Their best is as good as our best.

619
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:50,597
But their bad's as rough as
ours, and that's pretty rough.

620
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:54,107
Now, I'm responsible for your
safety while you're in this mess...

621
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:56,074
so while you're here,
you'll obey my orders!

622
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,240
- And if you don't like it, you'll have
to lump it. - This is intolerable.

623
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:04,648
I agree, ma'am. But don't blame me.

624
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,743
Blame your harmless little Africans.

625
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,914
Blame them? Who put guns into their
hands? Who taught them to shoot? You.

626
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,924
And if it wasn't for people like us...

627
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:14,256
you wouldn't be able to walk around,
spouting your smarmy, silly...

628
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:17,229
bloody, half-baked ideas!

629
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:21,461
That remark, Sergeant Major,
may well cost you your rank.

630
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:24,197
Stay with her, Muscles, until she quiets
down. See she doesn't leave the mess.

631
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:27,399
- Sir.
- Ooh, what a right old cow.

632
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:30,204
No wonder the officers
dumped her onto us.

633
00:48:30,277 --> 00:48:35,044
All those nurses up there, I bet they
don't mind being cooped up for a year.

634
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:37,379
As long as somebody can knit.

635
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:42,144
I must admit, the old bag's got guts.

636
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:44,554
I only hope to God she doesn't
get to be prime minister.

637
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,934
- Russell.
- Colonel Deal.

638
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:59,803
Glad you've arrived. Sir
Williams waiting to see you.

639
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:02,865
- You're in for a long party tonight.
- I'm afraid so.

640
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,434
A change in government can
affect an awful lot of people.

641
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:08,913
- Is it as close as that?
- Yes, I think so.

642
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:18,982
All right. Keep me informed.

643
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:21,425
- Hello, John.
- Sir William.

644
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:22,723
- Tony.
- Hello, sir.

645
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,094
- You made good time.
- Well, it sounded serious.

646
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:29,397
Yes, it is. Things have happened
fast since I spoke to you. Whiskey?

647
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,836
- Oh, fine.
- Thank you, sir.

648
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:35,568
To put it mildly, the
position is, well, delicate.

649
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:38,907
I've just heard the buzz that the
president is on his way out of the country.

650
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,970
Taking his wives with him.

651
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:43,539
That'll leave the rebels a clear field.

652
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:46,245
I think we should get out of
the habit of calling them rebels.

653
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,254
By the morning, they may
well be the government.

654
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,654
That's fantastic. In less than 36 hours.

655
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,692
Yes, well, no doubt it
was well prepared at first.

656
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:55,125
HarryJobila has saw to that.

657
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:58,187
<i>Seems to be no stopping him now.</i>

658
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:00,597
Oh, excuse me.

659
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,897
Yes?

660
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,063
When did you hear this?

661
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:08,130
All right. Ring me back.

662
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:11,268
The Afro-Britannia mines.

663
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,370
The new boys have just taken over.

664
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:18,111
You know what that means?
The wealth of this country.

665
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:21,951
- HarryJobila is no fool.
- It doesn't make sense.

666
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,752
Five years in jail and within
six months of coming out...

667
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,191
he's on his way to
the president's palace.

668
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:30,389
He spent that six months here as a
gardener. Got to know him pretty well.

669
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:33,991
Lousy gardener. I hope he'll
make a better president.

670
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,627
Anyway, going to jail is considered
a shortcut to power these days.

671
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:39,433
I hope it never happens in the army.

672
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:41,633
<i>Come in.</i>

673
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,973
Radio message from the airfield,
sir. Jobila's men are in control.

674
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,309
- Any casualties?
- No, sir.

675
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,372
- Good.
- Get on to the camp, Tony.

676
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:51,747
- Is that all right, sir?
- Yes, yes, use this one.

677
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:55,447
I want to talk to Captain Abraham.

678
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:58,423
Get me Batasi Camp, please.

679
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:01,791
What's gonna happen?
In the future, I mean.

680
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:04,194
I should think that once
the position is stabilized...

681
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:06,232
they'll want us to carry on as usual.

682
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,360
And Jobila will need all the
support and advice he can get...

683
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:12,599
if he's gonna fulfill some
of those promises he's made.

684
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:16,234
The thing to do is to hang on. And
above all, keep our noses clean.

685
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,211
<i>Excuse me, sir. There's something
wrong with the line to the camp.</i>

686
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:21,213
They can't make contact.

687
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,977
Give me that.

688
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:10,753
Halt! Who goes there?

689
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:14,164
Squad, halt!

690
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,361
Sergeant Major?

691
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:21,733
Armed party, a dozen men.

692
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,333
Who goes there?

693
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,936
Lieutenant Boniface.

694
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,509
Advance, sir, unarmed,
and be recognized.

695
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,755
You two, come with me.

696
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:39,314
- Muscles?
- Sir?

697
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:41,623
Go back and keep your
eyes on Miss Barker-Wise.

698
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:43,629
See she doesn't come in
until these people are gone.

699
00:52:43,697 --> 00:52:46,029
- Understand?
- Sir.

700
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,903
Good evening, Sergeant Major.

701
00:52:52,973 --> 00:52:55,237
I hope this call isn't too inconvenient.

702
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:58,945
It's a pleasure, sir.

703
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,946
Let us hope it will remain one.

704
00:53:02,816 --> 00:53:04,807
Indeed, sir.

705
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:11,457
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.

706
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,455
Now, sir.

707
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:21,126
Sergeant Major, I've
come to inform you...

708
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:24,796
that I've taken over command of
the battalion from Captain Abraham.

709
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:27,863
You'll therefore regard me
as your commanding officer.

710
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:33,368
I've only got one C. O.,
sir, that's Colonel Deal.

711
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:36,746
As far as I'm concerned, Captain Abraham
is in temporary command of the battalion.

712
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:39,843
As far as I'm concerned,
Captain Abraham is a traitor.

713
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,115
Anyway, he's dead.

714
00:53:42,189 --> 00:53:44,817
I'll believe that when I
see the casualty return.

715
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:47,985
In the meantime, sir, will you
please remove your headdress...

716
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:50,427
while in the sergeants' mess and
request your escort to do the same?

717
00:53:50,497 --> 00:53:53,489
Leave them on.

718
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:57,594
Sergeant Major, I'm not interested
in points of etiquette at the moment.

719
00:53:57,671 --> 00:53:59,764
Mr. Boniface...

720
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,105
I've been a member of this
mess for 23 years, sir.

721
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:06,737
In all that time, I've never seen
anybody-man, woman or child...

722
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:09,805
sergeant or field
marshal or prime minister-

723
00:54:09,883 --> 00:54:12,443
walk into this mess with
his hat upon his head!

724
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:17,347
I do not see you now, sir.

725
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:21,527
All right.

726
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,529
If it worries you.

727
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,506
Now, sir, can I be of service?

728
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,243
I wish you'd understand,
Sergeant Major...

729
00:54:41,314 --> 00:54:44,545
I will give you protection
if you cooperate with me.

730
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:47,086
Your future in my country is
very limited, you must appreciate.

731
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:51,716
Limited, did you say, sir?
That's a very elastic word.

732
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:54,420
No doubt you'll be sent back to
your own country in due course.

733
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:57,895
At this very moment, the new
president is considering the matter.

734
00:54:57,964 --> 00:55:01,092
And where do you come in, Mr.
Boniface? You as a loyal officer.

735
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:03,830
- So, where do you come in?
- Loyal to whom?

736
00:55:03,904 --> 00:55:06,065
To the corrupt lackeys your
government left to lead us...

737
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,869
when they granted us our
so-called independence?

738
00:55:10,744 --> 00:55:14,510
So you consider that soldiers
should not be revolutionaries.

739
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:17,209
Your Cromwell was a soldier, wasn't he?

740
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:19,582
Did he not grab Ireland, Sergeant Major?

741
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,522
Well, you know, sir, it
was only for their own good.

742
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:27,651
The micks have always been
obstinate, sir. Very obstinate.

743
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:31,096
As for myself, I'm a soldier.

744
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:34,998
- I don't understand politics. - Well,
I do understand them, Sergeant Major.

745
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:38,367
And for my political education, I'm
obliged to one of your compatriots...

746
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:40,633
Miss Barker-Wise.

747
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:42,800
However, I did not come
here to discuss politics.

748
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:45,709
I've come to tell you all
that you must remain here...

749
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:48,873
until I receive further
instructions from the new government.

750
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:53,682
My men will surround the mess and they
will shoot anyone who tries to leave.

751
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:59,555
In the meantime, I am taking possession of
the camp in the name of the new republic.

752
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:03,824
Sergeant Major, you will deliver
to me all your arms and ammunition.

753
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:08,334
<i>And I will be responsible for
your safety. Is that understood?</i>

754
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:12,337
Also, I shall withdraw your servants
who will be required to carry arms.

755
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:14,839
Corporal Abou. Private Daniel.

756
00:56:22,683 --> 00:56:25,777
You will collect all the mess silver...

757
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:29,653
<i>and your kit, and report
to me in the orderly room.</i>

758
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:36,823
Do you hear me?

759
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:40,990
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

760
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,526
Now, Sergeant Major...

761
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:18,765
if you will leave all
your weapons on the

762
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:21,132
veranda, I will send a
squad to collect them.

763
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:25,167
<i>- I will inform you of any later
developments. - Just one moment, sir.!</i>

764
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:27,179
<i>If you please.</i>

765
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,238
Well?

766
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:34,547
Now you listen to me, Mr. Boniface.

767
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:38,991
I'm a professional soldier, born across
the road from Wellington Barracks.

768
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:41,994
I enlisted when I was 17.
By the time I was 24...

769
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:45,657
I was a sergeant serving on
the northwest frontier of India!

770
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:49,260
<i>Sometimes, Mr. Boniface, I'd lay awake
in my tent with a hurricane lamp...</i>

771
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:51,270
<i>sometimes in the middle of a blizzard...</i>

772
00:57:51,338 --> 00:57:54,603
reading about the exploits
of other British soldiers.

773
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:59,203
Sometimes I'd be lying there in my
freezing cold tent actually sweating.

774
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:03,739
Beads of sweat pouring down my
face from a battle 200 years old!

775
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:07,048
And later on I had a little active
service of my own to take notice of.

776
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:10,750
Now, what I'm coming to, sir, is this-

777
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,725
All this experience of warfare,
imaginary and otherwise...

778
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:17,059
gives me a certain amount of experience
to face this misunderstanding...

779
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:20,396
with a certain amount of sangfroid!

780
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,799
It's a fly on the wall,
sir, a fight with a feather!

781
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,930
- I refuse to- - As far as
the weapons are concerned...

782
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:31,638
I was ordered by my C. O. to
keep them to swat flies with.

783
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:36,274
And until I get further instructions,
I intend to hang on to them.

784
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:40,252
- Now look here, sir- -
Will you please listen to me!

785
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:45,087
You seem to have gained control of this
battalion by an act of mutiny. Very well.

786
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:49,596
You're entitled to the mess servants
because they're your countrymen, not mine.

787
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:52,427
You're entitled to the mess property...

788
00:58:52,499 --> 00:58:55,957
because it stands on your soil.

789
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,639
But if you think for one moment that I'm

790
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,633
gonna hand over the
lives of these people...

791
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:05,736
to the custody of a half-cooked,
jumped-up, sad, little...

792
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,509
blackboard warrior like yourself...

793
00:59:08,582 --> 00:59:11,073
you're very much mistaken!

794
00:59:11,151 --> 00:59:14,518
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

795
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:19,789
Absolutely clear, Sergeant Major.

796
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:31,765
I always knew that one would
turn out to be a savvy boy.

797
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,171
<i>Squad, about face.!</i>

798
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:36,539
That's fixed him for a bit.

799
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:39,738
Provided the servants don't
tell him we've got Abraham.

800
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:44,250
Abou won't. Abou's the
same tribe as Abraham.

801
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,980
Boniface comes from the coast.

802
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:49,048
Abou's people look on all the coastal

803
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:51,582
tribes as several grades
lower than bush rat.

804
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:53,785
Let's hope you're right.

805
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:57,686
Sergeant Major, what
right has this man...

806
00:59:57,765 --> 01:00:00,791
to keep me confined to that room?

807
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:02,802
My authority, ma'am.

808
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,804
Am I under arrest then?

809
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:07,670
Not yet, ma'am, not yet.

810
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:12,007
Sergeant Major, I can end this
ridiculous nonsense in five minutes...

811
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,570
and get Captain Abraham to hospital.

812
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:18,516
I implore you, please
send me to Boniface.

813
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:21,884
No, ma'am, and for a very good reason.

814
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,822
It'd be a waste of time.
He's already been to see us.

815
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:29,158
- That boy? You mean he's been here?
- He left a few moments ago.

816
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:33,029
He wanted to tell me that he'd seized
control of the battalion by mutiny.

817
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,161
And if we'd all be good little boys and
girls, he'd see we didn't come to any harm.

818
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:39,535
I sent him off with a flea in his ear.

819
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:42,973
You did what, you bloody fool?
Why didn't you let me talk to him?

820
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:45,841
I know Boniface like my own son.

821
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:48,404
- Did you tell him about Captain Abraham?
- I did not.

822
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,815
- Why? - If you'll excuse me, I've
gotta get on with battalion orders.

823
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:55,548
- If he doesn't get to doctor, he'll die.
- We've all gotta die sometime.

824
01:00:55,622 --> 01:00:58,989
If I handed him over to your pal
Boniface, he wouldn't stand a hope in hell.

825
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:02,222
Nonsense. He's a very humane man.
His principles are very sound.

826
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:06,392
- And they've all got a bullet up the
spout. - Let me tell you this.

827
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:10,402
Your stupidity is placing
all our lives in danger.

828
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:12,631
When you talk of principles
with a bullet up the spout...

829
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:15,197
that's a perfect example
of your own mentality.

830
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:19,473
You're a - a living gun. They've
turned you into a human rifle.

831
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:21,419
They've taken away your personality,

832
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,812
Sergeant Major, bit by
bit down the years...

833
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:26,876
and replaced it with a
sort of military stuffing.

834
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:29,514
"Left, right, about
turn, obey, fight, kill!"

835
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,253
- Don't be impertinent, ma'am!
- That's all you know!

836
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:36,421
<i>You're an instrument, ready primed
to put to someone's shoulder.!</i>

837
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:41,399
<i>- A royal trigger in waiting. - Just you
be careful, ma'am, that I don't go off.</i>

838
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:43,436
What's your life?

839
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:47,769
A dull routine round of boot
licking, waiting for a war.

840
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:51,607
The only way you'll ever fulfill
yourself is to die in action!

841
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:02,083
What are you huddling about there
for like a brood of wet hens?

842
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:04,089
Wilkes, get back on guard!

843
01:02:04,157 --> 01:02:06,751
Schoolie, get that ammo stored away.

844
01:02:06,827 --> 01:02:09,318
Miss Eriksson.

845
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:11,990
- Do you cook?
- Oh, yes.

846
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:14,966
I expect the dinner is spoiled by
now, but perhaps you do what you can.

847
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:17,162
- Yes, sir.
- Muscles! Digger!

848
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:21,908
Get that table tidied up.
It's the queen's birthday.

849
01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:24,535
And even if we have to have
paraffin and brick dust sandwiches...

850
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:26,772
we're gonna celebrate it...

851
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:30,850
with or without our distinguished guest.

852
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:35,783
Dodger, don't stand there
like a spare wig at a wedding!

853
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:40,391
<i>- Get me a drink.
- Yes, sir.</i>

854
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:49,887
What the hell do you think you're doing?

855
01:03:49,963 --> 01:03:54,423
Now just do what you're told and
you'll have nothing to worry about.

856
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:56,969
Throw down your revolvers, both of you!

857
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:59,972
Oh, no. By what authority?

858
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,474
The authority of the new government.

859
01:04:04,044 --> 01:04:07,013
Now you listen to me.

860
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,379
This revolver is staying where it is...

861
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,614
until I see some signed
order from a legal member...

862
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:16,781
of your government.

863
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:26,662
All right, Colonel. Now get moving.

864
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:35,501
Meanwhile, you might get
your men to change that wheel.

865
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,203
<i>- Private Wilkes!
- Sir?</i>

866
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:09,573
You better hear this. I've drawn up guard
detail and battalion orders for tomorrow.

867
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:11,736
Right. Now, about the
sleeping arrangements.

868
01:05:11,812 --> 01:05:14,110
Miss Eriksson will go
in your room, Dodger.

869
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:16,115
You go in with Digger.

870
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:19,152
First time I get a bird in
my room, I'm posted absent.

871
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:22,120
Ben, Miss Barker-Wise will
be in your little nest.

872
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:24,214
- You can go in with Muscles.
- That's a happy release.

873
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:27,158
Schoolie, you stand
fast, and I'll be in here.

874
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:30,492
Now, you'll all sleep fully
clothed, and that includes boots.

875
01:05:30,564 --> 01:05:33,226
If anything does happen, I don't want
anybody to get a burst up the backside...

876
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,235
when you're bending down
looking for your boots.

877
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:38,567
Reveille at the usual time
- 0600 hours.

878
01:05:38,638 --> 01:05:42,165
The last man on guard can have a
nice long lay till half past. Right.

879
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:45,575
Ben, as soon as you've changed
over your kit, you relieve Wilkes.

880
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:47,636
Carry on.

881
01:05:49,382 --> 01:05:51,873
- Come on, darling. Let's go to kip.
- Get out of here!

882
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:53,943
- Got a light?
- Yes, of course.

883
01:06:57,984 --> 01:07:01,681
I suppose you realize this is
strictly against Queen's regulations.

884
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:34,450
I'd better be getting back in.

885
01:07:37,624 --> 01:07:39,558
Good night.

886
01:07:39,626 --> 01:07:41,617
Um-

887
01:07:43,263 --> 01:07:46,323
You know what you wanna do if
it gets too hot in your bedroom?

888
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:48,424
No. What?

889
01:07:50,971 --> 01:07:54,202
Just-Just leave your window open.

890
01:08:16,863 --> 01:08:20,799
All right, all right,
Wilkes. I'm relieving you.

891
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:24,496
I put opalescence in the rations's
door, so you better go get some kip.

892
01:08:24,571 --> 01:08:27,972
Well, I - I think I'll just take a
stroll before I turn in.

893
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:31,340
Take a stroll? You've been
strolling for two hours.

894
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:34,141
What's the matter with you?

895
01:08:34,214 --> 01:08:36,148
- Insomnia.
- What?

896
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:39,879
- Chronic insomnia.
- Wait. You wanna see a quack about that.

897
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:42,581
You might get rings under your eyes.

898
01:08:42,656 --> 01:08:48,884
Good night.

899
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:04,572
You crafty basket weaver.

900
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:09,538
Who is it?

901
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:14,548
It's all right. It's only
your blind Uncle Charlie.

902
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:16,885
- Hello, Wilkie.
- Hello.

903
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:39,041
Now wait a minute.

904
01:10:44,677 --> 01:10:46,668
- Schoolie.
- Huh?

905
01:10:47,881 --> 01:10:50,315
All quiet, Schoolie?

906
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:52,544
Quiet as the proverbial grave, sir.

907
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:56,180
Yes. Never mind the proverbs. I
didn't get my rank on a proverb.

908
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,054
- No, sir. - Unless it's
"God helps them that help themselves."

909
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,525
Miss Barker-Wise?

910
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,175
Will you please tell these
men to take their hands off me?

911
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,783
You must forgive them. I gave
orders no one was to leave the mess.

912
01:11:35,861 --> 01:11:39,388
- Please sit down.
- Thank you, Boni.

913
01:11:39,464 --> 01:11:41,455
I had to come and see you.

914
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:44,297
- What about, ma'am?
- Captain Abraham.

915
01:11:46,071 --> 01:11:50,167
- Captain Abraham? - He arrived at
the mess last night. He'd been wounded.

916
01:11:50,242 --> 01:11:52,767
Perhaps it was an
accident. I don't know.

917
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:57,077
But he must have immediate
medical attention.

918
01:11:57,149 --> 01:12:00,414
That's no problem. I'll see
that he's removed immediately.

919
01:12:09,528 --> 01:12:12,292
There. That's settled.

920
01:12:12,364 --> 01:12:17,199
Thank you, Boni. I knew it was only
a matter of common sense and reason.

921
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:19,363
If you'll give me an
escort, I'll go see that

922
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:21,365
Captain Abraham is
ready for the ambulance.

923
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,035
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I must ask you to stay here.

924
01:12:28,347 --> 01:12:30,713
I don't understand.

925
01:12:30,782 --> 01:12:33,945
<i>Squad, halt.!</i>

926
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,885
Is that how you're gonna
fetch Captain Abraham?

927
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:44,326
- If necessary.
- What's gonna happen to him?

928
01:12:44,396 --> 01:12:47,524
He'll be charged with treason. If
he's found guilty, he'll be shot.

929
01:12:47,599 --> 01:12:51,467
- But what has he done? - He's known to
have opposed the National Unity Party.

930
01:12:51,536 --> 01:12:53,527
Is that all?

931
01:12:54,706 --> 01:12:56,640
I forgot you're a member of Parliament.

932
01:12:56,708 --> 01:13:00,144
We do things a little differently
here. Perhaps we're in more of a hurry.

933
01:13:00,212 --> 01:13:02,942
But, Boni, I-

934
01:13:03,015 --> 01:13:06,007
I don't understand. You-

935
01:13:06,084 --> 01:13:10,248
When you were in England,
you were... so different.

936
01:13:10,322 --> 01:13:13,086
I was one of your African
mascots then, wasn't I?

937
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:17,185
Sitting at your feet, listening to
you talk. My God, how you talked!

938
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:20,493
No one talks better than the
British. They drug you with talk.

939
01:13:20,565 --> 01:13:23,534
When you wake up, they still
have their heel on your neck.

940
01:13:23,602 --> 01:13:26,503
- Now, if you'll
excuse me. - But, Boni-

941
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,174
Now you listen to me, the lot of you.

942
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:34,303
Owing to a gross piece of negligence,
Barker-Wise has escaped from the mess.

943
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:36,313
I don't blame one man
any more than the rest.

944
01:13:36,381 --> 01:13:39,612
You've all been walking around
in your sleep, so watch it!

945
01:13:39,685 --> 01:13:42,813
Keep your eyes rolling and your minds
ticking! Be sure to check your guns.

946
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:44,822
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

947
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,218
Very well. Dismissed.
Now, what do you want?

948
01:13:49,294 --> 01:13:53,128
Mr. Boniface is here,
sir, with an armed party.

949
01:13:57,703 --> 01:13:59,967
He's coming in on his jack.

950
01:14:01,573 --> 01:14:04,269
Don't hang around the windows!
Disperse yourselves round the room!

951
01:14:04,343 --> 01:14:06,334
Digger, Muscles, on the other side.

952
01:14:11,516 --> 01:14:13,643
Good morning, gentlemen.

953
01:14:24,563 --> 01:14:28,090
<i>Sergeant Major, I'll come quickly
to the purpose of this visit.</i>

954
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:29,930
I understand from my
friend, Miss Barker-Wise,

955
01:14:29,931 --> 01:14:31,431
that she's been kept here under duress.

956
01:14:31,503 --> 01:14:34,199
For her own safety, sir.

957
01:14:34,272 --> 01:14:37,264
I'd be obliged if you'd have
her restored to my custody.

958
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:40,505
<i>- She insisted on returning
to Batasi, Sergeant Major.</i>

959
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:48,646
There is something more
important for us to discuss.

960
01:14:51,023 --> 01:14:55,050
You have here a wounded
officer, Captain Abraham. Not so?

961
01:14:55,127 --> 01:14:58,392
Miss Barker-Wise informs
me that this is so.

962
01:14:58,463 --> 01:15:03,662
- Well, she must be mistaken. - Women of
her intelligence do not make such mistakes!

963
01:15:03,735 --> 01:15:06,533
I understand that Captain Abraham is
badly in need of medical treatment.

964
01:15:06,605 --> 01:15:08,698
If you'll hand him over
to my custody, I'll see-

965
01:15:14,446 --> 01:15:18,507
- There is no officer of that name here.
- Now don't waste my time!

966
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,517
I insist that you hand
over Captain Abraham!

967
01:15:20,585 --> 01:15:23,452
<i>He's required to answer for
crimes against the new republic.!</i>

968
01:15:23,522 --> 01:15:25,786
<i>That's his hardship, not mine.</i>

969
01:15:25,857 --> 01:15:27,791
<i>You are being very stupid.!</i>

970
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:30,157
<i>The affair of Captain Abraham
is the affair of government.</i>

971
01:15:30,228 --> 01:15:32,253
<i>You will hand him over at once.!</i>

972
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:34,491
Mr. Boniface...

973
01:15:34,566 --> 01:15:37,262
suppose for the sake of argument
Captain Abraham was wounded...

974
01:15:37,335 --> 01:15:39,462
and had come to me for protection.

975
01:15:39,538 --> 01:15:41,563
In that case, sir...

976
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,768
I wouldn't be at liberty to hand him
over without an order from Colonel Deal!

977
01:15:44,843 --> 01:15:49,837
You will appreciate that it is I who
give the orders, and you who will obey!

978
01:15:49,915 --> 01:15:52,645
For the first time in the history
of my country, Sergeant Major...

979
01:15:52,717 --> 01:15:55,117
it is the African who is putting
the shell into the breech...

980
01:15:55,187 --> 01:15:57,951
and giving the order to fire!

981
01:15:58,023 --> 01:16:00,218
Really, Mr. Boniface?

982
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:02,283
I don't think I've ever
come across a misfit...

983
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,794
of your size and quality before.

984
01:16:04,863 --> 01:16:07,957
You missed your vocation.
You ought to be in Hyde Park!

985
01:16:08,033 --> 01:16:12,663
If you do happen to go putting
a shell into the breech, sir...

986
01:16:12,737 --> 01:16:15,706
I sincerely hope you'll remember
to put the sharp end to the front.

987
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:22,613
You are in great danger, all of you!

988
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:25,013
You have already refused
to give up your weapons...

989
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:29,019
now you refuse to hand over an
officer who's wanted for treason.

990
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:31,681
Sergeant Major, I will give
you an hour to change your mind.

991
01:16:31,756 --> 01:16:34,589
If you haven't delivered Captain
Abraham into my charge by that time...

992
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:38,993
I will destroy the sergeants'
mess and everyone in it!

993
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:45,894
One hour, Sergeant Major.

994
01:16:52,777 --> 01:16:56,406
<i>Squad, about face.!</i>

995
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,682
Do we get any danger
money for this caper?

996
01:17:04,756 --> 01:17:09,216
- No. He's probably bluffing.
- Bluffing like bloody hell he was!

997
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:12,991
They can't do this. It's
not in Queen's regulations.

998
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:15,692
It's there somewhere, boy. They've
got everything taped in there.

999
01:17:17,369 --> 01:17:20,133
We oughta let him have Abraham on
a written guarantee of safe conduct.

1000
01:17:20,205 --> 01:17:23,641
- Then we're in the clear. - Safe conduct?
How long do you think that'd last?

1001
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,676
It's no skin off our nose.

1002
01:17:25,744 --> 01:17:28,941
We could always say they broke their
promise. It's no concern of ours.

1003
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:31,744
No concern of ours.

1004
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:35,013
You stupid-

1005
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:38,852
Pitch a man into the arms of a firing
squad and you say it's no concern of ours.

1006
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:42,087
You're bloody keen, aren't you?
What's he ever done for you?

1007
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,185
- I'll tell you what he did for me!
- Men!

1008
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,333
Look. I had a skinful one night.

1009
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:58,501
Around 4:00 in the morning, I felt
somebody shake me while I was sleeping.

1010
01:17:58,577 --> 01:18:01,512
It was Abraham. You know
what he said? I'll tell you.

1011
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,014
He said, "Tell the sergeant
I just had a strange dream.

1012
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:06,676
A dream that I went to the arms store
and helped myself to 100,000 rifles."

1013
01:18:06,751 --> 01:18:08,981
I didn't need any second telling.

1014
01:18:09,054 --> 01:18:11,454
I got up and bolted round the armory
and found I'd forgot to lock it.

1015
01:18:11,523 --> 01:18:13,063
If it was anyone but Abraham on duty, I

1016
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:14,959
would have got
court-martialed for negligence.

1017
01:18:15,026 --> 01:18:19,429
You tell me one European officer that
wouldn't have stuck it on his report.

1018
01:18:19,497 --> 01:18:21,556
<i>Thank you, Sergeant.</i>

1019
01:18:23,868 --> 01:18:26,962
Are you all right, sir? You
shouldn't be walking about.

1020
01:18:27,038 --> 01:18:29,632
I'm all right.

1021
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,699
Just-

1022
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:35,836
I'm sorry, sir.

1023
01:18:37,215 --> 01:18:39,479
I can't allow you to leave the mess.

1024
01:18:39,551 --> 01:18:42,145
You cannot prevent it, Sergeant Major.

1025
01:18:46,658 --> 01:18:48,626
Don't you see that while I remain...

1026
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:51,560
I'm involving you in my own affairs?

1027
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:55,623
- Is that good ethics? - I'm not
interested in good ethics or bad ethics.

1028
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,828
Or politics, I trust.

1029
01:18:58,903 --> 01:19:01,599
Well, you're lucky.

1030
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:05,600
Thank you for your hospitality.

1031
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:09,270
Ben!

1032
01:19:12,684 --> 01:19:14,675
Before you go, sir.

1033
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:19,852
Yes, Sergeant Major? Wha-What is it?

1034
01:19:19,924 --> 01:19:23,257
I've given you the
protection of this mess, sir.

1035
01:19:23,328 --> 01:19:25,762
If you insist on going
against my advice...

1036
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:29,163
would you please sign a chit
to say you do so willingly?

1037
01:19:30,602 --> 01:19:33,332
All right.

1038
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:36,306
But I must ask you to hurry.

1039
01:19:38,877 --> 01:19:40,868
Yes, of course.

1040
01:19:49,187 --> 01:19:52,987
<i>I, Captain...</i>

1041
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:55,390
<i>on this, uh...</i>

1042
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,394
<i>day-</i>

1043
01:20:04,269 --> 01:20:06,601
Abraham...

1044
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:09,572
<i>do hereby...</i>

1045
01:20:17,282 --> 01:20:19,307
<i>declare that I...</i>

1046
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:23,278
leave the...

1047
01:20:23,355 --> 01:20:25,289
European...

1048
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,927
Sergeants' mess...

1049
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:33,587
at my own...

1050
01:20:38,536 --> 01:20:41,437
<i>insistence.</i>

1051
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:51,405
Now, sir...

1052
01:20:54,886 --> 01:20:57,684
would you please sign this, sir?

1053
01:20:57,756 --> 01:20:59,747
Just here.

1054
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:10,367
I've signed for many things
in the army, Sergeant Major.

1055
01:21:12,971 --> 01:21:16,031
First time I've signed for myself.

1056
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:35,584
Muscles, give him a hand!

1057
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:37,651
Take him back to his room.

1058
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,931
I thought for one nasty moment
he was gonna get off the hook.

1059
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:51,402
There are more ways of killing a cat
than sticking a poker in his ear, lad.

1060
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:56,704
I think I'll have this framed.

1061
01:21:57,682 --> 01:22:00,810
Sir, take a look at this.

1062
01:22:10,562 --> 01:22:13,098
The ack-ack guns. The Bofors.

1063
01:22:16,334 --> 01:22:20,168
<i>So that's what the bastard meant when he
talked about putting a shell in the breech.</i>

1064
01:22:26,511 --> 01:22:28,979
The only weapons in this battalion...

1065
01:22:29,047 --> 01:22:32,175
capable of blowing us all to blazes.

1066
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,014
Not that the gunner's very smart, but...

1067
01:22:35,086 --> 01:22:38,749
you can't very well miss a sergeants'
mess at a hundred yards in broad daylight.

1068
01:22:40,758 --> 01:22:44,194
Now, the quickest way to
put a Bofor out of action...

1069
01:22:44,262 --> 01:22:46,696
is to shove a 36 grenade in the breech
- simple as that.

1070
01:22:46,764 --> 01:22:49,392
<i>There are two guns.</i>

1071
01:22:49,467 --> 01:22:52,265
So, it will need two of us.

1072
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:55,135
I know you're all itching to
get out there and get stuck in...

1073
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:57,265
so I'll offer it to the first volunteer.

1074
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,543
Well, come on, lads.
Come along. Don't be shy.

1075
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:10,150
What's the matter with
you? Lost your tongue?

1076
01:23:10,221 --> 01:23:12,883
Surely I don't have to detail somebody.

1077
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:19,229
Well, gentlemen...

1078
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:22,027
you amaze me.

1079
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,399
You honestly amaze me!

1080
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,895
I do honestly declare
to you I've never seen

1081
01:23:27,896 --> 01:23:30,373
anything like this in
all of my service life!

1082
01:23:30,441 --> 01:23:32,432
Holy suffering!

1083
01:23:34,646 --> 01:23:38,480
The first chance we get
for a bit of action...

1084
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:43,249
<i>instead of sitting on our duffs
like a lot of prized billy goats...</i>

1085
01:23:43,321 --> 01:23:46,950
and there's not a man among you.

1086
01:23:47,025 --> 01:23:50,552
Not one man who's even got the
guts to admit he's a coward.

1087
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:55,761
I'll tell you what it is, sir.

1088
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,283
In the war, all you had to do was go out

1089
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:01,100
and find the enemy and
give him the chopper.

1090
01:24:01,172 --> 01:24:05,506
But these blokes are
supposed to be on our side.

1091
01:24:05,577 --> 01:24:09,069
- We don't know if we're on
foot or horseback. - I'll go.

1092
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:12,446
<i>- Come on. Let's toss.
- I said I'll go.</i>

1093
01:24:12,517 --> 01:24:15,680
Steady on, Ben. I'll go.

1094
01:24:15,753 --> 01:24:18,517
After all, Ben, you're
a bit old for this job.

1095
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:20,524
- I'm what?
- Well-

1096
01:24:20,592 --> 01:24:22,822
<i>- Drop it, would ya!
- You got a family-</i>

1097
01:24:22,894 --> 01:24:25,299
Ben, you've only got
10 days to do in the

1098
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,991
army, and I take that
into full consideration.

1099
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:31,900
If you want to leave it to Dodger
or Digger, it's all right with me.

1100
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:34,905
Leave it to them? They couldn't
fix a rat in a drain pipe.

1101
01:24:34,973 --> 01:24:37,373
- Sir?
- Yes, what is it?

1102
01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:40,172
It would be simpler to
toss for it, wouldn't it?

1103
01:24:41,613 --> 01:24:45,242
Well, is anybody against
tossing up for it?

1104
01:24:45,316 --> 01:24:47,307
All right, get a move on.

1105
01:24:53,124 --> 01:24:55,058
Ben.

1106
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:59,352
<i>Muscles?</i>

1107
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:01,364
<i>Dodger?</i>

1108
01:25:01,432 --> 01:25:03,423
<i>Digger?</i>

1109
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:07,329
Wilkes?

1110
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,244
The queen, God bless her.

1111
01:25:23,354 --> 01:25:26,448
All right, lad, that's you and me.

1112
01:25:26,524 --> 01:25:29,960
- Now is your chance to get
smothered in glory. - Wilkes.

1113
01:26:04,295 --> 01:26:07,093
The 36's are ready, sir.

1114
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:11,397
Right. We better take two each, just
in case only one of us gets through.

1115
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:21,902
- Layout to the camp, sir.
- Good. Follow me, Wilkes.

1116
01:26:25,717 --> 01:26:29,619
The sergeants' mess is
here, the guns there.

1117
01:26:29,687 --> 01:26:32,952
If we come up from the
front, they'll make jam of us.

1118
01:26:33,024 --> 01:26:35,891
So we go out of the back around there.

1119
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,894
How you gonna get across the road?

1120
01:26:37,962 --> 01:26:40,863
Will you stick a boomerang in that
great Aussie cakehole of yours.

1121
01:26:53,177 --> 01:26:55,509
They're just lining up on us.

1122
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,423
Right. We come out
the back where there's

1123
01:26:57,424 --> 01:26:59,573
plenty of cover and make
our way round to there.

1124
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:03,643
Now this is the tricky bit. Ben,
give us two minutes to get here.

1125
01:27:03,721 --> 01:27:05,655
Then I want you to
attract their attention.

1126
01:27:05,723 --> 01:27:09,124
If you can hold it for even five
seconds, we'll be across this road.

1127
01:27:09,193 --> 01:27:12,492
- How 'bout some cover fire, sir? - With
two Bofors sticking right up our jumpers?

1128
01:27:12,563 --> 01:27:14,497
No, no, no. Make out
you're otherwise engaged.

1129
01:27:14,565 --> 01:27:16,795
A fight, a party, I
don't care. Do a dance.

1130
01:27:16,868 --> 01:27:19,268
- Wilkes? All right so far?
- Yes, sir.

1131
01:27:19,337 --> 01:27:21,271
I wonder they didn't
make you a sergeant.

1132
01:27:21,339 --> 01:27:23,637
I had a stripe once.
Lost it after a fortnight.

1133
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:27,838
After this is over, you'll probably get
it back. Not too late to stay on, lad.

1134
01:27:27,912 --> 01:27:31,814
Once we're across this road, we'll
make our way through the firing butts.

1135
01:27:31,883 --> 01:27:34,181
- And then?
- There's plenty of cover there.

1136
01:27:34,252 --> 01:27:39,246
We'll play it by ear. Ben, we'll be at
the end of the buildings in two minutes.

1137
01:27:39,323 --> 01:27:41,985
And then we'll wait till
you start your fracas.

1138
01:27:42,059 --> 01:27:46,120
And keep it going till those guns go up.

1139
01:27:46,197 --> 01:27:48,461
I make it...

1140
01:27:48,533 --> 01:27:52,492
10 seconds short of 0633.

1141
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:57,803
So, zero from... now. Come on, Wilkes.

1142
01:27:59,444 --> 01:28:01,435
Good luck, sir.

1143
01:28:03,014 --> 01:28:05,141
Give me a hand with the piano.

1144
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,477
All right, Wilkes.

1145
01:28:51,362 --> 01:28:53,626
A minute and a half to go.

1146
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:31,261
- Wilkes!
- Sir.

1147
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:39,441
Come on, Wilkes. Quick!

1148
01:30:04,502 --> 01:30:06,493
Right. Come on.

1149
01:30:37,034 --> 01:30:39,525
Ten seconds. Digger, open those windows.

1150
01:30:39,604 --> 01:30:42,437
I want them to get the
full benefit of the choir.

1151
01:30:42,506 --> 01:30:45,339
Schoolie, come and do your stuff.

1152
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:48,674
Three, two, one.

1153
01:30:48,746 --> 01:30:53,149
Glorious, victorious

1154
01:30:53,217 --> 01:30:57,381
<i>One pint ofbeer between the four of us</i>

1155
01:30:57,455 --> 01:31:01,585
<i>Glory be to God there
isn't any more of us</i>

1156
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:04,992
<i>'Cause one of us could
drink the bloomin'lot</i>

1157
01:31:05,062 --> 01:31:08,930
<i>I'll be there I'll be there</i>

1158
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,697
<i>With beers on the table I'll be there</i>

1159
01:31:20,244 --> 01:31:24,180
- Glorious, victorious
- Sing up!

1160
01:31:24,248 --> 01:31:28,014
<i>One pint ofbeer between the four of us</i>

1161
01:31:28,085 --> 01:31:31,646
<i>Glory be to God there

1162
01:31:31,722 --> 01:31:34,850

1163
01:31:34,925 --> 01:31:38,918

1164
01:31:38,996 --> 01:31:42,796
<i>With beers on the table I'll be there</i>

1165
01:31:44,902 --> 01:31:47,393
- Now then, through the trench.
- The danger flag's up.

1166
01:31:47,471 --> 01:31:49,996
Well, keep your head down then.

1167
01:32:01,285 --> 01:32:04,277
- They won't get in the top 10 with
that little number. - Quiet!

1168
01:32:05,589 --> 01:32:10,492
<i>And his soul goes marching on</i>

1169
01:32:10,561 --> 01:32:13,155
<i>Glory, glory hallelujah</i>

1170
01:32:27,211 --> 01:32:31,011
That'll teach me to go
peeping through keyholes.

1171
01:32:31,082 --> 01:32:35,746
Let's get out of here before they send
someone to set the target up again.

1172
01:32:49,500 --> 01:33:02,370
<i>Glory, glory hallelujah</i>

1173
01:33:02,446 --> 01:33:07,076
<i>And his soul goes marching on</i>

1174
01:33:07,151 --> 01:33:09,142
A bit tawdry.

1175
01:33:16,794 --> 01:33:20,195
What do we do now, sir? Charge?

1176
01:33:30,641 --> 01:33:32,802
<i>That's torn it. His nibs.</i>

1177
01:33:52,329 --> 01:33:55,025
He couldn't have done it
better if we'd asked him.

1178
01:34:02,072 --> 01:34:04,438
<i>Glorious, victorious</i>

1179

<i>- Pick it up.! Come on.!
- I'll be there</i>

1183
01:34:18,923 --> 01:34:20,857
I'll be there

1184
01:34:20,925 --> 01:34:24,759
With beers on the table I'll be there

1185
01:34:28,299 --> 01:34:30,233
Good morning.

1186
01:34:32,203 --> 01:34:34,797
Is Mr. Lauderdale about?

1187
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:42,607
Um, he's, uh
- He's doing something outside, sir.

1188
01:34:45,182 --> 01:34:47,582
I take it you've heard the news.

1189
01:34:49,653 --> 01:34:51,587
News, sir? What news?

1190
01:34:53,490 --> 01:34:56,254
That we have a new government.

1191
01:34:56,327 --> 01:34:58,557
The old lot have already surrendered.

1192
01:34:58,629 --> 01:35:01,621
We got through the crisis
without being involved.

1193
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:04,259
And good show.

1194
01:35:04,335 --> 01:35:08,635
Tell Mr. Lauderdale I'd like to see
him when he's finished, would you?

1195
01:35:13,177 --> 01:35:15,975
Well, go on, Color Sergeant. Go on.

1196
01:35:30,094 --> 01:35:33,120
Get on! The guns are going off! Get on!

1197
01:35:43,407 --> 01:35:46,205
What in God's name-

1198
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,071
I-

1199
01:35:53,317 --> 01:35:55,683
I think the sergeant
major's finished, sir.

1200
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:10,097
<i>- Wilkes.
- Sir?</i>

1201
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:13,193
Put your betty on. Put your button up.

1202
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:15,966
Well, Miss Eriksson,
thank you for your help.

1203
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,736
- Good-bye, Sergeant
Major. - Bon voyage.

1204
01:36:23,113 --> 01:36:25,240
Good-bye, sir.

1205
01:36:25,316 --> 01:36:27,250
Uh, Wilkes.

1206
01:36:27,318 --> 01:36:31,049
Remember, some folks sleep light.

1207
01:36:31,121 --> 01:36:33,646
Next time, don't sling
your boots around, lad.

1208
01:36:46,737 --> 01:36:48,671
- Good morning, Sergeant Major.
- Good morning, ma'am.

1209
01:36:48,739 --> 01:36:50,673
I'm leaving you today.

1210
01:36:50,741 --> 01:36:53,335
I trust your fact-finding tour
has provided you with a few facts.

1211
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:55,776
Perhaps one or two concerning
Lieutenant Boniface.

1212
01:36:55,846 --> 01:36:58,212
Colonel Boniface, Sergeant Major.

1213
01:36:58,282 --> 01:37:00,748
If it's any consolation
to you, I disapprove,

1214
01:37:00,749 --> 01:37:02,946
of his methods as much as I do of yours.

1215
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,580
- Colonel Boniface?
- Yes, Mr. Lauderdale.

1216
01:37:05,656 --> 01:37:09,319
I see that you're already
dressed for the ceremonial parade.

1217
01:37:09,393 --> 01:37:11,623
Yes, sir. What's it all about, sir?

1218
01:37:11,695 --> 01:37:14,498
Well, it's a bit of
a rush job, actually.

1219
01:37:14,631 --> 01:37:18,362
It's to celebrate the coming
to power of the new government.

1220
01:37:18,435 --> 01:37:20,767
Colonel Boniface will
be taking the salute.

1221
01:37:20,837 --> 01:37:24,933
He's now military
governor of the providence.

1222
01:37:25,008 --> 01:37:27,636
I think under the circumstances...

1223
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:32,944
it might be better if you handed
over the parade to the color sergeant.

1224
01:37:36,052 --> 01:37:38,384
Very good, sir.

1225
01:37:38,455 --> 01:37:42,414
You'll be glad to hear the new government
has elected to stay in the commonwealth.

1226
01:37:42,492 --> 01:37:46,053
So, of course, we shall
be carrying on as before.

1227
01:37:46,129 --> 01:37:48,063
Very well, sir.

1228
01:37:48,131 --> 01:37:50,725
What's going to happen
to Captain Abraham, sir?

1229
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:55,430
Well, the new president has
given him safe conduct...

1230
01:37:55,505 --> 01:37:58,303
out of the country.

1231
01:37:58,375 --> 01:38:00,570
That's good, sir.

1232
01:38:00,644 --> 01:38:02,578
Yes, but...

1233
01:38:02,646 --> 01:38:06,707
we, um, had to compromise.

1234
01:38:06,783 --> 01:38:11,186
General McClellan told me this
morning that Boniface had demanded...

1235
01:38:11,254 --> 01:38:14,712
that you leave the
country within 48 hours.

1236
01:38:16,259 --> 01:38:19,695
The general considers the
request completely unjustified.

1237
01:38:19,763 --> 01:38:25,167
Boniface also wants us to take
disciplinary action against you.

1238
01:38:29,005 --> 01:38:32,497
What does that mean,
sir? A court-martial?

1239
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,340
Oh, no, no, of course
it won't come to that.

1240
01:38:35,412 --> 01:38:39,678
We've asked for time to
consider the matter naturally.

1241
01:38:39,749 --> 01:38:43,116
But the general thinks
it would be wise...

1242
01:38:43,186 --> 01:38:47,646
if you were on the first
available plane back to England.

1243
01:38:52,696 --> 01:38:55,722
Very well, sir. I'll
get my gear together.

1244
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:01,432
I don't suppose it's any
comfort to you, Mr. Lauderdale...

1245
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:05,372
but in your place I'd have
done exactly as you did...

1246
01:39:06,509 --> 01:39:08,704
step for step.

1247
01:39:43,513 --> 01:39:45,447
- Muscles.
- Sir?

1248
01:39:45,515 --> 01:39:47,449
- Digger.
- Sir?

1249
01:39:47,517 --> 01:39:49,883
Get the weapons back to the store.

1250
01:39:49,953 --> 01:39:52,751
- Schoolie.
- Sir?

1251
01:39:52,822 --> 01:39:56,189
- Get busy emptying them sandbags.
- Yes, sir.

1252
01:39:56,259 --> 01:39:59,285
- Dodger.
- Sir?

1253
01:39:59,362 --> 01:40:01,990
Check your vehicles and let
me have a list of deficiencies.

1254
01:40:02,065 --> 01:40:04,056
Yes, sir.

1255
01:40:07,604 --> 01:40:09,595
Sir.

1256
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:14,704
See what you can do about the
mess silver, will you, please?

1257
01:40:16,846 --> 01:40:19,644
And, Ben.

1258
01:40:19,716 --> 01:40:22,344
You'll be taking the
parade this afternoon.

1259
01:40:29,626 --> 01:40:33,062
- Pour me a whiskey, will you,
please, Corporal Abou. - Sir.

1260
01:40:40,336 --> 01:40:42,702
That'll be all, lad.
