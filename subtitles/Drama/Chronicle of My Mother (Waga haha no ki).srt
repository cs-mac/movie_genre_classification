1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,040
subtitles,

2
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,160
remember?

3
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,930
that heavy rain we stood under the eaves

4
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,160
i was there?

5
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,250
yes

6
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,670
in hamamatsu

7
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,880
you lived there with us for 1 year

8
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,260
you stayed here from 5 to 8

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,470
then you entered izu school

10
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,720
grind wasabi

11
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,510
kanazawa high school, kyoto university

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,180
journalist in osaka, writer in tokyo

13
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,980
you've been all over japan

14
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,440
school wasn't in izu but numazu

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,150
it's next door

16
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,570
the rain was pouring

17
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,030
that day you sent us to the station

18
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,860
i'll take this one

19
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,820
every time you come you take something

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,240
mom's upset

21
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,330
very valuable on the market

22
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,750
it's just catching dust here

23
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,080
right… that time

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,460
i remember dad's face

25
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,840
but he was waiting in taiwan

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,420
here

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,680
we joined him there

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,220
a whole year in taiwan

29
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,510
you were so lucky to stay

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,390
i wasn't

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,350
sure

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,350
no

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,440
sure

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,850
you were lucky

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,560
i was abandoned

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,980
what?

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,190
you were lucky

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,320
indeed

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,610
it was tough there

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,740
you want some?

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,280
mom's not joining us?

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,200
thank you

43
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,390
thanks

44
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,730
akio, so early

45
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,940
the library car gave me a ride

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,200
thank you

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,410
brother-in-law you arrived last night?

48
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,530
from tokyo after noon

49
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,870
we don't need funeral clothes anymore

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,290
when dad saw his son, he recovered

51
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,540
that's a father's wish

52
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,290
rather when he saw kuwako

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,340
when he saw you

54
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,000
no way

55
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,250
when he saw you

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,550
stubborn

57
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,010
i'm not

58
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,930
dad looked good on these army photos

59
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,560
villagers used to call him "excellency"

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
he retired as a major general

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,270
still young when he came to these mountains

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,230
he refused a position at the hospital…

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,440
to work in the fields

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,690
what a weird guy

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,490
you too were attracted to wasabi plantation

66
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,820
for 3 minutes

67
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,160
3 minutes?

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,160
there was enough family here…

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,490
in igami to work it

70
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,120
i would have thrown it all away one day

71
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,960
kuwako you were the same

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,670
skipping marriage to start business

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,340
i was young and confused

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,380
now i'm in antique art

75
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,010
he's so similar

76
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,350
yes… you too chose an artistic career

77
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,310
no, i meant similar to his father

78
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,310
surely not

79
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,060
fiddling with a cigarette case

80
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,820
you like soba cake as he does

81
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,150
i hate it

82
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,280
surely not

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,440
you're here

84
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,000
yep

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
mourning outfit?

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,030
there

87
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,530
you forgot mine

88
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,280
sorry

89
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,200
idiot

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,030
i go get it

91
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,490
enough… can't rely on you

92
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,290
i take this too?

93
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,370
father's check book?

94
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,750
father's funeral record

95
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,760
it reads "funeral expenses"

96
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,880
it's all scrupulously recorded

97
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,600
we had to pay so much

98
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,310
you & kuwako were both in tokyo

99
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,020
i had to handle it

100
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,730
take care of our status here

101
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,810
there are funerals expenses

102
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,480
there are two funeral accounts

103
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,020
that's mom's

104
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,400
so old-fashioned

105
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,360
how about your bus?

106
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,200
soon… you kuwako?

107
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,030
i stay another night

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,040
to what purpose?

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,370
tidy up storage

110
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,580
excuse me

111
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,710
what?

112
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,330
i'll go greet

113
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,130
he looks so much like father

114
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,590
right

115
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,570
your father said

116
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,150
write the obituary, not a verbose one

117
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,700
going back to tokyo

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,790
next week here again

119
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,510
my all time best-seller

120
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
so popular

121
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,100
my kids complain

122
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,270
if you read it

123
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,230
from cover to cover

124
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,780
it's 500,000 words

125
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,780
story of our family

126
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,530
i'll be back, goodbye

127
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,100
aki-chan

128
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,180
you enjoy that

129
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,730
so busy writing about genghis khan

130
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,150
no time to visit your father

131
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,940
it's my livelihood

132
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,320
what?

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,690
wasabi

134
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,700
bye

135
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,620
you don't have to come

136
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,500
i'm visiting honkei

137
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,560
hi, hiroshi

138
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,980
hello

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,660
thanks for the food

140
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,080
come greet honkei

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,710
in a hurry

142
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,590
you're the only son

143
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,260
your father asks you

144
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,760
can't hear you

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,930
write the obituary, not verbose

146
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,270
i know

147
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,390
who told you?

148
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,810
you did

149
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,730
you're ok?

150
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,820
i am

151
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,030
have a doctor check your head

152
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,700
hello

153
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
bye

154
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,800
bye

155
00:09:53,010 --> 00:10:05,870
eric paroissien, minimal subtitles, paroissien.com

156
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,180
let's go

157
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,000
tamada, the glue

158
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,130
sure

159
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,390
your slip shows

160
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,390
i'll take it

161
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:43,930
sorry

162
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,020
it's slow

163
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,650
how many volumes, mr. saburo?

164
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,690
12,000

165
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,110
12,000… mom…

166
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,610
kotoko is back from school?

167
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,690
she has a photo exhibition for school

168
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,950
her father will be mad

169
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,870
but it's good for her

170
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,530
what does the printer say?

171
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,500
he went 2 hours ago

172
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
he's at the restaurant

173
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,760
i'm back

174
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,220
welcome back

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,050
welcome back

176
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,140
welcome back

177
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,180
we're busy with the prints

178
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,890
i like home's liveliness

179
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,350
how's your father

180
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,060
i'd be more worried about mom

181
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,230
how?

182
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,940
whatever

183
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,990
wasabi, again

184
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,410
beautiful selfless dedication

185
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,080
service is a form of love

186
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,910
next week's lecture trip

187
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,910
later

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
sir, your meal

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
have you eaten?
-not yet

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
call for delivery

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
which restaurant?

192
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,840
wakamatsu

193
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,050
a soba cake

194
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
additional orders

195
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,590
they don't like phone calls

196
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,720
i'll run there then

197
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,010
hello

198
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:02,720
excuse me

199
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,300
sorry

200
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,850
welcome back

201
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,640
hello

202
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,900
how many prints today?

203
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,770
12,600

204
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,730
1 pen, 2 chopstick

205
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,400
that's what feeds a family

206
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,030
mother fiercely disapproved me

207
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,240
a writer is a waste

208
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,700
you started at 43

209
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,620
father moved to izu at 48

210
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,210
i became a writer at 43

211
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,800
i quit osaka newspaper, came to tokyo

212
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,380
had to be tokyo?

213
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,720
sure

214
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,590
why?

215
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,100
well

216
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,060
tokyo is the place

217
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,770
always dreamed of working in tokyo

218
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,610
you too

219
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,520
same for me

220
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,280
he's a good writer too

221
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,450
segawa can speak for himself

222
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,030
you have to hurry

223
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,450
thank you

224
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,700
thanks for your work

225
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,290
leave it

226
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,290
where's kotoko?

227
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,130
busy with her photos

228
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,000
what photos?

229
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,460
a photo competition at school

230
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,130
we ordered food for her

231
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,340
thank you

232
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,600
that kid is stubborn

233
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,060
she knows how busy we're all with the print

234
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,980
she has no love

235
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,480
no love, no service

236
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,320
your voice is loud, you scare noriko

237
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,650
my voice isn't loud

238
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,320
18 years old, she's scared?

239
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,700
you're fine

240
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,630
coming in

241
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,850
what's this?

242
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,190
snails

243
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,730
while we're busy with the print

244
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,820
you play with snails

245
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,240
it's for the photo competition

246
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,240
when, tomorrow?

247
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,070
next month

248
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,200
no urgency

249
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,700
the print is more important

250
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,960
as long as we enjoy helping

251
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,750
but you force it on everybody

252
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,250
you live on my money

253
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,890
ah, the snails

254
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,650
how do you feel?

255
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,570
i'm fine

256
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,900
sorry about yelling

257
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,290
hello

258
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,180
dear

259
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,850
what?

260
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,400
your father

261
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,650
died?

262
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,080
just before i left him…

263
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,590
he took my hand

264
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,300
don't know why

265
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,220
he held my hand

266
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,220
then tossed it away

267
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,220
he's rejecting you?

268
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,400
he was surprised to see me

269
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,530
at first he, like, hooked me

270
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,360
he just wanted to hold

271
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,080
last tender gesture

272
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,450
father and son is not that simple

273
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,540
why kotoko rebellious?

274
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,050
puberty

275
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,090
because i make her write?

276
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,930
who knows

277
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,890
i became a writer to feed the family…

278
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,230
and launch my family into the trade

279
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,270
the history of genghi kahn

280
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,270
the whole family writes

281
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,320
ikuko and noriko agreed

282
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,910
different personality

283
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,830
cup of tea?

284
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,290
please

285
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,620
i'll go to the livingroom

286
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,840
this slope… you ok?

287
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,010
don't force it

288
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,840
sorry to be a burden

289
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,180
kotoko you go, i take care of noriko

290
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,470
we're together

291
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,640
father is mad at you lately

292
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,230
or he'd be mad if she left you behind

293
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,650
better stick together

294
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,150
i'm segawa the snail

295
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,270
i was called to help

296
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,200
"segawa the snail"?

297
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,110
because i helped you pick up the snails

298
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,830
that's where it comes from?

299
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,870
could you help?

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,660
all right

301
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,620
thank you

302
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,670
he'll carry you

303
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,420
she's light

304
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,710
please

305
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,220
heave ho

306
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,550
all right

307
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,810
thank you very much

308
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,930
grandma

309
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,890
sound of the mountain stream

310
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,570
what kind of kid was my father?

311
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,700
read his autobiography

312
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,240
your angle?

313
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,450
a seeker

314
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,080
seeking what?

315
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,420
anywhere on this planet

316
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,170
a small boy searching

317
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,760
amazing

318
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,760
grandma you're a poet

319
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,390
not a poet

320
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,970
it looked like verse

321
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,100
cold

322
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,810
you too

323
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,530
summer 1960

324
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,200
grandma

325
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,490
you liked mr. shunma

326
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,410
did i?

327
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,790
you said you did

328
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,290
more than grandpa?

329
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,370
he was about your age

330
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,790
he'd be 90 now

331
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,460
he didn't last that long

332
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,130
you'd have married him

333
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,840
we would not be born

334
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,130
enough… creepy

335
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,350
just a possibility

336
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,010
but his face

337
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,390
no way

338
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,890
are you talking about mr. shunma?

339
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
she comes again

340
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,310
precisely

341
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,020
how do you know about him?

342
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,980
you always talk about him

343
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,400
mr. shunma

344
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,530
talking about him

345
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,330
he's still in my heart…

346
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,370
after all this time

347
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,210
grandma is so cute

348
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,840
this week's letters from readers

349
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,050
just today's

350
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,090
fan lovers too

351
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,390
your slip shows
-she's hopeless

352
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,390
grandma, cards could predict your union with mr. shunma

353
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,020
come sit here

354
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,570
wait, after we finish here

355
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,950
married! none of us were born

356
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,030
neither dad is born

357
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,930
grandma marries mr. shunma

358
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,100
why do you talk about mr. shunma?

359
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,940
here we go again

360
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,820
welcome back

361
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,410
heavy rain

362
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,240
kids are all in?

363
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,910
they would be able to come back

364
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,910
everyone's in?

365
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,080
your mother is here

366
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,460
i'm not alone

367
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,830
come in

368
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
good

369
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,460
segawa, driver and student
this is koneko

370
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,300
nice to meet you

371
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,630
whose driver?

372
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,510
mine

373
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,630
he'll stay here

374
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,140
sorry… hand him a towel

375
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,010
back ache?

376
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,270
welcome back

377
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,680
welcome back

378
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,650
not only that, my thoughts are confused

379
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,610
you took care of mom for a year

380
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,770
indeed

381
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,110
i told you i could take her at my place

382
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,190
let's try for a week

383
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
she couldn't bear 2 days

384
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,320
experience taught us

385
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,710
mom said "i'm so old"

386
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,170
"moving to a home with kids"

387
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,130
what is she mumbling?

388
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,840
we have to do as she says

389
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,390
come quick

390
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,140
you know him, segawa the snail

391
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,310
the snail

392
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,440
fired from a printing company

393
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,400
no place to go, i took him in

394
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
a 2nd secretary?

395
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,070
my driver

396
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,530
what car?

397
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,650
we buy one

398
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,740
you take such decisions

399
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,320
it's bought, coming tomorrow

400
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,330
a pair of socks

401
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,080
talk about your wages

402
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,080
nice to meet you

403
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,170
this way

404
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,380
not selling antiques today?

405
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,510
mom wants to talk to mr. kosaku

406
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
surely not a big deal

407
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,930
she says it's important

408
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,280
she chats with the kids

409
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,780
keeps mentioning mr. shunma

410
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,410
shunma?

411
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,290
a friend who died 70 years back

412
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,870
yes, that genius who died young

413
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,710
his dad was struck by lightning

414
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,800
what grandma

415
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,550
she totally ignores your dad

416
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,720
she never mentions him

417
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,560
not as if she'd forgotten, but…

418
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,230
strange

419
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,980
they were such a good couple

420
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,240
mom's memory is fading

421
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,790
it's coming

422
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,750
gather the middle

423
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,580
away from window

424
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,130
kotoko, you wanna die?

425
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,500
kuwako, sit down

426
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,470
what's the fuss

427
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,430
it's coming

428
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,520
since father's death

429
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,520
in an instant

430
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,030
it's like he lives in me

431
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,160
going to the garden

432
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,320
wearing my clogs

433
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,790
slouching, reading the newspaper

434
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,500
playing with the cigarette box

435
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,970
suddenly the mouth of death facing me

436
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,510
next it's my turn

437
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,020
however, in my case…

438
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,020
mother is still healthy

439
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,860
half of me in the sea of death

440
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,030
mother preserving the other half

441
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,070
that gap between me and death

442
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,740
in fact will disappear

443
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,750
when mother passes away

444
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,090
excuse me

445
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,510
please

446
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,050
staying up late?

447
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,220
tell you something

448
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,180
what?

449
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,100
my brother living in the usa

450
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,100
is 70 this year

451
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,270
right

452
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,440
i want to send him a gift

453
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,780
last week i sent him a silver watch

454
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,070
you did?

455
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,200
we wrapped it in front of you

456
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,620
he's received it by now

457
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,260
don't touch please

458
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,600
i'm not sure you did it

459
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,770
what's that about?

460
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,310
you don't understand the world

461
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,780
leaving you in yugashima was my mistake

462
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,820
there you go again

463
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,160
right after shinako's birth

464
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,120
i should have come for you

465
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,330
but my health wasn't good

466
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,250
a year later you came it was too late

467
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,300
too late…? dramatic!

468
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,170
you didn't want to leave yugashima

469
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,260
you didn't come for me

470
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,470
i did many times

471
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,140
you saw your brother several times

472
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,310
you abandoned me

473
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,490
warehouse onui grandma became my mother

474
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,700
find the funeral record

475
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,950
the funeral record?

476
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,880
that book recording funeral expenses…

477
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
we found at dad's death?

478
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
why would anyone record funeral gifts

479
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,010
you know about that book

480
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,720
why should i care?

481
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,640
our family's funeral record

482
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
you lost me there

483
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,970
it is very important

484
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,690
times have changed now

485
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,310
we're wealthy enough to leave it

486
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,150
we pay back funeral gifts…

487
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,030
what we received in times of grief

488
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,700
when they are in grief we help them

489
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,820
suppose you died, and no one paid it

490
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,990
that wouldn't be fair

491
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,000
i get it, i'll find it

492
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,250
that dismissive tone

493
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,500
typical of onui grandma

494
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,590
so self-righteous

495
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,350
that warehouse woman

496
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,940
but i left you with her

497
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,190
it's not my place to talk

498
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,570
i'll go back home tomorrow with kuwako

499
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,240
i want that book back before, please

500
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,930
elvis

501
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,450
dad?

502
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,780
shit

503
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,410
one more

504
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,170
my father's handwriting

505
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,750
the 1920's

506
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,760
they're funerals gifts

507
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,470
japanese society was based on barter and exchange

508
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,760
"give and take", just like americans

509
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,020
not at all

510
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,100
they'd share all they had

511
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,770
nothing was left

512
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,480
a buddhist principle

513
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,150
don't get it

514
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,820
a funeral in 1920

515
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,740
your mother's mother?

516
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,660
warehouse onui grandma

517
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,790
what does it mean?

518
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,630
from age 5 to 8

519
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,840
onui grandma and i lived together

520
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,510
in a warehouse?

521
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,010
deep in izu mountains a small warehouse

522
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,510
onui grandma did something bad

523
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
in a way

524
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,480
she's not your mother's mother?

525
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,020
that's the official status

526
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,110
the truth?

527
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,860
my mother's grandfather's concubine

528
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,370
his lover?

529
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:40,040
my great-grandfather abandoned his wife and my mother

530
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,330
started a new family

531
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,340
he married that woman, changed her status

532
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,170
why?

533
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,840
strange question

534
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,390
to take care of her future

535
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,890
our family's genealogy

536
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,440
study, research it

537
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,570
grandma's grandpa had a lover

538
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,620
it's indecent

539
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,250
it's indecent

540
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,600
thanks a lot

541
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,310
tired

542
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,610
we're here on this map

543
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,530
shigako

544
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,990
we just arrived

545
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,780
how's mother?

546
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,160
she's great… in the lounge

547
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,080
my name's igami

548
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,290
do we have the orchestra tonight

549
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,170
they have arrived

550
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,090
classical?

551
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,470
sorry they're not

552
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,390
it's a latin group

553
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,300
a latin band

554
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,900
try again

555
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,310
it's like writing, just practice

556
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,980
i'm sorry

557
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,070
from the right knee

558
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,740
segawa enough, move on

559
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,950
don't be weak on him

560
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,830
kuwako

561
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,920
kuwako

562
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,670
akio, it's them

563
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,730
segawa is put to the task

564
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,350
never loses heart

565
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,530
it's grandma's birthday

566
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,570
coming here makes dad happy

567
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
it's a duty for all the family

568
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,950
this too is a duty?

569
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,280
serving is a form of love

570
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,700
is why we love to serve

571
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,080
it's dad's motto

572
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,000
his service and love are coerced

573
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,290
take it easy

574
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,130
mom… mr.tamaya

575
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,020
it hurts

576
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,140
wait kotoko

577
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,900
i'm out

578
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,490
stood kotoko

579
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,950
wait

580
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,490
kotoko

581
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,580
hello

582
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,830
hello

583
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,760
kotoko

584
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,510
for dad it's not a service

585
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,730
but a payment for his sin

586
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,560
kotoko talks nonsense

587
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,270
paying for what sin?

588
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,940
he used grandma's life and ours

589
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,780
to write his novels

590
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,070
he robbed us of our soul

591
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,370
his sin would rather be hubris

592
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,830
lucifer

593
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,750
admission to hawaii university

594
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,330
you study abroad?

595
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,750
once i graduate here

596
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,720
i may never marry or leave home

597
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,470
if you don't marry, neither shall i

598
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,930
who cares who marries first

599
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,660
grandma is 75

600
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,670
twelve candles

601
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,270
indeed

602
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,780
unexpected

603
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,020
grandma now

604
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,690
is more and more like a child

605
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,400
she's like a 10 year old

606
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,820
right

607
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,940
as she regressed

608
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,530
her memory dwindles

609
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,320
selectively forgetting

610
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,280
only bad memories

611
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,620
remembers good things

612
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,540
it started at dad's death

613
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,380
aging is an eraser going over memories

614
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,050
can't erase them all

615
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,130
she forgets a lot

616
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,970
she remembered someone who died in izu

617
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,100
she wanted to attend the funeral

618
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,640
and send them money

619
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,180
i'm fed up with her whims

620
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,390
she found an old funeral record

621
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,980
she searched it

622
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,570
how much she owes to such family

623
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,480
just like accounting

624
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,530
i've had enough

625
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,000
this for my mother

626
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:23,420
eric paroissien, minimasubs, paroissien.com

627
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,180
so tired

628
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,020
back to your room?

629
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,020
i could see the pool from my room

630
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,280
i thought this was it

631
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,110
your room is above

632
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,580
i'd rather be here

633
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,120
spacious and comfortable

634
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,420
why did you bring the records?

635
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,970
sure didn't

636
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,130
it just fell from your shawl

637
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,020
don't be weird

638
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,060
maybe shigako brought it

639
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,770
she's here

640
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,400
you can't just disappear

641
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,780
i had to talk…

642
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,070
with your brother…

643
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,530
i called him to my room

644
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,280
what with her?

645
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,030
your room?

646
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,990
nothing

647
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,580
about visiting the graves tomorrow?

648
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,330
i'm patient

649
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,750
you don't visit grandpa's tomb.

650
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,750
i'll follow him soon

651
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,130
no one knows

652
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,220
your grandpa

653
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,350
was working

654
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,440
during the war

655
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,860
it was so hard

656
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,190
he can rest now

657
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,160
i had to go meet him in the snow

658
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,040
the roads were icy

659
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:28,040
next door lady slipped and fell

660
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,590
i prepared his lunch every day

661
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,510
there was so little food

662
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,350
i polished his boots

663
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,060
military boots

664
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,190
were so long it was hard

665
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,530
let me rest

666
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,650
grandma your nightgown

667
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,150
i'll lay like this

668
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,950
brush your teeth

669
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,330
all right

670
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,910
well

671
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,370
wait

672
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,580
mother wait

673
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,920
i help you

674
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,420
easy

675
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,750
you're too slow

676
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,960
grandma wait

677
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:17,880
she has no loving memory of dad

678
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,510
she's forgetting him

679
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,520
she also forgot the harm he did to her

680
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,520
his coldness too

681
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,940
their mutual debt is erased

682
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,820
tonight at last…

683
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,070
this is made clear

684
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,410
what?

685
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,950
you've changed

686
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,200
what?

687
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,080
first time you mention mom affectionately

688
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,420
say…

689
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,460
still i have not forgiven her

690
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,550
she abandoned me in yugashima

691
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,430
but she lost that memory

692
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,260
we can't fight over it

693
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,390
the memory gone, you can love her

694
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,490
too later for such racket

695
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,870
3 years ago, marilyn monroe

696
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,120
john wayne, 5 months

697
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,450
cheers for john wayne

698
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,160
cheers

699
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,380
amazing akio

700
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,840
kotoko how's grandma?

701
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,300

you know?

723
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,570
they abandon them

724
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,080
they throw them in a tree

725
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,580
they must come down the tree

726
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,750
otherwise they lose their parents

727
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,430

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,930
gimme a break

751
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,520
you're raising your voice

752
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,480
he's doing his share of work

753
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,190
this is so unfair

754
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,150
he's your son-in-law

755
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,030
get out of my home is you don't like it

756
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,830
i wish we had done it

757
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,200
you have some nerve for a servant

758
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,080
she mistook me for a servant?

759
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,460
mom

760
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,130
mom, you just called me "servant"?

761
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,380
mom

762
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,140
we have to take care of grandma

763
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,260
she'd come here with us?

764
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,350
akio's will be hospitalized two weeks

765
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,180
just while he's absent

766
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,020
dad don't laugh

767
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,770
but grandma doesn't like tokyo

768
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,150
in hard times you negotiate with the enemy

769
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,440
what enemy?

770
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,360
we celebrate her first food

771
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,820
kotoko, help me

772
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,700

773
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,620

774
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,210

776
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,090
i'll take care of grandma

777
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,050
what kind of idea

778
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,180
she won't stand 2 days in tokyo

779
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:58,520
we take her to karuizawa

780
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,390
the air is good there

781
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,350
grandma will love it

782
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,000
reopenig the villa is a big task

783
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
wasp nesting around

784
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,490
rain and wind opening windows

785
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,940
birds inside the house

786
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,740
kotoko would be scared

787
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,450
no one cares how grandma feels

788
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,950
as if she was an enemy

789
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,290
you should take better care of her

790
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,330
enough, kotoko

791
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,210
we celebrate her first food

792
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,250
kotoko, it's your idea, you do it

793
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,130
you can't deal with it on your own

794
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,720
i can pick up grandma

795
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,130
not on your own

796
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,890
you're over-protective

797
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,510
over-protective

798
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,390
you're always careful nobody would touch us

799
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,730
as if you feared an assault

800
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,150
on a typhoon alert you call my school

801
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,310
it's that type of situation

802
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,940
did i say that

803
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,070
you called me back from the cinema

804
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,950
during a storm

805
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,320
the wind and rain

806
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,240
who knows what could happen

807
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,490
moreover noriko, you're weak

808
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,660
the movie was "virgin spring"

809
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,920
"virgin spring"

810
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,880
you watch erotic movies?

811
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,750
an ingmar bergman movie

812
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,590
a father take revenge

813
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,260
for his daughter's murder

814
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,680
he kills 3 brothers

815
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,730
even the smallest boys

816
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,150
i couldn't see it till the end

817
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,520
i so wanted to see it

818
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,030
until the end

819
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,280
you shouted on the phone

820
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,370
you decide for everything

821
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,870
we're deprived of freedom

822
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,300
noriko, you okay

823
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,220

824
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,600
i'll serve tea

00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,480
a fight about "virgin spring"

826
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,270
my brother was shocked

827
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
so shocked

828
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,990
but she should do something

829
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,110
or she'll never leave home

830
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,160
she's our version of "virgin spring"

831
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,620
you're laughing, mr. dutiful?

832
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,450
i am sorry

833
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,660
he's not dutiful

834
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,160
sure, he's too

835
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,270

00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,160
mont ubasute?

841
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,380
kids abandon their elderly there

842
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,290
I'd be relieved

843
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,510
get ready to go

844
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,510
kids are so ungrateful

845
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,390
i'll use the bathroom

846
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,310

was a hospital before the war

849
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,520
here there was a pharmacy and waiting room

850
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,820
medicinal drawers are still here

851
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,150

870
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,320
losing her mind or playing fool

871
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,860

who's that kid?

875
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,740
family taking care of grandma

876
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,830
she also comes to tokyo

877
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,200
did you greet our hosts?

878
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,080
ah did

879
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,660
did not

880
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,960
he went to numazu college

881
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,010
when we were in taiwan

882
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,180
mr. american, you hear me

883
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,760
i hear

884
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,390
you speak only japanese

885
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,930
"really"

886
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,850
let's go see the ocean in numazu

887
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:18,210
this is where my son used to swim

888
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,460
"yes indeed"

889
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,760
later i managed to get him back

890
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,550
however, his father

891
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,510
was garrisonned in taiwan

892
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,310
we also went to taiwan

893
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,280
sir

894
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,240
everything fine, shigako?

895
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,660
she came without fuss

896
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,910
we arrive in the evening

897
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,250
she protested a lot?

898
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:59,750
she complained she's abandoned

899
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,670
that legend, at 70

900
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,170
she said kids throw their elderly in the mountain

901
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,840
and she'd be relieved

902
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,010
she said we should abandon her

903
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,140
she would be better off

904
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,100
she's hard to deal with

905
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,440
say

906
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,480
she's not making fun of us

907
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,820
she does too

908
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,490
like in that movie about tokyo

909
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,700
she considers us nasty kids

910
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,320
coming back to our parents to abuse them

911
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,620
like the son and daughter of that movie

912
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,790
you remember?

913
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,160
i haven't seen it

914
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,830
after the war food was scarce

915
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,710
such stories might have happened

916
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,670
mom is very stressed

917
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,970
you're so kind to her

918
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,890
not that kind

919
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,180
I'm just saying she's a proud person

920
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,890
she would give up in front of no one

921
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,730
OK, gotta go

922
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,190
OK thanks

923
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:08,700
ms tamadai

924
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,030
we have a folder on mont ubasute

925
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,370
a haiku and song collection about it

926
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,000
a picture book too

927
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,790
picture book?

928
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,870
please find it

929
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,760
sorry to bother

930
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,010
come

931
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,680
still up

932
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,350
something bugs me

933
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,930
i may be repeating myself

934
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,930
i didn't notice that

935
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,940
I'm always bothering you

936
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,860
you probably have enough of me

937
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,070
no such thing

938
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,280
I'm relieved

939
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,280
i won't harass you

940
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,320
as soon as possible

941
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,410
not today, but tomorrow

942
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,580
let me go back home

943
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,920
back to izu home

944
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,010
today you spoke about mont ubasute

945
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,140
i may have mentioned it

946
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,810
you remember this book

947
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,770
mont ubasute

948
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,310
when i arrived in izu

949
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,940
you gave it to me

950
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,150
these were hard times

951
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,660
kids were abandoning their parents

952
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,160
on my summer vacations back in izu

953
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,660
i found it at onui grandma's

954
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,660
warehouse onui grandma

955
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,830
she'd kept it preciously

956
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,880
don't forget about my returning home

957
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,850
segawa will drive you to karuizawa

958
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,440
i'll join you later

959
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,040
first book you loved?

960
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,130
i was 5

961
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,420
i burst into tears

962
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:34,180
i had to leave my mother

963
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,510
very painful

964
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,850
at 11 i read it again and cried again

965
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,570
i was about to leave onui grandma

966
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,210
sir

967
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,630
i was told, the first 3 days she was mad

968
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,000
so to speak

969
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,550
even her american brother couldn't soothe

970
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,970
as soon as we arrived here

971
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,100
she thought i was the janitor

972
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:26,940
grandma?

973
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,440
this way

974
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,450
how is she?

975
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:39,200
good today

976
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,660
yesterday not too good

977
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,450
today she's fine

978
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,080
hey, grandma

979
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:50,000
on board from the pier in yokohama

980
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,790
peaceful

981
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,300
aging ideally

982
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,930
she finally gave up on the 5th day

983
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,680
i told her she had to be here

984
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,480
you've done a great job

985
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,780
the house is damaged

986
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:21,740
don't push me

987
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,240
look

988
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:28,000
humidity is eating it away

989
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,170
i'll wait at the post office

990
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,760
this way, grandma

991
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,420
I'll manage, you can go

992
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,300
go where?

993
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,180
tokyo

994
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,510
i can't

995
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,850
must take care of you

996
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,180
no one is asking you

997
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:49,020
until you become reasonable

998
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,770
me and Sada-chan and segawa stay

999
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,110
like a house arrest

1000
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,280
2 guards and that janitor

1001
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,990
that's so sad

1002
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,070
what?

1003
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,030
a woman asked me for direction

1004
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,200
i wanted to show her the way

1005
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,000
but kotoko was impatient

1006
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,540
it's not true

1007
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,500
you're impatient

1008
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,050
she told her she was grace kelly

1009
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,210
like a swan flying

1010
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,220
she didn't ask she was just passing

1011
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,050
she wasn't lost

1012
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,720
kotoko enough

1013
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,970
she asked me

1014
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,430
segawa say something

1015
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,560
that woman didn't ask

1016
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,270
a janitor follows his boss

1017
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,360
you embarrassed him

1018
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:46,030
always impatient, you're pathetic

1019
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,200
i've had enough of you

1020
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:52,750
sure, you and me we're "bye-bye"

1021
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,820
he's gone?

1022
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,120
who?

1023
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,410
that creep

1024
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,790
man with a hat

1025
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,000
that would be me

1026
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:39,800
careful, i saw him

1027
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,380
spies wear such hats

1028
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:45,340
american spies

1029
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,550
who am i?

1030
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,930
you're the american

1031
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,640
uncle keiichi?

1032
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,350
i missed you today

1033
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,350
i wondered where…

1034
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,480
keiichi is still in the states

1035
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,520
how old?

1036
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,320
keiichi is 5 years younger than you

1037
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,950
for some time…

1038
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:09,120
i wanted to ask you

1039
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,580
you received the silver watch?

1040
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,250
silver watch?

1041
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,630
for your 70th, i asked my son

1042
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,340
'course i received it long ago

1043
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,140
never knew if he really sent it

1044
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,640
'course it was sent

1045
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,390
my son is spaced out

1046
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:41,270
since that warehouse onui grandma ensnared him

1047
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,440
he wouldn't leave her

1048
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,900
he was in numazu

1049
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:49,570
lucky she died suddenly

1050
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,040
had she lived longer…

1051
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,830
about the silver watch

1052
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,580
you received it?

1053
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,530
kotoko?

1054
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,070
tennis club

1055
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,860
with a man

1056
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,290
you ready?

1057
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,330
"nice"

1058
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,560
an elegant movement

1059
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,310
that man in white pants?

1060
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,270
he's her classmate

1061
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,320
they often meet?

1062
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,400
not often

1063
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,660
you go back

1064
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,700
good

1065
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,120
kotoko, you did good

1066
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,130
cuba libre

1067
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,630
cuba libre

1068
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,460
your father is waiting

1069
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,440
your boyfriend? in white pants?

1070
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,360
nope

1071
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,530
whenever you feel like introducing me

1072
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,280
writing today's events?

1073
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,330
also about me too?

1074
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,960
"you and me we're bye-bye"

1075
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,090
finally, what are we to you…

1076
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,510
but novel raw material

1077
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,640
using grandma thus…

1078
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,930
i'm quite a match to dickens

1079
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,310
Alzheimer is such a book-seller, you

1080
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,070
Saturday-chan infected me with her parlance

1081
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:34,030
just ending a sentence with "you"

1082
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,990
doesn't make it izu dialect, you

1083
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,040
easy

1084
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,710
heavy

1085
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,380
easy

1086
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,810
I'm beginning to understand

1087
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,230
what?

1088
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,610
how you see grandma

1089
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,950
we go back

1090
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:20,160
are you a writer or a son?

1091
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,160
we discuss this when you're sober

1092
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,540
look at you

1093
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,580
too shy when you're sober

1094
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,580
you never talk

1095
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,840
enough kotoko

1096
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,470
the writer is kind to grandma

1097
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,430
but the son resents his mother

1098
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,010
resentment is the drive

1099
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,220
without it the canary doesn't sing

1100
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,980
"the canari forgot the song"

1101
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:52,860
eric paroissien, minimasubs, paroissien.com

1102
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:58,780
"let's abandon it in the mountains"

1103
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:06,120
"no, you can't do that"

1104
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,870
heavy

1105
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,080
heavy

1106
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,420
grandma

1107
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,380
grandma

1108
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,300
what's this?

1109
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,350
grandma gone

1110
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:23,600
what?

1111
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,980
at the shrine

1112
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:28,730
go to the shrine

1113
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,600
check the pathways

1114
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,650
grandma

1115
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,320
grandma

1116
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:41,870
grandma

1117
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,060
grandma

1118
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,190
go back

1119
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,900
please

1120
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,660
I'm fine

1121
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:22,700
you're closing

1122
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,910
thank you

1123
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:24,700
going inside?

1124
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:25,830
sorry to bother

1125
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,870
it's raining

1126
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,790
let's go

1127
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:33,040
i'm busy

1128
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,840
let's go

1129
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,500
it's raining

1130
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,460
segawa

1131
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,590
the car

1132
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,640
all right

1133
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,100
grandma liked karuizawa

1134
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,350
we stayed until winter

1135
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,610
father didn't show up

1136
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,490
your nap

1137
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,990
good

1138
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,990
forgot that prayer

1139
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,500
it's ok to forget

1140
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,790
where do you go?

1141
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,880
outside

1142
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,800
be careful

1143
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,010
ok

1144
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,560
if i bother

1145
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,190
i go in my room, miss

1146
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,020
stop calling me miss

1147
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,070
a bit unexpected

1148
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,530
and stop being dutiful

1149
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,200
what do you mean?

1150
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,710
if you're not too serious we could be dating

1151
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,920
but not as a house employee

1152
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,940
why are you so restrained?

1153
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:08,030
i'm the boring type

1154
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,200
to be honest, your kind of person

1155
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:14,910
is a mystery to me

1156
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,290
you took this line

1157
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,880
from a novel of my father's

1158
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,420
the heroines of your father…

1159
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,460
are unconcerned by love

1160
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:28,090
at odds or disconnected

1161
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,430
and should their apathy…

1162
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,140
ever be disrupted by actual sex…

1163
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,060
love is terminated

1164
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,390
this sterilized type of love

1165
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,310
doomed from the egg, is not my…

1166
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,270
segawa

1167
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,270
I'm not marrying you

1168
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:41,770
all right

1169
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,740
in short

1170
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,870
chose my father the writer…

1171
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,240
or chose me

1172
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:56,330
both

1173
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,330
i won't take it

1174
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,760
you chose the glass, the bottle will hate you forever

1175
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,840
my student abused my trust

1176
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:12,970
he may hinder your future literary prize

1177
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,150
i quit being dutiful

1178
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,110
grandma, sorry

1179
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,610
help us

1180
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:34,120
Sada-chan your chores

1181
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,880
is it all right?

1182
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,880
all in line

1183
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,510
grandma

1184
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,180
good ceremony

1185
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,900
i wish it was every day

1186
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,480
you know for whom?

1187
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
for whom?

1188
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:17,370
my memory is fading it's terrible

1189
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,160
we commemorate warehouse onui grandma

1190
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,590
she's been dead for 50 years

1191
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,510
that puts an end to it

1192
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,380
we don't owe her anything more

1193
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,330
thus she joins the ancestors

1194
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:38,080
thank you for your trouble

1195
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,430
where's kurokawa?

1196
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,890
not yet

1197
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,070
you heard that?

1198
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:54,030
death reconciles old enemies

1199
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,360
dad?

1200
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,580
in the salon with noriko

1201
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,050
hawaii?

1202
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,430
he agreed i'll study in hawaii

1203
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,810
congratulations

1204
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:27,850
thank you

1205
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,820
i saw he was alone so…

1206
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,530
i mustered the courage to ask

1207
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:34,240
easier than i expected

1208
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,280
good for you

1209
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,070
I'll announce it now

1210
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,640
a photo here?

1211
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,260
you promised you'd be with me today

1212
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,020
to find a title for the special edition?

1213
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,020
your taking a break in the country

1214
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,190
who came up with that?

1215
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,690
segawa the snail

1216
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:10,810
thought so

1217
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,270
it's a conservative magazine

1218
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,440
you snatched Mr. dutiful away from me

1219
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:17,450
he decided on his own

1220
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,450
he dropped me to date you

1221
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,490
you're getting the hang of abandonment

1222
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,040
i love it

1223
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,460
he wrote good stuff under my guidance

1224
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,670
he's not just a good editor, get it?

1225
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:47,180
onui grandma's celebration in that side room is creepy

1226
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:55,070
when we'd visit my parents place

1227
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,490
she'd enter through the back door to greet people

1228
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,320
never enter the main room

1229
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,660
even dead, today she's forbidden

1230
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:10,000
but you'd enter through the front door?

1231
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,040
onui grandma told me to do so

1232
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,380
you'd have dinner here some times

1233
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,500
never

1234
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,090
grandpa and grandma…

1235
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,800
would not feed offer a meal

1236
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:23,510
we were often invited…

1237
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,720
but I'd refuse

1238
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,690
in my kid's heart i knew onui grandma's feeling

1239
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:37,280
so we'd go back to the warehouse

1240
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:37,000
i remember writing poetry on this swing

1241
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,130
what poem?

1242
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:45,840
forgot

1243
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:49,100
your memory is excellent

1244
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:52,640
not for what i wrote at that time

1245
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,600
nothing's left

1246
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,820
you were protecting grandma

1247
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,950
had she entered the main room

1248
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,660
the whole family…

1249
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:15,830
were her enemies

1250
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,550
here she held my hand for the first time

1251
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,510
who?

1252
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,980
onui grandma

1253
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,990
a sunset like this one

1254
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,490
mother, had dropped me in yugashima

1255
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,660
onui grandma raised me

1256
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,380
go back

1257
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,250
that year in yugashima

1258
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,960
shigako was so busy

1259
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:44,250
dad took in grandma

1260
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,920
grandma not on your own

1261
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,300
help

1262
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:52,430
lock the door yone-chan

1263
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,560
grandma come on

1264
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,610
the luggage upstairs

1265
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,280
grandma

1266
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,240
easy

1267
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,410
come on

1268
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:14,990
easy now

1269
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:19,160
come

1270
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,670
easy

1271
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:23,670
in our tokyo home

1272
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:27,960
we had such rackets that could last an hour

1273
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,430
especially in the afternoon

1274
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:33,760
she was agitated

1275
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:37,810
the rest of the time she would be peaceful

1276
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:46,190
it was tough today, grandma

1277
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:50,150
I'd rather forget it

1278
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,490
putting you in such trouble

1279
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:55,950
among us…

1280
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,830
she'd listen only to dad

1281
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:02,370
but i doubt she knew he was her son

1282
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,170
that was creepy

1283
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:26,360
grandma

1284
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,620
let's go

1285
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:46,880
all right, kotoko

1286
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,380
all right

1287
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:52,340
this way

1288
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,130
you can't sleep like that

1289
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,890
your nightgown

1290
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:00,720
this is it?

1291
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,400
grandma go back to sleep

1292
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:09,070
grandma sleep

1293
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,570
she went to your study this time?

1294
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:20,370
she's doing this every night?

1295
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,450
keep it quiet

1296
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,250
thanks noriko

1297
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,960
for 2 weeks, every night

1298
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
at first i thought

1299
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,720
she couldn't find the bathroom

1300
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:35,970
she came to my room

1301
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:38,140
she is disoriented

1302
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:42,140
she checks every room in turn

1303
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:45,060
until she finds her own

1304
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:48,600
in yugashima she'd wander 3 times a night

1305
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,980
even in yugashima

1306
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:53,280
in my room and in madam's room

1307
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,570
the kitchen too

1308
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,610
then back to her room

1309
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:00,740
so she's not looking for her room

1310
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:03,370
we should close her door

1311
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:06,750
like a child looking for her mother

1312
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,920
if it was so

1313
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,590
we'd feel sad for her

1314
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,340
but she's spooking us

1315
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:17,430
or a mother looking for her child

1316
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,760
kotoko take the flashlight from her

1317
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:23,970
but…

1318
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:27,000
when we hid the funeral book she forgot

1319
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,020
hide it

1320
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,600
she won't wander

1321
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,770
you're wrong

1322
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,440
do as i say

1323
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,820
ok

1324
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,150
yesterday

1325
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,070
she lost the flashlight

1326
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,990
you searched?

1327
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,160
the 2 of us in the night

1328
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,000
for the flashlight…

1329
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,370
she's wandering

1330
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,000
no way

1331
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:54,130
that flashlight has legs

1332
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:58,670
forgot

1333
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,390
here, flowers

1334
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,020
thanks "slip-showing" yone-chan

1335
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,850
"slip-showing" yone-chan

1336
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:10,520
good weather

1337
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,190
the amaranth is beautiful.

1338
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,030
we call it tampala…

1339
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,030
this is so nice

1340
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:22,320
I'd like a garden too

1341
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:23,870
indeed

1342
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,040
wait here

1343
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,540
the new secretary

1344
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:37,380
sir

1345
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:41,010
today deadline for the series

1346
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,550
i know

1347
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,720
they want to split it in 3 volumes

1348
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:47,930
they need to know where to split

1349
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,180
good

1350
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:10,410
there was a person writing every day

1351
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,750
he went

1352
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:16,710
dead?

1353
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:19,710
all too soon

1354
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:26,220
3 days after he died

1355
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,060
the 3rd day

1356
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,930
he was popular

1357
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,940
many people mourned him

1358
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:45,070
there's one thing

1359
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:48,950
i always wanted to tell you

1360
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,670
we won't meet again

1361
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,960
need to tell you

1362
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:57,840
what?

1363
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,260
that woman living with me

1364
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,760
shigako?

1365
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,140
she's just a servant

1366
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,810
any other person living with you?

1367
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:20,650
that woman who took my son

1368
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:27,780
every night

1369
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:32,790
i ask her for my son

1370
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,790
she would not tell me

1371
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:44,130
if i could see him just once before i die

1372
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,510
grandma

1373
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:54,310
you left your son back

1374
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,650
never considered his sadness

1375
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,360
"the rain stopped"

1376
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:08,910
what?

1377
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:15,870
"left many puddles"

1378
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:21,790
"the pacific, the mediterranean, the sea of japan"

1379
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:26,170
"each to its own"

1380
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:31,050
"but my favorite"

1381
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:37,390
"is not of this earth, a small, new channel"

1382
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:42,570
"links mother & me"

1383
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:49,410
"but my favorite"

1384
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:55,450
"is not of this earth, a small, new channel"

1385
01:30:55,540 --> 01:31:02,880
"linking mother & me"

1386
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:15,310
"linking mother & me"

1387
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:26,150
"is not of this earth, a small, new channel"

1388
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:33,820
"is not of this earth"

1389
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,120
"a small, new channel"

1390
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,500

1393
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:20,870
i was right about the flashlight

1394
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:26,000
grandma is not roaming anymore

1395
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,500
something happened?

1396
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,670
nothing

1397
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,470

1399
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,020

1401
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,900

1404
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,530

1405
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:10,750
thank you for your kindness

1406
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,260
noriko

1409
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:19,930

everyone going back

1412
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,230
everyone going back

1413
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:30,070
she knew it

1414
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:32,900
because i took a photo

1415
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,280
she wanted to look good

1416
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,070
didn't have her dentures though

1417
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,080
indeed

1418
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,580
lost it

1419
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,790
lost it

1420
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,370
her dentures

1421
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,290
haven't seen her with it lately

1422
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,290
haven't seen it

1423
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,710
neither did i

1424
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,800
power outage

1425
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,880
the fuse

1426
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:56,970
i'll check

1427
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,610
you found it?

1428
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,440
it's on

1429
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:15,610
good

1430
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:49,310
farewell

1431
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:51,480
kuwako is late

1432
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:54,020
she'll take the plane then

1433
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,150
i look for her

1434
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,450
maybe she fears the sea

1435
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:00,280
like grandma

1436
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,820
never heard that one

1437
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,870
she can't swim

1438
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,830
she loves the firm ground

1439
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,950
when did you hear that?

1440
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,540
at our wedding

1441
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,290
an awful long time ago

1442
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:12,380
she said she'd die

1443
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,960
when she left for taiwan

1444
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,720
a ship sank just before their trip

1445
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:20,220
she thought the whole family would die

1446
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,300
at least she would save her son

1447
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:24,720
she left me because of that?

1448
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:28,680
a survivor son had to be left behind

1449
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,230
no matter how painful it was for him

1450
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:35,360
to preserve the family for the ancestors sake

1451
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,690
what did she have in mind

1452
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:39,150
a sole survivor

1453
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,820
his temperament will be strong

1454
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,370
you knew this all along?

1455
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,700
why didn't you tell me?

1456
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:47,290
you became interested…

1457
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:48,540
only recently

1458
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,000
surely not

1459
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,880
you'd feel abandoned in any case

1460
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,340
it's your drive to write excellent novels

1461
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,730
excuse me

1462
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,190

01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,570

1466
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,700

1467
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,870
already yellow

1468
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,870
indeed

1469
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,200
my feet are yellow too

1470
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:30,580

1471
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:48,560

1472
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,560
it's dad

1473
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,570

1474
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:01,990
the entrance…

1475
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:03,990
dad?

1476
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:08,080
30 min left, can't see kuwako

1477
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,490
she didn't call you?

1478
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,830
no

1479
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:19,250

1488
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,500
grandma

1489
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,530
when you reel in a strong fish…

1490
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:44,710

grandma breathed her last

1644
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:57,530
at 1:48

1645
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:02,660
mother died peacefully in her home…

1646
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:06,620
and we owe this to you as a couple

1647

suddenly mont ubasute's landscape came up

1654
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:15,820
suddenly my legs are unsteady

1655
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:22,360
for all i carried her on my back

1656
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:29,080
i felt i had no choice

1657
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:34,630
couldn't find her a suitable place

1658
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:41,170
mother was angry

1659
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:47,100
she said i wasn't looking hard enough

1660
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:54,270
for my only mother

1661
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:57,940
a place to get rid of her

1662
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:02,400
to find such a place…

1663
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,320
it is not a sin

1664
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,860
you found her dentures?

1665
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:47,120

1666
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:56,120
