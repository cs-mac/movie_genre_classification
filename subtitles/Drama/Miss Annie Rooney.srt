1
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
There's an old joke. Two elderly women
are at a Catskill Mountain resort.

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,280
One of 'em says,
''The food at this place is really terrible.''

3
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,800
The other one says,
''Yeah, I know. And such small portions.''

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,400
That's essentially how I feel about life.

5
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,280
Full of loneliness and misery
and suffering and unhappiness.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,480
And it's all over much too quickly.

7
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,680
The other important joke for me is one
that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>I think it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious.</i>

9
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,480
It goes like this - I'm paraphrasing.
I would never wanna belong to any club

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,200
that would have
someone like me for a member.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,480
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,080
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Cos I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm not worried about ageing.
Although I'm balding slightly on top.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,200
That's about the worst
you can say about me.

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,480
I think I'm gonna get better as I get older.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,200
I think I'm gonna be
the balding virile type,

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,000
as opposed to, say,
the distinguished grey, for instance.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,280
Unless I'm one of those guys with
saliva dribbling out of his mouth,

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
who wanders into a cafeteria
with a shopping bag,

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,480
screaming about socialism.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,280
Annie and I broke up.
And I still can't get my mind around that.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,280
I keep sifting the pieces of
the relationship through my mind,

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,880
examining my life, and trying to
figure out - where did the screwup come?

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,680
A year ago we were... in love, you know.

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,480
And... It's funny... I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,280
I... I... You know...

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,680
I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War II.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,080
He's been depressed.
All of a sudden he can't do anything.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?
- Tell Dr Flicker.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
It's something he read.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,480
Something he read, uh?

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,880
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,600
The universe is everything. If it's
expanding, someday it will break apart

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,080
and that will be the end of everything.

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,080
What is that your business?

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
He stopped doing his homework.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,880
- What's the point?
- What has the universe got to do with it?

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,200
You're here in Brooklyn!
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,800
It won't be expanding
for billions of years yet, Alvy.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,680
And we've gotta try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here, uh?

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,280
<i>My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories.</i>

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,080
<i>But I was brought up
under the roller coaster</i>

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
<i>in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.</i>

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,480
<i>Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.</i>

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>I have a hyperactive imagination.</i>

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,200
<i>My mind tends to jump around a little.</i>

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,480
<i>I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.</i>

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,080
<i>My father ran the bumper car concession.</i>

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,480
<i>There he is.</i>

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
<i>And there I am.</i>

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,880
<i>I used to get my aggression out
through those cars all the time.</i>

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,480
<i>I remember the staff at our public school.</i>

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,480
<i>We had a saying.:
''Those who can't do, teach,</i>

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,080
<i>and those who can't teach, teach gym. ''</i>

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,680
<i>And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.</i>

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
<i>I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.</i>

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,880
<i>Melvyn Greenglass. His fat little face.</i>

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,400
<i>And Henrietta Farrell.
Just Miss Perfect all the time.</i>

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,680
<i>And Ivan Ackerman.
Always the wrong answer. Always.</i>

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Seven and three is nine.

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>Even then, I knew they were just jerks.</i>

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,080
<i>In 1942 I had already discovered women.</i>

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
He kissed me! He kissed me!

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
That's the second time this month!
Step up here.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,280
- What did I do?
- Step up here!

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,400
You should be ashamed of yourself.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,480
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,880
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I did.

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,800
For God's sakes, Alvy!
Even Freud speaks of a latency period.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, I never had a latency period.
I can't help it.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Why couldn't you have been more like
Donald? Now there was a model boy.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Tell the folks where you are today.

76
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,280
I run a profitable dress company.

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,880
<i>Sometimes I wonder
where my classmates are today.</i>

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,880
I'm president of
the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,600
I sell tallises.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
I used to be a heroin addict.
Now I'm a methadone addict.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm into leather.

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,600
<i>I lost track of most of my schoolmates,
but I wound up a comedian.</i>

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,600
They did not take me in the army.
I was... Interestingly enough... I was 4-P.

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,600
In the event of war, I'm a hostage.

85
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,080
You always only saw the worst in people.

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,080
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,680
You were always out of step
with the world.

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,200
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

89
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,680
I distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, ''Jew.''

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
You're crazy.

91
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,480
We were walking off the tennis court.
Him and me and his wife.

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
He looked at her and they both looked at
me. And under his breath he said, ''Jew.''

93
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,800
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,280
I pick up on those kinda things.

95
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,680
I was having lunch with some guys from
NBC. So I said, ''Did you eat yet or what?''

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,000
And Tom Christie said, ''No. D'you?''

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,400
Not ''Did you''. ''D'you eat?'' ''D'you?''

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
Not ''Did you eat?'' but ''D'you eat?''
''Jew?'' You get it? ''Jew eat?''

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,880
- Max...
- Stop calling me Max.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Why, Max? It's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I was in a record store. There's
this big, tall, blond, crew-cutted guy,

102
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,600
looking at me in a funny way and saying,
''We have a sale this week on Wagner.''

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,800
Wagner, Max. Wagner. I know what he's
really trying to tell me, very significantly.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Right, Max.

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,680
California, Max.

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
We move to sunny LA.
All of show business is there.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
No. I don't wanna live in a city
where the only cultural advantage

109
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
is that you can make
a right turn on a red light.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,480
Forget it.
Aren't you late for meeting Annie?

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm meeting her at the Beekman.
I have a few minutes.

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Are you on television?

113
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,880
Once in a while. Occasionally.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,800
- What's your name?
- You wouldn't know it. lt doesn't matter.

115
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,000
You were on the... uh...
'The Johnny Carson', right?

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,680
Once in a while, you know.

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
What's your name?

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm... I'm Robert Redford.

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Come on!

120
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Alvy Singer. lt was nice...
Thanks very much for everything.

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,080
Hey!

122
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
What?

123
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
This is Alvy Singer!

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Fellas, you know...

125
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,480
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer? Am I right?

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,080
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

127
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
I need a large polo mallet.

128
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,200
- Who's on television?
- On 'The Johnny Carson Show.

129
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,280
Is this a meeting of the Teamsters?

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,000
- What programme?
- Can I have your autograph?

131
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,680
- You don't want my autograph.
- No, I do. It's for my girlfriend.

132
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,800
Make it out to Ralph.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,400
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brudder.

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,200
You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?

135
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Alvy Singer over here!

136
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
It's all right, fellas.

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Jesus! What did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

138
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the cast of 'The Godfather'.

139
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,880
- You have to learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with guys named Cheech!

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
Please. I have a headache, all right?

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,080
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,800
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I'm getting my period!

143
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
A little louder. I think
one of them may have missed it.

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,000
- Has the picture started?
- It started two minutes ago.

145
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
That's it. Forget it. I can't go in.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,600
- Two minutes, Alvy.
- I can't do it. We've blown it already.

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
I can't go in in the middle.

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
We'll only miss the titles.
They're in Swedish.

149
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,880
- You wanna get coffee for two hours?
- Two hours? No. I'm going in.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
- Go ahead. Goodbye.
- While we're talking, we could be inside.

151
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Can we not stand here and argue
in front of everybody? I get embarrassed.

152
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
All right. So what do you wanna do?

153
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,280
I don't know now.
You wanna go to another movie?

154
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,400
Let's go see 'The Sorrow and the Pity'.

155
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Come on. I'm not in the mood to see
a four-hour documentary on Nazis.

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,280
Well, I'm sorry. I've gotta see a picture
exactly from the start to the finish.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,280
Cos... Cos I'm anal.

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,680
That's a polite word for what you are.

159
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,680
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best.

160
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,680
It lacks a cohesive structure.

161
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,400
You get the feeling that he's not
absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.

162
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,200
I've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

163
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,680
Granted, 'La Strada' was a great film.
Great in its use of negative imagery.

164
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,480
I can't stand this guy.
I'm gonna have a stroke.

165
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, stop listening to him.

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

167
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Like all that 'Juliet of the Spirits'
or 'Satyricon'.

168
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
I found it incredibly... indulgent.

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,000
He really is. He's one of
the most indulgent filmmakers.

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,080
The key word here is indulgent.

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Without getting...

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,080
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

173
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,280
- How can you possibly oversleep?
- The alarm clock.

174
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,080
Do you know
what a hostile gesture that is to me?

175
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
I know.
Because of our sexual problem, right?

176
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,400
Everybody at 'The New Yorker'
has to know our rate of intercourse?

177
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,280
It's like Samuel Beckett.

178
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,880
I admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,080
- I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
- Stop it, Alvy!

180
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,600
He's spitting on my neck.
He's spitting on my neck when he talks.

181
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,080
You know, you're so egocentric
that if I miss my therapy,

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,280
you can only think of it
in terms of how it affects you.

183
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
<i>Weltanschauung is what it is.</i>

184
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Probably on their first date.

185
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,880
Probably met by answering an ad
in the 'New York Review of Books'.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,400
''Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman

187
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,480
who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy.''

188
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,080
Our sexual problem? I'm comparatively
normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

189
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
OK. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem.
OK? My sexual problem.

190
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,480
I never read that. That was a Henry James
novel? Sequel of 'The Turn of the Screw'?

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,680
It's the influence of television.

192
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high...

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,080
high intensity.
You understand? A hot medium...

194
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,880
What I wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

195
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,200
What do you do when you get stuck in
a movie line with a guy like this behind?

196
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,200
Why can't I give my opinion?
It's a free country.

197
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,880
Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't
you ashamed to pontificate like that?

198
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

199
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,680
Really? I happen to teach a class
at Columbia called 'TV, Media and Culture'.

200
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
So I think my insights into Mr McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,400
Oh, do you? That's funny, because
I happen to have Mr McLuhan right here.

202
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,800
Just let me... Come over here a second.

203
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I heard what you were saying.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,880
You know nothing of my work.

205
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,200
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

206
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,280
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing.

207
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Boy, if life were only like this!

208
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,800
<i>June 14th, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.</i>

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,400
<i>All over the country, people are desperate
for every available scrap of news.</i>

210
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,880
Those guys in the French Resistance
were really brave.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,880
To have to listen to
Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

212
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

213
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,200
The Gestapo would take away
your Bloomingdale's charge card

214
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
and you'd tell 'em everything.

215
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,280
That movie makes me feel guilty.

216
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah, cos it's supposed to.

217
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Alvy...

218
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,800
What? What... What's the matter?

219
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I don't... I don't know.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,080
It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed
together. You know, it's been a long time.

221
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,680
Well, it's just that I gotta sing tomorrow
night, so I have to rest my voice.

222
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
There's always an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

223
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,000
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

224
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,000
We're probably
in the 'Guinness Book of World Records'.

225
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,480
Alvy, it'll pass.
I'm going through a phase. That's all.

226
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

227
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,880
You were very hot for Allison at first.

228
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
You're on right after Chris Brown,
which looks about 20 minutes.

229
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,600
Excuse me. When do I go on?

230
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Who are you?

231
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Alvy Singer.

232
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,280
I'm a comedian.

233
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,680
Oh, comedian. Yeah.

234
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Oh. You're on next.

235
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
What do you mean, next? I'm...

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,880
You're on right after this act.

237
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,280
No, it can't be. Because he's a comic.

238
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

239
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,480
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

240
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,880
No, I'm sorry. I don't wanna go on
after another comedian.

241
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,000
It's OK.

242
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,080
No. Because they're laughing.
So I'd... rather not.

243
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,480
Will you relax? They're gonna love you.

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,480
I'd prefer not to. Look.
They're laughing at him.

245
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,280
They're gonna laugh at him
then I gotta go out.

246
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,080
I gotta get laughs too.
How much can they laugh?

247
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,880
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,880
Jesus!

249
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
What's your name?

250
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,800
Allison.

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah?

252
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Allison what?

253
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Portchnik.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

255
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Allison Portchnik.

256
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,880
So, what are you telling me? You work
for Stevenson all the time or what?

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,680
No. I'm in the midst of doing my thesis.

258
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,880
On what?

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,080
<i>Political Commitment
in 20th-Century Literature.</i>

260
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,880
You're like... New York, Jewish,
left-wing, liberal, intellectual,

261
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,800
Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps?

262
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,800
The father with the Ben Shahn drawings?
The really strike-oriented...

263
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,000
Stop me before I make
a complete imbecile of myself.

264
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,400
No. That was wonderful. I love
being reduced to a cultural stereotype.

265
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Right. I'm a bigot. But for the Left.

266
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,400
I have to go out there.
Say something encouraging. Quickly.

267
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,680
- I think you're cute.
- Do you?

268
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Go ahead.

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,800
I don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally cos...

270
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm not essentially
a political comedian at all.

271
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,680
I interestingly had... dated a woman

272
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,680
in the Eisenhower administration briefly.

273
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
And it was ironic to me cos...

274
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Cos I was trying to do to her

275
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,480
what Eisenhower has been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

276
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm sorry. I can't go through with this.

277
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,680
I can't get it off my mind, Allison.
It's obsessing me.

278
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

279
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,480
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository,

280
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,080
and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

281
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,280
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

282
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
It doesn't make sense!

283
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,480
I'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough

284
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,000
to hit a moving target at that range.

285
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,880
But...

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
if there was a second assassin...

287
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,680
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

288
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,480
They recovered the shells from that rifle.

289
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,480
OK. What are you saying now?

290
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,280
Well, why not?

292
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Yeah. Earl Warren?

293
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,000
Hey, honey. I don't know Earl Warren.

294
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,080
Lyndon Johnson?

295
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,400
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!
You know the ethics those guys have.

296
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,280
It's like a notch
underneath child molester.

297
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,880
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,200
The FBI and the CIA
and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies

299
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,480
and the Pentagon and the men's room
attendant at the White House.

300
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,280
I would leave out
the men's room attendant.

301
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,200
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

302
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,080
Oh, my God!

303
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,680
She's right.

304
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
She was beautiful, she was willing,
she was real intelligent.

306
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,880
Is it the old Groucho Marx joke that
I just don't wanna belong to any club

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,680
that would have
someone like me for a member?

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,880
Alvy, don't panic! Please stop it!

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,800
It's a mistake to ever bring
a live thing in the house.

310
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Stop it! Go for that one there.

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,480
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911 . It's the lobster squad.

312
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,080
They're only baby ones, for God's sakes.

313
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,480
- If they're only babies, you pick 'em up.
- All right! All right!

314
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me! Don't!

315
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,800
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,880
It'll turn up in our bed at night.

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,880
Will you get out of here
with that thing? Jesus!

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,080
Talk to 'em. You speak shellfish.

319
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,800
Hey, look. Put it in the pot.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,600
I can't put it in the pot!
I can't put a live thing in hot water!

321
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,480
You think we're gonna
take him to the movies?

322
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,480
Oh, good, Alvy. Oh, thank you.

323
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
OK. It's in. It's definitely in the pot.

324
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,400
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

325
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,680
I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.

326
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,880
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here
with a nutcracker, it'll run out.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm gonna get my camera.

328
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
I think if I could pry the door off...

329
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,480
We should have gotten steaks.
They don't run around.

330
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Goddamn it! Oh, jeez!

331
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,880
Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,880
You're gonna take pictures now?

333
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,400
Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely!

334
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,480
Oh, God! That's disgusting!

335
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
One more, Alvy. Please!

336
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,080
Oh, good! Good!

337
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first big romance?

338
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
Oh, no. No, no.

339
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,480
Really? Who was?

340
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
There was Dennis
from Chippewa Falls High School.

341
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,680
<i>Dennis? Local kid? Would meet you
in front of the movie house?</i>

342
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,480
<i>You should have seen
what I looked like then.</i>

343
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
<i>I can imagine. Probably
the wife of an astronaut.</i>

344
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
<i>Then there was Jerry, the actor.</i>

345
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Look at you. You're such a clown.

346
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,080
I look pretty.

347
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,480
You always look pretty. But that guy...

348
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Acting is like an exploration of the soul.
It's very religious.

349
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,200
Like a kind of liberating consciousness.

350
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
It's like a visual poem.

351
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
Is he kidding with that crap?

352
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh, right.

353
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,280
I think I know exactly what you mean
when you say ''religious''.

354
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,280
You do?

355
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,680
- Oh, come on. I was younger.
- Hey, that was last year.

356
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
It's like when I think of dying.

357
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
- You know how I'd like to die?
- No. How?

358
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,000
I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

359
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels!

360
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,800
Listen, he was a terrific actor.
He's neat-looking and he was emotionaI...

361
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,280
I don't think you like emotion too much.

362
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Touch my heart... with your foot.

363
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,080
I may throw up.

364
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,200
He was creepy.

365
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
I think you're pretty lucky
I came along.

366
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da.

367
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,880
If anyone had ever told me
I would be taking out a girl

368
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,480
who used expressions like la-de-da...

369
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,280
You really like those New York girls.

370
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
- Well, not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

371
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,880
There's Henry Drucker.
He has a chair in history at Princeton.

372
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,080
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.

373
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,480
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

374
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,800
- Why are you so hostile?
- Cos I wanna watch the Knicks on TV.

375
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,880
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

376
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,200
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

377
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Douglas Wyatt. 'The Foul'
'Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart'.

378
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,600
I'm so tired of making fake insights
with people who work for 'Dysentery'.

379
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
<i>Commentary.</i>

380
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Really? I heard 'Commentary' and 'Dissent'
had merged and formed 'Dysentery'.

381
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,480
No jokes. These are friends, OK?

382
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,680
Here you are.

383
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,680
There's people out there.

384
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,800
Two minutes ago the Knicks are ahead 14
points, and now they're ahead two points.

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
What is so fascinating
about a group of pituitary cases

386
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,080
trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

387
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,480
What is fascinating is that it's physical.

388
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Intellectuals prove
you can be absolutely brilliant

389
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,680
and have no idea what's going on.

390
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,280
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie,

391
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,280
as we now know.

392
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Stop acting out.

393
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,000
It'll be great. All those PhDs are in there
discussing modes of alienation,

394
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,600
and we'll be in here quietly humping.

395
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,600
Alvy, don't.
You're using sex to express hostility.

396
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,200
Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories?

397
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,600
He said, as he removed her brassiere.

398
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,480
There are people out there
from 'The New Yorker' magazine!

399
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,400
Oh, my God.

400
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
What would they think?

401
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
Damn siren!

402
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,880
OK. Don't get upset.

403
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
Dammit! I was so close!

404
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,400
Last night it was a guy honking
his car horn. The city can't close down.

405
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,280
You wanna have them
shut down the airport too?

406
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
No more flights so we can have sex?

407
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm too tense. I need a Valium.

408
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,200
My analyst says I should live
in the country and not in New York.

409
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,680
We can't have this discussion.
The country makes me nervous.

410
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,200
You've got crickets.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

411
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,680
The screens
with the dead moths behind 'em.

412
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Terry.

413
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,000
OK! OK! My analyst just thinks I'm
too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?

414
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
It's quiet now. We can start again.

415
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,280
I can't. My head is throbbing.

416
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,880
- You got a headache?
- I have a headache.

417
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,880
Bad?

418
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
- Like Oswald in 'Ghosts'.
- Jesus!

419
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,480
Where are you going?

420
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm going to take another
in a series of cold showers.

421
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,600
Max, my serve will send you
to the showers early.

422
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,880
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

423
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,880
Max, the city is terribly run.

424
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm not discussing politics or economics.
This is foreskin.

425
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Every time some group disagrees
with you, it's because of anti-Semitism.

426
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,880
The rest of the country sees New York

427
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,680
as left-wing, Communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

428
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,280
I think of us that way sometimes,
and I live here.

429
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,680
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

430
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,480
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

431
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

432
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,000
I know, but I...

433
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Egad. Here he comes.

434
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,600
You know Alvy? This is Janet.

435
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
This is Annie Hall.

436
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,080
This is Alvy.

437
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,000
Who's playing with who?

438
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,080
You and me against them?

439
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,480
- I can't play too good, you know?
- I've had four lessons.

440
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,280
Hi!

441
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,280
Well...

442
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
Bye.

443
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,400
You play very well.

444
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,480
Oh, yeah? So do you.

445
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,080
Oh, God. What a dumb thing to say, right?

446
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,880
You say, ''You play well'' and then
right away I have to say, ''You play well.''

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,280
Oh!

448
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,280
God, Annie. Well...

449
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Oh, well.

450
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,680
You want a lift?

451
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, why?

452
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
You got a car?

453
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,880
Me? No. I was gonna take a cab.

454
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,280
Oh, no. I have a car.

455
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,280
You have a car?

456
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,200
I don't understand.
If you have a car, so then...

457
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
why did you say, ''Do you have a car?''
like you wanted a lift?

458
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,480
I don't... I don't...

459
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Jeez, I don't know. I wasn't...

460
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
It's... I've got this VW out there.

461
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
What a jerk! Yeah.

462
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Would you like a lift?

463
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,280
Sure. Which way are you going?

464
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Me? Downtown.

465
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm going uptown.

466
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,880
Well, you know, I'm going uptown too.

467
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,280
You just said you were going downtown.

468
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,600
Sorry.

469
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,680
I can go uptown too.
I live uptown, but what the hell!

470
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,880
It'll be nice having company.
I hate driving alone.

471
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,880
So where do you know Janet from?

472
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
- I'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress?

473
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,880
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

474
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,280
- You're not from New York, right?
- Chippewa Falls.

475
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,280
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

476
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You're driving a tad rapidly.

477
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,280
Don't worry.
I'm a very good driver. I'm good.

478
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,000
- You want some gum anyway?
- No. No, thanks.

479
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,480
Hey, don't... No, no.
Would you watch the road? I'll get it!

480
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,680
- I'll get you a piece.
- So, you drive?

481
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,680
Do I drive? No.
I've got a problem with driving.

482
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,800
Oh, you do?

483
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
I've got a licence,
but I have too much hostility.

484
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,680
Nice car. You keep it nice.

485
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,680
Can I ask you? Is this a sandwich?

486
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,200
Huh? Oh, yeah.

487
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,680
I live over here. Oh, my God! Look!
There's a parking space.

488
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,280
That's OK. We can walk
to the kerb from here.

489
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,400
- You want your tennis stuff?
- Oh. Yeah.

490
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,600
That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

491
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,680
Well...

492
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,800
Thank you.

493
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,400
You're a wonderful tennis player and...

494
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,680
you're the worst driver
I've ever seen in my life.

495
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,880
Anyplace. Europe.
The United... Anyplace. Asia.

496
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,080
- And I love what you're wearing.
- Oh, you do, yeah?

497
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,680
Oh, well, it's a...
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

498
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,800
Who? Grammy... Grammy Hall?

499
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,080
Yeah, my grammy.

500
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
Did you grow up
in a Norman Rockwell painting?

501
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,280
- Your grammy?
- I know. It's pretty silly, isn't it?

502
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,800
My grammy never gave gifts. She was
too busy getting raped by Cossacks.

503
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,480
Well...

504
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Thank you again.

505
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,800
Hey, you wanna come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

506
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I mean, you don't have to.
You're probably late.

507
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,800
No, that'd be fine. I wouldn't mind. Sure.

508
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,880
I've got time. I've got nothing...
till my analyst appointment.

509
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
Oh, you see an analyst?

510
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,280
Yeah. Just for 15 years.

511
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm gonna give him one more year
and then I'm going to Lourdes.

512
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,080
15... Nah! Come on!

513
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Yeah? Really?

514
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,680
Sylvia Plath? lnteresting poetess
whose tragic suicide

515
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,600
was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

516
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,680
Oh, sorry.

517
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,600
I don't know.
Some of her poems seem neat.

518
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,000
Neat? I hate to tell you, this is 1975.

519
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,480
''Neat'' went out, I would say,
at the turn of the century.

520
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Who are those photos on the wall?

521
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,880
Oh! Well, you see now...
that's my dad.

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,680
That's Father.
And that's my brother Duane.

523
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
- Duane?
- Yeah, right. Duane.

524
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,800
And over there is Grammy Hall.
And that's Sadie.

525
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,080
- Who's Sadie?
- Oh, well, Sadie...

526
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother George.

527
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,800
George was real sweet.
He had that thing...

528
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,680
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence? What is it?

529
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,080
- Narcolepsy.
- Right, right!

530
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,680
So anyway... George went to the union,
you see, to get his free turkey.

531
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,680
The union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmas time

532
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,000
because he was shell-shocked
in the First World War.

533
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,680
Anyway, so George is standing in line -
oh, just a sec - getting his free turkey.

534
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,400
But the thing is, is that he falls asleep

535
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,480
and he never wakes up!

536
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,080
So... so he's dead!

537
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
He's dead. Yeah.

538
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,280
Oh, dear.

539
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Well... Terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say?
I mean, that's pretty awful.

540
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,880
It's a great story, though.
It really made my day.

541
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,400
I think I should get outta here
cos I think I'm imposing.

542
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,280
Really? Well, maybe...

543
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
You know, I...

544
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,480
- You don't have to, you know.
- I'm all perspired and everything.

545
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,680
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

546
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,480
Me? No. Cos I never shower
in a public place.

547
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,880
Why not?

548
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,080
Cos I don't like to get naked
in front of another man.

549
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, I see. I see.

550
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,800
I don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

551
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,280
You never know what's gonna happen.

552
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,000
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah. That's...

553
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
God bless.

554
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,400
You're what Grammy Hall
would call ''a real Jew''.

555
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
Thank you.

556
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Yeah, well, she hates Jews.
She thinks that they just make money.

557
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
But she's the one.
Is she ever! I'm tellin' you.

558
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,800
So did you do those photographs
in there or what?

559
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,680
<i>Yeah. I sort of dabble around, you know.
I dabble? Listen to me - what a jerk!</i>

560
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,880
<i>They're wonderful, you know.
They have a... a quality.
You are a great-looking girl.</i>

561
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,880
<i>Well, I would like to take
a serious photography course.
He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo.</i>

562
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,080
<i>Photography's interesting
cos it's a new art form,
I wonder what she looks like naked.</i>

563
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,080
and a set of aesthetic criteria
have not emerged yet.

564
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,880
<i>Aesthetic criteria? You mean
whether it's a good photo or not?
I'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there.</i>

565
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,680
<i>The medium enters in
as a condition of the art form itself.
I don't know what I'm saying.</i>

566
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,000
<i>Well... to me... I mean, it's... it's...
It's all instinctive. I just try to feel it.
God, I hope he doesn't turn out</i>

567
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,280
I try to get a sense of it
and not think about it so much.

568
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,680
<i>Still, you need a set of aesthetic
guidelines to put it in social perspective.
Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax!</i>

569
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Well, I don't know.

570
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,080
I guess you must be sort of late, huh?

571
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,400
You know, I gotta get there
and begin whining soon. Otherwise I...

572
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,280
- Hey, are you busy Friday night?
- Me?

573
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Oh, uh, no.

574
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Oh, I'm sorry! I have something.

575
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,880
What about Saturday night?

576
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Nothing. No, no.

577
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,080
You're very popular, I can see.

578
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,000
- I know.
- Do you have plague?

579
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of jerks.

580
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,880
I meet a lot of jerks too. I think that's a...

581
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,600
But I'm thinking about getting some cats.

582
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Oh, wait a second. Oh, no, no!

583
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,600
Oh, shoot! No. Saturday night I'm gonna...

584
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,280
I'm gonna sing. Yeah.

585
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,080
You're gonna sing?
Do you sing? No kidding?

586
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,680
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where? I'd like to come.

587
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,280
- Oh, no!
- I'm interested.

588
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,680
I'm just... I'm auditioning
at this club. I don't...

589
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,600
- It's my first time.
- It's OK. I know exactly what that's like.

590
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,280
You're gonna like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

591
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,680
It had to be you

592
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,280
It had to be you

593
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,880
I wandered around

594
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
And finally found

595
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,200
The somebody who

596
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,880
Could make me be true

597
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,200
Could make me be blue

598
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,280
And even be glad

599
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,600
Just to be sad

600
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,480
Thinking of you

601
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,000
I was awful! I'm so ashamed! I can't sing!

602
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
So the audience was a tad restless.

603
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,080
What do you mean, a tad restless?
They hated me!

604
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,680
They didn't! You have a wonderful voice!

605
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,080
- I'm gonna quit.
- I won't let you. You have a great voice.

606
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,600
- Really? Do you think so? Really?
- Yeah. It's terrific.

607
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,800
I never even took a lesson, either.

608
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Hey, listen. Give me a kiss.

609
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,080
- Really?
- Because we're just gonna go home later.

610
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,880
There's gonna be all that tension and l
won't know when to make the right move.

611
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,480
So we'll kiss now,
we'll get it over with and then go eat.

612
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,800
- We'll digest our food better.
- OK.

613
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,400
So now we can digest our food.

614
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm gonna have the corned beef, please.

615
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,680
Oh. I'm gonna have pastrami
on white bread

616
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,600
with mayonnaise
and tomatoes and lettuce.

617
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,080
So... your second wife left you.
And were you depressed about that?

618
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,200
Nothing that a few megavitamins
couldn't cure.

619
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
And your first wife? Allison?

620
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,800
She was nice, but... That was my fault.
I was just... I was too crazy.

621
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
That was so nice.

622
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,880
That was nice.

623
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,800
As Balzac said,
''There goes another novel.''

624
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
You were great.

625
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,880
Yeah. I'm wrecked.

626
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,000
- You're wrecked!
- I mean it.

627
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
I will never play the piano again.

628
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,600
It was... I don't know.
You really thought it was good?

629
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Yes.

630
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,000
That was the most fun I've ever had
without laughing.

631
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,080
Here. You want some?

632
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,680
No. I... I don't... use
any major hallucinogenics because I...

633
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,000
took a puff about five years ago
at a party and...

634
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,680
Tried to take my pants off over my head.

635
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,280
Something got in one ear.

636
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,400
Well, I don't really...
I don't do it very often.

637
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,480
It just sort of relaxes me.

638
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,000
- You're not gonna believe this, but...
- What?

639
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,800
I'm gonna buy you these books
because I think you should read them.

640
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,680
- Instead of that cat book.
- That's pretty serious stuff there.

641
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,680
Yeah. Cos I'm obsessed with death,
I think. Big subject with me.

642
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,000
I have a very pessimistic view of life.

643
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,480
You should know this
if we're gonna go out.

644
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,480
I feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

645
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Those are the two categories.
The horrible would be like terminal cases.

646
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,280
And blind people. And cripples.
I don't know how they get through life.

647
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,480
And the miserable is everyone else.

648
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
So you should be thankful
that you're miserable.

649
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
You're very lucky to be miserable.

650
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Look at that guy.

651
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
In the pink. Mr Miami Beach there.

652
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,600
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

653
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,480
Placed third.

654
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,280
Look at these guys. They're back from
Fire Island. They're giving it a chance.

655
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,680
- Italian, right?
- Him? Yeah, he's the Mafia.

656
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting, I think.

657
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,800
''Oh, gee! Must have
my moustache waxed.''

658
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,600
There's the winner of
the Truman Capote lookalike contest.

659
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,400
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy.

660
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

661
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,000
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

662
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,800
What does that mean?
I don't know what that is.

663
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,280
You're exceptional in bed
because you get pleasure

664
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,480
in every part of your body when
I touch you. Like the tip of your nose.

665
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,600
If I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps,
you suddenly get excited.

666
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
You know what? I like you.

667
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,680
I really do like you.

668
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,280
Do you love me? That's the key question.

669
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,880
I know you've only known me
a short while.

670
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,200
I think that's sort of...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

671
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Do you love me?

672
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,000
Love is... too weak a word for...
the way I feel.

673
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,480
I lurve you. You know, I loave you.

674
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,480
I luff you. With two Fs.
Yes, I have to invent...

675
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,800
Of course I do. Don't you think I do?

676
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
I don't know.

677
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,480
You're not gonna give up
your apartment, are you?

678
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,600
Of course.

679
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,680
- But why?
- I'm moving in with you.

680
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,280
- But you've got a nice apartment.
- I have a tiny apartment.

681
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,680
- I know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

682
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,400
Granted. lt has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative thing.

683
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,280
You know, bugs are...
Entomology is a rapidly growing field.

684
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,400
- You don't want me to live with you.
- I don't want you to live with me?

685
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
- Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

686
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,880
It was yours, actually.
But I approved it immediately.

687
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I guess you think
I talked you into something, huh?

688
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,400
No! We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

689
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,680
Jesus! You don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

690
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,200
- How is it any different?
- Cos you keep your own apartment.

691
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,400
We don't have to go to it.
We don't have to deal with it.

692
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,800
It's like a free-floating life raft.
That we know that we're not married.

693
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,480
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

694
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

695
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,080
It's got bad plumbing and bugs.

696
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,480
Jesus! My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

697
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,800
- You don't think I'm smart enough.
- Hey, don't be ridiculous.

698
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,880
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like I was dumb?

699
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,080
Adult education's a wonderful thing.

700
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,280
You meet interesting professors.
It's stimulating.

701
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
Does this sound like a good course?

702
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,600
''Modern American Poetry''?

703
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,680
Or let's see now. Maybe I should take...

704
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
''Introduction to the Novel''.

705
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,200
Just don't take any course
where they make you read 'Beowulf'.

706
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,480
Hey, what do you think? You think we
should go to that party in Southampton?

707
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,600
Don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

708
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,200
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the salami or something.

709
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette.

710
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Grass, right? The illusion that it will make
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

711
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,080
- Well, have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

712
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,280
If I have grass or alcohol or anything,
I get unbearably wonderful.

713
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,400
I get too wonderful for words.

714
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

715
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,680
- Well, it relaxes me.
- You have to be artificially relaxed

716
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,880
- before we can go to bed?
- What's the difference?

717
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,400
Take a shot of Sodium Pentothal.
You can sleep through it.

718
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,280
You've been seeing a psychiatrist
for 15 years.

719
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,480
You should smoke this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

720
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,400
- Come on. You don't need that.
- What are you doing?

721
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
- No, Alvy. Please.
- You can live without it once.

722
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Wait. I got a great idea.

723
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,480
Hang in there for a second.
I got a little artefact.

724
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,200
A little erotic artefact
that I brought up from the city

725
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,480
which I think is gonna be perfect.

726
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

727
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,280
Now we can go about our business here

728
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,280
and even develop photographs
if we want to.

729
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,200
- Hey, is something wrong?
- No. Why?

730
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,880
I don't know. It's like you're removed.

731
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,680
- No, I'm fine.
- Really?

732
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,880
I don't know. You seem sorta distant.

733
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's just do it, all right?

734
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,400
Is it my imagination or are you
just going through the motions?

735
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,680
Do you remember where
I put my drawing pad?

736
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,080
While you two are doing that,
I think I'm gonna do some drawing.

737
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,200
- That's what I call removed.
- Oh, you have my body.

738
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,680
Yeah, but I want the whole thing.

739
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,000
Well, I need grass.

740
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,480
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass.

741
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm a comedian. lf I get a laugh
from a person who's high,

742
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,080
it doesn't count,
cos they're always laughing.

743
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,280
- Were you always funny?
- What is this? An interview?

744
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
We're supposed to be making love.

745
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,680
This guy is naturally funny.
I think he can write for you.

746
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

747
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Let me explain how I work.

748
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,280
I don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys that come out.

749
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,280
You know you're gonna fall down.

750
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,000
But material's gotta be sensational for me.
I work with very... I'm kinda classy.

751
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,480
Let me explain. For instance,
I open with a song. Musical style like...

752
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,680
Place looks wonderful from here

753
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,000
And you folks look wonderful from here

754
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,600
And seeing you there
with a smile on your face

755
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,800
Makes me shout
''This must be the place''

756
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,680
Then I open with some jokes.
That's where I need you.

757
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,400
''I just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French up there.''

758
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,880
''The word to remember is 'Jeanne d'Arc'.
It means the light's out in the bathroom.''

759
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,880
''I met a big lumberjack...''

760
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
<i>Jesus! This guy's pathetic.</i>

761
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,080
<i>Look at him mincing around.</i>

762
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
<i>He thinks he's real cute.
You wanna throw up.</i>

763
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,280
<i>If only I had the nerve
to do my own jokes.</i>

764
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,280
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can keep this smile frozen on my face.</i>

765
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,600
<i>I'm in the wrong business. I know it.</i>

766
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,200
<i>''But... chri... ''</i>

767
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,280
''What will I do with this?''

768
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,680
''Oh, Marie! Sometime
you make me so mad!''

769
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,680
They scream at that! Write me something
like that. A French number. Can you do it?

770
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
Where am I? I have to reorient myself.

771
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,400
This is the University of Wisconsin, right?
Cos I'm always... tense...

772
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,680
I have a very bad history with colleges.
I went to New York University.

773
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,000
And I was thrown out of NYU
in my freshman year

774
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,600
for cheating on my metaphysics final.

775
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,880
I looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

776
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
My mother,
an emotionally high-strung woman,

777
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,880
locked herself in the bathroom
and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles.

778
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,200
I was depressed at that time.
I was in analysis.

779
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,200
I was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself.

780
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,880
But I was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

781
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,880
If you kill yourself, they make you pay
for the sessions you miss.

782
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,800
Alvy, you were just great.
I'm not kidding. lt was...

783
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,280
- You were so funny.
- College audiences are wonderful.

784
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,480
And I'm starting to get
more of the references too.

785
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,280
Are you? Well, the 12 o'clock show's
completely different.

786
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.
You'll meet Mother and Father.

787
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
- They'll hate me immediately.
- I don't think so.

788
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,880
I don't think they're gonna hate you at all.
It's Easter. We'll have a nice dinner.

789
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,280
I think they're gonna really like you.

790
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,800
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

791
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Oh, yeah.

792
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,800
Grammy always does such a good job.

793
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,600
A great sauce!

794
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,680
It is. It's dynamite ham.

795
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
We went over to the swap meet.

796
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,200
Annie, Gram and I.
We got some nice picture frames.

797
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,800
We really had a good time.

798
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,800
Ann tells us that you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

799
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,880
Yes. I'm making excellent progress.

800
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,200
Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch,
I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

801
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
- Duane and I went out to the boat basin.
- We were caulking holes all day.

802
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,880
And Randolph Hunt was drunk. As usual.

803
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,280
That Randolph Hunt.
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

804
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,000
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

805
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,200
I can't believe this family.

806
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,880
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

807
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,880
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

808
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,680
And the old lady at the end
of the table is a classic Jew-hater.

809
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,680
They really look American. Very healthy.
Like they never get sick or anything.

810
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,080
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

811
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,400
Let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

812
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,800
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes?

813
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
Is that an excuse? Diabetes?

814
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,480
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

815
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,880
- Is that a reason to steal from his father?
- What are you talking about?

816
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Sure! Defend him!

817
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Pass the wurst there.

818
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,680
Mo Moskowitz, he had a coronary.

819
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
You don't say!

820
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,880
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs Singer?

821
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,000
- We fast.
- Fast?

822
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,800
No food. To atone for our sins.

823
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,880
What sins? I don't understand.

824
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,200
To tell you the truth, neither do we.

825
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,280
Alvy.

826
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Hi, Duane. How's it goin'?

827
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
This is my room.

828
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,800
Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

829
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,880
Can I confess something?

830
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,880
I tell you this because,
as an artist, I think you'll understand.

831
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,680
Sometimes when I'm driving,

832
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,680
on the road at night, I see
two headlights coming toward me.

833
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,680
Fast. I have this sudden impulse
to turn the wheel quickly,

834
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,880
head-on into the oncoming car.

835
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,080
I can anticipate the explosion.

836
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,080
The sound of shattering glass. The...

837
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,280
flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.

838
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,680
Right. Well...

839
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,800
I have to go now, Duane, because I...

840
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,400
I'm due back on the planet Earth.

841
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,880
- Don't let it be so long.
- Look up Uncle Billy.

842
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
- He is adorable.
- Do you think so?

843
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,480
- You're taking them to the airport?
- Duane can. I haven't finished my drink.

844
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,280
Yes, Duane is.
Just a second. I have to get...

845
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,400
- You followed me.
- I didn't follow you.

846
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,680
You followed me!

847
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,080
I was walking behind staring at you.
That's not following.

848
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,280
- What is your definition of following?
- I was spying.

849
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,480
- Do you realise how paranoid you are?
- You've got your arms around a guy.

850
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,680
That is the worst kind of paranoid.

851
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,400
I didn't start out spying.
I thought I'd pick you up after school.

852
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,800
You wanted to keep
the relationship flexible, remember?

853
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,480
You're having an affair
with your professor.

854
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,000
That jerk that teaches that crap course -
Contemporary Crisis in Western Man?

855
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,680
Existential Motifs in Russian Literature!

856
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,680
It's all mental masturbation.

857
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,080
We finally get to a subject
you know about.

858
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Don't knock masturbation.
It's sex with someone I love.

859
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,480
We're not having an affair. He's married.
He just happens to think I'm neat.

860
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,480
Neat. Are you 12 years old?

861
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,480
- That's a Chippewa Falls expression.
- Who cares?!

862
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,480
Next he'll find you keen and peachy.
Then he's got his hand on your ass.

863
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,000
You've always had hostility
towards David.

864
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,680
- You call your teacher David?
- It's his name.

865
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,200
It's a biblical name, right?
What does he call you? Bathsheba?

866
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,200
Alvy, you're the one who never
wanted to make a real commitment.

867
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,280
<i>You don't think I'm smart enough.</i>

868
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,400
<i>We had that argument just last month.
Or don't you remember that day?</i>

869
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
- I'm home!
- Oh, yeah? How did it go?

870
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,280
Oh, it was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

871
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,880
I didn't have to lie down on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

872
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,400
I told her about the family
and my feelings towards men

873
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,800
and my relationship with my brother.

874
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,800
She mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

875
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,880
I'm one of the few males who suffers
from that. Go on. I'm interested.

876
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,480
She said I was very guilty about my
impulses towards marriage and children.

877
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,080
Then I remembered, when I was a kid, I
accidentally saw my parents making love.

878
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,200
All this happened the first hour?

879
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,880
I've been going for 15 years.
I don't have... nothing like that.

880
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,080
I told her my dream and then I cried.

881
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,480
You cried? I have never once cried.
That's fantastic.

882
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,480
I whine. I sit and I whine.

883
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,680
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this
pillow across my face and I can't breathe.

884
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,880
- Sinatra?
- Yeah. Strangling me.

885
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,800
Sure. Because he's a singer
and you're a singer.

886
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,200
It's perfect.
So you're trying to suffocate yourself.

887
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,800
It's a perfect analytic kind of insight.

888
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,400
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

889
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
- What do you mean? Me?
- Yeah, you.

890
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,080
Because in the dream
I break Sinatra's glasses.

891
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,080
You never said Sinatra had glasses. What
are you saying? That I'm suffocating you?

892
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,200
God, Alvy. I did this
really terrible thing to him.

893
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,080
Because then, when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitched voice.

894
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,200
What did the doctor say?

895
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,680
I should probably come five times a week.

896
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,480
I don't think I mind analysis at all. The
only question is, will it change my wife?

897
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
- Will it change your wife?
- My life.

898
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,480
- You said, ''Will it change my wife?''
- I said, ''Will it change my life?''

899
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,480
- You said wife.
- Life! I said life.

900
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,400
She said, ''Will it change my wife?''
You heard that, so I'm not crazy.

901
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,680
I told her I didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously,

902
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
because you don't think
I'm smart enough.

903
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Why do you always bring that up?

904
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,480
Because I encourage you
to take adult education courses?

905
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,200
You meet wonderful,
interesting professors.

906
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,680
Adult education is such junk.
The professors are so phoney.

907
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,000
I don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

908
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,080
And why are you following me around?

909
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,080
- I was following you and David.
- Let's call it quits.

910
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,400
That's fine. That's great.
I don't know what I did wrong.

911
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,080
She cooled off to me.
Is it something that I did?

912
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,680
It's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

913
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,480
Love fades? God!
That's a depressing thought.

914
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,800
I have to ask you a question.
With your wife in bed,

915
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,400
does she need some kind of
artificial stimulation? Like marijuana?

916
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,480
We use a large vibrating egg.

917
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,480
A large vibrating egg?

918
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,280
Well, I ask a psychopath,
I get that kind of an answer. Jesus!

919
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,800
Here. You look like a very happy couple.

920
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,880
- Are you?
- Yeah.

921
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,000
So how do you account for it?

922
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,080
I'm very shallow and empty,

923
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,200
and I have no ideas
and nothing interesting to say.

924
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,600
- And I'm exactly the same way.
- I see. Well, that's very interesting.

925
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,480
So you've managed
to work out something, huh?

926
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,080
Well, thanks very much for talking to me.

927
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,480
<i>Even as a kid, I always went for the
wrong women. I think that's my problem.</i>

928
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,800
<i>My mother took me to see Snow White.
Everyone fell in love with Snow White.</i>

929
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,280
<i>I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.</i>

930
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,280
- We never have any fun any more.
- How can you say that?

931
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,000
You're always leaning on me
to improve myself.

932
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,400
You must be getting your period.

933
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,880
I don't get a period!
I'm a cartoon character.

934
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,000
Can't I be upset once in a while?

935
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,400
Max, forget about Annie.
I know lots of women you can date.

936
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,800
I don't wanna go out
with any other women.

937
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
I have got a girl for you. You'll love her.
She's a reporter for 'Rolling Stone'.

938
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,680
I think there are more people here to see
the Maharishi than there were for Dylan.

939
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,680
I covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

940
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,200
Especially when he sang,
''She takes just like a woman.''

941
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,880
''And she makes love just like a woman.
Yes, she does.''

942
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,880
''And she aches just like a woman.''

943
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,480
''But she breaks just like a little girl.''

944
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,680
After that,
the most charismatic event I covered

945
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,680
was Mick's birthday
at Madison Square Garden.

946
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,280
- That's great. That's just great.
- Did you catch Dylan?

947
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,680
Me? No, I couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

948
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,600
You have a raccoon?

949
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,200
A few.

950
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,680
The only word for this is transplendid.

951
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,800
It's transplendid.

952
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,880
I can think of another word.

953
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,080
He's God. This man is God.
He's got millions of followers

954
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,880
who would crawl across the world
just to touch the hem of his garment.

955
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,880
Yeah? Must be a tremendous hem.

956
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,200
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.

957
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,280
I can't get with any religion
that advertises in 'Popular Mechanics'.

958
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,280
Look. There's God
coming out of the men's room.

959
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,480
It's unbelievably transplendid!

960
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,680
I was at the Stones concert
when they killed that guy.

961
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,280
Were you?
I was at an Alice Cooper thing

962
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,200
where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

963
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,600
I hope you don't mind
that I took so long to finish.

964
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,280
Oh, no. Don't be...
Don't be silly. You know, I...

965
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,080
I'm starting to get
some feeling back in my jaw now.

966
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,080
Sex with you is really
a Kafkaesque experience.

967
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,200
Oh. Thank you.

968
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,200
I mean that as a compliment.

969
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,080
I think... I think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm.

970
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,880
You know, to make up for
empty areas in life.

971
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,880
Who said that?

972
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,880
I don't know. I think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

973
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,880
Oh, hi!

974
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,000
Uh... no. What...

975
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,680
What's the matter?

976
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,800
You sound terrible.

977
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,400
No. Sure, I...

978
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,880
What kind of emergency?

979
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,600
No. Well, stay there.
I'll come over right now.

980
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,080
Just stay there. I'll come right over.

981
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,280
It's me. Open up. Are you OK?

982
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,480
What's the matter? Are you all right?

983
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,680
There's a spider in the bathroom.

984
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,880
What?

985
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,680
There's a big, black spider
in the bathroom.

986
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,200
You got me here at three in the morning
cos there's a spider in the bathroom?

987
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,880
You know how I am about insects. I can't
sleep with a live thing crawling around.

988
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,480
Kill it! What's wrong with you?
Don't you have a can of Raid?

989
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,280
I told you a thousand times. You should
always keep a lotta insect spray.

990
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,600
You never know who's gonna crawl over.

991
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,280
And a first-aid kit
and a fire-extinguisher...

992
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,800
Give me a magazine, cos I'm a little tired.

993
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,800
You make fun of me,
but I'm prepared for anything.

994
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,600
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

995
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,680
Hey, what is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

996
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh, yeah? Really?

997
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,080
How'd you like it?

998
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,080
Was it... I mean, was it heavy?
Did it achieve total heavy-ocity?

999
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,200
It was just great.

1000
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,800
Why don't you get the guy
that took you to the rock concert

1001
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
to come over and kill the spider?

1002
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,600
I called you. You wanna
help me or not, huh?

1003
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,200
Since when do you read
the 'National Review'?

1004
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,200
- What are you turning into?
- I like to try to get all points of view.

1005
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,000
Then get William F Buckley
to kill the spider.

1006
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,880
Alvy, you're a little hostile.
You know that?

1007
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,400
Not only that. You look thin and tired.

1008
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,800
It's three o'clock in the morning!
You got me out of bed.

1009
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,000
I ran over here. I couldn't get a taxi cab.
You said it was an emergency.

1010
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,200
I ran up the stairs. I was a lot more
attractive when the evening began.

1011
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,280
Are you going with a right-wing
rock-and-roll star?

1012
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,880
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

1013
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,600
Hey, what am I? Your son?
I came over for...

1014
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,680
I got the good chocolate.

1015
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,480
- Where's the spider?
- It's in the bathroom.

1016
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,400
Don't squish it. And after it's dead,
flush it down the toilet a couple of times.

1017
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,800
Darling, I've been killing spiders
since I was 30, OK?

1018
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,800
It's a very big spider.
Lotta trouble. There's two of them.

1019
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,800
I didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider. You got a broom?

1020
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's at your house. I think I left it there.
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

1021
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,480
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

1022
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,280
- What is this? You got black soap?
- It's for my complexion.

1023
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,200
What, are you joining a minstrel show?

1024
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,280
Don't worry!

1025
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,680
I did it. I killed them both.
What are you sad about?

1026
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,480
What did you want me to do?
Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?

1027
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,600
- Oh, don't go. Please.
- What do you mean, don't...

1028
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,680
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

1029
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,880
What's the matter?

1030
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't know. I miss you.

1031
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,680
- Oh, Jesus. Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1032
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
- Alvy?
- What?

1033
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Was there somebody in your room
when I called you?

1034
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,280
- What do you mean?
- Was there... I thought I heard a voice.

1035
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,080
I had the radio on. I'm sorry -
it was the television set.

1036
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
I was watching...

1037
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,200
Alvy, let's never break up again.

1038
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,480
I don't wanna be apart.

1039
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,200
I think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

1040
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,680
Living together
hasn't been so bad, has it?

1041
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,480
No. For me, it's been terrific. You know?

1042
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,000
Better than either one of my marriages.

1043
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,280
There's just something different about
you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.

1044
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,000
You know, I think that if you let me,
maybe I could help you have more fun.

1045
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,080
I mean, I know it's hard. It's...

1046
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,280
Alvy, what about...
what if we go away this weekend?

1047
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,400
Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us
would drive into Brooklyn?

1048
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,200
We could show you the old
neighbourhood. That'd be fun for you.

1049
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,080
Yeah, it would.

1050
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,200
Oh, my God! It's a great day!

1051
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,280
Watch the road!
You're gonna total the whole car!

1052
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,280
I've never even been to Brooklyn.

1053
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,480
I can't wait to see the old neighbourhood.
We can show her the schoolyard.

1054
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,880
I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max.
The best. I was all-schoolyard.

1055
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,080
They threw him a football once
and he tried to dribble it.

1056
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,200
I used to lose my glasses a lot.

1057
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,880
Oh, look! That's my old house.
That's where I used to live.

1058
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,080
Holy cow!

1059
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,000
You're lucky. Where I lived is now
a pornographic equipment store.

1060
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,600
I have some very good memories there.

1061
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,200
Your mother and father
fighting all the time?

1062
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,080
Yeah, and always over
the most ridiculous things.

1063
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,400
- You fired the cleaner?
- She stole!

1064
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,680
She's coloured!
They have enough trouble!

1065
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,080
- She went through my pocketbook!
- They're persecuted enough!

1066
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,080
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it!

1067
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,400
How can we afford it? On your pay?
What if she steals more?

1068
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,400
She's a coloured woman from Harlem!
She has no money!

1069
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,400
She's got a right to steal from us!
Who is she gonna steal from if not us?

1070
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,000
- You're both crazy!
- They can't hear you, Max.

1071
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,880
Leo, I married a fool!

1072
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,800
Hey, Max. What's that?

1073
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,280
That's the welcome-home party,
1945, for my cousin Herbie.

1074
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,000
Look. There. That's Joey Nichols.
He was my father's friend.

1075
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,680
He was always bothering me
when I was a kid.

1076
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,000
Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.

1077
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,080
See? Nickels.

1078
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,600
You see? Nickels.
You can always remember my name.

1079
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,200
Just think of Joey Five Cents.

1080
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,080
That's me! Joey Five Cents!

1081
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,080
What an asshole.

1082
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,280
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister Tessie.

1083
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,880
I was always the sister
with good common sense.

1084
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,280
Tessie was always
the one with personality.

1085
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,280
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1086
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,680
Tessie Moskowitz had the personality.
She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt.

1087
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
She was once a great beauty.

1088
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,000
Tessie, they say you were
the sister with personality.

1089
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,080
I was a great beauty.

1090
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,880
- How did this personality come about?
- I was very charming.

1091
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,680
There were many men interested in you?

1092
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,280
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

1093
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,280
That's very hard to believe.

1094
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,880
Well, I had a really good day. lt was just
a real fine way to spend my birthday.

1095
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,480
- Your birthday's not till tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1096
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,800
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

1097
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,200
I wonder what this is.

1098
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,480
- Happy birthday.
- What is this?

1099
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,800
Is this a present? Are you kidding?

1100
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,880
- Yeah. Why don't you try it on?
- Yeah? I don't...

1101
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,480
- This is more like a present for you.
- It'll add ten years to our sex life.

1102
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,280
- Yeah. Forget it.
- Here's a real present.

1103
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?

1104
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,480
- Check it out.
- Let me see.

1105
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,480
OK. Let's see.

1106
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,280
Oh, God!

1107
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,000
You knew I wanted this.
God! It's terrific.

1108
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,880
Just put on the watch and the...
and that thing and everything.

1109
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,800
Oh, God. Oh.

1110
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,680
Seems like

1111
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,800
Old times

1112
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Having you

1113
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,400
To walk with

1114
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,880
Seems like

1115
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,600
Old times

1116
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,080
Having you to walk with

1117
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,280
And it's still a thrill

1118
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:31,080
Just to have my arms around you

1119
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,800
Still the thrill

1120
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,400
That it was the day I found you

1121
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,800
Seems like

1122
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:57,880
Old times

1123
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,800
Dinner dates and flowers

1124
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:12,000
Old times

1125
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Staying up all hours

1126
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:23,280
Making dreams come true

1127
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:32,400
Doing things we used to do

1128
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:43,280
Seems like old times

1129
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,600
Here with

1130
01:03:52,080 --> 01:04:01,000
You

1131
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,400
Thank you.

1132
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,200
You were sensational. I told you
if you stuck to it you would be great.

1133
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,480
And... and you know...
you were sensational.

1134
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,600
Well, Alvy, they were
just a terrific audience.

1135
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,680
It makes it really easy for me
because I can be...

1136
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,080
Excuse me.

1137
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,600
Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

1138
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,680
We just wanted to stop by and say
that we really enjoyed your set.

1139
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,680
Oh, yeah, really?

1140
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,600
I thought it was very musical
and I liked it a lot.

1141
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,680
That's really nice. Thanks a lot.

1142
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,080
Are you recording? Do you...
Are you with any label now?

1143
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,680
Me? No.

1144
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,200
No. Not at all.

1145
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,480
Well, I'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

1146
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,880
- Possibly working together.
- Well, that's nice.

1147
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,280
Oh, listen. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

1148
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,200
No, but I know your work.
I'm a big fan of yours.

1149
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Thank you very much.

1150
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,200
This is Shaun and Bob and...
Bob and Petronia.

1151
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,280
Hi.

1152
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,600
We're going back to the Pierre.
We're staying at the Pierre.

1153
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,880
We're gonna meet Jack
and Anjelica and have a drink.

1154
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,680
If you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1155
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,000
We can just sit and talk. Nothing...

1156
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,880
Not a big deal. It's just relaxed.
It would just be very mellow.

1157
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,600
Remember we have that thing.

1158
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,200
What thing?

1159
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,600
Don't you remember we discussed
that thing that we were... We had a...

1160
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,680
Oh, the thing!

1161
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,800
Yeah...

1162
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,280
Oh, well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine too. We'll do it another time.

1163
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,080
Maybe if you're on the coast,
we'll get together and meet there.

1164
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,680
It was a wonderful set. I really enjoyed it.

1165
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,800
Nice to have met you. Good night.

1166
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Bye.

1167
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,080
What's the matter?
You wanted to go to that party?

1168
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,680
I don't know.
I thought it might be kinda fun.

1169
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,880
It would be nice
to meet some new people.

1170
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:04,600
I don't think I could take a mellow
evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

1171
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,480
I have a tendency to...
If I get too mellow, I ripen and then rot.

1172
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,600
It's not good for my...

1173
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,280
So you don't wanna go to the party.
So what do you wanna do?

1174
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,880
That was the last day I remember
really having a good time.

1175
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,880
- We never have any laughs any more.
- I've been moody and dissatisfied.

1176
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,080
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1177
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,600
- Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
- Constantly. I'd say three times a week.

1178
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,480
- The other night Alvy wanted to have sex.
- She would not sleep with me.

1179
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,080
Then... I don't know... Six months ago
I would have done it just to please him.

1180
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,400
I tried everything, you know.
I put on soft music and my red light bulb.

1181
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,400
But the thing is,
since our discussions here,

1182
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,880
I feel I have a right to my own feelings.

1183
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,600
I think you would have been happy
because I asserted myself.

1184
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,400
I'm paying for her analysis. And she's
making progress and I'm getting screwed.

1185
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,280
I feel so guilty because
Alvy is paying for it.

1186
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,200
So I do feel guilty
if I don't go to bed with him.

1187
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,000
If I do go to bed with him, it's like
I'm going against my own feelings.

1188
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,000
She's making progress and I'm not.
Her progress is killing my progress.

1189
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,080
Sometimes I think
I should just live with a woman.

1190
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,200
I don't believe it! You mean to tell me
you guys have never snorted coke?

1191
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,680
Well, I always wanted to try.
But Alvy, he's very down on it.

1192
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,600
Don't put it on me. I don't wanna put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

1193
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,680
There's the nasal membrane.

1194
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,280
- You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
- How can you say that?

1195
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,680
I said that you, I and that girl from your
acting class should have a threesome.

1196
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,480
- Well, that's sick!
- I know it's sick, but it's new.

1197
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,600
You didn't say it couldn't be sick.

1198
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,680
Come on, Alvy.

1199
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,680
Do your body a favour. Try it.

1200
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,680
I'm sure it's a lot of fun,
cos the lncas did it.

1201
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,680
And they were a million laughs.

1202
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,800
Come on. For your own experience.
You wanna write.

1203
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,800
It's great stuff. A friend of mine
just brought it in from California.

1204
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,680
Oh, you know, we're going
to California next week.

1205
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,280
It's incredible. I'm thrilled, as you know.

1206
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,200
On my agent's advice, I sold out
and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

1207
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,880
No. That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on television.

1208
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,480
You act like
you're violating a moral issue.

1209
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,200
We have to leave New York
during Christmas week, which kills me.

1210
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:26,400
Listen, while you're in California, could
you possibly score some coke for me?

1211
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,280
Oh, sure. I'd be glad to. I'll just put it
in a hollow heel that I have on my boot.

1212
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,680
How much is this stuff, incidentally?

1213
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,800
It's about $2,000 an ounce.

1214
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,880
Really? And what is the kick of it?
Cos I never...

1215
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,800
I've never been so relaxed
as I have been since I moved here, Max.

1216
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,000
I want you to see my house. I live next to
Hugh Hefner. He lets me use the Jacuzzi.

1217
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,000
And the women are like
the women in 'Playboy' magazine,

1218
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
only they can move their arms and legs.

1219
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,280
I can't get over it -
this is really Beverly Hills.

1220
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,600
The architecture's so consistent.

1221
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,800
French next to Spanish
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1222
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,880
God! It's so clean out here.

1223
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,480
They don't throw their garbage out.
They make it into TV shows.

1224
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,880
Give us a break, Max. It's Christmas.

1225
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Can you believe this is Christmas?

1226
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,600
It was snowing and
really grey in New York, naturally.

1227
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,880
Santa Claus'll have sunstroke.

1228
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,600
Max, there's no crime.
There's no mugging.

1229
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,680
There's no economic crime.

1230
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,880
But there's ritual religious-cult murders.
There's wheat-germ killers out here.

1231
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,200
While you're out here,
I want you to see some of my TV show.

1232
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,800
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

1233
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,480
All right now, Charlie,
give me a good laugh here.

1234
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,480
<i>..limousine to the track break down?</i>

1235
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,480
A little bigger.

1236
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,080
Max, you realise how immoral this all is?

1237
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,200
- Max, I got a hit series.
- I know. But you're adding fake laughs.

1238
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,880
<i>..home so early.</i>

1239
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,280
Give me a tremendous laugh here,
Charlie.

1240
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,800
We do this show live
in front of an audience.

1241
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,480
And nobody laughs,
cos the jokes aren't funny.

1242
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,680
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1243
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,280
<i>Honey, you'd better lie down.
You've been in the sun too long.</i>

1244
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,880
Now give me
a medium-sized chuckle here.

1245
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,880
And then a big hand.

1246
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,680
Is there booing on that?

1247
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,600
Oh, Max.

1248
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,400
I don't feel well.

1249
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,800
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I just got... very dizzy.

1250
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,080
- I feel dizzy, Max.
- Well, sit down.

1251
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,800
Oh, Jesus!

1252
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,880
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

1253
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,800
- You wanna lie down?
- No. My stomach felt queasy all morning.

1254
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,800
- How about a ginger ale?
- Oh... Max, no.

1255
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,880
Maybe I'd better lie down.

1256
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,280
Why don't you try to get a little
of this down? It's just plain chicken.

1257
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Oh, no. I can't eat this.

1258
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,480
I'm nauseous.

1259
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,200
If you can just give me something
to get me through the next two hours.

1260
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,880
I have to go out to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

1261
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,280
There's nothing wrong with you,
actually, so far as I can tell.

1262
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,200
You have no fever.
No symptoms of anything serious.

1263
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,000
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor.

1264
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,000
Alvy, that was the show.
They said everything is fine.

1265
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,400
They found a replacement
so they're going to tape without you.

1266
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,480
Jesus! Now I don't get to do the TV show?

1267
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,080
- I know. Listen, doctor.
- I was just saying, I can't find anything.

1268
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,880
- Nothing at all?
- No. I could get a lab man up here.

1269
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,880
Can I have the salt, please?

1270
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,000
Perhaps it would be even better
if we took him to hospital for a day or two.

1271
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,080
Otherwise there's no real way
to tell what's going on.

1272
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,880
This is not bad, actually.

1273
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,680
Don't tell me we have to walk
from the car to the house.

1274
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,080
My feet haven't touched pavement
since I reached Los Angeles.

1275
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,480
I'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1276
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,680
I took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1277
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,680
All the good meetings are taken.

1278
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,680
Right now it's only a notion.
But I think I can get money

1279
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,680
to make it into a concept,
and then turn it into an idea.

1280
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,600
Like this house, Max?

1281
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,000
I even brought a map
to get us to the bathroom.

1282
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,600
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1283
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,680
What difference does that make?

1284
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,000
- I think he has a thing for Annie.
- No. Unfortunately, Max,

1285
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,400
- he goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1286
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,480
The one with the VPL.

1287
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,600
Visible Panty Line.

1288
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,200
- Max, she is gorgeous.
- Yeah, she's a ten, Max.

1289
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,600
- Great for you, cos you're used to twos.
- There are no twos, Max.

1290
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,200
The kind with shopping bags in Central
Park with surgical masks on, muttering.

1291
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,080
How do you like this couple? They just
came back from Masters and Johnson.

1292
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,200
Yeah. Intensive care ward.

1293
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,800
My God. Hey, Max,
I think she's giving me the eye.

1294
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,880
If she comes over,
my brain'll turn into guacamole.

1295
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,080
- Hi.
- You're Alvy Singer, right?

1296
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,080
- Didn't we meet at EST?
- No, I was never to EST.

1297
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,480
- Then how can you criticise it?
- Oh, he didn't say anything.

1298
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,400
I came out to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1299
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,400
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How you doing?

1300
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,680
- You taste to see if the food's poisoned?
- Yeah. He's crazy.

1301
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,680
You guys are wearing white. lt must be
in the stars. Uri Geller must be here.

1302
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,680
We're gonna operate together.

1303
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,880
We just need about six weeks. ln six
weeks we could cut the whole album.

1304
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,080
I don't know. This is strange to me.

1305
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,600
You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing you can have.

1306
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,480
- Yeah? Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1307
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,400
I don't know.

1308
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,880
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good meeting.

1309
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,080
This is a great house. Really.
Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1310
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,200
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.

1311
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,800
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1312
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,280
Charlie Chaplin.
Right before his un-American thing.

1313
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,080
That's great.

1314
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,800
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, I love it there.

1315
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,600
I used to live there. I used to live there
for years, but... It's so dirty now.

1316
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,680
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.

1317
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,400
This is a really nice
screening room, Tony.

1318
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,680
There's another thing about New York.

1319
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,080
If you wanna see a movie, you have to
stand in line. It could be freezing.

1320
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,480
We saw 'Grand Illusion' here last night.

1321
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,080
Hey, that's a great film if you're high.

1322
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,280
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing.

1323
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,280
No, thanks, man. I'm cool.

1324
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,400
It's wonderful. They just eat
and watch movies all day.

1325
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,480
And gradually you get old and die.

1326
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,080
It's important to make an effort
once in a while.

1327
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,600
Do you think his girlfriend's beautiful?

1328
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,200
A tad on the androgynous side,
but dynamite.

1329
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,600
Yeah. I forgot my mantra.

1330
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
<i>That was fun.</i>

1331
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,400
<i>I don't think California's bad at all.</i>

1332
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,680
<i>It's a drag coming home.</i>

1333
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
<i>A lot of beautiful women.</i>

1334
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,880
<i>It was fun to flirt.</i>

1335
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
<i>I have to face facts.</i>

1336
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,080
<i>I adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work any more.</i>

1337
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,880
<i>I'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.</i>

1338
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,000
<i>What do I need this?</i>

1339
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,480
<i>If only I had the nerve to break up.
But it would really hurt him.</i>

1340
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,280
<i>If only I didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.</i>

1341
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,480
<i>It'd probably wreck her.
But I should be honest.</i>

1342
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,680
Alvy, let's face it. You know...

1343
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,680
I don't think our relationship is working.

1344
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,800
I know. A relationship,
I think, is like a shark.

1345
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,080
It has to constantly
move forward, or it dies.

1346
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,400
And I think what we got
on our hands is a dead shark.

1347
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,280
Whose 'Catcher in the Rye' is this?

1348
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,080
If it has my name on it,
then I guess it's mine.

1349
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,280
It sure has... You wrote
your name in all my books

1350
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,680
cos you knew this day was gonna come.

1351
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,080
Alvy, you wanted to break up
just as much as I do.

1352
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:05,480
No question. I think we're doing
the mature thing, without any doubt.

1353
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,600
All the books on death and dying are
yours, and all the poetry books are mine.

1354
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:15,080
'Denial of Death'. This is the first book
that I got you. Remember that day?

1355
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,680
Jeez, I feel like
there's a great weight off my back. Hm.

1356
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,680
Oh. Thanks, Annie.

1357
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,200
Oh, no, no, no. I mean,
I think it's really important for us

1358
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,200
to explore new relationships
and stuff like that.

1359
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,400
There's no question about that. Cos
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1360
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,000
My analyst thinks this move is key for me.

1361
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,800
And, you know, I trust her.
Because my analyst recommended her.

1362
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,400
Why should I put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1363
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,600
And you know what the beauty part is?

1364
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,800
- We can always get back together again.
- Exactly.

1365
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,480
I don't think many couples could handle
this. Just break up and remain friends.

1366
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,280
Hey, this one's mine, this button.
I guess these are all yours.

1367
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,680
Impeach Eisenhower. Impeach Nixon.

1368
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,800
Impeach Lyndon Johnson.
Impeach Ronald Reagan.

1369
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,880
I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.

1370
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,480
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

1371
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,600
Then the hell with her.
If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there.

1372
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,480
- He's a jerk, for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1373
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,200
He may have... Listen, Harvard makes
mistakes too. Kissinger taught there.

1374
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Don't tell me you're jealous.

1375
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,880
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea.

1376
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Can I show you something, lady?
I have here... I found this in the apartment.

1377
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,600
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

1378
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,680
Don't ask me why.

1379
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,080
Why don't you go out with other women?

1380
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,680
Well, I tried. But it's...
you know, it's very depressing.

1381
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,600
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

1382
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,200
What are you making such a big deal
about? They're only lobsters.

1383
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,200
You're a grown man.
You know how to pick up a lobster.

1384
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,480
- I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
- When did you quit?

1385
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,680
16 years ago.

1386
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,280
What do you mean?

1387
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,600
Mean?

1388
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,800
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
Is that what you said?

1389
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,280
I don't understand.

1390
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,400
Are you joking or what?

1391
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,680
Central Park's turning green.

1392
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,680
Yeah. I saw that lunatic
that we used to see

1393
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,800
with the pinwheel hat,
you know, and the roller skates.

1394
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,400
Listen, I... I want you to come back here.

1395
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,880
Well... Then I'm gonna
come out there and get you.

1396
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,400
What do you mean, where am l?
Where do you think I am?

1397
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,200
I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in.

1398
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,600
I... Well, I flew in to see you.

1399
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,800
Hey, listen. Can we not
debate this on the telephone?

1400
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,280
Because I feel that I got a temperature.

1401
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,080
And I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles
nausea already. I don't feel so good.

1402
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:03,600
<i>Wherever you wanna meet. I don't care.
I'll drive in. I rented a car.</i>

1403
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,400
<i>I'm driving. What do you...</i>

1404
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,400
<i>What, is that such a miracle?
I'm driving myself.</i>

1405
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,680
I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and...

1406
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,680
a plate of mashed yeast.

1407
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,680
You look very pretty.

1408
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,280
Oh, no. I just lost a little weight, that's all.

1409
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,280
Well... you look nice.

1410
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,000
I've been thinking about it,
and I think that we should get married.

1411
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,480
Oh, Alvy. Come on.

1412
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,280
Why? You wanna live out here?

1413
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,480
It's like living in Munchkin Land.

1414
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,880
What do you mean?
It's perfectly fine out here.

1415
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,000
I mean, Tony's very nice.

1416
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,200
And... well, I meet people
and I go to parties and we play tennis.

1417
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,280
I mean, that's a very big step for me,
you know.

1418
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,680
I mean, I'm able to enjoy people more.

1419
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,400
So... you're not gonna
come back to New York?

1420
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,200
What's so great about New York? It's
a dying city. You read 'Death in Venice'.

1421
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,080
You didn't read 'Death in Venice'
till I bought it for you.

1422
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,800
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word ''death'' in the title.

1423
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,080
Cos it's an important issue.

1424
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,480
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life.

1425
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,480
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1426
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,000
You're like this island unto yourself.

1427
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,800
I can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1428
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,280
If one guy is starving someplace,
that's... it puts a crimp in my evening.

1429
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,480
So you wanna get married or what?

1430
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,680
No. We're friends.

1431
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,680
I wanna remain friends.

1432
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,800
OK.

1433
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,600
Check, please!

1434
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,800
You're mad, aren't you?

1435
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,280
Yes, of course I'm mad.
Because you love me. I know that.

1436
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:26,000
Alvy, I can't say that that's true
at this point in my life. I really can't.

1437
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,080
You know how wonderful you are.

1438
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,600
You know you're the reason that I got out
of my room and that I was able to sing

1439
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,880
and get more in touch
with my feelings and all that crap.

1440
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,480
Anyway, look, I don't wanna...
Listen, listen, listen...

1441
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,680
So what are you up to anyway, huh?

1442
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,600
The usual, you know. I'm trying to write.
I'm working on a play.

1443
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So what are you saying? You're not
coming back to New York with me?

1444
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,880
No. Look...

1445
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,800
I gotta go.

1446
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,400
- I flew 3,000 miles to see you.
- I'm late.

1447
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,400
Air miles. You know what
that does to my stomach?

1448
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,480
It's a hectic time for Tony.
The Grammies are tonight.

1449
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,400
- The what?
- He's got a lot of records up for awards.

1450
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,480
They give awards for that music?
I thought just earplugs.

1451
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,400
Just forget it!
Let's just forget the conversation.

1452
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,880
Awards! They do nothing
but give out awards! I can't believe it.

1453
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,680
Greatest fascist dictator - Adolf Hitler.

1454
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:56,080
I know what you're gonna say. I'm not a
great driver. I have some problems with...

1455
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,080
Can I see your licence, please?

1456
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,800
Just don't get angry or anything, cos I...

1457
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,880
I have my licence here.

1458
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It's a rented car and I... I...

1459
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,080
Here.

1460
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,080
Don't give me your life...

1461
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,080
story.

1462
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,200
Just pick up the licence.

1463
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,600
You have to ask nicely cos I've had
an extremely rough day. My girlfriend...

1464
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,680
Just give me the licence, please.

1465
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,200
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1466
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,880
I have a terrific problem with authority.

1467
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,680
It's not your fault. Don't take it personal.

1468
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,280
So long, fellas. Keep in touch.

1469
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:50,480
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call, Max.

1470
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,680
Yeah. I had the feeling
that I got you at a bad moment.

1471
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,000
I heard high-pitched squealing.

1472
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,080
Twins, Max.

1473
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,280
16-year-olds.

1474
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,000
Can you imagine
the mathematical possibilities of that?

1475
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:09,000
You're an actor, Max. You should be
doing Shakespeare in the Park.

1476
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,880
I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.
I got mugged.

1477
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,480
I was playing Richard II, and two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1478
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,280
Max, are we driving through plutonium?

1479
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,000
It keeps out the alpha rays, Max.

1480
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,080
You don't get old.

1481
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,000
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

1482
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,680
What is so incredibly great
about New York?

1483
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,680
It's a dying city.
You read 'Death in Venice'.

1484
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,080
You didn't read it till I gave it to you.

1485
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,400
You only give me books
with ''death'' in the title.

1486
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,200
- It's an important issue.
- You are totally incapable of enjoying life.

1487
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,680
You're like New York. You're an island.

1488
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,480
OK. lf that's all that we've been
through together means to you,

1489
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,000
I guess it's better if we just
say goodbye, once and for all.

1490
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,280
You know, it's funny, after all the serious
talks and passionate moments,

1491
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:05,200
that it ends here, in a health-food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1492
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,480
Goodbye, Sunny.

1493
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,080
Wait.

1494
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,080
I'm gonna go with you.

1495
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,080
I love you.

1496
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,400
What do you want? lt was my first play.

1497
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,600
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art

1498
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,000
because it's real difficult in life.

1499
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,080
Interestingly, however,
I did run into Annie again.

1500
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,800
It was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

1501
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,200
<i>She had moved back to New York.
She was living in SoHo with some guy.</i>

1502
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,000
<i>And when I met her, she was dragging
him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity,</i>

1503
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,000
<i>which I counted as a personal triumph.</i>

1504
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,000
<i>Annie and I had lunch
sometime after that and...</i>

1505
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,400
<i>just kicked around old times.</i>

1506
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:55,080
<i> Just to have my arms</i>

1507
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:00,000
<i> Around you</i>

1508
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,200
<i> Still the thrill that it was</i>

1509
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,480
<i> The day I found you</i>

1510
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:15,480
<i> Seems like</i>

1511
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,600
<i> Old times</i>

1512
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:30,600
<i> Dinner dates and flowers</i>

1513
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,600
<i> Old times</i>

1514
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,880
<i>After that, it got pretty late
and we both had to go.</i>

1515
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,280
<i>But it was great seeing Annie again.
I realised what a terrific person she was</i>

1516
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,000
<i>and how much fun it was
just knowing her.</i>

1517
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,800
<i>And I thought of that old joke, you know.</i>

1518
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,880
<i>This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says,</i>

1519
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,680
<i>''Doc, my brother's crazy.
He thinks he's a chicken. ''</i>

1520
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,200
<i>And the doctor says,
''Well, why don't you turn him in?''</i>

1521
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,280
<i>And the guy says,
''I would, but I need the eggs. ''</i>

1522
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,680
<i>Well, I guess that's pretty much now
how I feel about relationships.</i>

1523
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,600
<i>You know, they're totally irrational
and crazy and absurd and...</i>

1524
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:16,800
<i>But I guess we keep going through it
because most of us need the eggs.</i>
