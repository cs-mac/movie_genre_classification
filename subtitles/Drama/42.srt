2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,921
<i>In 1945, America's greatest generation
came back from war.</i>

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,646
<i>The flags of freedom fly over Europe.</i>

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,960
<i>Nazi Germany had been defeated...</i>

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,085
<i>...and 3 months later,
Imperial Japan surrendered as well.</i>

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,647
<i>And there's jubilation around this earth.</i>

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,169
<i>Men returned home. Among them,
some of baseball's most beloved names.</i>

8
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,449
<i>Musial. DiMaggio. Williams.</i>

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,251
<i>Life in the United States
could return to normal.</i>

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,289
<i>- What's the guy's name?
- What's on second?</i>

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,840
<i>- Who's on second?
- Who's on first?</i>

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,086
<i>- I don't know.
- Third base.</i>

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,683
<i>And baseball was proof positive
that democracy was real.</i>

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,650
<i>A baseball box score, after all,
is a democratic thing.</i>

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,531
<i>It doesn't say how big you are
or what religion you follow.</i>

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,365
<i>It does not know how you voted
or the color of your skin.</i>

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,121
<i>It simply states what kind of ballplayer
you were on any particular day.</i>

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,924
<i>And he did it. It's a home run.</i>

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,923
<i>They knew he'd do it.</i>

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,323
<i>African Americans
had served their country gallantly.</i>

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,529
<i>They returned home from fighting
to free the world from tyranny...</i>

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,526
<i>...only to find racism, segregation
and Jim Crow law still waiting at home.</i>

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,047
<i>Segregation was the law...</i>

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,443
<i>...and no group was more scrupulous
in its observance of custom...</i>

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,170
<i>...than organized baseball.</i>

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,760
<i>There was a long road ahead.</i>

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,887
<i>If African Americans dreamed
of playing baseball...</i>

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,690
<i>...it was not for the Yankees...</i>

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,208
<i>...but for teams like the Kansas City
Monarchs of the Negro Leagues...</i>

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,001
<i>...where the barnstorming style of play
stood in contrast to the Majors.</i>

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,330
<i>In 1946, there were
16 Major League baseball teams...</i>

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,882
<i>...with a total of 400 players
on their rosters.</i>

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,691
<i>Every one of the 400 players
were white.</i>

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,529
<i>But when opening day came in 1947,
that number dropped to 399...</i>

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,603
<i>...and one man stood apart.</i>

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,529
Gentlemen, I have a plan.

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,611
Plan's good, Mr. Rickey.
You always have one.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,445
My wife says I'm too old. Heh, heh.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,045
That my health's not up to it.

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,121
My son says, uh, everybody in...

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,290
Everybody in baseball
is gonna be against me. Heh.

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,522
But I'm gonna do it.

43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,602
Do what, Mr. Rickey?

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,808
I'm gonna bring a Negro ballplayer...

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,451
...to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,125
With all due respect, sir,
have you lost your mind?

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,406
Think... Think about...

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,086
Think about the abuse...

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,527
...that you are gonna take
from the newspapers...

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,524
...let alone how this is gonna play out
in Flatbush!

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,809
Please, Mr. Rickey.

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,963
Sit down, Harold.

53
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,491
No law against it, Clyde.

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,965
No.

55
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,801
No, but there's a code.

56
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,527
You break a law and get away with it,
some people think you're smart.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,401
You break an unwritten law...

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,001
...you'll be an outcast.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,201
Mm-hm.

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,364
So be it.

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,446
New York's full of Negro baseball fans.

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,121
Dollars aren't black and white,
they're green.

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,726
Every dollar's green.

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,248
I don't know who he is...

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,883
...or where he is...

66
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,643
...but he's coming.

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,811
Hey, runner!

68
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,169
Where'd you learn to move like that,
at a dime-a-dance night?

69
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,850
Stand still!

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,411
There you are!

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,881
Ball!

72
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,484
Safe!

73
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,526
Catcher!

74
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,569
When you gonna start throwing for real?

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,006
You talking to me?

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,162
You got a rag arm, catcher.

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,530
Steal home.
You'll find out what kind of arm I got.

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,444
Okay.

79
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,766
I'm coming.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,764
Where's your shortstop from?

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,081
California.

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,402
Sure got a mouth on him.

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,407
<i>Safe!</i>

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,769
<i>Discussions
concerning Japan's offer of surrender.</i>

85
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,406
<i>Washington, London, Moscow,
and Chungking...</i>

86
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,608
<i>...now framing their decision.</i>

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,122
<i>When this decision will be communicated
to Tokyo via the government's...</i>

88
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,647
- Fill her up?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,451
You boys heading out?
Uh, Chicago.

90
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,409
Chicago, huh? Heh.

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,283
- You boys get around.
- Yeah, we sure do.

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,563
- Hey. Hey, you, where you going?
- To the toilet.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,410
Hell, come on, boy.
You know you can't go in there.

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,123
Them Cokes are a nickel.

95
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,645
Take that hose out of the tank.

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,484
- Robinson.
- What?

97
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,969
I said take it out.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,685
We'll get our 99 gallons of gas
someplace else.

99
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,525
All right, then. Go on.

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,450
Go on! Use it.

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,484
Roy Campanella.

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,168
Hell of a player. He's too sweet.
They'd eat him alive.

103
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,810
All right.

104
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,282
Oh, sorry. Oh, wait. Sorry.

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,723
- Satchel Paige, then.
- He's too old.

106
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,362
We need a player with a future,
not a past.

107
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,925
Here.

108
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,809
Jack Roosevelt Robinson.

109
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,407
4-sport college man, out of UCLA.
That means he's played with white boys.

110
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,724
Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs.

111
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,407
26 years old.
He's batting .350. 3-50.

112
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,363
Methodist.

113
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,851
Commissioned Army officer.

114
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,371
He was court-martialed.

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,090
<i>He's a troublemaker.</i>

116
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,567
<i>Well, he argues with umpires.</i>

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,524
<i>A quick temper is his reputation.</i>

118
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,600
<i>Well, what was he court-martialed for?</i>

119
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,009
<i>Wouldn't sit in the back
of a military bus. Fort Hood, Texas.</i>

120
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,084
Driver asked him to, uh, move back.

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,768
MPs had to take him off.

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,846
There, you see?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,163
I see he resents segregation.

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,688
If he were white, we'd call that spirit.

125
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,691
Robinson's a Methodist.

126
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,763
I'm a Methodist. God's a Methodist.

127
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,089
We can't go wrong. Find him.

128
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,404
Bring him here.

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,600
How are you, fellas?
I'm looking for your, uh, shortstop.

130
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,121
You Jackie Robinson?

131
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,484
Who are you?

132
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>Mr. Rickey.</i>

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,250
What's this about?

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,606
This is about baseball, Jackie.

135
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,684
I see you starting in spring
with our affiliate in Montreal.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,968
If you make it there...

137
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,688
...we'll try you down here...

138
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,241
...with the Dodgers.

139
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,966
With the white Brooklyn Dodgers.

140
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,523
Hmm.

141
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,490
I'll pay you $600 a month.

142
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,762
And a $3500 bonus
when you sign the contract.

143
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,967
That agreeable?

144
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,444
- Yes, that's fine but...
- There's one condition.

145
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,770
I know you can hit behind the runner.
That you can read a pitch.

146
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,327
One question is...

147
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,528
...can you control your temper?

148
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,487
My temper?

149
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,967
Yes, your temper! What are you, deaf?

150
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,726
A black man in white baseball, heh,
can you imagine the reaction?

151
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,008
The vitriol?

152
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,567
Dodgers check into a hotel,
a, uh, a decent, good hotel.

153
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,041
You're worn out from the road.

154
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,926
Some clerk won't give you the pen
to sign in with.

155
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,682
"We got no room for you, boy. Not even
down in the coal bin where you belong."

156
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,811
Team stops at a restaurant.
Waiter won't take your order.

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,891
"Didn't you see the sign on the door?
No niggers allowed."

158
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,840
What are you gonna do then?
Fight him? Ruin all my plans?

159
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,040
Answer me, you black son of a bitch!

160
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,605
You want a player who doesn't
have the guts to fight back?

161
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,725
No.

162
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,605
No.

163
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,088
I want a player who's got the guts
not to fight back.

164
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,767
People aren't gonna like this.

165
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,040
They're gonna do anything
to get you to react.

166
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,125
Echo a curse with a curse
and, uh, they'll hear only yours.

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,968
Follow a blow with a blow and they'll say,
"The Negro lost his temper."

168
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,169
That "The Negro does not belong."

169
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,641
Your enemy will be out in force...

170
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,247
...and you cannot meet him
on his own low ground.

171
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,964
We win with hitting, running, fielding.
Only that.

172
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,330
We win if the world is convinced
of two things:

173
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,804
That you are a fine gentleman
and a great baseball player.

174
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,527
Like our Savior...

175
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,162
...you gotta have the guts...

176
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,649
...to turn the other cheek.

177
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,409
Can you do it?

178
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,561
You give me a uniform...

179
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,208
...you give me a, heh,
number on my back...

180
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,362
...and I'll give you the guts.

181
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Hello?

182
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,011
<i>Rae...</i>

183
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,005
Jack.

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,050
I'm in Brooklyn.

185
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,841
Brooklyn? For what?

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,729
Uh...

187
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,804
I don't want to say on the phone.

188
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,682
In fact, I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

189
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,565
What's going on? Aren't you supposed
to be playing in Chicago?

190
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,683
We've been tested, you and me.

191
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,687
<i>We've done everything
the right way. We have.</i>

192
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,121
Me trying to make money,
you finishing school.

193
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,724
We don't owe the world a thing.

194
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,611
<i>Only each other.</i>

195
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,566
Jack, what are you talking about?
What is going on? What happened?

196
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,410
Will you marry me, Rae?

197
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,925
Absolutely.

198
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,931
Yes. Yes.

199
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,607
When?

200
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,524
Um...

201
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,762
How about right now?

202
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,048
Did my mom look happy?

203
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,407
Yes. You know your mother loves me.

204
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,282
Did my gram look happy?

205
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,210
Yes.

206
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,211
My brother look happy?

207
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,328
- Heh, your brother?
- Ha, ha.

208
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,968
Everyone looked happy. I've never seen
so many happy-looking people.

209
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,688
Did Jack Robinson look happy?

210
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,689
What if I can't make you happy?

211
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,650
Too late.

212
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,809
You already do.

213
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,488
It's you and me, Rae.

214
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,889
Ooh, ha, ha.

215
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,042
Um...

216
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,767
- Till the wheels fall off.
- Hmm.

217
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,164
Oh, Jack, the world is waiting for us.

218
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,767
The world can wait one more night.

219
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,840
Are you coming, Mrs. Robinson?

220
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,691
I'd follow you anywhere, Mr. Robinson.

221
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,805
Okay.

222
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,124
Okay.

223
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,041
<i>Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.</i>

224
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,521
<i>Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.</i>

225
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,761
"Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.
Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour."

226
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,045
Are you okay?

227
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,682
I've just never seen one before.

228
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,405
Oh.

229
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,690
Yeah, we're not in Pasadena anymore.

230
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,885
Rae?

231
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,407
Rae?

232
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,730
Rae!

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,642
Oh, boy.

234
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,761
We have to lighten the plane.

235
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,046
There's some bad weather east of here.

236
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,931
A heavy plane is dangerous.

237
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,568
So someone'll have to cancel.

238
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,770
Look, I'm with the Brooklyn Dodger
organization.

239
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,331
I have to get down to Daytona.

240
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,086
I'm supposed to report to spring training
in the morning.

241
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,887
We'll do our best to get you there
by tomorrow, but it might be the day after.

242
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,287
- Jack.
- Right this way.

243
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,766
You gave away our seats?

244
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,887
You get us back on that plane.

245
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,201
You get us back on that plane right now.

246
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,923
Do you wanna call the sheriff...

247
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,964
...or should I?

248
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,771
Watch your step.

249
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,287
Oop, there he is. There's my boy.

250
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,125
Folks, stand back,
we'll get the bags out.

251
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,647
Jackie Robinson.

252
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,845
Wendell Smith.

253
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,046
<i>Pittsburgh Courier.</i>

254
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,926
A reporter?

255
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,846
Mr. Rickey sent me to meet you.
I'm gonna be your Boswell.

256
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,041
My who?

257
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,486
Your chronicler.

258
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,848
Your advance man.

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,487
Hell, even your chauffeur.

260
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,971
Mrs. Robinson.

261
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,525
It's Rachel.

262
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,327
Man, you two looked wiped out.

263
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,521
You got a car?

264
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,444
Uh-huh.

265
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,367
Brooklyn plays downtown.
Montreal just a few blocks from here.

266
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,888
Joe and Duff Harris live here.

267
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,406
He gets out the Negro vote.
He does a lot of good for colored people.

268
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,161
Now, Mr. Rickey set it up himself.

269
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,720
"If the Robinsons can't stay
at the hotels...

270
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,963
...they should stay someplace
that represents something."

271
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,010
You'll stay here all but a few days
at the end of the week...

272
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,927
...when the Dodger organization goes
to Sanford. It's about 45 minutes away.

273
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,646
You'll stay here, Rachel.

274
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,844
This'll be your home
when Jackie has to travel.

275
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,609
Uh, where are the other wives staying?

276
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,001
Welcome to Daytona Beach.

277
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,041
- There are no other wives.
- You must be Jackie.

278
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,329
You're the only one that Mr. Rickey
allowed to spring training.

279
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,446
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm. After you.

280
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,601
Come on, now, skip.

281
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,768
All right, here we go, boys!

282
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
- I got it! I got it!
- I got it!

283
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,971
That was a pretty big hop, there.

284
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,360
- You got the hop!
- Ha, ha.

285
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,286
Spring training.
It's where we work out our differences.

286
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,645
All right!

287
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,963
You boys continue
to pretend you're ballplayers.

288
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,648
- Morning, Leo.
- Good morning, Mr. Rickey.

289
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,766
How are they doing?

290
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,641
They're rusty, but we'll have them
oiled up in no time, ready to go.

291
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,290
Oop.

292
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,049
First day of spring training.

293
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,851
Pittsburgh Courier readers need to know
how it feels.

294
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,011
It's okay.

295
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,082
That's not exactly a headline.

296
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,370
It's all I got.

297
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,488
Look, Jack, right now,
it's just me asking you.

298
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,843
<i>But there's gonna be The New York Times
and the Sporting News.</i>

299
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,322
- You should think about it.
- If they ask something, I'll answer it.

300
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,124
Okay, well here's one for you

301
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,886
What if one of these white pitchers
throws at you?

302
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,367
Look, they're gonna try to get under
your skin. You need to be ready.

303
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,329
Listen, listen.

304
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,091
You know...

305
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,083
You know how when you're
at the plate...

306
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,686
...you want to see the ball
come in slow?

307
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,004
You want to see these questions
come in slow too.

308
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,726
Hey, Jackie. Jackie, you think you can
make it with these white boys?

309
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,966
Uh, I had no problems with white men
in the service or at UCLA.

310
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,044
What you gonna do if one of these
pitchers throws at your head?

311
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,725
Yeah, Jack.

312
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,884
- I'll duck.
- Heh, that's a good one.

313
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,042
Hey, Jack, what's your natural position?

314
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,203
I've been playing shortstop.

315
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,931
Are you after Pee Wee Reese's job?

316
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,724
Uh...

317
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,723
Reese plays for Brooklyn.

318
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,969
I'm still trying to make Montreal.

319
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,647
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Jack, is this about politics?

320
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,046
It's about getting paid.

321
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,249
"About getting paid." Hear what he
said? "it's about getting paid."

322
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,526
He's gotta be kidding.

323
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,808
Yeah. Good luck, Hop.

324
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,130
Clay, Jackie Robinson.

325
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,922
Jackie, I'd like you to meet Clay Hopper.
Manager of the Montreal Royals.

326
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,481
Jack. They call me Hop.

327
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,446
Now, we ain't doing much today.
Just tossing the ball around, hitting a few.

328
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,002
You can probably toss with those fellows
over there.

329
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,123
Jorgensen, come here!

330
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,764
You're not playing him at shortstop,
huh, Clay?

331
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,521
Oh, he's getting by on a quick release.
His arm's too weak for short.

332
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,081
I think second base is his spot.

333
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,411
I agree.

334
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,725
Clay...

335
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,002
...I need you to get the other players
to act like gentlemen around him.

336
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,049
Treat him like they would
any other teammate.

337
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,281
Hmm, mm-hm.

338
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,087
- Be natural, work together in harmony.
- Mm-hm.

339
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,246
Got the double up!

340
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,131
That was practically superhuman.

341
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,169
Heh, "superhuman"?

342
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,402
I mean, don't get carried away,
Mr. Rickey.

343
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,562
That's still a nigger out there.

344
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,167
Come on in now. Grab a bat. Who's up?

345
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,608
Nice job, boys!

346
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,922
Clay, I realize that attitude
is part of your cultural heritage.

347
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,688
That you practically nursed race prejudice
at your mother's breast...

348
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,888
...so I'll let that go.

349
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,330
But I will tell you this

350
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,168
You will either manage Robinson fairly
and correctly...

351
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,649
...or you, sir, can be unemployed.

352
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,170
Yes, sir.

353
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,366
Let's go! Come on, guys, let's go!

354
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,921
Way to turn two, Jackie.

355
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,208
Well, well, lookie here.

356
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,409
Jackie, I'm Mr. Brock.

357
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,648
Welcome to Sanford, Florida.

358
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,643
Thank you for having us.

359
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,202
The day belongs
to decent-minded people.

360
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,400
- Wendell, always good to see you.
- You as well.

361
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,086
Yeah, well, the wife's inside cooking.

362
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,210
You know what she asked me?
She asked me this morning:

363
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,041
What do you serve when a hero's coming
to dinner?

364
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,409
Heh, um, Mr. Brock, I'm just a ballplayer.

365
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,721
Oh, no, no.

366
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,851
You tell that to all the little colored boys
playing baseball in Florida today.

367
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,288
To them, you a hero.

368
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,288
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you, sir.

369
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,086
Here you go.

370
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Scorecards, get your scorecards here!

371
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,765
Scorecards here!
Get your scorecards here!

372
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,804
Ed! You stay where I can see you.

373
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,611
Mom, I'm 10 years old!

374
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,450
Come on.

375
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,449
<i>Welcome to the inner-league
game between the Brooklyn Dodgers...</i>

376
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,211
<i>...and their Minor League affiliate,
the Montreal Royals.</i>

377
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,683
There you go, Pee Wee!

378
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,808
<i>Now coming to bat for the Royals...</i>

379
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,122
<i>...number nine, Jackie Robinson.</i>

380
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,485
Get out of here!

381
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,961
Stand up tall, Jackie!

382
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,561
Get out, nigger!

383
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,326
Jack's got a thick skin. He'll be okay.

384
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,610
Well, how about you?

385
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,005
I better get one in a hurry, heh.

386
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,605
Have pride, Jackie!

387
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,084
Look. Look, there he is,
black as the ace of spades!

388
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,642
Hey, nigger boy!
What are you doing playing baseball?

389
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,040
Hit a home run, Jackie!

390
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Please, God, let Jackie show them
what we can do.

391
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,488
- Please.
- All right, now, Jackie Robinson!

392
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,766
Let's go, Jackie!

393
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,090
Come on, Jackie!

394
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,367
Ball!

395
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,203
They're giving you a chance!
Do something about it!

396
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
Let's go, Higbe!
Shut him down right here!

397
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,290
Ball!

398
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,962
Durocher,
tell him to throw some strikes!

399
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,241
Let him hit!

400
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,890
Come on now, come on now!

401
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,367
He ain't scared of you, Higbe!

402
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,890
You show him, Jackie!

403
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,161
Ball!

404
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,969
Come on, rook.
Ain't you gonna swing at something?

405
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,250
Higbe, just settle down. Let's get
the ball over the plate now, all right?

406
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,404
Ball four!

407
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,126
You stink, Higbe!

408
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,251
It's just a walk.

409
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,688
Ha, ha, who can blame them?

410
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,487
Good job, Jackie.

411
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,610
<i>Now coming to bat for the Royals...</i>

412
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,603
<i>...number 3, Spider Jorgensen.</i>

413
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,321
Let's go, Hig!

414
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,289
All right, Higbe, shake it off, there.

415
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,807
We got this, boy. We got this, boy.
Let's do it.

416
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,284
Well, throw it over there!
What are you waiting for?

417
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,724
Safe!

418
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,970
Come on, pop up, Jack.

419
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,810
Ball one!

420
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,844
Yeah, Jackie!

421
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,809
Heads up, Jack. Get the sign.

422
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,960
He's going!
Runner! Runner!

423
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,721
Come on, move!
Get back!

424
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,604
Get him, Schultzy!
Get him, Schultzy!

425
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,045
Here we go!

426
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,009
What are you gonna do now?
Come on!

427
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,321
Outside! Outside!

428
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,211
On your horse, Bragan!
On your horse! Outside!

429
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,045
- Now!
- Go, Stanky! Go, Stank!

430
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,727
Ooh.

431
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,561
Hey, all right!

432
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,248
Hey! Don't you know nothing?

433
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,882
You're supposed to get back
when I step off.

434
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,529
What are you doing? You can dance
with him later! Focus on the plate!

435
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,004
Come on, now! Work the plate!
Work the plate!

436
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,127
Come on, Higbe, don't worry about
the runner. Get this guy at the plate.

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,206
Timeout!

438
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,486
That's a balk.

439
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,808
Runner, take home.

440
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,245
Son of a bitch.

441
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,288
He didn't come to play, he came to kill.

442
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,442
What happened? I don't understand.

443
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,730
The pitcher dropped the ball. It's a balk.
Therefore, Jackie scores.

444
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,484
But he didn't do anything.

445
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,850
Oh, Mama, yes, he did.
He discombobulated the man.

446
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,361
He... What?

447
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,809
Phew.

448
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,401
I hope Jackie's sleeping all right.

449
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,690
Chasing baseballs in the sun all day?
Put me in my grave.

450
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,931
- How they treating him out there?
- Well, they treat him okay.

451
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,248
As far as I can see.

452
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,408
Well, you can find good people
every place.

453
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,127
Even here in Sanford.

454
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,685
Is he in there?

455
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,647
Who is it that you're looking for?

456
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,450
The Nigra ballplayer.

457
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,329
Is he in there?

458
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,648
He's asleep right now.

459
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,170
Maybe you wanna come back
in the morning.

460
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,767
No, I ain't coming back.

461
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,401
Other fellas is coming.

462
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,807
And they ain't happy
that he's staying here in Sanford...

463
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,930
...playing ball with white boys.

464
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,290
- Now, let me tell you something, sir.
- No, you listen to me, young man.

465
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,802
You best just skedaddle on out of here.

466
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,602
Because if they get here
and he's still here...

467
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,644
...there's gonna be trouble.

468
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,930
You understand?

469
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,805
Trouble.

470
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,926
Trouble, trouble, trouble.

471
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,291
Mr. Brock.

472
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,648
May I please use your telephone?

473
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,287
Wake him up and get him out of there.

474
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,168
Put him in the car and, uh, start driving
to Daytona Beach. Now.

475
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,846
Uh, oh, and, uh, Wendell...

476
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,406
...under no circumstances are you
to tell him what this is about, uh...

477
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,766
I don't want him getting it in his head...

478
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,962
...to stay there and fight.

479
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,171
Where's he at?

480
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,085
I don't know.
Think he's getting another one.

481
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,721
Hey, Jim. You escorting
that boy out of town?

482
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,001
Hey, look at this.

483
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,764
What's that?

484
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,731
What's he want?

485
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,684
Hey, hey, hey!

486
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,170
What the hell, Wendell?

487
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,766
A man came by while you was asleep.

488
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,490
He said more men were coming.

489
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,165
It might have been those fellas.

490
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,011
Mr. Rickey said to get you to Daytona
Beach ASAP.

491
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,530
Why didn't you say so?

492
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,526
Mr. Rickey was afraid you wouldn't leave.
You'd want to stay there and fight.

493
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,766
Man, what in the hell
are you laughing at?

494
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,123
I thought you woke me
because I was cut from the team.

495
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,401
You got a strange sense of humor, man.

496
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,407
Two, two, two! Take him back.
Throw him out now!

497
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,847
Safe!

498
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,363
You're too fast for them, Jackie!

499
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,602
All right, way to go. Way to go, boy!

500
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,444
Get that nigger off the field!

501
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,331
Come on, Spider, bring him in. Let's go.

502
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,486
We got him.

503
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,209
Four! Four! Four!

504
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,249
No cut!
He's running through!

505
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,325
Safe!

506
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,006
Get off the field.

507
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,568
- What?
- Get off the field. Now.

508
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,250
- Why?
- Because it's against the law, that's why.

509
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,562
No nigger's gonna play with white boys.

510
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,961
Now you get off the field, or go to jail.

511
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,691
You use that thing,
you better hit me between the eyes.

512
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,121
Hey, hold on, now. What'd he do wrong?

513
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,409
We ain't having no Nigrae mix
with white boys in this town.

514
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,087
Y'all ain't up-states now.
They gotta keep separate.

515
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,648
The Brooklyn Dodgers
ain't changing our way of living.

516
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,771
Where y'all from, anyhow?

517
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,490
I'm from Greenwood, Mississippi.

518
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,883
Ha, ha, hell, boy,
you ought to know better.

519
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,323
Now, you tell your Nigra I said to git.

520
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,321
<i>What did you do?</i>

521
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,805
Oh, I said:

522
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,204
"Okay, skipper.
I'm a-gitting, I'm a-gitting, I'm a-gitting.

523
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,283
- You don't want no trouble."
- You did not!

524
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,841
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Ha, ha.

525
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,322
Then I took a cold shower.

526
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,528
We lost two to one.

527
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,921
Aw.

528
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,050
Okay, skipper. I'm a-gitting, I'm a-gitting.

529
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,004
Oh, no, you not getting away from me.

530
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,205
Jack.

531
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,166
Get back, Rae.

532
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,251
I want you to know something.

533
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,926
Yeah, what's that?

534
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,490
I want you to know I'm pulling for you
to make good.

535
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,007
A lot of folks around here
feel the same way.

536
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,483
If a man's got the goods,
he deserves a fair chance, that's all.

537
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,205
Ma'am.

538
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,400
You wanted to see me, Mr. Rickey?

539
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,084
Bermuda grass grows so well here.

540
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,562
I wish we could get it to grow like this up
in Brooklyn.

541
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,725
Yeah.

542
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,363
I like the way it smells
when they mow it.

543
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,205
Heh, me too.

544
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,050
Jackie...

545
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,041
...it is my pleasure...

546
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,410
...to tell you that you have earned a place
with the Montreal Royals.

547
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,568
When they head north on Tuesday
for opening day with Jersey City...

548
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,922
...you'll be on the train.

549
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,851
I won't let you down.

550
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,411
Yeah, I know you won't.

551
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,606
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go tell my wife.

552
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,366
Ah, you give her my regards.

553
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,607
Mr. Rickey?

554
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,289
Why are you doing this?

555
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,127
I'm in the baseball business.

556
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,289
With you and the other Negro players
I hope to bring up next year...

557
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,967
...I can put together a team
that can win the World Series.

558
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,124
And the World Series means money.

559
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,007
You believe that, don't you?

560
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,081
I don't think it matters what I believe.

561
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,930
Only what I do.

562
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,651
Agreed.

563
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,084
Therefore...

564
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,483
...I want you to worry those pitchers
till they come apart.

565
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,642
Run as you see fit.

566
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,371
Sometimes you'll get caught,
but that doesn't matter.

567
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,648
Ty Cobb got caught plenty.

568
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,485
You just run those bases
like the devil himself.

569
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,849
Put the natural fear of God in them.

570
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,525
Yes, sir.

571
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,244
<i>Train for Atlanta
and points north now boarding.</i>

572
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,404
<i>Train for Atlanta and points
north now boarding.</i>

573
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,011
There he is.

574
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,050
All aboard!

575
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,444
Young man.

576
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,602
I can still hear him.

577
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,247
I can still hear him!

578
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,245
Play ball!

579
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,603
<i>And now the lineup
of the visiting Montreal Royals.</i>

580
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,287
<i>Batting first, playing center field,
Marv Rackley.</i>

581
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,445
<i>Batting second, playing second base,
Jackie Robinson.</i>

582
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,087
<i>Batting third, playing left field,
George Shuba.</i>

583
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,765
Hey, you okay?

584
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,410
I think I might be sick.

585
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,686
Excuse me, Wendell.

586
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,323
Popcorn! Get your popcorn!

587
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,930
You all right, honey?

588
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,649
I'm sick.

589
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,769
Don't know why.

590
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,367
Mm, thank you.

591
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,327
When did you have your monthly last?

592
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,763
It may be that you're pregnant.

593
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,320
<i>Now batting for Montreal,
number 9, Jackie Robinson.</i>

594
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,005
Come on, Jack!

595
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,845
Come on, Jackie.

596
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,606
- Come on, batter.
- Put it here!

597
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,522
Whoo!

598
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,882
He may be superhuman after all.

599
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,689
Way to go.

600
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,283
Oh, Jack.

601
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,445
Yeah.

602
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,443
My daddy left. Heh.

603
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,284
He left us flat...

604
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,203
...in Cairo, Georgia.

605
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,562
I was only 6 months older
than you are now.

606
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,969
I don't remember him.

607
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,762
Nothing good, nothing bad.

608
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,810
Nothing.

609
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,927
You will remember me.

610
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,851
I'm gonna be here with you
till the day I die.

611
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,161
Yeah.

612
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,448
<i>Hello, Leo.</i>

613
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,649
<i>What are you doing?</i>

614
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,290
I'm bowling.

615
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,169
No, I'm snowshoeing in the Alps.

616
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,005
I'm trying to sleep, Mr. Rickey.
It's still dark out.

617
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,006
<i>Another spring training
is upon us, Leo. In Panama.</i>

618
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,042
I need to know your attitude
towards Jackie Robinson.

619
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,168
I don't got an attitude toward him.

620
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,689
<i>8 times in the Bible
we're told to love our neighbor as ourself.</i>

621
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,886
It's one of God's
most repeated commands.

622
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,805
<i>Well, I don't know much about the Bible.</i>

623
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,247
But I didn't go to school
just to eat my lunch.

624
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,528
I'll play an elephant
if he can help us win...

625
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,365
...and to make room for him,
I'll send my own brother home.

626
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,170
Oh, what are you gonna do with me?

627
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,529
We're playing for money here.
Winning is the only thing that matters.

628
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,170
<i>Is he a nice guy?</i>

629
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,483
Well, if by nice you mean soft, no.

630
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,722
No, not particularly.

631
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,725
Good, he can't afford to be.

632
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,850
- Nice guys finish last.
- And what about nice girls?

633
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,162
<i>So you have no objection to him?</i>

634
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,527
None whatsoever.
Can I go back to sleep now?

635
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,806
- Yes.
<i>- All right.</i>

636
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,564
<i>- Oh, and Leo.</i>
- What?

637
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,085
The Bible has a thing or two
to say about adultery as well.

638
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,723
I'm sure it's got a lot to say about a lot.
Good night.

639
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,767
What am I gonna do with you?

640
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,604
I thought you knew.

641
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,686
You gonna take care of your mama?

642
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,691
No? You better.

643
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,405
Mm-hm.

644
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,403
You gonna take care of my mama?

645
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,766
Come here, baby.

646
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,127
- There you go.
- Come here, baby, I got you.

647
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,889
Promise me you'll write?

648
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,081
When have I ever not written?

649
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,290
I want you to know I'm there for you,
even if it's words on paper.

650
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,724
Rae...

651
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,924
...you're in my heart.

652
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,921
You're getting close now, and the closer
you get, the worse they'll be.

653
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,087
Don't let them get to you.

654
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,450
I won't.

655
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,367
God built me to last.

656
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,401
Hmm.

657
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,081
I'll see you in Brooklyn in eight weeks, oh.

658
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,167
It might be Montreal.

659
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,168
It's gonna be Brooklyn.

660
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,410
I know it is.

661
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,641
Why do you think Rickey's got us playing
spring games here in Panama, huh?

662
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,482
He wants us to get used
to Negro crowds.

663
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,648
He wants more of them
than there are of us.

664
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,009
And he's hoping it'll make us more
comfortable being around Robinson.

665
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,924
Ahem. All right, ahem.

666
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,567
Listen up. This is what I got.

667
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,202
"We, the undersigned Brooklyn Dodgers,
will not play ball...

668
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,289
...on the same field as
Jackie Robinson."

669
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,601
That's right.

670
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,210
Kirby Higbe.

671
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,848
- I'll sign that.
- All right.

672
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,002
Brooklyn Dodger Declaration
of Independence.

673
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,366
That's right.

674
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,090
Give me that.

675
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,605
- Y'all sure about this?
- You wanna play ball with a nigger?

676
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,120
Skip's got you out in left?

677
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,964
Yeah, for today.
Hey, Robinson.

678
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,569
- What do you want me to do with this?
- Well, you play first base.

679
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,768
Coach, I never played first base
in my life.

680
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,564
Well, it's like this:

681
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,566
Brooklyn's got a solid second baseman.
We got Pee Wee Reese over at short.

682
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,569
But first base is up for grabs.

683
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,924
Come on in.

684
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,851
- Hey, Stank.
- What's going on?

685
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,520
Well, we got a petition going on, Stank.

686
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,610
Keep Robinson in Montreal.
Where he belongs.

687
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,082
Can't sign now, boys.

688
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,249
I'm indisposed.

689
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,768
How about I just catch up
with you later?

690
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,571
That ball's coming in a lot faster, Jack.

691
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,728
The angle's a lot different in second.

692
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,164
Take all the time in the world on second.
You're getting it.

693
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,569
That's like you have a suitcase on your
hand there, Jack.

694
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,287
The new glove, it's the big one there,
Jack. You'll get used to it.

695
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,844
Give me the pen.

696
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,765
You know Mr. Rickey wants you
to play conspicuous baseball.

697
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,763
To be so good that the Dodgers demand
to have you on their team.

698
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,247
That's it.

699
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,808
So I thought about it for a while...

700
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,004
...and I looked up "conspicuous"
in the dictionary.

701
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,489
It means "to attract notice or attention."

702
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,010
Conspicuous.

703
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,007
Look, it's like this: I got a wife,
I got a baby and I got no money.

704
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,845
So I don't wanna step in anything, so...

705
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,731
You want to skip me on this one, Dix.
I'm not interested.

706
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,008
- What if they put him at shortstop?
- Exactly.

707
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,326
That's right, Pee Wee.

708
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,608
Well, I figure if he's man enough
to take my job...

709
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,000
- ...he deserves it.
- Ugh.

710
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,531
Oh, the hell he does.

711
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,207
He does not have the ice water
in his veins to play big league baseball.

712
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,442
- That's right.
- So let him show what he's got.

713
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,171
Robinson can either play or he can't.

714
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,209
It'll all take care of itself.

715
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,771
It's gonna cut you off.

716
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,888
So right foot on the bag when it comes.

717
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,203
There you go. That's nice, Jackie.
Nice, Jackie. Pop that foot off.

718
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,728
When that ball comes, that right foot,
just pop that.

719
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,042
Pop that...
Don't leave that foot on there.

720
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,690
Yes, Mr. Rickey.

721
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,923
<i>Have
our friends in the press gone to sleep?</i>

722
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,767
We are the only people awake
on this entire isthmus, Mr. Rickey.

723
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,163
<i>About this, uh, petition, Leo.</i>

724
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,926
I think a deliberate violation
of the law deserves...

725
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,370
...a little show of force.

726
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,531
I leave it to you, Leo.

727
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,487
Good night.

728
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,049
Good night, Mr. Rickey.

729
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,730
- So, what are we doing here in the night?
- Leo said to get everybody together.

730
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,848
- I was sleeping good.
- Down in the kitchen?

731
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,606
Wake up now, ladies! Wake up!

732
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,330
It has come to my attention that some of
you fellas don't wanna play with Robinson.

733
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,609
That you've even got a petition you've
drawn up and you're all going to sign.

734
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,802
You know what you can do
with your petition.

735
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,450
You can wipe your asses with it.

736
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,807
- Oh, come on, Leo.
- Come on, what?

737
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,760
Ballplayers gotta live together,
shower together.

738
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,968
It ain't fair to force him on us like this.

739
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,804
Besides, I got a hardware store...

740
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,363
Screw your hardware store, Dix!
And if you don't like it, screw you.

741
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,763
Mr. Rickey will be happy
to make other arrangements for you.

742
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,646
Now, I don't care if he is yellow,
or black...

743
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,802
...or has stripes like a zebra.

744
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,042
If Robinson can help us win,
and everything I have seen says he can...

745
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,687
...then he is gonna play on this ball club!

746
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,971
Like it, lump it, make your minds up to it,
because he's coming!

747
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,370
And think about this
when your heads hit the pillows tonight.

748
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,890
He's only the first, boys.

749
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,770
Only the first.

750
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,880
There are more coming right behind him
every day...

751
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,362
...and they have got talent
and they wanna play.

752
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,044
Oh, yeah, they are gonna
come scratching and diving.

753
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,409
So I would forget your petition
and worry about the field...

754
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,007
...because unless you fellas
pay a little more attention to your work...

755
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,482
...they're gonna run you right
out of the ball park!

756
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,601
Bragan, most of your
teammates have already, uh...

757
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,048
...recanted on this petition nonsense.

758
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,488
Are you really here to tell me you don't
wanna play with Robinson?

759
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,130
Yes, sir.

760
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,721
My friends back in Birmingham
would never forgive me.

761
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,201
Well, what about your friends
in Brooklyn?

762
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,249
I don't know.

763
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,409
Hmm.

764
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,201
Then I will accommodate you.

765
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,526
As long as you give me your word that you
will do your very best for this team...

766
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,728
...until I can work out a trade.

767
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,083
Do you think I would quit on anyone?
I don't quit, sir.

768
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,891
Only on yourself, apparently.

769
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,689
Taxi!

770
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,683
Hey, Jack.

771
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,609
You again.

772
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,851
That's right. Me again.

773
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,881
There something wrong with that, Jack?

774
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,084
Where's the car?

775
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,289
Right this way.

776
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,124
They can't keep you in Montreal
for long.

777
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,048
After these exhibition games,
they're gonna have to bring you up.

778
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,485
You don't have two words to rub together,
do you?

779
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,167
You ever wonder why I sit down
behind third base...

780
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,482
...with my typewriter on my knees?

781
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,642
Does that ever cross your mind?

782
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,049
It's because Negro reporters
aren't allowed in the press box.

783
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,005
So guess what?

784
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,722
You, Mr. Robinson, are not the only one
with something at stake here.

785
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,490
I apologize.

786
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,690
You've been there for me through this...

787
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,969
...more than anyone
besides Rae and Mr. Rickey.

788
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,209
But I guess that's what bothers me.

789
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,962
How do you mean?

790
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,362
I don't like needing someone
to be there for me.

791
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,886
I don't like needing anyone for anything.

792
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,849
I never have.

793
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,324
You a hard case, Jack Robinson.

794
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,130
Hey.

795
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,961
Is it okay if I keep driving you, or
should I let you get out so you can walk?

796
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,081
Hmm?

797
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,161
"Branch Rickey cannot afford
to upset team chemistry...

798
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,129
...so the only thing keeping Robinson
off the Dodgers now, plainly...

799
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,089
...is the attitude of the players.

800
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,130
If it softens at the sight
of Jackie's skills...

801
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,251
...he'll join the club sometime
between April 10th and April 15th.

802
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,570
Otherwise, Robinson will spend the year
back in Montreal."

803
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,248
Oh, for the love of Pete.

804
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,008
He batted .625 in the exhibition games
against them.

805
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,288
Us, them... Against us!

806
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,290
Judas Priest!

807
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,131
Jane Ann, are you out there?

808
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,211
Branch Rickey.

809
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,210
Yes, uh, this is him.

810
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,681
The commissioner of what?

811
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,045
Uh, yes, put him through.

812
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,646
The Commissioner of Baseball.

813
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,802
Branch. Ha! How are you?

814
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,247
<i>Good, Happy. What can I do for you?</i>

815
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,484
How'd you feel about losing Durocher
for the year, Branch?

816
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,526
Uh, I'm sorry, Happy, heh, I thought you said
lose Durocher for a year.

817
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,364
<i>I got a notice today...</i>

818
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,481
...from the Catholic Youth Organization
vowing a ban on baseball...

819
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,644
...if Durocher wasn't punished
for his moral looseness.

820
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,286
You're joking.

821
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,002
I wish I were, but it's this business
of this actress out in California.

822
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,767
She's recently divorced
and Durocher's the cause.

823
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,491
They say they may
even be illegally married.

824
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,524
Now I know you're joking.

825
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,011
I'm not.

826
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,005
Thing of it is, Branch, uh...

827
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,041
...this CYO, they buy a lot of seats,
they draw a lot of water...

828
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,043
...and I can't afford
to ruffle their feathers.

829
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,523
I'm sorry,
am I mixing my metaphors there?

830
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,685
Happy, you know very well
my organization is entering a tempest.

831
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,241
I need Durocher at the helm.

832
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,801
He's the only man that can handle
this much trouble.

833
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,240
In fact, he loves it.

834
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,209
You're cutting off my right hand!

835
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,449
I have no choice.

836
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,126
I'm gonna sit your manager, Branch.

837
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,171
Leo Durocher is suspended from baseball
for a year.

838
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,527
Happy, you can't do this,
you son of a bitch!

839
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,000
<i>As the search continues...</i>

840
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,407
<i>...to replace Leo Durocher,
I have it on good authority...</i>

841
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,281
<i>...that former Yankee manager Joe
McCarthy has turned down the request...</i>

842
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,410
<i>...of Branch Rickey to take the reins
of the Brooklyn Dodgers.</i>

843
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,767
<i>He is not the only man to say no.</i>

844
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,804
<i>And so with the 1947 season
about to begin...</i>

845
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,089
<i>...the Dodgers
are still without a manager.</i>

846
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,410
<i>Now we present once again Mary...</i>

847
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,605
Hello?

848
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,764
<i>Mr. Robinson?
This is Jane Ann in Mr. Rickey's office.</i>

849
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,763
<i>He needs to see you right away.</i>

850
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,571
<i>He has a contract for you to sign.</i>

851
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,200
Contract for me to sign.

852
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,089
Okay.

853
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,971
Hello?

854
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,963
Shoot!

855
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,882
Clyde, you're good.
Jane Ann, get in there.

856
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,127
Come on.

857
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,284
Harold, telegram the press. Say this:

858
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,370
"Today the Brooklyn Dodgers
organization...

859
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,849
...has purchased the contract of Jackie
Robinson from the Montreal Royals.

860
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,048
He will report immediately."

861
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,285
I love you.

862
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,004
I love you.

863
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,889
Lookie here.

864
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,169
Hey, you're looking for your locker,
aren't you, son? Follow me.

865
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,961
I'm Hermanski. Welcome to Brooklyn.

866
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,645
Greetings.

867
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,450
Hey, man. Ralph Branca.

868
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,681
Greetings.

869
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,882
Greetings. Okay.

870
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,287
I just found out today. The best I can do.

871
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,125
I'll get you straightened out tomorrow.
Okay?

872
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,203
It's okay.

873
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,361
Robinson, can we get a photo?

874
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,085
Robinson, turn around!
Come on, come on, Mr. Robinson.

875
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,330
Good luck, sir!

876
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,802
Get out of here!
We don't need you!

877
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,769
Get out of here!

878
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,645
Yeah! There he is!

879
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,240
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

880
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,291
<i>By the dawn's early light</i>

881
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,611
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

882
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,685
<i>At the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

883
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,805
<i>Who's broad stripes and bright stars</i>

884
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,806
<i>Through the perilous fight</i>

885
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,365
<i>O'er the ramparts we watched</i>

886
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,804
<i>Were so gallantly streaming?</i>

887
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,124
<i>And the rockets red glare</i>

888
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,609
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

889
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,924
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

890
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,489
<i>That our flag was still there</i>

891
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:33,640
<i>Oh, say
Does that star-spangled banner yet wave</i>

892
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:41,209
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

893
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:47,447
<i>And the home of the brave</i>

894
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,451
Play ball!

895
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,925
Another opening day, Harold.

896
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,401
All future, no past.

897
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,881
It's a blank page, sir.

898
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,046
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

899
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,165
It's The OI' Redhead speaking here from
high up in the catbird seat at Ebbets Field.

900
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,809
Welcome to opening day of the 1947
Brooklyn Dodgers season.

901
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,767
As many of you know,
the Dodgers finished 96-60 last season.

902
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,844
Respectable, but still two games
behind St. Louis...

903
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,571
...who would, of course, go on to take
the World Series.

904
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,809
The Dodgers looking to move up this year
and win the pennant.

905
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,962
<i>Now batting for the Dodgers...</i>

906
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,487
<i>One out. Bottom of the 1st.</i>

907
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,406
<i>Headed to the plate now for his first
big league at bat is Dodger rookie:</i>

908
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,971
Jackie Robinson.

909
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,329
Jackie is very definitely brunet.

910
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,204
<i>The Dodgers still without a manager...</i>

911
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,921
<i>...as Leo Durocher was suspended
earlier this week.</i>

912
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,451
You got this, Jackie!

913
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,001
<i>It's a shirtsleeve afternoon.</i>

914
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,803
<i>Johnny Sain looking in.
When he's got that fastball working...</i>

915
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,169
<i>...what I mean to say is, he can toss
a lamb chop past a hungry wolf.</i>

916
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,846
<i>Oh, and it's a hard-hit ball down
the third baseline.</i>

917
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,129
<i>Elliott gobbles it up and makes
the long toss across the diamond.</i>

918
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,520
You're out!

919
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,682
<i>And Robinson is out.</i>

920
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,845
Come on! Ump, get some glasses!

921
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,082
You blew it! AI, you blew that call!

922
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,321
You blew it!

923
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,690
<i>It was a close play at first. A tie
usually goes to the runner but not this time.</i>

924
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,765
So that first big league hit
will remain to be seen.

925
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,488
So the Giants got Mize batting cleanup.

926
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,444
Shame about Leo.

927
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,287
Inevitable, I suppose.

928
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,205
I asked him if she was worth it,
he said yes.

929
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,370
How's the retirement?

930
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,887
Oh, it's just fine.

931
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,371
You know, the roses are...

932
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,771
Hell of a thing
when a man's got good health...

933
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,331
...and plenty of money...

934
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,363
...and absolutely nothing to do.

935
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,888
Heh, well, I'm perfectly happy.

936
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,565
Is that so?

937
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,041
You know, when I took the Cleveland
uniform off two years ago...

938
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,484
...I promised the missus I'd never put
on another uniform again.

939
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,564
So the roses are beautiful...

940
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,927
...and, uh, I sleep better too.

941
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,084
Roses and sleep
are two wonderful things, Burt.

942
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:25,610
But sleep you can get when you're in your
casket, and flowers look great on top of it.

943
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,327
But, uh, you don't look like a dead man
to me, Burt.

944
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,405
What's this about, Branch?

945
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,246
I need you to manage the Dodgers
for me, Burt.

946
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,601
- No.
- Now, wait.

947
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,004
We're a ship without a captain
and there's a typhoon coming.

948
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,248
I'm sorry, no.

949
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,090
Don't you miss the game, Burt?

950
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,168
Working with the players?

951
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,641
Helping to get the best out of the team?

952
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,090
Go on, look me in the eye
and tell me you don't.

953
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,490
Baseball's the only life
for an old pepper pot like me.

954
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,803
But I promised my wife, Branch.

955
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,964
You promised her you'd never
put on a uniform again.

956
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,361
You didn't promise her
you wouldn't manage.

957
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,966
Wear a suit and a tie like Connie Mack.

958
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,804
Come on, Burt.

959
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,926
What do you say?

960
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,443
Burt, I need you.

961
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,008
What do you say?

962
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,648
All right, men. Men?

963
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,570
Men?

964
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,043
I know you've all, uh, heard the news.
I'm your new manager.

965
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,521
I don't have much to say to you.

966
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,131
Just, uh...

967
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,001
...don't be afraid...

968
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,801
...of old Burt Shotton as your manager.

969
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,640
You can win the pennant in spite of me.

970
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,564
There's, uh...

971
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,565
There's nothing I can do to hurt you.

972
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,091
So, uh...

973
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,966
You Robinson?

974
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,689
I thought so.

975
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,891
So let's get out there and beat those, uh...
Who are we playing?

976
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,280
Giants, Burt.

977
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,683
Giants! Let's go beat the Giants!

978
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,531
<i>Now batting, number 42...</i>

979
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,571
<i>...first baseman, Jackie Robinson.</i>

980
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,842
You mark my words and circle this date.

981
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,527
Negroes are gonna run the white man
straight out of baseball.

982
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,407
I'm not prejudiced. It's physiological.

983
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,087
They have a longer heel bone.
Gives them an unfair speed advantage.

984
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,770
<i>Here's Robinson.
Jack holds that club down by the end...</i>

985
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,965
<i>...rear foot at the back end of the box,
slight open stance, bent at the knees.</i>

986
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,561
<i>Jack swings.</i>

987
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,242
<i>That ball is screaming out to left.
Hartung watching it go and...</i>

988
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,368
<i>So long! Home run!</i>

989
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,770
<i>Jackie Robinson
has his first Major League home run.</i>

990
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,244
Was that because his heel bone
was longer, Bob? Hmm?

991
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,843
"Heel bone longer."

992
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,764
Sorry I'm late. Class ran long.

993
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,530
That's okay.

994
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,083
It's so cold and raw out, I don't want
him getting sick at the game.

995
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,208
Fed him already.

996
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,364
All of his bits are on the table
over there.

997
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,489
He'll be nice and warm in here.

998
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,483
Thank you, Alice.

999
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,370
<i>Bottom of the 1st.</i>

1000
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,881
The skies are leaden now.
Pretty threatening.

1001
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,088
Eddie Stanky, safe at first.

1002
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,322
<i>And Jackie Robinson stepping
to the plate.</i>

1003
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:26,169
There's a slight breeze coming in
from right field, blowing towards left.

1004
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,483
It shouldn't give much of an advantage
to the right-handed hitters.

1005
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,369
Hey! nigger!

1006
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,000
Black nigger!

1007
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,245
Hey, why don't you go back to the cotton
fields where you come from, huh?

1008
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,607
I saw you swing your way
out of a jungle.

1009
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,765
Chapman, the Phillies manager, seems
to be chirping something out to Robinson.

1010
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,241
<i>Chapman, a hothead
during his playing days...</i>

1011
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,762
<i>...has carried that reputation right
into his managing.</i>

1012
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,480
He's got half a mind, Jackie.

1013
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,851
Take that monkey out now!

1014
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,044
You all right? You don't look all right.

1015
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,202
Nigger, nigger, nigger!

1016
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,761
Come on, nigger, nigger, nigger!

1017
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,610
Whoa!

1018
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,284
Welcome to the big leagues, rook!

1019
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,048
Come on, now, get up.

1020
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,771
Can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen, rook.

1021
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,967
Right, Bobby, heh?

1022
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,562
Those are nice dance moves, Bojangles.

1023
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,770
Leave your hat on the ground, maybe
somebody'll throw some money in it, huh?

1024
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,891
Put on a little show, nigger.

1025
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,008
Do a little shuffle.

1026
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,041
- Come on, midnight!
- He's all right, he's all right.

1027
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,361
All right, nigger.

1028
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,166
Let's do this. You ought to be careful
in this sunshine.

1029
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,368
Tar baby skin gonna melt.

1030
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,369
Whoa!
You can't hit that?

1031
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,363
One more! Strike him!

1032
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,205
Why don't you get that boy
that you sent down...

1033
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,408
...to the International League, huh?

1034
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,523
That's where Africans play, ain't it?

1035
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,011
Who was that?

1036
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,924
Who'd you put out of a job, nigger?

1037
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,249
Come on, Jackie.

1038
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,442
<i>Robinson, waiting for the pitch.</i>

1039
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,602
<i>Swings, and it's a fly ball out to left.</i>

1040
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,362
<i>Ennis settles under it for the out.</i>

1041
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,128
<i>Sky's starting to clear now,
the sun pushing its way through.</i>

1042
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,726
Nigger can't play.

1043
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,927
It's all right, he can take it.

1044
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,291
God built him to last.

1045
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,648
<i>No score, bottom of the 4th.</i>

1046
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,644
<i>Spider Jorgensen
taking a small lead off first.</i>

1047
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,644
Jorgensen, a rookie,
spent last season in Montreal.

1048
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,965
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

1049
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,561
<i>And Stanky lines a single
out to right field.</i>

1050
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,131
Three!

1051
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,360
Hung low. Now there you go.
<i>Next up for the Dodgers:</i>

1052
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,127
<i>Jackie Robinson.</i>

1053
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,286
Hey!

1054
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,805
Hey, Pee Wee!

1055
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,361
Hey, what's this nigger doing
for you all...

1056
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,490
...that you let him drink out
of the same water fountain as you?

1057
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,571
Huh?

1058
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,123
I hope you don't take showers
with him.

1059
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,611
Because you gonna be a mess!

1060
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,166
Hey! nigger!

1061
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,362
You like white women, huh?

1062
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,002
Hey, which one of these Dodger wives
are you climbing on tonight?

1063
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,281
Time!

1064
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,364
Wait, timeout, hold on.
He's gotta take a nap.

1065
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,521
Hey, which one is it?

1066
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,964
I think I know!

1067
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,641
Dixie?

1068
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,046
Sorry. Dixie,
I hate to be the one to tell you.

1069
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,807
I saw her walking earlier
with a little bit of a bow in her step.

1070
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,446
It'll be fine.

1071
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,440
It'll be fine. He looks like a nice boy.

1072
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,369
That right, boy?

1073
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,210
Come on, nigger, nigger, nigger!

1074
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,929
<i>Two men on for Robinson.</i>

1075
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,363
<i>Here's the pitch from Leonard.</i>

1076
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,922
<i>Swung on,
and it's a towering infield pop-up.</i>

1077
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,446
<i>Seminick settles under it.</i>

1078
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,201
- Hey, is that a home run?
- Yeah.

1079
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,163
If you're playing in an elevator shaft.

1080
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,926
Can of corn, and Robinson is out.

1081
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,842
You don't belong here, nigger!

1082
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,484
You hear me?
Why don't you look in the mirror?

1083
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,768
This a white man's game.

1084
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,726
All right? Get that through
your thick monkey skull!

1085
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,330
Look at me, baby.

1086
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,121
Look at me, baby. Look at me.

1087
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,800
No!

1088
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,450
No.

1089
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,640
The next white son of a bitch
that opens his mouth...

1090
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,962
...I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.

1091
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,847
You can't do that, Jack.

1092
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,485
I'm supposed to just let this go on?

1093
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,571
These men have to live with themselves.

1094
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,325
I have to live with myself too.

1095
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,964
Right now I'm living a sermon out there.

1096
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,528
You don't matter now, Jack.

1097
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,564
You're in this thing.

1098
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,008
You don't have the right to pull out
from the backing of people...

1099
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,721
...that believe in you, that respect you,
that need you.

1100
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,166
Is that so?

1101
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,604
If you fight, they won't say
that Chapman forced you to.

1102
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,402
They'll say that you're in over your head.
That you don't belong here.

1103
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,962
Do you know what it's like having
somebody do this to you?

1104
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,281
No.

1105
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,366
No.

1106
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,411
You do.

1107
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,166
You're the one...

1108
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,049
...living the sermon.

1109
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,284
In the wilderness.

1110
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,169
40 days.

1111
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,691
All of it.

1112
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,411
Only you.

1113
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,091
There's not a goddamn thing I can do
about it.

1114
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,770
Of course there is!

1115
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,605
You can get out there and hit!

1116
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,843
You can get on base and score.

1117
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,049
You can win this game for us.

1118
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,485
We need you.

1119
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,688
Everybody needs you!

1120
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,400
You're medicine, Jack!

1121
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,241
Let's go, fellas.

1122
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,090
They're taking the field.

1123
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,731
Now, get out there.

1124
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,041
Be smart, fellas.

1125
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,326
Let's go!

1126
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,048
Who's playing first?

1127
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,681
I'm gonna need a new bat.

1128
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,843
<i>8 zeros on the scoreboard
for the Phi/lies, seven for the Dodgers.</i>

1129
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,480
<i>No score,
with the bottom of the 8th coming up.</i>

1130
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,085
All right, nigger.

1131
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,006
Hey, boy!

1132
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,129
Porch monkey!

1133
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,244
Hey, nigger, I know you can hear me.

1134
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,602
You know what you're here for,
don't you, huh?

1135
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,004
You're here to get the nigger dollars
for Rickey at the gate.

1136
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,403
You don't belong here, nigger!

1137
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,325
Sit down.
You sit down or I sit you down.

1138
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,920
What's the problem, Stank?

1139
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,129
You're the problem, you disgrace.
What the hell kind of man are you?

1140
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,808
You know he can't fight back. Why don't
you try picking on someone who can.

1141
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,361
I'm not gonna fight you,
get thrown out of the game.

1142
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,524
Stanky now having a chin-wag
with his ex-teammate Chapman.

1143
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,569
Both men, masters of distraction.

1144
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,848
Stanky from second
and Chapman from the dugout.

1145
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,321
We'll have to wait and see
what the umpire does...

1146
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,370
...since he's well within his rights
to kick Stanky out.

1147
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,684
Hey, 12! That's enough.
Back to the dugout.

1148
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,763
You shut your mouth or I shut it for you.

1149
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,610
This ain't happening.

1150
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,287
Hey, Stank? What's it like
being a nigger's nigger?

1151
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,001
I don't know, Chapman. What's it
like to be a redneck piece of shit?

1152
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,609
<i>Robinson up.</i>

1153
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,410
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

1154
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,361
<i>And Jack pokes a soft hit past second.</i>

1155
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,401
Sorry!

1156
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,004
<i>Not much of a hit to speak of,
but Jackie is standing on first.</i>

1157
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,005
Go, Jackie.

1158
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,401
<i>Center fielder, number 7, Pete Reiser.</i>

1159
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,882
<i>Mr. Pete Reiser steps up
into the batter's box.</i>

1160
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,929
Robinson with another big lead off first.

1161
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,560
He's just as restless
as a cat with a hot foot.

1162
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,081
Back.

1163
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,765
- Whoa!
- Safe!

1164
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,209
<i>The Flatbush faithful
voicing their approval of Jack...</i>

1165
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,050
<i>...as this type of scrappy play...</i>

1166
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,443
<i>...is exactly what they've grown
to expect of their beloved Bums.</i>

1167
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,090
Play now.

1168
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,005
Work it.

1169
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,523
Steal it, sweetheart. Take it.

1170
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,043
- Strike three, you're out.
- He's going!

1171
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,601
Down!
Safe!

1172
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,089
<i>The Dodgers,
with an excellent chance...</i>

1173
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,811
<i>...as Robinson has willed himself
into scoring position.</i>

1174
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,485
Thattaboy.

1175
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:23,247
<i>Young Gene Hermanski
steps to the plate, playing right today.</i>

1176
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,166
Come on!

1177
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,641
<i>Hermanski cracks a single to left...</i>

1178
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,331
<i>...and Robinson is able to trot home
for the first run...</i>

1179
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,165
<i>...that may also be the decider.</i>

1180
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,484
All right.

1181
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,601
Jackie!
All right!

1182
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,770
Hey, Robinson!

1183
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,847
Thanks.

1184
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,690
For what?

1185
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,526
You're on my team.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1186
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,847
Nice hit.

1187
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,047
All this fuss over a rookie.

1188
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,403
What, he's got 10, 12 at bats.

1189
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,846
Y'all gonna spoil him.

1190
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,128
Chapman,
do you think it cost you the game?

1191
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,080
No. I think that a single out
to the left field cost us the game.

1192
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,642
You think you were a little hard
on Robinson?

1193
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,441
No. Look, we treat him the same way
we treat Hank Greenberg...

1194
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,126
...except we call him a kike
instead of a coon.

1195
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,760
Whenever we play exhibitions
with the Yankees...

1196
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,321
...we call Joe DiMaggio "The Wop."

1197
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,448
All right? They laugh about it.

1198
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,047
And it's forgotten when the game's over.

1199
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,563
<i>I don't care if they like me.</i>

1200
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,287
I didn't come here to make friends.

1201
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,209
I don't even care if they respect me.
I know who I am.

1202
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,171
Got enough respect for myself.

1203
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,409
But I do not want them to beat me.

1204
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,650
They're never gonna beat you.

1205
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,289
They came close today.

1206
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,241
I'm going in that Phillies dugout
tomorrow...

1207
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,482
...and I'm gonna wring
Ben Chapman's neck!

1208
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,608
Did I say something funny?

1209
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,048
When I first told you about Robinson,
Harold...

1210
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,170
...you were against it.

1211
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,482
Now, all of the sudden
you're worried about him.

1212
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,966
Wonder how that happened.

1213
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,442
- Why, any decent-minded person would...
- Sympathy, Harold.

1214
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,531
It's a Greek word. It means "to suffer."

1215
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,127
"I sympathize with you"
means "I suffer with you."

1216
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,451
That Philadelphia manager is, uh...

1217
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,291
He's doing me a service.

1218
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,205
- A service?
- Yes.

1219
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,843
He's creating sympathy
on Jackie's behalf.

1220
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,211
"Philadelphia" is Greek.

1221
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,287
Means "brotherly love."

1222
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,241
<i>Bob Bragan to see you, Mr. Rickey.</i>

1223
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,723
What in Satan's fire does he want?

1224
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,121
All right, send him in.

1225
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,565
What do you want, Bragan?

1226
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,686
Uh, Mr. Rickey, I, uh...

1227
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,407
- I would like, um...
- What do you want?

1228
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,882
I'd like to not be traded, sir.

1229
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,130
If it's not too late.

1230
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,044
What about Robinson?

1231
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,283
The world's changing.

1232
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,006
I guess I can live with the change.

1233
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,608
I mean, I can't believe it.
I speak my mind, and they trade me.

1234
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,409
This ain't the America I know.

1235
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,082
Uh-uh. Home of the free, land of the brave?
You hear me?

1236
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,363
Where they sending you, Hig?

1237
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,566
Pittsburgh.

1238
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,808
For cash and some Italian outfielder
named Gionfriddo.

1239
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,205
Pittsburgh. I mean...

1240
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,961
Good luck, boys. You gonna need it.

1241
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,289
Pittsburgh!

1242
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,450
Branch, it's Herb.

1243
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,722
<i>Herb. What can I do for you?</i>

1244
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,962
Branch,
how long have we known each other?

1245
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,611
Oh, 20 years, maybe more.

1246
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,366
That's right.
Been over some solid road together.

1247
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:55,209
So, urn, you can trust me when I tell you
Brooklyn's due here tomorrow...

1248
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,651
...but you cannot bring
that nigger down here...

1249
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,609
<i>...with the rest of your team.</i>

1250
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,809
Why's that, Herb?

1251
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,162
His name is Jackie Robinson,
by the way.

1252
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,687
Yeah, Branch,
I understand he's got a name...

1253
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,680
...but we're just not ready for that sort
of thing here in Philadelphia.

1254
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,848
We're not gonna be able to take the field
against your team if that boy's in uniform.

1255
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,841
Well, what you do with your team
is your decision, Herb.

1256
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,004
But my team's gonna be
in Philadelphia tomorrow...

1257
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,003
<i>...with Robinson.</i>

1258
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,562
And if we have to claim the game
as a forfeit, so be it.

1259
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,643
That's 9-0...

1260
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,200
<i>...in case you forgot.</i>

1261
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,688
You've had a hell of a hair across your ass
over this for a long time.

1262
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,366
I'd like to know
what it is you're trying to prove.

1263
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,126
You think God likes baseball, Herb?

1264
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,525
What...? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1265
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,081
It means someday
you're gonna meet God...

1266
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,971
...and when he inquires
as why you didn't take the field...

1267
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,884
...against Robinson in Philadelphia...

1268
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,611
...and you answer
that it's because he was a Negro...

1269
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,690
...it may not be a sufficient reply!

1270
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:25,883
Okay, guys, we got 20 minutes to check in
and get to Shibe, so chop-chop!

1271
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,241
Hey!

1272
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,250
Hey. Out.

1273
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,811
And get that bus out of here.

1274
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,925
Oh, no, no, no, we have reservations.
We're the Dodgers.

1275
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,085
No, your team is not welcome here. Not
while you have ball club Negroes with you.

1276
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,368
You just mean that Robinson can't stay,
right?

1277
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,047
No, I mean your entire team
has been refused.

1278
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,727
- We've been staying here for 10 years.
- And you can stay away that long too.

1279
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,008
Hold on. Now, wait,
we should talk about this.

1280
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,208
Who put you up to this?
Is it the Phillies?

1281
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,402
They're not gonna let us stay here,
fellas.

1282
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,251
They don't want us here.

1283
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,804
Yeah, well maybe 42's got enough friends
in town we can bunk up.

1284
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,930
It's the rule we're gonna go with.
We've got reservations.

1285
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,690
- Why is that?
- That is the rule!

1286
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,604
What's that supposed to mean?

1287
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,650
It's not supposed to mean a thing.

1288
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,929
When you can't get in hotels,
you got people's houses you stay at.

1289
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,605
Ain't that right?

1290
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,606
What?

1291
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,209
What do you want from me, Walker?

1292
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,366
An apology.

1293
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,245
You want an apology? For what?

1294
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,765
For places like this?

1295
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,644
No. For turning this season
into a damn sideshow.

1296
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,768
- Hey, fellas.
- I'm a ballplayer, all right?

1297
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,287
- I'm here to play ball!
- So am I.

1298
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,886
I'm hereto win.

1299
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,690
We want to win.
We on the same page?

1300
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,081
Well, how we supposed
to win sleeping on a bus?

1301
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,164
Maybe it'll do you some good
the way you been swinging the bat.

1302
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,483
- Hey, you watch your mouth!
- Hey, you watch your hand.

1303
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,087
- Don't you ever talk to me like that again!
- Watch your hand!

1304
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,402
You hear me? Watch yourself!

1305
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,129
- You spit on me now?
- If I spit on you, it'd be an improvement.

1306
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,807
- That's it. You go home, all right?
- All right, that's enough!

1307
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,331
Hey, hey! Get used to it, fellas.
This how it's gonna be.

1308
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,124
We show up, the circus is in town!

1309
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,328
I'm not going anywhere!

1310
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,760
I'm right here!

1311
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,964
"There is a great lynch mob among us.

1312
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:23,482
They go unhooded
and work without a rope."

1313
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,603
That's you, not me.

1314
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,124
"We must remember
that all this country's enemies...

1315
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,090
...are not beyond the frontiers
of our homeland."

1316
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,480
A Jew probably wrote that.

1317
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,041
I don't care who wrote it.
It's in the damn papers!

1318
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,723
This is not good, Ben.

1319
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,811
Makes the entire Phillies organization
look racist.

1320
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,485
You gotta do something about it.

1321
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,889
Me? Look, I'm defending baseball.

1322
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,408
It's time for you to step up
and defend the Phillies.

1323
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,410
This started on the field, it's gonna end on
the field, and we're done talking about it.

1324
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,844
All right.

1325
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,810
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

1326
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,647
Excuse me. Hi. Jackie.

1327
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,285
Uh, Wendell, um...

1328
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,687
A request came in.

1329
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,044
Uh, Ben Chapman, he's the, uh, manager
for the Phillies. You knew that.

1330
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,362
Uh, he'd like his photo taken with you.

1331
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,611
You been drinking, Harold?

1332
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,161
No. No. I wish.

1333
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,409
No, Mr. Rickey, uh,
he thinks it's a good idea.

1334
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,563
He says it's gonna be in every sports page
across the country.

1335
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,361
An example that even the most hardened
man can change.

1336
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,684
Chapman hasn't changed.
He's just trying to save face.

1337
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,322
Mr. Rickey says it doesn't matter
if he's changed.

1338
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,881
As long as it looks like he's changed.

1339
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,406
Jackie, you've seen the questions
come in slow.

1340
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,804
Now, just see this photo come in
even slower.

1341
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,885
Chapman said he'd come down here.
Or, uh, he could meet you in the runway.

1342
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,326
No.

1343
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,444
On the field.

1344
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,971
Where everyone can see.

1345
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:28,841
Did World War Ill break out?
Look at all of y'all.

1346
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,683
They even dug you up, Baum.
This must be important.

1347
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,888
Listen, I want to say something, uh...

1348
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,723
Jackie's been accepted into baseball...

1349
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,327
...and the Philadelphia organization
wish him all the luck that we can.

1350
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:46,481
I just hope that our trial of fire
has helped him along.

1351
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,730
How about a picture?
You shake hands. Bury the hatchet.

1352
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,484
You wanna bury the hatchet?

1353
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,166
Sure.

1354
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,724
We'll use a bat.

1355
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,407
That way we don't have to touch skin.

1356
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,884
- All right.
- Come on, fellas.

1357
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,327
- All right, do it.
- That's good. Right here.

1358
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,450
One more. This way, Ben.

1359
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,961
<i>It's Ostermueller on the mound.</i>

1360
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,451
<i>Ostermueller, deliberate.</i>

1361
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,241
<i>What I mean to say is, he's one of
the slowest working pitchers in the game.</i>

1362
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,890
<i>Here's the windup. And...</i>

1363
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,362
<i>Oh, my! He hit Jackie Robinson right
in the head. And Jackie is down!</i>

1364
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,767
What are you doing out there,
Ostermueller?

1365
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,565
Hey!

1366
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:46,008
Ostermueller, you creep!
You gotta bat too! Don't you forget it!

1367
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,844
Hey, I'm ready, you wop bastard!

1368
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,571
Oh, yeah? "Wop bastard"?
It's coming between your eyes.

1369
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,769
- I'm gonna come like a kamikaze!
- He doesn't belong here!

1370
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:54,967
Get off! Knock it off!

1371
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,245
I'll send you back
to Schmeling and Goering...

1372
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,607
...and the rest of your dead
Kraut buddies!

1373
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,165
You want some, Piner?

1374
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,731
He doesn't belong here!

1375
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,444
They're just ignorant.

1376
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,367
Hmm?

1377
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,727
If they knew you,
they would be ashamed.

1378
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,569
What can I do for you, Pee Wee?

1379
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,962
Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this.

1380
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,647
The series in Cincinnati next week?

1381
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,804
Yes. Important road trip.

1382
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,046
- We're only three games out of first.
- Yes, sir.

1383
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,205
Now, you know I'm from Kentucky.

1384
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:12,641
Then Cincinnati
will nearly be a home game for you.

1385
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,805
Well...

1386
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,369
...I got this letter.

1387
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,487
Apparently, some people aren't too happy
about me playing with Robinson.

1388
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,005
Huh?

1389
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:28,241
"Nigger lover.

1390
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,124
Watch yourself.

1391
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,010
We'll get you, carpetbagger."

1392
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,241
Pretty typical stuff.

1393
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,010
Well, it's not typical to me, sir.

1394
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,404
How many of those letters
have you gotten, Pee Wee?

1395
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,802
Just the one. Ain't that enough?

1396
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,571
What are those?

1397
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,527
Well, I'll tell you what they aren't.

1398
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:09,527
They aren't letters
from the Jackie Robinson fan club.

1399
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,888
"Get out of baseball
or your baby boy will die."

1400
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,924
"Quit baseball or your nigger wife..."

1401
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,486
"Get out of the game or be killed."

1402
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,645
Does Jackie know?

1403
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,041
Well, of course he does.

1404
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,924
And the FBI.

1405
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:43,250
They're taking a threat in Cincinnati
pretty seriously.

1406
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:48,361
So excuse me if I don't get too upset
about you getting called a carpetbagger.

1407
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,170
You should be proud.

1408
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,650
Well, I'd just like to play ball, sir.
That's all.

1409
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,924
Oh, I understand.

1410
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,765
I bet Jackie just wants to play ball.

1411
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,003
I bet he wishes he wasn't leading
the League in hit by pitch.

1412
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,084
I bet he wishes people didn't want
to kill him.

1413
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,885
The world's not so simple anymore.

1414
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,922
Guess it never was.

1415
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,084
We just, uh...

1416
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,766
Baseball ignored it, now we can't.

1417
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,520
Yes, sir.

1418
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,408
<i>No hits, no runs for
the Dodgers. The Reds are coming to bat.</i>

1419
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,131
How many times
do you think Pee Wee's gonna score?

1420
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,441
Well, I don't know, son.

1421
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,650
I remember when I was a kid, I saw Honus
Wagner play, scored three times that day.

1422
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,963
- We'll just have to wait and see.
- Wow, that would be great.

1423
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,484
We don't want you here!

1424
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,325
Hey! Hey, Nigger boy!

1425
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,130
Get the hell out of Cincinnati!

1426
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,369
We don't want you here!

1427
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,450
Go back to Brooklyn!

1428
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,965
You the batboy, sambo?

1429
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,761
Hey, nigger! I'm talking to you!

1430
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,362
Get the hell out of Cincinnati!
We don't want you here, boy!

1431
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,610
Nigger!

1432
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,603
We don't want you here!

1433
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,646
Cincinnati fans expressing their
displeasure as the Dodgers take the field.

1434
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,650
<i>Jackie Robinson at first.
"The Brat" Eddie Stanky at second.</i>

1435
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,929
<i>Spider Jorgensen at third. And
the captain, Pee Wee Reese, at short.</i>

1436
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:33,686
<i>Fans, ask any man and they'll tell you,
the Gillette Superspeed razor is a honey.</i>

1437
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,127
<i>Maybe the sweetest shaving razor
you'll ever use.</i>

1438
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,965
<i>Look sharp, feel sharp, be sharp.</i>

1439
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,730
We don't want no niggers here!

1440
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,850
They can say all they want.
We're just here to play ball.

1441
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,570
Get him off the field!

1442
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:49,486
It's just a bunch of crackpots
still fighting the Civil War.

1443
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,447
Well, we'd have won that son of a gun
if the cornstalks would have held out.

1444
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,602
We just ran out of ammunition.

1445
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,883
Better luck next time, Pee Wee.

1446
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,329
Ain't gonna be a next time, Jackie.

1447
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,721
Hey, Reese! Carpetbagger!

1448
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,249
All we got's right here. Right now.
You know what I mean?

1449
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,965
Thank you, Jackie.

1450
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,729
What are you thanking me for?

1451
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,361
I got family up there from Louisville.

1452
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,170
I need them to know.

1453
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,728
I need them to know who I am.

1454
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,080
Hey, number 1!

1455
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,848
You playing ball or socializing?

1456
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:46,961
Playing ball, ump.

1457
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,160
Play ball!
Don't let them get to you!

1458
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,770
Playing ball.

1459
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:56,681
Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear 42.
That way they won't tell us apart.

1460
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,289
Come on, Jackie!

1461
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,490
Let me ask you something, Jackie.

1462
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,962
How come you never shower
until everybody else is done?

1463
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,686
What are you, shy?

1464
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,647
I don't want to make anyone feel
uncomfortable.

1465
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,840
We're a team. On a hot streak.

1466
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,480
Come on, half those wins
were on account of you.

1467
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,244
You're the bravest guy I ever saw.

1468
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,770
You're leading us,
you're afraid to take a shower? Heh.

1469
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,768
Come on, take a shower with me, Jackie.

1470
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,243
I didn't mean it like...

1471
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,688
That came out wrong. I was not saying
just take a shower with me.

1472
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,491
I was saying, why don't we all go
and take a shower.

1473
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,681
- Like, why...?
- Heh.

1474
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,446
As a team,
why don't we shower together.

1475
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:20,120
- Heh. Branca?
- Yeah.

1476
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:25,323
- Stop.
- Yeah.

1477
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,886
I'm stopping.

1478
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:59,965
We're in the last of a 4-game
series with the Cardinals.

1479
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:04,409
These two teams are in a dogfight for first.
Top of the 11th now, all tied up at 2.

1480
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,166
<i>For those of you just tuning in,
how did we get here?</i>

1481
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,885
<i>Well, it's been double trouble...</i>

1482
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,283
<i>...as Robinson knocked in Stanky
with a double in the 3rd.</i>

1483
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,965
Shoot two! Shoot two!

1484
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,640
<i>And Dixie Walker did
the same with a double in the 8th.</i>

1485
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,124
Second base! Second base!

1486
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,560
<i>But it wasn't enough...</i>

1487
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,524
<i>...as the Cardinals
tied it up with two of their own in the 9th.</i>

1488
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,126
<i>This game is crucial to the Red Birds.</i>

1489
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,486
<i>They are five games out...</i>

1490
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:32,406
<i>...with the Dodgers not having
relinquished first place since June 30th.</i>

1491
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,724
<i>They call him "Country."</i>

1492
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,771
Slaughter's hitless in four trips. "Fireman"
Casey in his second inning of relief.

1493
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:41,924
<i>This game is just as tight
as a new pair of shoes on a rainy day.</i>

1494
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,082
<i>Casey goes into his windup.</i>

1495
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,568
<i>Slaughter hits a hard ground ball right at
Reese, who fires it over to Jack at first.</i>

1496
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,406
<i>Oh, my!</i>

1497
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:56,487
<i>Robinson is down. Slaughter spiked him
high up on the leg and he is down.</i>

1498
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,450
Goddamn it! You knew
what you were doing! You spiked my guy!

1499
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,045
Get up, Jackie.

1500
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,522
Get him up, boys, get him up.

1501
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,444
Stay off it. Team doc will be out.

1502
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,047
Hugh, next guy up, you hit him right
in the head. You clean his clock.

1503
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,601
- No. Get me up.
- No, lay down, man. You're staying.

1504
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,609
No. Get me up!

1505
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,011
Easy, kid.

1506
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,645
Just get him out.

1507
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,125
Just get him out.

1508
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,281
Understand?

1509
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,125
Game's too important.

1510
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,850
Just get him out.

1511
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,846
Go play ball.

1512
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,367
- You a tough man, Jackie.
- Let's get him out.

1513
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,488
Jackie, what are saying?
He spiked you on purpose?

1514
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,445
You saw the play.

1515
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,968
My foot was on the inside of the bag,
he was out, but he kept coming.

1516
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,646
- It was on purpose?
- Slaughter said it was an accident.

1517
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,325
What are you asking me for then?

1518
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,801
- Are you calling Slaughter a liar?
- Is he a liar?

1519
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,850
Am I calling him a liar?
What are you gonna write?

1520
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,686
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Come on, Rickey, let him finish the story!

1521
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,760
Go on, let me talk to my first baseman.

1522
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,046
- Is he a liar, Jackie?
- Go!

1523
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,010
- All right, all right.
- Getting stitched up, for Pete's sake.

1524
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,527
Just trying to do our job, Rickey.

1525
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,011
Looks good, Babe.
Thank you, sir.

1526
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:22,411
Sticking up for himself
is something you'd expect of any man.

1527
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:29,042
Some find it galling in a Negro.

1528
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,281
You know what I saw this morning?

1529
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:49,050
I was passing a sandlot,
little white boy was up at bat.

1530
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,043
You know what he was doing?

1531
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,489
Sitting on a fastball?

1532
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,244
He was pretending he was you.

1533
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,368
Rubbing dirt on his hands.

1534
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,963
Swinging with his arms outstretched,
like you do.

1535
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:10,768
Little white boy
pretending he is a black man.

1536
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,162
Why'd you do this, Mr. Rickey?

1537
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,890
We had a victory over fascism
in Germany.

1538
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,647
It's time we had a victory
over racism at home.

1539
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,211
No.

1540
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,171
Why?

1541
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,006
Why'd you do it?

1542
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,291
Come on.

1543
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,164
Tell me.

1544
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,610
I love this game.

1545
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,769
I love baseball.

1546
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,642
Given my whole life to it.

1547
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:13,526
40-odd years ago, I was a player-coach
at Ohio Wesleyan University.

1548
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:18,205
We had a Negro catcher.
Best hitter on the team.

1549
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,929
Charlie Thomas. Fine young man.

1550
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:27,327
I saw him laid low, broken,
because of the color of his skin.

1551
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:29,482
And I didn't do enough to help.

1552
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,041
Told myself I did, but I didn't.

1553
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:38,451
There was something unfair
at the heart of the game I loved.

1554
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,005
And I ignored it.

1555
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,409
But a time came...

1556
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,687
...when I could no longer do that.

1557
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,764
You...

1558
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,886
You let me love baseball again.

1559
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,846
Thank you.

1560
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,085
<i>Last long road trip of the year.</i>

1561
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,726
<i>And two long faces, huh?</i>

1562
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,288
Try not to lunge at the plate.

1563
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,690
You serious?

1564
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,684
That's why they're throwing
the fastballs inside.

1565
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,241
Fight those inside fastballs off...

1566
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,644
...sooner or later they won't be able
to help but throw a curve.

1567
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,247
And what'll happen then, coach?

1568
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,083
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

1569
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,562
Well, you know,
if we win enough of these next games...

1570
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,844
...we bring home the pennant.

1571
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,009
You bring yourself home.

1572
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,730
That'll be plenty.

1573
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,604
You're in my heart.

1574
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,407
<i>Since the 4th of July, the Brooklyn
Dodgers have gone on a hot streak...</i>

1575
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:30,040
<i>...holding off all challengers.</i>

1576
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,283
<i>During that time
and during this season...</i>

1577
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:35,046
<i>...I have watched Jackie Robinson
submerge himself...</i>

1578
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,850
<i>...to serve something greater.</i>

1579
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,769
<i>And I don't mean the Brooklyn Dodgers,
though he's doing that too.</i>

1580
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,763
<i>The man flat-out has guts.</i>

1581
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,208
<i>A stand-up force of nature,
he's complicated everything but himself.</i>

1582
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,807
<i>He's changing the world
and refusing to let it change him.</i>

1583
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,249
<i>But baseball isn't tennis.</i>

1584
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:58,169
<i>It takes a team.</i>

1585
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,487
<i>Joining together was a start.</i>

1586
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,802
<i>Staying together, a big step forward.</i>

1587
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,122
<i>But working together is how you win.</i>

1588
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,560
Out!

1589
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,328
Jackie, you son of a gun,
I could kiss you!

1590
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:12,641
Nice catch.

1591
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,290
Yours or mine? Heh.

1592
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,485
<i>Down the stretch
on the last long road trip of the year...</i>

1593
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:21,008
<i>...Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn
Dodgers are doing exactly that.</i>

1594
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,088
<i>They're holding off the Cardinals
and streaking towards the pennant.</i>

1595
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,320
Boss, we did it.

1596
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,721
We did it, we swept Cincinnati!

1597
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,291
<i>Great, Harold.</i>

1598
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,329
One more win could do it.

1599
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,528
Who's pitching tomorrow
for the Pirates?

1600
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,330
Ostermueller.

1601
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,003
<i>Fritz Ostermueller on the mound.</i>

1602
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,844
<i>He's 12-8 on the season.</i>

1603
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,241
<i>A big game today in Pittsburgh.</i>

1604
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,609
<i>A win and the Dodgers will have clinched
the National League pennant...</i>

1605
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,366
<i>...Yankees having already clinched
in the American League.</i>

1606
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:57,681
<i>There's bad blood here...</i>

1607
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,526
<i>...as Ostermueller beaned Robinson
in the head earlier in the season...</i>

1608
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:04,251
<i>...prompting quite a rhubarb at the time.</i>

1609
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,883
<i>Teams have gone
their separate ways since...</i>

1610
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,520
<i>...with Ostermueller left standing
in the Dodgers' way...</i>

1611
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:13,291
<i>...as they chase the pennant
that eluded them last year.</i>

1612
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,249
Come on, Jackie, let's go!

1613
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,760
<i>Here comes the pitch.</i>

1614
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,368
<i>And Robinson takes outside. Ball one.</i>

1615
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:26,928
- Come on, Fritz, let's get this boy!
- You don't belong here.

1616
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,645
And you never will.

1617
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,484
<i>Robinson crowding the plate.</i>

1618
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,927
<i>Jack hasn't backed down
to a pitcher all season.</i>

1619
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,161
There you go, Jackie!

1620
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:38,564
You got nothing for him, Ostermueller!
But he's got something for you!

1621
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,882
<i>Ostermueller winds and throws.</i>

1622
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,844
<i>Low and away, ball two.</i>

1623
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,122
<i>Fritz seems
to be pitching around Jackie...</i>

1624
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:50,250
<i>...or as they say in the trade,
trying to get him to chase.</i>

1625
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,402
<i>Robinson's having
a fine rookie standard...</i>

1626
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,643
<i>...batting .301 with 31 doubles
and 10 home runs.</i>

1627
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,929
<i>He has stolen 27 bases this season
and has yet to be thrown out attempting.</i>

1628
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,201
<i>Needless to say,
Ostermueller being careful with him.</i>

1629
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,969
<i>It's 3-0 now.</i>

1630
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,444
<i>Robinson patient,
waiting for something he can swing on.</i>

1631
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,445
Give me something.

1632
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,405
Give me something I can hit.

1633
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,766
You want it?

1634
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,490
What are you afraid of?

1635
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,129
What are you afraid of?

1636
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:33,969
<i>Ostermueller looking in for the sign.</i>

1637
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,771
Be careful what you ask for, boy.

1638
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,449
<i>And here comes the pitch.</i>

1639
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,602
<i>Oh, and that's a deep fly ball to left.</i>

1640
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,001
<i>Kiner on his horse,
I don't think he'll get there.</i>

1641
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,730
<i>Back, back, back, and...</i>

1642
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,360
<i>Oh, ho, ho, doctor!</i>

1643
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,648
<i>Robinson got his pitch!</i>

1644
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,040
<i>It's a home run.</i>

1645
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,771
<i>And barring a miracle comeback...</i>

1646
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,810
<i>...the Dodgers are going
to the World Series!</i>

1647
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,001
Yes!

1648
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,005
He did it, he did it!

1649
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,330
Pittsburgh!

1650
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,367
Yes!

1651
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:30,364
Way to go, Jackie!

1652
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,728
<i>Jack in his home run trot now,
and the home crowd here at Forbes...</i>

1653
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,486
<i>...recognizing something special
when they see it.</i>

1654
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,847
<i>All the same,
I can practically hear the roar...</i>

1655
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,526
<i>...from the heart of Flatbush back
in Brooklyn.</i>

1656
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,405
Jackie, yeah, yeah!

1657
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,531
Robinson rounds third...

1658
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:32,248
...headed for home...

1659
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,442
...sweet home.
