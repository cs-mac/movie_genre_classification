1
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:03,685
Previously on "Designated Survivor"...

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:06,021
America's favorite
vice presidential candidate

3
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:08,089
and the CIA's most wanted mercenary

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:08,983
know each other.

5
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:11,493
I'm working a lead that could
prove damning to Peter MacLeish.

6
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:12,648
Congresswoman Hookstraten

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,195
just called for an extended recess.

8
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:15,530
She's delaying MacLeish's hearing.

9
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:17,432
Someone inside the U.S. government

10
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,534
handed over the
blueprints to Majid Nassar

11
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:20,802
for the Capitol bombing.

12
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,270
There's a traitor among us.

13
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,505
Special Agent Hannah Wells

14
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:25,273
seemed to be a bit obsessed with me.

15
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,775
I just hope she isn't trying
to convince the speaker

16
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,677
of any conspiracy theory.

17
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,311
I found the evidence I was looking for.

18
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,066
I'll explain everything when I get there.

19
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,432
My God, are you okay?

20
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,068
Can you hear me?

21
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,557
Look, you've been in an accident,

22
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:56,882
but help is on the way.

23
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,948
Just try and sit still, okay?

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,250
And don't move your neck.

25
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:11,520
You're gonna be fine.

26
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,629
Madam Speaker, I know
you're waiting for someone,

27
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,665
but the entire country is waiting for us.

28
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,434
We can't delay this vote any longer.

29
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,469
Peter MacLeish is a hero.

30
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,771
Who my witness claims

31
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,506
to have damning evidence against.

32
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:05,807
We owe it to our constituents

33
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,443
to find out what that is.

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,683
Damn it. Pick up.

35
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:32,567
It's me.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,403
I lost her.

37
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,518
Aah!

38
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,173
Tom, what is this?

39
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,209
It's a blueprint.

40
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,543
A blueprint?

41
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:18,114
A guide for how to blow
up the Capitol building.

42
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,282
- Where did it come from?
- Us.

43
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,884
The Department of Defense.

44
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:25,167
Apparently after 9/11,

45
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,755
the Pentagon did a threat assessment

46
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:29,090
on all key government buildings

47
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,826
to show us where our weaknesses were.

48
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:34,063
A-And so you're thinking what?

49
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,533
I think someone inside our government

50
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,203
gave that blueprint to Al-Sakar
to blow up the Capitol.

51
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,205
Who else knows about this?

52
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,607
Just you and Mike.

53
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,575
Tom, you need to call in someone

54
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,611
from Homeland Security or the FBI.

55
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,412
No, no, we can't call anyone

56
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:53,448
until we know exactly what this is.

57
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,117
You're scaring me right now.

58
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,318
You remember the first night

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,620
we were here in the Rose Garden?

60
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:00,755
You asked me if I thought
we were a target.

61
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:01,990
I said I didn't know.

62
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,025
But now...

63
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,527
...I think you need to take the kids

64
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:07,829
and leave until we know it's safe.

65
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,997
Take them where?

66
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,399
Where's "safe"?

67
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,002
- I don't know.
- But that's my point.

68
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,004
How do we run if we don't
know who we're running from?

69
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,438
Mike's bringing in

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,774
the man who wrote the file, Dr. Enright.

71
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,509
Maybe he's got some answers for us.

72
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,111
But until then,

73
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,346
we cannot trust anyone.

74
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,015
Okay, time's up.

75
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,883
If you don't join us inside immediately,

76
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:30,068
I will tell the public

77
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,705
that you blocked Peter
MacLeish's appointment

78
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,609
so you would be next in
line for the presidency.

79
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,561
Reconvene the committee.

80
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,624
Hannah?!

81
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,626
- What happened?
- You can't let them find me.

82
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:12,894
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!

83
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,229
You need help!

84
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,530
Chuck, you can't call anyone.

85
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,365
I have to get you to the hospital.

86
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,466
You need a-a doctor.

87
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:19,635
You... Hannah?

88
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,594
Hannah!

89
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:28,555

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,380
Now that the House Judiciary Committee

91
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,015
has given the nominee the green light,

92
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,417
the full House will convene
for a late-night vote

93
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,419
that many expect will
make Peter MacLeish

94
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,822
the next Vice President
of the United States.

95
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,924
Congratulations.

96
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,726
Ooh. To Peter MacLeish.

97
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,162
- To the new Vice President.
- Hear, hear.

98
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,467
What's up, Spring Break?

99
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,401
Oh, come on.

100
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,570
You know, if you had
60 news-hungry journalists

101
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,906
clamoring for information
about Nassar's murder,

102
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:58,927
you'd be thirsty, too.

103
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:00,544
Eh, maybe the MacLeish confirmation

104
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,867
will keep them off your
back for a news cycle.

105
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:02,821
Yeah.

106
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,679
The only thing that's
gonna keep them off my back

107
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:05,947
is an answer,

108
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,615
which, as I remind you, we don't have.

109
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,017
Yeah.

110
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,123
Rumor is MacLeish

111
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,754
is bringing a bunch of his
House staffers with him.

112
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:12,863
You guys know any of them?

113
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,455
Yeah, I used to play
soccer every Tuesday night

114
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,590
with his Coms director.

115
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:16,925
That guy's sharp as a marble.

116
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,927
I once shared a summer
house in Dewey Beach

117
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,728
with his legislative assistants.

118
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,431
I mean, we were only 19,
but they seemed on top of it.

119
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,599
19?

120
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,268
Yes, and I will need plenty more of these

121
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,213
before you get any of those stories.

122
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:33,741
All right, I'm gonna go meet the
speech writers on New Street.

123
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,243
You guys are welcomto join.

124
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,911
Nah, we're good where we are, Seth.

125
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,881
- Thank you.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

126
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:42,417
- Have a good night.
- Get home safe.

127
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,686
...will be his wife, Beth,
and their two daughters.

128
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,788
Can you believe
everything that's happened?

129
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,692
It's been a roller coaster, for sure.

130
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,694
You know, I have to admit,

131
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:54,595
when I first got here,

132
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:57,765
I thought that you were
gonna do everything you could

133
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,267
to get me out of the White House,

134
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,437
not be the reason I'm still here.

135
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,407
Well, I have to admit,
when you first got here,

136
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:07,976
I didn't think you could handle it.

137
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:09,811
Yeah, you called me a minor leaguer.

138
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,715
Yeah, well, I was wrong.

139
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:17,553
If anything, I'm learning from you.

140
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,739
Mr. President, Dr. Alan Enright.

141
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,708
Dr. Enright, please.

142
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:48,851
I need you to verify for
me that this is your work.

143
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,400
I think you know that it is.

144
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,491
I think that's why I'm here, Mr. President,

145
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:59,244
but I had nothing to do with
what happened at the Capitol.

146
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,829
I wrote this file to
prevent what happened,

147
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,031
not to cause it.

148
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,665
Even if that's true, you had to realize

149
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:05,833
that someone used your work

150
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,635
to plan and carry out the bombing.

151
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,551
They followed it to the letter.

152
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,103
Why didn't you come forward?

153
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,512
I close my eyes.
I can see the building fall.

154
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,618
The cast iron melting,
the marble crumble.

155
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,618
Whoever did this,

156
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,919
we're talking about a conspiracy

157
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,989
of unparalleled proportions.

158
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,426
I was scared, Mr. President.

159
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,930
Okay.

160
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,199
Okay.

161
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,568
Doctor, I'm gonna need you to give me

162
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,004
every single name
that had access to this file.

163
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:47,008
I put an ORCON
classification on this file,

164
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,611
which means the number of
people who saw it is limited.

165
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,981
And then I sent it to
the DOD security team.

166
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:55,709
They all died in the Capitol.

167
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,186
I also sent it to the head of NORCOM.

168
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,488
You sent the file to General Grady?

169
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,159
I wrote this file two
years and six months ago.

170
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,496
General Grady was not
the head of NORCOM then.

171
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,731
Who was?

172
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,634
The general you fired.

173
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:15,169
Harris Cochrane.

174
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,852
...Met MacLeish properly

175
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,877
with the House Judiciary Committee.

176
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,647
Peter MacLeish has been named
the Miracle on the Potomac,

177
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,983
and this return to the capital
will hopefully redefine

178
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,785
the public's association with...

179
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,924
With a final tally of 424-9,

180
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,593
Congressman MacLeish

181
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,461
was confirmed by the
House of Representatives

182
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,730
in a historic vote late last night.

183
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,766
Meanwhile, organizers
are working double time

184
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,100
to prepare for...

185
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:51,168
Hi.

186
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,203
Hey.

187
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,088
Uh, hey.

188
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:55,572
You okay?

189
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,074
How you feeling?

190
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,008
Better.

191
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,576
Yeah, thanks to you.

192
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:00,679
Easy.

193
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,615
Hey, Chuck. Did you glue my wound?

194
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,816
Yeah.

195
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,651
Where did you learn to do that?

196
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:08,687
YouTube.

197
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,255
House confirmed him.

198
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:12,923
They're swearing him in this afternoon.

199
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:14,792
Peter MacLeish's confirmation

200
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:17,161
received no opposition from
the newly appointed...

201
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:18,662
Whoever made sure MacLeish survived

202
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:19,830
wanted him as VP for a reason,

203
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,265
so we have less than eight hours

204
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,866
- to make sure that doesn't happen.
- Okay, look,

205
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,668
I know this isn't what
you're gonna want to hear,

206
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,804
but...

207
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:27,805
...Someone tried to kill you,

208
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:28,872
Atwood's in prison,

209
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:31,842
Foerstel has me on suspension.

210
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:35,679
- Maybe it's time we...
- What?

211
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:38,650
- Quit?
- Hannah.

212
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,320
You almost died last night.

213
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:46,824
I literally had to scrub
your blood off of my hands.

214
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,794
What else do they need to do to us?

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Chuck, why did you join the FBI?

216
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,171
To help people.

217
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,641
I joined to piss my father off.

218
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:07,845
He's a top surgeon in Chicago,

219
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,013
and he wanted me
to follow in his footsteps.

220
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:12,750
Practically held me at gunpoint

221
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,695
and took me to Johns Hopkins.

222
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:17,221
So I went.

223
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,189
And, uh, halfway
through grad school,

224
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,991
I walked out, jumped on a train,

225
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:25,162
went to D.C., and signed up for the FBI.

226
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:26,597
I wanted to help, too.

227
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,666
I just wanted to do it in my own way.

228
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:34,738
It's not their job to stop.

229
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,307
It's our job to stop them.

230
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,577
And I'm scared, too.

231
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,847
But if we quit, they win, and then...

232
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:48,118
everyone who lost someone that day...

233
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,522
they'll never know peace.

234
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:54,591
Nice try.

235
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,126
You've never been scared in your life.

236
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,658
Fine. I'm in. What's the next step?

237
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,801
- Get back in touch with Hookstraten?
- No.

238
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,602
I told her I had evidence on MacLeish,

239
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,071
- and someone tries to kill me.
- Right.

240
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:10,141
And they took all my evidence.

241
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:15,145
The evidence I got from the
woman who's been calling me.

242
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,313
No, I already told you

243
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,869
I can't trace the call from her again,

244
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:20,951
and even if I could,
I'm shut out of my office.

245
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,286
Then you'd better get creative

246
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,264
'cause it's the only lead we got.

247
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:31,615
- Did anyone see you bring him in?
- No, sir.

248
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,891
I kept him off Waves and brought
him in through the East Wing.

249
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,132
It was still early, so it wasn't a problem.

250
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,633
Okay, good.

251
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:37,902
Thank you, Mike.

252
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,445
It's different in here when it's quiet.

253
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:49,847
On the contrary.

254
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,915
This is what this room is usually like.

255
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,951
More calm than storm.

256
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,606
General, I need you to look at this.

257
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:57,232
Mike?

258
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,233
This looks like a re-enactment
of the Capitol bombing.

259
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:11,268
Well, it's not.

260
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,199
General, this is file 12-80C,

261
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:16,855
a threat assessment
created by the Pentagon

262
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,477
2 1/2 years before the bombing.

263
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:26,383
Mr. President, I have
never seen this before.

264
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,418
I find that highly unlikely.

265
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,321
This file was given an
ORCON classification.

266
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:32,556
I can count on my hand

267
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,325
the number of people that have seen it.

268
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,561
Your name is the only one on the list

269
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,163
that survived the bombing.

270
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:43,679
This was sent to me,

271
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,569
but I never had
the opportunity to read it.

272
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:49,072
That file was reclassified
by the Secretary of Defense

273
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:50,907
and recalled electronically
from my computer

274
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,075
before I could access it.

275
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:53,443
And you expect me to believe

276
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,178
that you just remembered that?

277
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,754
A file taken from my hand
by the Secretary of Defense

278
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,583
at a moment's notice?

279
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,418
A lieutenant general being told

280
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,286
he's not cleared to read something?

281
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,255
Never happened before, not to me.

282
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:06,590
What would be the circumstances

283
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,358
that would cause the Secretary of Defense

284
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,594
- to reclassify a document like that?
- I don't know,

285
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,696
but it's not something
he could do unilaterally.

286
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,231
He must've been given orders.

287
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,199
By who?

288
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:19,369
There's a chain of command.

289
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:22,540
Only one place the Sec
Def gets his orders from.

290
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,770
The White House.

291
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,825
General, you'll be detained

292
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,036
- until we can verify your story.
- I understand.

293
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,117
Mr. President.

294
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,620
You have a serious problem.

295
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:39,456
And while you may not ask for my help,

296
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,493
it's here if you want it, sir.

297
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,104
- Hey, Emily.
- Hey.

298
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:52,269
So, I was thinking,
now that MacLeish is confirmed,

299
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:53,993
we should start scheduling
committee hearings right away

300
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,648
to push the president's
cabinet nominees through.

301
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:56,573
That's a great idea.

302
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,608
We should get some Leg Affairs
folks to start prepping.

303
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,976
I'll get on it.

304
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,112
Hey, listen. About last night...

305
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,859
You mean when you kissed me?

306
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:04,938
You don't have to be weird about it.

307
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,682
Well, what if I want
to be weird about it?

308
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,153
Anyway, there's an Elvis impersonator

309
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:11,655
later tonight at the Nine Thirty club.

310
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:12,679
You want to go?

311
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,424
How did you know I like Elvis?

312
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:16,493
Well, opposition research
comes in handy sometimes.

313
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,428
Seth told you?

314
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,064
Seth told me.

315
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm in.

316
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,168
All right.

317
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,538
The president wants to see me.

318
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,340
I didn't get a message.

319
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:32,676
Well, then it can't be
anything too important.

320
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,212
Yeah.

321
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,183
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay in this room.

322
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,219
- Do you understand?
- Of course.

323
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,976
Yesterday I received a
highly classified DOD file

324
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,668
detailing how to blow up the Capitol.

325
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,526
I believe it's what Al-Sakar used

326
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,328
to plan and carry out the attack.

327
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,563
I also think the file was given to them

328
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:56,032
by someone in Richmond's administration.

329
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:57,737
That's why I had to bring you in on this.

330
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,402
Not only do I trust you implicitly,

331
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:02,205
you weren't here when the
file was being circulated.

332
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,341
Who was?

333
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,245
This is what I managed
to put together so far.

334
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,666
- Aaron's on this list.
- I know.

335
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:15,252
I had to put down everyone's name

336
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,720
who had security clearance
that would allow them

337
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:19,055
to know the file even existed.

338
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:22,425
Emily, I think there's a
traitor in the White House,

339
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:24,394
and I need you to help
me find out who it is.

340
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:33,652
Yeah, Shelly.

341
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:35,092
Nassar's been dead for six days.

342
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,793
When can we expect an answer?

343
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,261
As I said before, Shelly,

344
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,097
I still don't have any
information about this.

345
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,898
Come on, guys, who's gonna ask me
about the swearing-in ceremony?

346
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,899
Over here. Seth. Seth.

347
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,034
Natalie.

348
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,023
About the decision

349
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,237
to hold the swearing-in
at the Capitol site...

350
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,805
How exactly was that reached?

351
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,307
Thank you, Natalie.

352
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,276
So, since Thomas Jefferson's
inauguration in 1800,

353
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,612
swearing-in ceremonies have
been held at the Capitol,

354
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,651
and the president felt

355
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,915
it was both symbolic and necessary

356
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,617
to continue with that tradition, all right?

357
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,985
That's actually all I have right now.

358
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,560
I am gonna be calling you back in,
in a few hours.

359
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:04,616
Thank you.

360
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,160
Have OP send us an updated list

361
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,715
of who they've invited to the swearing-in.

362
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,773
Seth.

363
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,930
A word?

364
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,665
Thanks, guys. I'll catch up to you.

365
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,067
Lisa. Hey.

366
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,301
You didn't call on me once.

367
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,909
Oh, sorry. I didn't see you.

368
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,806
I couldn't have been more clear
if I had one of those light sticks

369
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,808
they use to direct airplanes.

370
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,643
Now, if this is about you

371
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,279
holding a grudge about
the Leo Kirkman story...

372
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,781
Look, there's limited time.

373
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,082
You know, I can't get
to everyone's question,

374
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,683
but if you have
something that's pressing,

375
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,845
you can always send me an e-mail

376
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:36,348
or reach out to one of the
deputies in my office.

377
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,301
Seth.

378
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:38,755
Okay, I get it.

379
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,152
I betrayed your trust.

380
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:41,825
And I'm sorry.

381
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,809
But it's my job to ask questions

382
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,068
and your job to answer them.

383
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,766
The president can forgive me.
Why can't you?

384
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,014
Emily.

385
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,348
Hey. I was looking all over for you.

386
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,218
I thought you were gonna sit in on that
legislative affairs meeting with me.

387
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,486
Oh, sorry.

388
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,222
I got tied up.

389
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,517
So, what did the president
want to see you about?

390
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,469
Nothing.

391
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,663
Uh, he just... he wanted
me to take another look

392
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,375
at Bruce Rangell for HUD Secretary.

393
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,068
That one's obviously important
for him, so... Yeah.

394
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,911
- Hey, so, tonight,
pick you up here... -45?

395
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,470
Um...

396
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,840
Look, I think I'm gonna
be pretty swamped here,

397
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,008
so I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

398
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,343
I'm sorry.

399
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,771
Okay. All right.

400
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:35,629
Rain check.

401
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,442
Em... Emily, listen, you... you don't...

402
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,717
You don't regret last night, do you?

403
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,987
No, I just can't do it tonight.

404
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,155
Okay.

405
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,230
Okay, signaling system 7... SS-7.

406
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,899
Lets every cellphone
tower talk to each other

407
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:56,777
so your phone works
anywhere in the world.

408
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,101
How does that help us?

409
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,402
If I can get in,

410
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,238
we can connect the dots from your cell

411
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,373
back to the one that mystery
woman called you from.

412
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,280
Got it. I'm in.

413
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,393
- Good job, Chuck.
- Don't thank me yet.

414
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,672
I still got to backtrack the
number that called your cell.

415
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,188
- Damn it.
- What?

416
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,190
Network picked up the intrusion.

417
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,092
It's a race to see what happens first...

418
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,928
I track your mystery caller's phone,

419
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,346
or they track us.

420
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,431
Come on. Come on.

421
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,870
Got it.

422
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,307
Looks like the call to your cell

423
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,358
- came from a burner phone.
- Purchased from where?

424
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,181
A convenience store in Dupont Circle.

425
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,453
- Speaker Hookstraten's here, sir.
- Thank you, Wyatt.

426
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,955
You wanted to speak
with me, Mr. President?

427
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,823
Yes, Madam Speaker.

428
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,093
I was told that you had
information on Congressman MacLeish

429
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,063
that you wanted to
share with the committee.

430
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,100
I'm sorry, but I need
to know what that was.

431
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:09,005
Six weeks ago, an FBI
agent approached me.

432
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,808
She wanted access to the
blueprints of the Capitol.

433
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,944
Yesterday, she told me

434
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,980
she had evidence against Peter MacLeish.

435
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,982
And then she never showed up.

436
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,350
She... What was the agent's name?

437
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,484
Hannah Wells.

438
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,354
Hannah Wells.

439
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,823
Congressman MacLeish told me...

440
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,565
What did he say, exactly?

441
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,262
He thought that
she was obsessed with him,

442
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,998
that her investigation had
somehow turned personal.

443
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,267
Did she come across that way to you?

444
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,502
No, sir, not at all.

445
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,371
Do you know where she is now?

446
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,740
Well, strangely, I haven't
heard from her since.

447
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Okay, thank you.

448
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:50,093
Kimble...

449
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,315
why does she want the blueprints
for the Capitol Building?

450
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,525
She requested them

451
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,588
as part of the investigation
into the bombing.

452
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,154
Right.

453
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,489
Of course, right.

454
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,992
Thank you.

455
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:03,782
Is everything all right, sir?

456
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,463
I'm not sure yet.

457
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:11,396
I'll let you know as soon as I can.

458
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,639
Then your detail will bring you back

459
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:19,806
to One Observatory Circle.

460
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:21,908
Home, sweet home.

461
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,503
I'm sorry for the interruption.

462
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:24,831
- Mr. President.
- Not at all.

463
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:27,009
We're just going through
some of the final details.

464
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,815
It's gonna be a great event, Peter.

465
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,317
Mike, can I borrow you
for a second, please?

466
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,452
Excuse me.

467
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:39,192
I need to speak with an FBI
agent named Hannah Wells.

468
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:41,662
- Сan you find her for me?
- Yes, sir.

469
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,864
Thank you.

470
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:02,467
Hannah Wells?

471
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:05,026
Why does the president want
to know about Hannah Wells?

472
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:06,361
He's interested in some information

473
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:08,363
she claims to have on Peter MacLeish.

474
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:11,024
Why? What kind of information
did she say she had?

475
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,391
She didn't.

476
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,002
That's, um...

477
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:15,403
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

478
00:22:15,405 --> 00:22:18,540
Do you know where I could find her?

479
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,974
I wish I did.

480
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:24,078
She totaled her car yesterday
at 15th and "K"

481
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,246
and fled the scene.

482
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:27,215
I've checked every local hospital,

483
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,083
even tried pinging her phone.

484
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:33,021
You're saying an FBI agent
just up and disappeared?

485
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:34,255
Yes.

486
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,990
I mean, who knows what kind of mess

487
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:37,892
Jason Atwood's got her mixed up in,

488
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:41,396
but you want to know
more about Agent Wells?

489
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:43,197
Here's her file.

490
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,400
See for yourself.

491
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,436
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

492
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:53,441
Hi. I'm Agent Wells.

493
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:56,110
I called earlier about looking
at your surveillance footage.

494
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:57,211
Yes, of course.

495
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:58,713
Uh, it's in the back.

496
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,048
Bob, can you take the register?

497
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,650
- No problem.
- Right this way.

498
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,453
- Thanks for doing this.
- Yeah.

499
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:08,056
Can you pull up some
footage from January 26th,

500
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:10,091
around 3:32 p.m.?

501
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:12,027
That's when the phone was initiated.

502
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,000
Stop.

503
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:23,304
Do you have any exterior cameras?

504
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:25,106
Yeah, in the parking lot.

505
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:27,075
Okay, I need you to pull that up.

506
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:32,447
Freeze.

507
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:33,549
And zoom in.

508
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,290
This is Chuck.

509
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,225
Hey, Chuck, I need you
to run a plate for me.

510
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:45,627
At the swearing-in,

511
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,549
the invocation will be delivered

512
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,497
by a Colonel William Sizemore.

513
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:51,299
He was the congressman's Army pastor,

514
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,501
and he'll be sworn in using
Beth MacLeish's Bible,

515
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:54,669
which is being brought in

516
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,304
from the family home in Oregon.

517
00:23:57,574 --> 00:23:58,406
Yeah, Lisa.

518
00:23:58,408 --> 00:23:59,641
Thank you.

519
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:01,109
I've just learned from a source

520
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:02,510
that a suspect is in custody

521
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,312
in connection with the
murder of Majid Nassar.

522
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:05,647
What is the White House's response

523
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:07,315
and... And when can we expect

524
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:08,683
to learn more about the suspect's identity.

525
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,518
Lisa, let me interrupt you right there,

526
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,286
as it would be inappropriate
for the White House to comment

527
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,321
on an ongoing investigation.

528
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:14,756
Now, that being said,

529
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,290
this is obviously a matter
of extreme importance...

530
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,659
How long
has the White House known?

531
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,293
When can we find out their name?

532
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,162
Are you worried about
the public's confidence

533
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:22,530
- in the president?
- What else is the White House hiding?

534
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:24,098
I would direct any
remaining questions you have

535
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,433
to the Army criminal investigators, okay?

536
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:27,168
That's all I have for right now, guys.

537
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,170
I'll see you at the Capitol
for the swearing-in.

538
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:31,005
You can't just walk away from this.

539
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,409
We deserve answers.
The public deserves answers!

540
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:36,644
Don't get many West Wingers here,

541
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:39,013
especially senior aides to POTUS.

542
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,215
It's a special assignment.

543
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,550
Now, all phone calls from the White House

544
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:44,152
- are catalogued, correct?
- Yes, ma'am,

545
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:45,553
every letter, call, correspondence...

546
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:47,321
All preserved for history.

547
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:48,690
Perfect.

548
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,224
I'm trying to find who,
from the White House,

549
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:52,193
contacted the Secretary of Defense

550
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:57,332
on June 23, 2015,
between 8:00 and 8:33 a.m.

551
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,453
Shouldn't be a problem.
Just give me a sec.

552
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:07,709
Here you go.

553
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:09,243
There was a call logged

554
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:11,345
to the Office of
the Secretary of Defense...

555
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:14,382
8:23 a.m., 23, June 2015.

556
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:16,118
Who made the call?

557
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,492
White House Chief of
Staff Charles Langdon.

558
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:24,425
Do we have an update on Agent Wells?

559
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:26,861
She was in a car accident
yesterday at 15th and "K."

560
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:29,430
And according to witnesses,
she abandoned the scene.

561
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,399
FBI hasn't been able to track her down.

562
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:32,667
Wait a second.

563
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:34,402
She was in a car accident on her way

564
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:37,171
to provide information
on Congressman MacLeish?

565
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:38,740
That's a bit of a coincidence.

566
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:40,971
Director Foerstel
gave me a look at her file.

567
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:43,077
Merits of accommodation aside,

568
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,413
Agent Wells has been going
through a difficult time.

569
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:46,848
According to Atwood's own notes,

570
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,741
he felt her judgment might
be compromised.

571
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:50,418
- Why?
- She was in a relationship

572
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,352
with someone that died at the Capitol,

573
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:53,354
Senator Scott Wheeler.

574
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:55,356
All I know is that she
went to Hookstraten

575
00:25:55,358 --> 00:25:57,225
looking for the blueprints
for the Capitol Building

576
00:25:57,227 --> 00:25:59,260
weeks before we knew about the file,

577
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:01,429
so she's either crazy,
like everybody says

578
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:02,597
or she knows something.

579
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,199
We got to keep looking for her.

580
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:06,568
Yes, sir.

581
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:47,769
FBI! Stop right there!

582
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,737
Turn around.

583
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,273
Turn around.

584
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,812
I know you.

585
00:27:57,814 --> 00:27:58,806
You're Charles Langdon.

586
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:00,514
You were Richmond's Chief of Staff.

587
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,773
- Everything thinks you're dead.
- You've got to get out of here.

588
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:03,753
They could have followed you.

589
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,417
You're the one calling me about MacLeish?

590
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:07,596
You don't know how hard it
is to stay hidden from them.

591
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,662
It was a woman's voice.

592
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:09,869
They're never gonna
stop searching for me.

593
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,392
Who's "they"? Who is behind this?

594
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:12,927
Why do they keep MacLeish alive?

595
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:14,762
It's... It's bigger than you think.

596
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:16,030
Don't trust anyone.

597
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,331
Get down!

598
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,446
Aah!

599
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:29,907
Aah!

600
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:35,462
Oh!

601
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,044
This is Russink.

602
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,178
Hey, Chuck.

603
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,680
I got a security key card here.

604
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,114
It's, uh, got a logo on it.

605
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,702
It's an "M" with a circle around it.

606
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:14,551
"M"? Um...

607
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,520
Could be Metway
Security out of Virginia...

608
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,689
Super high-end private
security and monitoring firm.

609
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,524
They offer me a job every year or two.

610
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,359
All right, I'm gonna give you
the serial number on the back.

611
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,560
Run it for me. See what this unlocks.

612
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,395
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah, shoot.

613
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,266
Zulu-Tango-3-2-6-7-Echo.

614
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,535
Hannah?

615
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,703
Hannah, you still there?

616
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,404
Call me when you got something.

617
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
All right, so this reporter, Lisa Jordan...

618
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,381
She knows we have someone in custody.

619
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,926
She just doesn't know that it's Atwood?

620
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,504
That's right. She knows
we've arrested someone.

621
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:49,352
- She just doesn't know who it is.
- Then, she has nothing.

622
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,854
She knows we're hiding something.

623
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:53,269
Mr. President, we agreed
not to tell the press anything

624
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:54,738
until we have all the facts.

625
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,927
Well, we have them now.

626
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,548
The FBI just handed in their report,

627
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:00,797
and it concludes that Jason Atwood

628
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,600
did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.

629
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,568
That's incredible.

630
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,038
I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on
as a White House correspondent

631
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,272
to keep us honest.

632
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:12,575
She kept up her end of the bargain.

633
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,910
We need to do the same.

634
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,578
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive

635
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,947
on the man that we have in custody,

636
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,949
but she's gonna have
to wait till tomorrow.

637
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,384
Yes, sir.

638
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,822
Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.

639
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,791
I know you didn't want it to be true.

640
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,827
None of us did.

641
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:34,300
Oh, sir, I was thinking if, uh...

642
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:36,410
if... if you're having second thoughts

643
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,968
on Bruce Rangell
for Secretary of Housing,

644
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,736
I could always pull up
more information on him

645
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,104
to look over.

646
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm not having second
thoughts on Rangell.

647
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:44,909
What would make you think that?

648
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,678
I-I'm sorry.

649
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,013
I-I must have been, um...

650
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,115
I must have been thinking
about something else.

651
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,985
The motorcade leaves for
the Capitol in 30 minutes.

652
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,987
- Thank you.
- Sir.

653
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,396
Ritter.

654
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:02,592
Agent Ritter, it's John Foerstel.

655
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,860
What can I do for you?

656
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,328
You asked me to keep the White House

657
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,596
in the loop on Hannah Wells.

658
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,498
I just got a disturbing phone call

659
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,633
out of Virginia.

660
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,055
Agent Wells shot someone?

661
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,971
Yes, sir, at a farm in Fredericksburg.

662
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,500
The FBI's still working
to identify the body,

663
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:18,858
but witnesses claim

664
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:20,643
they saw someone fitting
Agent Wells' description

665
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,846
engaged in a shootout
before fleeing the scene.

666
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,014
What the hell is going on?

667
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,383
The Feds are throwing a net over D.C.,

668
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,152
and their EOC is monitoring
every camera and feed

669
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,787
within a 30-mile radius.

670
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,522
I'll make sure our people

671
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,691
are on the lookout for her, as well.

672
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,660
- What... you think she's a threat?
- I don't know, sir.

673
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,796
But I can't logically explain her actions

674
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,612
over the past 24 hours.

675
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,168
We should consider that
both MacLeish and Foerstel

676
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,377
might be right about her.

677
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:49,736
And I'd rather we overreact and be wrong

678
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:52,062
than underestimate her
and live to regret it.

679
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:54,668
Okay, thanks, Mike.

680
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,257
Hey, Chuck.

681
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:06,890
Hannah, I've been monitoring
the police scanners...

682
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,826
Metro Police, the Bureau...
They're all looking for you.

683
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,260
I don't know how much
longer I can help you.

684
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:12,509
Look, I understand.

685
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,690
Were you able to find out
anything about the key card?

686
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:18,701
Yeah. It gives you access
to room 7 on the 8th floor

687
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,004
of the PLC Building on Louisiana.

688
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,090
Louisiana?

689
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:25,508
Chuck, room 7...
does it face east or west?

690
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,731
East. Why?

691
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:31,254
You can see the steps.

692
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,814
Hannah, what are you thinking?

693
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,584
Proximity to the Capitol,

694
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,587
direct line of sight to the platform.

695
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,190
Chuck, they're gonna kill Kirkman.

696
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,887
It'll be okay.

697
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,823
I just wish we had more time
to figure everything out

698
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,624
before we did something so permanent.

699
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,126
Tom, if you feel that way,

700
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,961
then we should not go through with this.

701
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:18,908
We don't have a choice.

702
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,831
The only evidence we
have is circumstantial.

703
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,599
We could be wrong.

704
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,735
The country can't afford another setback.

705
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:34,778
Peter.

706
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,049
Everyone's waiting. It's time to leave.

707
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,785
What's wrong?

708
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:44,021
We were supposed to be in
the car 10 minutes ago.

709
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,158
I don't know if I can go through with this.

710
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,222
- Honey, of course you can.
- No.

711
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,666
I think we need to rethink this thing.

712
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,169
It is perfectly normal to have cold feet,

713
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,938
but this is a great day for all of us.

714
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,041
It is exactly what
we've been working for.

715
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,210
Yeah.

716
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,615
But at what cost?

717
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,318
At any cost necessary.

718
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,556
Peter, you were chosen
to survive for a reason.

719
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,859
You've been given
a tremendous responsibility

720
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,961
to restore this nation

721
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:28,604
to the empire it once
was and can be again.

722
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,705
Our friends placed their faith in you.

723
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,059
What would they think if
they saw you like this?

724
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,585
You are on the cusp, Peter.

725
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,690
This isn't the time for weakness.

726
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,983
Now tell me you agree.

727
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,122
Tell me you agree, Peter.

728
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:56,860
Okay.

729
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,663
Good.

730
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,833
Now let's go.

731
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,749
Lisa.

732
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,951
Excuse me, Cody.

733
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,786
Hey.

734
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,888
I took your question to the president.

735
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,356
Let me guess... No comment.

736
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,758
If it was up to me,
honestly, yeah, no comment.

737
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,293
We've been way too reactive around here,

738
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,761
and that's gonna change,

739
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,029
but the president appreciates you,

740
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,264
and we've decided to grant you

741
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,266
the exclusive on the
Nassar investigation.

742
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:38,868
Really?

743
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,770
- When?
- Soon.

744
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,272
For now, let's let America celebrate.

745
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,273
I'll be in touch.

746
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,944
8th floor... all clear.

747
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,339
Clear.

748
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:53,144
- President Kirkman!
- Mr. Kirkman!

749
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,753
Ladies and gentlemen,

750
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,928
the President of the United States.

751
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,732
I wanted to take a moment
before we get started

752
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:51,167
and congratulate you on
becoming vice president.

753
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,236
Our country's got
a long road to recovery,

754
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,904
but this is another big step.

755
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,006
Thank you, sir. I won't let you down.

756
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,209
Great to see you.

757
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:00,777
Emily Rhodes.

758
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,012
Ms. Rhodes, it's Amanda
at the switchboard.

759
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,048
- Yes.
- You asked me to look deeper

760
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,419
into Charles Langdon's
phone records June 23.

761
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,287
Uh, as it turns out,

762
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,523
he wasn't in his office that day.

763
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,791
I'm sorry?

764
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,760
I double-checked his schedule.

765
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:20,430
Uh, Mr. Langdon was on an
overseas trip to Geneva.

766
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,358
Then who made the call to the Pentagon?

767
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:25,065
His deputy, Aaron Shore.

768
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,042
Thank you.

769
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,947
Mr. President, it's time.

770
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:48,192
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated.

771
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,231
Good afternoon.

772
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,100
When I see how many of you

773
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,902
have chosen to brave the elements

774
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,470
to mark this momentous occasion,

775
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:03,173
I can only tell you how inspired I am.

776
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,075
Today, I stand...

777
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,178
...on the site of one of
America's greatest tragedies

778
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,081
and offer the promise
of America's rebirth.

779
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,483
The night I was sworn in

780
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,151
as President of the United States,

781
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,020
this nation,

782
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,088
our nation,

783
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,990
was in the grips of chaos.

784
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:24,260
But now, as I look out on the Mall,

785
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,629
I don't see a people that were scared.

786
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,632
I don't see a people
that were frightened.

787
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,579
- Excuse me.
- I see that we are strong...

788
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:33,002
Excuse me.

789
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,271
...and that we are proud

790
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:38,007
and that we are, once again, united.

791
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,510
God bless all of you

792
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:43,279
and these United States of America.

793
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,049
Ladies and gentlemen,

794
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,117
it is my profound honor to introduce

795
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,029
Congressman Peter MacLeish,
our next vice president.

796
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:54,422
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

797
00:39:54,723 --> 00:39:56,189
Congressman MacLeish,

798
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:57,657
if you'll place your hand on the Bible

799
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:58,681
and repeat after me.

800
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,197
"I, Peter Lewis MacLeish..."

801
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,032
I, Peter Lewis MacLeish...

802
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,168
"...do solemnly swear
to support and defend

803
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,870
the Constitution of the United States..."

804
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:09,339
...do solemnly swear
to support and defend

805
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,074
the Constitution of the United States...

806
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,543
"...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic..."

807
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:16,212
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

808
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,882
Excuse me. Excuse me.

809
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,684
...that I bear true faith
and allegiance to the same...

810
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:24,354
Excuse me. Move!

811
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:28,091
...without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion."

812
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,260
...and that I take
this obligation freely,

813
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,196
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion,

814
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:34,998
and that I will well and faithfully
