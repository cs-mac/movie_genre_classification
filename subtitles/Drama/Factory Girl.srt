1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,400
My great, great, great...

2
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,680
great uncle was a signer
of the Declaration of Independence,

3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,040
and my mother's side started building
New York before the Revolution.

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,800
You get the idea.

5
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,120
I went to a party once and there was
a palm reader there.

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
When she looked at my hand,
she just--

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,520
she froze.

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,480
And I said to her,
"I know.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
My life line is broken.

10
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,880
I know I won't live
past 30."

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,880
You know those photos
of smiling families

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,000
you always see
on a mantelpiece?

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,920
I can't even look at them,

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,080
because you never know
what they're hiding.

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,120
A "Life Magazine" photographer
came to our house

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,600
to photograph
the "ideal American family."

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,240
We looked happy
and pretty,

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,760
but underneath

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,560
it just wasn't
that way at all.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,280
Looks like the country
is disintegrating.

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,200
Lost all its hope.

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,880
There's always hope no matter
what's happened before.

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,160
Yeah?

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
Where's the hope in that?

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,960
You know, when he first started painting
everybody thought he was mad.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,360
Can you imagine?

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
God, wouldn't it be wonderful
to know that students

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,320
were looking at your work,
analyzing it?

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,960
That depends on
what they're saying.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,760
I mean, people say
he's a no-talent freak.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,080
He's changing the way
that we look at the world, isn't he?

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,560
I think people
who manage to do that

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,200
must have the hardest
time in life.

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,480
Are you sure you'll be okay
in New York?

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll be fine. I've got Chuck
to look after me.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Oh, Syd, why won't
you come too?

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,080
My folks would kill me.

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,200
Where I come from,
it's not easy to get a scholarship.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,960
You know, I'm not so sure
about Chuck.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
He can be a real
shit sometimes.

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't worry.

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
Edie!

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,320
Chuckie, how can you want to go home?
We're in Manhattan.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,280
To become an artist,
I had to get out of that classroom.

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,520
And to me New York was Jackson
Pollock sipping vodka

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,480
and dripping paint
over a raw canvas.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,160
There's so much to see, Chuck.
Look where we are.

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,240
Yeah, taking
New York by storm.

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,920
Two zombies.

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,400
Chuck and I had come down
together from Cambridge.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
You know, he was
a flamboyant socialite

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,800
who carried a pocketful
of calling cards.

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,720
He made me feel
I wasn't alone.

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,800
- Can we play the game?
- I don't want to.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
- Come on.
- All right, go.

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
- Lamb.
- Chop.

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
- Pony.
- Snout.

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
- Shy.
- You.

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,040
- You think I'm shy?
- Sometimes.

60
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,520
I guess I can
be shy sometimes.

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,680
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

62
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,040
What are your sins, my son?

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,880
Well, I have this
friend Mark.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,960
Well, he buys all these clothes
from Bloomingdale's.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
But because he's from London,
everybody on the Cape

66
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
keeps talking about
his "fabulous English look,"

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,560
which really is so good.

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,960
He was at a party
up there last weekend

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,280
and Norman Mailer walked up
and punched him in the stomach.

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,200
When Mark asked him why,

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,440
he just said it was
"for wearing a pink coat."

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,720
I know I should have
been happy for Mark

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,360
that Norman Mailer
punched him,

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,200
but all I could think was,
"Will Norman Mailer ever punch me?"

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't even have
a pink coat.

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,640
Or get invited to those
glamorous kinds of parties.

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,280
Andy, why do you come
to confession?

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
Well, because
it's a sin not to.

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,000
Edie, come on now.

80
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
It's going to be over
by the time you're done.

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,320
You're not even
going to meet him.

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,960
We're going to be late.
Very late.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,400
I just don't understand. Why are
Jasper's selling and mine are not?

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
Andy, what do these people
know about art?

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
They know how to buy it.

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,520
I wonder if Picasso
knows who I am yet.

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
Who cares about
these people?

88
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,560
They're so '50s.
So boring.

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,640
Not very chic.

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
- Not very English.
- I love the English, don't you?

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,160
Mick Jagger is so sexy.

92
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,640
I hear he has
a really big cock.

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
What?

94
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,040
Andy, what are you doing
here all by yourself?

95
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Oh, I'm not by myself, Sam.
I'm here with Lex and Molly.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,560
Of course you are.
Sorry, ladies.

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
- May I steal him away?
- Of course.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,160
How's the movie business?

99
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh, well, it's busy,
but I wouldn't call it a business.

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,960
I haven't made
any money off of it yet.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,160
Of course you haven't, Andy.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,080
The movie business
is the most fickle in the world.

103
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
- You know that.
- Oh.

104
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,840
Listen, I have met
the most remarkable lady.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,240
- Oh.
- Old money-- very old.

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,760
Oh good, does she want
to buy a painting? Who is she?

107
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Oh, thank you.
Oh!

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
That's her.
That's Edie Sedgwick.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh.

110
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,480
What good manners. Chuckie,
pay attention to these gentlemen.

111
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,400
You just might
learn something.

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,840
Oh, wow.
She's so beautiful.

113
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,320
It's like a morgue in here. Please.

114
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
Her father struck
oil out west.

115
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,760
She escaped to art school
in Cambridge or somewhere.

116
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Made her way
down here last year.

117
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,280
She's done some modeling.

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,920
Tried to get
into a gallery,

119
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,360
but no one has ever seen
anything she's done.

120
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,080
When you said "old money,"
you made her sound 50.

121
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,200
- Is that the Andy Warhol?
- Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,120
- Want to meet him?
- Of course.

123
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,920
Edie, this is Andy.

124
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
Hi.

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,880
Oh, it's just amazing
to meet you.

126
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,320
- I think you're just a genius.
- Oh.

127
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,840
No one is doing anything
like you right now

128
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,480
and that in itself is a sign
of brilliance, don't you think?

129
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,480
I'll leave you two alone.

130
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,920
Well there's four olives.

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Is that really bad?

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,160
Well, not if you eat them because
I just couldn't bear the thought.

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Oh, well, I don't
really like olives.

134
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
But I'd love you to be
in one of my movies.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,760
I would love for you to eat my olives.

136
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,200
Oh!

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,080
And what would I have to do
in one of your movies?

138
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,160
Just be yourself.

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,520
Well which one?

140
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
Well, you talk to Chuckie 'cause he
handles all the little details.

141
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,920
You're the boss,
applesauce.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,400
What did I tell you?
Is she a star or what?

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,600
I would sure love
to work with her.

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,960
I've never seen a girl
with so many problems.

145
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,200
Andy, in your films,
what are you hoping to do?

146
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,400
We're just trying
to make it so bad,

147
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,240
but doing it well.

148
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,520
You know, where you get the most
scratches you can on a film.

149
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,200
Or all the dirt
you can get on a film.

150
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
Or zooming badly,

151
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,200
where you zoom and you
hit the most important--

152
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,920
miss the most
important thing.

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,520
And, uh...

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,560
your camera jiggles

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,720
so that everybody knows
you're watching a film.

156
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,680
How do you work
with your actors then?

157
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
What do you tell them?

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Well, I don't like
to tell them what to do.

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,920
I mean, I just think
people are so interesting.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Some say your work
is pornographic.

161
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,960
Oh, yeah.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,280
Isn't that great?

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
So...

164
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,800
do you work in hay?

165
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,560
Oh yeah,
we're making a cowboy movie.

166
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,600
Who are all these people?

167
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
- That's Rotten Rita.
- Now turn for me.

169
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,480
And Silver George,
Debbie Dropout,

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,480
the Turtle.

171
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,120
I don't know who that is.

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,000
Who's that?

173
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,960
This is Ondine and Brigid.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
- This is Chuck and Edie.
- Hello.

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,720
Andy, I got a new book
to draw in.

176
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,240
It said on the front,
"The Topical Bible."

177
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,160
I didn't know what the theme
should be, so I thought,

178
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,600
"What rhymes with topical?"
And then I started rhyming.

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,760
Topical, bopical...
and then I got to "C."

180
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,480
Cockical. I mean, it's perfect, right?
An entire book about cocks.

181
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,400
Yeah, that's great.

182
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,880
Her last book
was called "Scars,"

183
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,280
but "Cocks" has a nicer ring to it,
don't you think?

184
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,480
- Hmm.
- Like a cock ring.

185
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,360
- I wish my phone had a cock ring.
- Yeah.

186
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,520
Uh, so who's gonna be in your book?
Anyone famous?

187
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,520
Ooh, maybe we can get
the President's.

188
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,160
Oh yeah,
Johnson's johnson.

189
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
Brigid, you got to
call your father.

190
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,640
Are you insane, Andy? You know what
my father would say to me?

191
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
- Maybe he'd want to be in the book.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,440
Brigid's father has an empire.
He's very rich.

193
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,240
Oh, you should do your cock
for the book too.

194
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,000
This one is mine
right here.

195
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
Brig, what if
the cops come here?

196
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,600
Where's the sign?
Who took the sign down?

197
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,040
Hey, Andy,
we're ready.

198
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,360
Oh, we're gonna do the movie.
You want to see?

199
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,560
I can give him a tranquilizer.

200
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,080
Tranquilizer?
I'll take one of those, Mary.

201
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,080
Will you put
the microphone in lower

202
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,280
so we can see it?
Yeah, neat.

203
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,840
- Have you used one before?
- No.

204
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,000
It's easy.
Why don't you turn it on?

205
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,960
Andy Warhol's "Horse."

207
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,600
Which one of you
has a gun?

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,080
Which one of you has a gun?

209
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Look at the size of it.

210
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,400
Ooh, look at that gun.

211
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
- I want to ride it on the prairie.
- I bet you do.

212
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,080
- You've seen bigger, yeah?
- No, of course not.

213
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,400
- Except once or twice.
- Hello?

214
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,360
We're doing a movie.

215
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,360
- Easy, horsie.
- Whoa.

216
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
- Whoa, easy there, boy.
- Oh my.

217
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,040
All right.

218
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, shit!

219
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,200
Shh.

220
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,120
Shh.

221
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,080
What do you think of The Factory?

222
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,400
Do you like it here?

223
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
Of course.

224
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,080
I think it's always good to get beyond
your experiences, you know?

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,840
And I hate it when people take
themselves too seriously.

226
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
- Don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

227
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,320
I read somewhere

228
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,520
that you were born in California.
Is that true?

229
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,400
Yes, but we were
from back East originally.

230
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,640
Well, Fuzzy got sick.

231
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,080
And so he wanted
to move to a warmer climate,

232
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,720
and he bought a ranch
in Santa Barbara, California.

233
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
And that's
where I was born.

234
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,360
Who's Fuzzy?

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,520
- Oh, Fuzzy's my father.
- Oh.

236
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,480
My father.
Mm-hmm.

237
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,560
And is Chuck
your best friend?

238
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,560
He's my best girlfriend.

239
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,480
Who's your best boyfriend?

240
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,920
Oh, that's easy.
That would--

241
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,840
actually,
it's not that easy.

242
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,480
I would have to say
my brother Minty.

243
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, well, you should
bring him over.

244
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I can't.
I wish I could.

245
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,640
He's dead.

246
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,960
Who is the first boy
you made it with?

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,560
The first boy I made it with
was at Silver Hill.

248
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,880
- The hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,600
Oh, I hear it's very chic.

250
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,000
Didn't Cornelia Vanderbilt
go there?

251
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,720
All I had to do was walk in

252
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,040
on Fuzzy fucking
our neighbor.

253
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,920
And then when
I told my mother,

254
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,400
well, Fuzzy said
that I was imagining it.

255
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,120
There has to be
another way.

256
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,320
But even after all the pills
that he pumped me up with,

257
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,120
I knew what I saw.

258
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
And so he sent me off
to Silver Hill

259
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,400
just like he did with my brothers
Minty and Bobby.

260
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,120
It was sort of
the Sedgwick way.

261
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,120
Who was the first boy you ever kissed?

262
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,840
Fuzzy.

263
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,040
Silver Hill.

264
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't take it anymore.

265
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,960
I want to die.

266
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,040
Why do you want to die?

267
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,640
Because my credit's
no good at Bonwit Teller.

268
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,240
Because I just stole
$30 worth of underwear from Bergdorf's,

269
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
and I think I might
do it again.

270
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
Is that you, Edie?

271
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,760
I thought you might
be lonely on the watch.

272
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,840
Don't lie to Wanda.

273
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,160
- I've known you for too long.
- But really, Wanda,

274
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,040
everything is just super.

275
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,360
I met the most
fantastic people.

276
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,120
I went to this gallery.

277
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,560
You know, Roy Lichtenstein
and Jasper Johns

278
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,640
and Andy Warhol.
I may get a show there.

279
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,880
Somebody asked me
to be in a movie, Wand.

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,040
Wouldn't you love
to be in a movie?

281
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,400
Are you still seeing a doctor?

282
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,760
In today's news,

283
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,600
rioting continued
in Alabama

284
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,600
as civil rights demonstrators converged
on the courthouse steps

285
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,360
in downtown Selma.

286
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Who could grant any wish.

287
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,720
Andy was a little boy

288
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,360
who needed
to be taken care of.

289
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,280
I mean, his mother
moved in with him when he was 22.

290
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,000
As a child, he had this horrible
nervous condition.

291
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,760
- It made him feel like an outsider.
- Thanks, Mama.

292
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,960
I like your Sunday
personality better.

293
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
Hello?

294
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,400
- Hello?
- Hello.

295
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,400
Hello.
How are you, dear?

296
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,360
Well, Andy, I'm just about ready
to flip my lid.

297
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,040
Henry Winthorpe III
just left The Factory.

298
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,560
Oh, the toothpaste heir?
How were his teeth?

299
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,960
Oh, I didn't notice,
but his cock was beautiful.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,240
- Was it big?
- Listen.

301
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,560
- Did he know you were taping him?
- He insisted.

302
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,920
Andy, I'm getting
such good tapes.

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,600
I don't care if she is wearing
a wig. It's a movie about boys.

304
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,320
- It's supposed to be an all-male cast.
- But Edie looks like a boy.

305
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
- Like a beautiful boy.
- And I think she's fantastic.

306
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,640
But she shouldn't be in this.
It throws off the whole concept.

307
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,280
It's supposed to be about thugs
and J.D.s and hooligans.

308
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,360
Oh, I know.
I know.

309
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Is she gonna
say anything,

310
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,120
or is she just gonna sit
there like a mannequin?

311
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
I just don't think
she's cut out for this.

312
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, Gerard, maybe Edie doesn't think
you're cut out for it either.

313
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,400
"Vinyl," a film by Andy Warhol

314
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,880
starring Gerard Malanga.

315
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm a troublemaker. A hooligan.

316
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,040
A real motherfucker.

317
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,000
So if you got a problem,

318
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,400
I can stick it where I can put it
whether you want it or not.

319
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,320
Why is he doing that?

320
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,840
Why doesn't he stop?

321
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,640
In The Factory you were accepted

322
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,560
and encouraged

323
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
and even expected
to be different.

324
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,600
Andy made me
feel comfortable,

325
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600
and I believe that
he felt comfortable with me.

326
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,480
No, I'm serious. Let's say you're
on a TV show like "Steve Allen"

327
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
and he says, "So, Edie, any plans
for getting married?"

328
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,200
Okay, fine.

329
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
But I could only marry four--
maybe three people.

330
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,720
Who?

331
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,560
The future Earl of Litchfield,
but he'll have to be the last, I think.

332
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,240
- Oh.
- And Mick Jagger.

333
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, yeah.
I hear he has a really big cock.

334
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,840
- And then who?
- Nureyev.

335
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,840
But I don't think
he likes women.

336
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
Are you allowed
to say that on television?

337
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,120
Oh, Andy, we couldn't say
anything on television.

338
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,680
They'd have to tape
our mouths shut.

339
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,880
It's so much more fun
in New York

340
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,000
since you showed up.

341
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,320
Those were really
the happiest days of my life.

342
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,040
When we were experiencing life
on our own terms.

343
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,200
What better way
to say goodbye

344
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,320
to Edith Minturn Sedgwick,
the Mayflower girl.

345
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,040
Andy, what do you think
of Edie's new look?

346
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,240
It'll be great.
I can't wait to see it.

347
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,680
Andy took ordinary
objects and made them iconic.

348
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,280
I always thought that he was throwing
America back in its face--

349
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
you know, turning the assembly
line into a punchline.

350
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,880
Hello?

351
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,280
Andy.

352
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
When are you going
to show me your drawings?

353
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,240
You've showed them
to Gerard and Brigid.

354
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,240
I want them
to be the right ones.

355
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,840
Well just put anything together.
We'll make a show.

356
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,960
Ileana Sonnabend is coming to New York
next month. I'll introduce you.

357
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
Really?

358
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,840
I will.
This weekend I'll--

359
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Oh no, not this weekend. We're supposed
to go to Fire Island, remember?

360
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,360
Well when am I supposed
to get it done?

361
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,280
It'll happen.
I wouldn't worry about it.

362
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,080
That's easy for you to say.
You have nothing to worry about.

363
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
Oh, that's not true.

364
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,040
The Sculls cancelled
a whole order of Brillo boxes.

365
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,680
Andy, I know plenty
of people in New York

366
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,840
who are looking
to buy great art.

367
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,280
Edie, I just think
it will clash terribly

368
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,840
with the Biedermeier chairs.

369
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,960
Well you can just say
whatever color you want.

370
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,360
I just picked up a new blue from Pearl
that's fantastic.

371
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,160
Well, Mrs. Shingle,
just so you know,

372
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,080
my mother had one
done last month,

373
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,560
and she was so happy with it
she ordered three more.

374
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,080
Wow, your mother always
did have excellent taste.

375
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,960
Taupe I think
would work best.

376
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,960
I wonder if people
are gonna remember us.

377
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,640
What, when we're dead?

378
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,640
Yeah.

379
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,360
I think people will talk about how
you changed the world.

380
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,560
I wonder what
they'll say about you

381
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,720
in your obituary.
I like that word.

382
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,200
Nothing nice, I don't think.

383
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
Come on.
It would say...

384
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,960
"Edith Minturn Sedgwick,

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,880
beautiful artist
and actress..."

386
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,800
"And all-around loon."

387
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,200
"Remembered for setting
the world on fire..."

388
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,000
"And escaping the clutches
of her terrifying family."

389
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,200
"Made friends with everybody
and anybody..."

390
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,640
"By creating chaos and uproar
wherever she went.

391
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Divorced as many times
as she married,

392
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,160
she leaves only
good wishes behind."

393
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,240
That's nice, isn't it?

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,800
Well, I hope
I die first,

395
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,920
because I would be too sad
if you died before me.

396
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,520
Tell me other places
you lived after that.

397
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,320
I lived in Paris
when I studied art.

398
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,120
The French, they're
just so good looking.

399
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,960
Andy, we should go.

400
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,160
Actually, when I say it it makes sense
for you to be there right now.

401
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,600
But I didn't think
they liked new art anymore.

402
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,240
You just take some of the flower
paintings and the movies,

403
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,840
and they'd appreciate
you so much more than they do here.

404
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,320
You know, here people don't really know
why you do what you do.

405
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,000
But in Paris,
they don't care.

406
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,800
So you're free to express it
however you want.

407
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,600
Well, they only care
that you know why.

408
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Oh, well I just do it
because I'm ugly

409
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,280
and there's nothing
else for me to do.

410
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,560
You're not ugly, Andy.

411
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,480
Well, I do have my good days.

412
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
Three shrimp cocktails,

413
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,400
extra lemon,
extra cocktail.

414
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
And then I'll have
the salmon grilled. Is it fresh?

415
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,080
- Oh yes, ma'am.
- No butter, but extra parsley.

416
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,080
- Ooh, and lots of Russian dressing.
- $200?

417
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,400
And you?

418
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
Oh, I'll just have
a peanut butter sandwich.

419
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,040
I'll see what I can do.

420
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,120
- Put everybody on my tab.
- Yes, ma'am.

421
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,920
I don't understand.
These are all your bills?

422
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,680
I know, they're huge.
You might have to start paying me.

423
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,240
Either that or I'll have to move into
a one-bedroom or a studio.

424
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,760
Oh God, where would
I keep all my clothes in a studio, Andy?

425
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,000
- What should I do?
- Oh, nothing.

426
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,120
I just think what you're doing right now
is so glamorous.

427
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

428
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,520
Darling, where did you get that blouse?
It's simply divine.

429
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,200
- It's Donald Brooks.
- Hmm.

430
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,680
Here, try it on.
We're about the same size.

431
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,800
There I was in the midst of hara-kiri

432
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
when it hit me--

433
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
24 hours in the life
of Edie.

434
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,560
One day.
One movie.

435
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,160
You are so much fun. How come you don't
spend more time with us?

436
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,040
- Because of my lips.
- Your lips?

437
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,520
They have a hard time
kissing Andy Warhol's ass.

438
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,680
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

439
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,360
- Yeah.
- Right?

440
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,120
How well do you and Edie
speak French?

441
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,400
So, Andy wants to take us
to Paris with him.

442
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,720
Oh, fabulous.
Let me settle the check.

443
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
Waiter!
Everybody, we're leaving.

444
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,520
Darling, we're leaving now.
Would you charge it to my account?

445
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,360
If you can wait here for just a minute.

446
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,480
A minute?
Why that's a complete lifetime.

447
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,960
I mean, there are things
that are born, live and die in a minute.

448
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,880
Don't ask me what, dear,
because I couldn't tell you.

449
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
But I have to go to Paris.

450
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
You just tell Mr. What's-his-name
to send me the bill.

451
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
- Oh, how's my hair?
- Stunning, madame.

452
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,760
Well, I don't know.
I guess I'm bored with it.

453
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,440
So I'm just going to
quit painting

454
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
and we're going to
make movies now.

455
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,760
Make Edie a big star.

456
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,720
Well, I'm not going.

457
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
I have nothing to wear.

458
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
Why don't you just
try on some clothes?

459
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,320
I don't feel like trying on--
Why do I have to try on clothes?

460
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,400
You have a whole closetful.

461
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
Do I look different?

462
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,800
I ran into an old friend
who said every time I saw him

463
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,000
I looked so different
he hardly knew who I was.

464
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,720
Well, do you think
that's true?

465
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,600
Huh?

466
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,000
Edie Sedgwick

467
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,120
in Andy Warhol's
"Poor Little Rich Girl."

468
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,760
Bravo!

469
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Oh, that's so nice.

470
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,800
I just love that
he doesn't speak any English.

471
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,920
Aru, I want
to touch your cock.

472
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,280
- Oui, Andy. Oui.
- Oui. Isn't he great?

473
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,560
I can't tell what he's saying, but he
keeps talking about Edie.

474
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,960
Just take your pants down.

475
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
Andy, critics may love you in France,

476
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,200
but here they say
your work is superficial

477
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,880
and that you wouldn't be
where you are without Edie.

478
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,600
I don't pay attention
to what they write.

479
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,440
I just measure it in inches.

480
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,080
Edie, I understand
you're an artist too.

481
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,040
That was a very long time ago.

482
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Edie's too beautiful
to be an artist.

483
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,160
I think artists should be ugly.

484
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,960
No, Edie's a superstar.

485
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,280
Superstar.

486
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,360
That's crazy.

487
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,920
There's one more thing
on the sidewalk.

488
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,160
Look at that.

489
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,520
Oh, that's what he said.

490
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,040
I got it.

491
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,680
It's like a madhouse in here.
Andy, this is my mother, Alice!

492
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,560
She just flew into town
to help me furnish.

493
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,320
Oh, hi.
You're so beautiful.

494
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,920
It's so nice to meet you.

495
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,760
No no!
Put it over there.

496
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
Careful with that box, love.
It's Waterford.

497
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,640
Betsy Johnson--
I know, isn't she fabulous?

498
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,400
She asked me
to be her first model.

499
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,480
Anyway, I've got to go.
Ciao.

500
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,040
- I'm a mad hatter.
- Oh, he's here.

501
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,640
Oh, you made it.
Isn't he beautiful?

502
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,760
His name is Wallow
and I got him at Abercrombie's.

503
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,240
Hello. Did you have
a nice trip over?

504
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,760
Oh, Mum-mum
aren't you proud

505
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,320
Pretty soon money will
be falling off trees.

506
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,600
- I won't need any help at all.
- There's a novel idea.

507
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,640
But, Mom, don't you think that Fuzzy
would get a kick out of all of this?

508
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,720
Oh, please. Your father's so square
he doesn't pee in the shower.

509
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,120
Mum-mum!

510
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,280
Hello?

511
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,680
I think your daughter
is going to be super famous.

512
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,320
And what would
be the value in that, Mr. Warhol?

513
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,040
Oh, well, I think everybody
wants to be famous.

514
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,480
Well, I had much
higher hopes for Edith.

515
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,760
Oh.

516
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,280
You know,
I used to dance twice a day.

517
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,640
I'd do this jazz ballet.

518
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,240
And I'd wear leotards
and black tights

519
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,400
and I was too lazy
to take them off.

520
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,120
And I decided
to go with it.

521
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,760
Divine one,

522
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,200
I am entirely superficial
and I intend to stay that way.

523
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,160
But you, my dear,
you are the real thing.

524
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,240
America's next "It" girl.

525
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,800
We'll put you
under contract.

526
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,480
People started to notice
and it sort of caught on.

527
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,560
You know, the earrings,
the thick black eyelashes--

528
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
it was all
a part of the show.

529
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,720
This is Andrea Romando
with the BBC.

530
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,360
I'm here with Edie Sedgwick
at the infamous Factory.

531
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,880
She is known
as Andy Warhol's superstar.

532
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,240
And in New York, she has been dubbed
Queen of Underground Cinema.

533
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,760
Edie, how does your family feel about
you having this title?

534
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,760
They hate it.

535
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,440
They hated the idea
of my doing any modeling

536
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,200
to make my own way.

537
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
As soon as I started all of this,
they're sending telegrams

538
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,680
saying, "Oh, you've got to go
model, please."

539
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,440
At an Andy Warhol art exhibition...

540
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
The glamorous Miss Edie
Sedgwick unraveled her long white...

541
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,560
The Plymouth Rock
princess and her commoner companion...

542
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,960
...in town last night,
at Max's Kansas City...

543
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,920
...Hollywood legends...

544
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,000
...the former window
dresser and commercial artist...

545
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,000
...the first girl to bring sex appeal

546
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,280
to American high society.

547
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll have a porterhouse,
she'll do the sirloin.

548
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,960
Actually, I think I'll
try the chicken tonight.

549
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,920
Coq au vin, please.

550
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,200
- Miss Sedgwick?
- Why don't you have the grilled fish?

551
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,080
No butter. We don't want you blowing up
now, do we, honey?

552
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,160
You game
for a steak, Warhol?

553
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,560
You sure look like
you could use one.

554
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,920
The Met is thinking
of buying some of Andy's work.

555
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,720
- Oh, lovely.
- How about this?

556
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,040
I've just been commissioned
for a 30-foot bronze stallion

557
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,000
in downtown Santa Barbara.

558
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,840
Oh, Edie does horses too.

559
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,120
Well, where do you think
she learned that?

560
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,600
Has Edie told you
about my studio?

561
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,080
Yeah.

562
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,480
I've seen some
of your work, Warhol.

563
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,280
You're really more
of a printmaker than an artist.

564
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,840
What's your family do?

565
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,640
Well, my father
was in a coal mine.

566
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
Andy and I are thinking about making
some more movies together.

567
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,840
If you can call them that.

568
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,800
You can call them whatever you want.

569
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,280
- Like Dorothy, or...
- Ondine.

570
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,240
Hillary.

571
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,480
This whole time
I'm thinking,

572
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,280
"Who is this guy who has my little girl
all turned around?

573
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,280
He must be
some kind of a man."

574
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,960
Then I talk to you
for two minutes,

575
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,920
and I have to smile, because I don't
have a thing to worry about, do I?

576
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,000
You're a full-blown queer.

577
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,400
Andy, we can go now.

578
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,880
Edith...

579
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,200
don't you dare
make a scene.

580
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Minty had been...

581
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,880
I guess an embarrassment
to the family

582
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,160
because he was different.
He was...

583
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,440
he was a homosexual.

584
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,480
And Fuzzy knew it.

585
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,200
And when Minty came clean,
Fuzzy called him a faggot.

586
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,080
You know, he just--

587
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,560
he broke him.

588
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,880
And when they closed the casket lid
on my brother Minty...

589
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,760
I remember Fuzzy
just standing there.

590
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,000
No reaction, just...

591
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,520
standing there...

592
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,720
like a stone.

593
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,640
For days the whole family
just sat around the ranch

594
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,560
as though nothing
had happened.

595
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,200
And at his funeral,
no one cried.

596
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,920
No one.

597
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,840
Not even my brother
Jonathan.

598
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,160
And I ran at him and I pounded
my fists on his chest...

599
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,400
and he didn't cry.

600
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,480
I--

601
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,040
I had to cry
for all of them.

602
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,760
Oh, you made it.
That's great. Oh, hi.

603
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,880
Look who's here,
everybody. Hi.

604
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,680
Hey, Mick, how are you?

605
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,960
Oh, it's great to have you here.
I love the album.

606
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,360
- Jesus, Richie.
- The tissue's hardened, Brig.

607
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,480
You got to really push.

608
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
Hey, Brig. What are
you girls up to?

609
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,080
Cocktails, darling.

610
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,160
Adderall, Digoxin
and Dextromethamphetamine.

611
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Has certainly more kick
than a martini, no?

612
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,240
You go to med school, Brig?

613
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,480
My parents have had me
doped up on diet pills since I was 10.

614
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,360
Well, my parents plopped me in the bins
before I could drive.

615
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,200
You're an Aquarius,
aren't you?

616
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,600
No, I'm an Aries.

617
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,320
I know an Aquarius
when I see one.

618
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,680
I just adore Aquariuses.

619
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,440
You thirsty for a poke?
It's divine.

620
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,800
Ooh.

621
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
Mark.

622
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
Edie, why don't you
tell us a story?

623
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,920
Oh, tell us about
Arthur Bainbridge.

624
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,160
Charles, I do not want
to tell that story.

625
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,320
- It's so sad.
- Oh, I've read about him.

626
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,760
His mother's family
made a fortune out of real estate.

627
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,200
That's him.

628
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,400
Well, we went out
a few times.

629
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Nothing chic,
but all very fun.

630
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,560
Well, one night we were all set for this
date at Tavern on the Green,

631
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,960
only Chuck and I got into this
very deep and long conversation

632
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
about the Tarot and I Ching

633
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,520
and all this completely
fascinating stuff.

634
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,680
And Arthur shows up
and he's just so possessive.

635
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,640
And I didn't want to hurt
his feelings,

636
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,120
I knew he'd be furious
if he knew Chuck was there

637
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,720
so I had him
hide in the closet.

638
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,440
And Arthur got down on one knee
just like in the movies

639
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,600
and asked me to marry him.

640
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,680
He'd bought this ring
from Tiffany's.

641
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,960
And he kept going on about
children and Connecticut.

642
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,720
- I mean, could you imagine?
- Could you?

643
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,800
No.
No.

644
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,520
But he was in tears.

645
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,800
A boy who has everything
in the world

646
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,120
was just reduced
to absolutely nothing.

647
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,240
And then...

648
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
and then Chuck
jumped out of my closet

649
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,520
laughing hysterically.

650
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,600
Arthur was just mortified.

651
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,560
Oh, he was boring.

652
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,600
Yes, but he was sweet.

653
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,520
I mean, Chuck-- Chuck, you really are
completely ruthless.

654
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,520
I'll get you right.

655
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,160
Hey, Rich, did you see
my mother's face when she met Andy?

656
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,760
I thought
she was gonna burst.

657
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,520
I know, my mother's
horrified.

658
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,640
Brig keeps threatening to invite
him to Christmas dinner

659
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,520
if she doesn't
up our allowances.

660
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
Well, no wonder you never
run out of money.

661
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,800
Edie.

662
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,040
Syd! What are you
doing here?

663
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,800
- I've been sent to find you.
- Oh, that sounds mysterious.

664
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,280
- Who sent you, the Red Chinese?
- No, but...

665
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,040
I am working
for someone pretty big.

666
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,760
- Rockefeller?
- Bigger.

667
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,920
Bigger than Rockefeller
and the Red Chinese?

668
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,480
Well, pray tell, who?

669
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,120
Why don't you come with me
and I'll show you.

670
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,000
Who's that?

671
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,120
- Taxi!
- Oh, darling, I landed straight down

672
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,440
on my
Margaret Jarrold pumps.

673
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,440
Thank God
I didn't break an ankle.

674
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,880
- You know, when I came to New York--
- Second Avenue and Fifth, please.

675
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,200
Oh, it's windows, dear, windows.

676
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,160
Andy realized that I wasn't
an artist, but who was I, a model?

677
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,240
That didn't seem
to fit either.

678
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,840
That'll be 85,
please.

679
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,520
- Shit, I don't have any cash.
- You've got to be kidding me.

680
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,880
- I never carry any either.
- What?

681
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,760
- Here, take this.
- What's that?

682
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,160
That is a beautiful
ring just for you.

683
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Are you coming?

684
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,400
You're still sculpting,
I hope.

685
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,800
That was just my great escape.
Do you remember that time

686
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,040
when we went to that restaurant--
oh, what was it called?

687
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Durgin Park in Faneuil Hall.

688
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,840
And all the waiters were so crusty,
and-- oh!

689
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,240
Watch it.
Watch it! Jesus.

690
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,000
And then I was dancing on the tables,
do you remember?

691
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,800
And I think that they thought
that I stole something,

692
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,520
when really I only
meant to borrow it.

693
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,120
Oh no, it wasn't you!

694
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

695
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,680
It was Don-Don.
And Chuckie was there.

696
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,720
- Edie.
- I nearly died laughing.

697
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,200
Edie, I have somebody
that I want you to meet.

698
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,600
This is Edie Sedgwick.

699
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,680
Edie, how about a picture?

700
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,640
Well, hello.

701
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,360
Why don't you put
your arm around her?

702
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,720
Hey, how about one shot?
One shot, Miss Sedgwick?

703
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,240
I got to go to work,
sweetheart.

704
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
Well, I wasn't interested
in him because he was famous.

705
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,160
It wasn't as if he was
the first famous person I'd ever met.

706
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,640
But he was so different.

707
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,960
We caught a couple of your films
last week at the Cinemateque.

708
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,440
You did?
And?

709
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,480
And, uh...
they were good.

710
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,600
No no, they were good.

711
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,920
We just-- well, we didn't really
understand they were--

712
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,600
I don't know,
what they meant.

713
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,880
I don't know if they're
supposed to mean--

714
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,840
I-- it's
just sort of like,

715
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,760
I don't know, watching
a Henry Moore sculpture

716
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,120
but a little bit
out of focus, you know?

717
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Pretty pretentious.

718
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,840
I don't know if it clears it up for us.

719
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,280
Sounds very pretentious.

720
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,040
- That clear it up for us.
- Could-- could--

721
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,040
could I get a little milk
for my coffee?

722
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,960
What about you?

723
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,160
Your songs are pretty--
pretty profound.

724
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,800
What are you trying to say?

725
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I'm not-- I'm not trying
to say anything.

726
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,520
I just write them.

727
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,720
I don't know, I guess I write
about what I see.

728
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,320
That's really good.

729
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,680
It's a doodle.
It's not--

730
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,600
No no no, that's--

731
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,880
that's a good drawing.

732
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,680
Wow.

733
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,720
So you're an artist.

734
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,560
Oh no, not really
anymore.

735
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,560
What? You're not drawing anymore?
Why?

736
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,720
It's just it's hard to find the time
to sit down and be alone.

737
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,960
I just find it hard
to sit still.

738
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,960
Seriously...

739
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
you got to, you know,
you got to find the time to do this.

740
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,000
The music was just hypnotic.

741
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,600
- I just think he's so maximal.
- Isn't he?

742
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,240
And he just has that power.
You know people who have that power.

743
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,360
- Like Superman?
- You can't really explain why it is.

744
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
It just is.

745
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,200
Well, what do you say to someone
like that? I mean, he's just so famous.

746
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,280
- We didn't really talk, you know.
- Oh, you didn't?

747
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,040
It was just nice to meet him.
Andy, what do you think of this?

748
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,960
Tres chic or tres fou?

749
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,920
Oh, tres chic,
definitely.

750
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,040
Well, I have to watch my spending.
Especially on clothes.

751
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,680
You know, I already
stopped wearing underwear.

752
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,000
Shit, what other sacrifices
do I have to make?

753
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,080
Who do you think you are?

754
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,880
Your family is so rich.

755
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,560
I mean, you're living
on Easy Street.

756
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,400
Oh!

757
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,200
Oh, Mama would love this.

758
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,600
I can buy it for you.

759
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,560
Oh no, you need
to watch your spending.

760
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,720
So, tell me more things.
Who else was he there with?

761
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,800
I don't really remember that,
you know?

762
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,400
But it was just something
about those lyrics.

763
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,840
What he was saying
was really poignant.

764
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,480
Like he really
had something to say.

765
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,120
What?

766
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,880
I was just saying
that he really had something to say.

767
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,760
- How much is this?
- Seven.

768
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,560
- $7?
- $7.

769
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,840
Oh no, that's too much.

770
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,760
Well, I could
give you $4.

771
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,200
What do you think?

772
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,720
I think you look beautiful.

773
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,480
Oh, I don't know
if he--

774
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,840
this, uh--

775
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,600
What's wrong?
Is this about that Syd character?

776
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,080
Have you ever analyzed
things to the degree

777
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,560
where you can't really
remember the difference

778
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,200
between what's real and what
you've created in your head?

779
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,360
I know that I'm real.

780
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,120
And I know that you're real.

781
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,440
And I know that's real.

782
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
I don't know.
I just wish life could be more simple,

783
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,720
you know,
sometimes.

784
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,000
James, dear, what are you
doing here so early?

785
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,880
- I...
- Sit down.

786
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,200
We had an appointment at my office
at noon, Miss Sedgwick. It's 2:30.

787
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,000
You've known me since
I was three, James. Call me Edie.

788
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,000
Your...

789
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,880
spending, Miss Sedgwick.

790
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,800
You're going to be
bankrupt soon.

791
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,080
James, you take life
too seriously.

792
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,960
How could I possibly
be bankrupt?

793
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,760
My grandfather
invented the elevator.

794
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,000
Then you should be familiar
with the concept of up and down.

795
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,320
When you got here,
your trust fund--

796
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,600
thank you.

797
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,280
Your trust fund was up.

798
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,240
After a year and a half,
it's almost in the basement.

799
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,680
- Oh shit.
- What, what, what?

800
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
Well, what about all
the money that I'm making?

801
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,880
Well,
you keep spending it.

802
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,640
Your father
is very upset with you

803
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,960
cavorting with drug addicts

804
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,720
and fringe elements.

805
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,640
You tell Fuzzy for me that those are
some very talented people.

806
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,840
If you don't
change your friends,

807
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,000
you'll get nothing from him.

808
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,760
Rich, will you make sure
the oven's off?

809
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,680
I'm sorry, I have to go.

810
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,040
Oh, looks like Cupid's
been busy as a bull dyke.

811
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,960
You look beautiful, honey.

812
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,440
Hello.

813
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,080
What are you doing?

814
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,040
Thought you weren't
gonna paint any more.

815
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,600
Oh, look, it's Judy Garland.

816
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,320
Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out
she was really a man?

817
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,840
Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out

818
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,320
Gerard was really a man?

819
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,760
When you get through sucking on that,

820
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,400
come over
and see for yourself.

821
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,760
Only if I can record the slurps.

822
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,560
Oh, Andy, Sam called. He's sending
a limo for us for the show tonight.

823
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,000
I hear rock stars like limos.

824
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,800
I think it's just delicious
that Edie has a boyfriend.

825
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,920
I'm not looking
for anything like that.

826
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,880
Okay.

827
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,040
Don't be jealous, Andy.
He's nothing like you.

828
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,640
Oh no, I'm not. I've just never made it
with a rock star before.

829
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,320
- It must be neat.
- I'm not making it--

830
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,200
Why do you do that?
Why do you have to make me feel guilty?

831
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,600
I hate it when people
make me feel bad.

832
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, you lied to me.
You said you didn't talk to him.

833
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,040
- And then that picture in the paper...
- Andy, this is absurd.

834
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,720
It was a photograph.

835
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,200
You know, we barely met.
You meet people all the time.

836
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,920
Do you fuck them?

837
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,480
Well, I just think sex
is too abstract anyway.

838
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,080
Andy, what do you think
about the war in Vietnam?

839
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,160
I don't know. Ask Edie.
What do you think, Edie?

840
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,640
Well, we prefer
"I Dream of Jeannie."

841
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,080
Andy, in the story of your life,

842
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,680
who would you want
to play Andy Warhol?

843
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,120
Oh, Edie. She's so perfect.
She does everything better than me.

844
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,640
- Hi.
- Hello.

845
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,840
Andy, I need
to talk to you.

846
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,640
I've gotten myself
into a little pickle

847
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,360
and I was just wondering if you could
maybe pay me for some of my work?

848
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,040
Edie, you know the movies
haven't made any money yet.

849
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,480
So you just need
to be patient.

850
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,680
Well, I can't be patient.
I have nothing to live on.

851
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,280
- Andy, you and I both know...
- Sam.

852
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,240
...that you are
never giving up painting.

853
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,440
You've just been saying that
to get publicity.

854
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,360
- Well, guess what?
- What?

855
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
- It worked.
- Great.

856
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,840
Come on, everyone
wants to meet you.

857
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,800
This way.

858
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,200
Hello, kitty-kat.

859
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,520
Hello.

860
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,800
That's a wonderful scarf.

861
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,040
Thank you.
Left my tux in the shop.

862
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,240
You here to buy a painting?

863
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,040
Tell me, why are all these cats gonna
pay a fortune for a soup can?

864
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,440
I mean...

865
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,840
You just have to look
beyond the obvious.

866
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,120
Am I stupid, or...

867
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,040
I don't get it.
Am I stupid?

868
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,960
You're being a little stupid.
I mean, don't you think it's intriguing?

869
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,520
Not just a little bit?

870
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,320
You know, it may
just be a painting,

871
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,680
but it's an idea.

872
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,720
And the man behind that idea
is what's interesting.

873
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,040
I think the man has got his priorities
all out of whack.

874
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,680
Whole world's burning up
and this cat's making...

875
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,800
gods out of garbage.

876
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,280
Well, the whole world
may be burning up,

877
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,880
but that doesn't mean
that we have to be cynical.

878
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,160
See, when I look at drink I don't see
that it's half empty.

879
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,120
- What, it's half full?
- No.

880
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,080
No, it's time for you
to go to the bar to get me another.

881
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,360
There's a smile.

882
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,920
Got the whole world on
a string, don't you?

883
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,960
But inside there...

884
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,920
well, it's as empty
as your friend's soup can.

885
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,080
I'll see you around...

886
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,280
superstar.

887
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,720
Well, you're just so smart, Chuck.

888
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,400
I just think you should
start directing.

889
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,240
I mean, you do
the camera so good.

890
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,080
We always need people
like you just to make things happen.

891
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,840
Well, I mean, I'm really
just here for Edie, you know?

892
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,520
Oh. Well, it's just such a pity

893
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,840
that she should get all the attention
when you're the one who found her.

894
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,560
I hope she still wants
to do more movies.

895
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,800
She does.

896
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,360
We-- we do,
we love movies.

897
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,880
I mean, in fact,
I had this--

898
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,360
I just don't know
if she's being...

899
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,560
well, I mean, you know her
better than me.

900
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,720
But, it seems like when
the camera's on sometimes

901
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,160
she just doesn't seem...

902
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,040
I don't know, I just wouldn't
want it to be disappointing.

903
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,200
It won't.

904
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,680
I can have her say
anything you want.

905
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,240
She trusts me more
than anyone.

906
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,920
Oh.

907
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,360
Yeah.

908
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
Oh yeah.
That's much better. It's less faggy.

909
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,160
Did I smudge it?

910
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,960
There.

911
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,880
Darling, you look fabulous.

912
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,640
El fabulisimo grande.

913
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,720
Hey, Andy. We're ready.

914
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,920
Okay.

915
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,560
"Beauty Number Two,"
an Andy Warhol production.

916
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,800
Daddy, will you
pass me my martini?

917
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,240
- Edie?
- Yes, Chuckles?

918
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,720
Chuckles-- didn't I
give you that name?

919
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,400
Edie, do you
like horses?

920
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,720
Horses have whiskers.

921
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,600
Yes, horses.
Do you ride?

922
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,960
Since I was a little girl,
I've just adored them.

923
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,360
Daddy taught me to ride
before I could walk.

924
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,440
My first horse...

925
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,840
Your father was
a handsome man?

926
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,360
Oh, Fuzzy?

927
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,320
He still is.

928
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,440
How about your brothers? They were
quite attractive, too, weren't they?

929
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,160
They must have had
a lot of women then.

930
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,640
Wha--?

931
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,120
Did they find
you attractive?

932
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,120
Of course.
I was their family.

933
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,920
Did you find them
attractive?

934
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,000
- Do you...
- Can you change the question?

935
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,680
find Gino attractive? That's-- that's
what I was going to ask you, Edie.

936
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,320
Gino?

937
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,040
He's devastatingly handsome,
isn't he?

938
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,600
Kiss him.

939
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,720
Are you scared?

940
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,480
Come on, Edie.
Like you mean it.

941
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,440
Gino, she likes when
you get rough.

942
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,120
She likes those tough men.

943
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,840
Strong men are what turn you on,
isn't that right, babycakes?

944
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,040
No.

945
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,800
Not like
your brother, Minty.

946
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,440
Your father wasn't
so keen on him, was he?

947
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,680
Who was he keen on? You?

948
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,880
Okay, get off!
Enough!

949
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,160
Andy, are we finished?

950
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,560
No, Edie,
we're still rolling.

951
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,080
Sedgwick.

952
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,080
Edie Sedgwick!

953
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,080
Hello.

954
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,840
What, are you trying
to kill me?

955
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,560
How'd a nice chick
like you get mixed up

956
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,360
in the whole
acting racket?

957
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,920
It was
"Breakfast At Tiffany's."

958
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,280
You know that poster with Audrey
and her hair's pulled back

959
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,920
and she's smoking through
the black cigarette holder?

960
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,120
You want to live
in a movie?

961
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,400
I never saw
the movie.

962
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,640
So then you haven't
read the book, huh?

963
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,200
Well, Audrey
isn't in the book.

964
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,680
Book's a bit different.

965
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,960
Book's about a working girl

966
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,640
and a writer.

967
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,000
An artist.

968
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,960
You see, the artist steals
the girl's stories,

969
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,760
makes a fortune,

970
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,080
and the girl doesn't
get anything.

971
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,880
Why do you have
such a problem with Andy?

972
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,800
Because of what
he worships.

973
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,160
And what about you? I mean,
I saw your face in those flashbulbs.

974
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,920
You pretend to be
some sort of crusader,

975
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,800
but I saw you
basking in it.

976
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,080
Oh, don't get us confused,
sister, all right?

977
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,960
Those bulbs, they get
a message out.

978
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,680
What-- what exactly
is the message...

979
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,920
aside from
"Look at me"?

980
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,840
Nah, I'm just
a guitar player.

981
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,200
- That's all.
- No no.

982
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,560
You're an overpaid prophet
and I'm a poor little rich girl.

983
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,600
Lady, you don't know
shit about shit.

984
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,560
Open your eyes, you know? Take a look
at the world around you, okay?

985
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,880
- It's very easy for you to say that...
- It's not all Park Avenue.

986
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,800
- You do know that, don't you?
- ...from your wonderful,

987
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,960
very glorified position
where you have your cars

988
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,600
and your houses
and your fucking bike.

989
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,160
You think I give a shit
about any of this?

990
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,200
- I think it's obvious you do.
- You think I actually care?

991
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,280
It's not real, babe.

992
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,120
- Big house, huh?
- Big house.

993
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,160
- Big family, too?
- Big family.

994
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,120
Tell me about
your house.

995
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,640
Mmm.

996
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,760
We lived on a ranch.
We lived on two ranches

997
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,240
in California.

998
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,120
- Two ranches?
- Two ranches with--

999
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,480
Must have been
a big family.

1000
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,120
It was a big family.
We had horses

1001
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,040
and cattle and we had--

1002
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,000
Lots of brothers
and sisters?

1003
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,880
We had eight brothers
and sisters.

1004
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,000
Now I have six
brothers and sisters.

1005
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,440
Well, what happened
to the other two?

1006
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,040
Minty...

1007
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
hanged himself

1008
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,760
at a place
called Silver Hill,

1009
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,760
which was sort of...

1010
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,880
a rehabilitation center.

1011
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,200
And Bobby...

1012
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,040
- Jesus.
- ...who was my elder brother

1013
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,920
ran his bike into a bus
on Fifth Avenue.

1014
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,600
But the funny thing
was was that I was in a--

1015
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,240
a car accident on the same--
it was New Year's Eve,

1016
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,920
and I-- well, he died,

1017
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,240
and-- and I didn't die.

1018
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,200
Babe.

1019
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,640
I was out with a couple
of heavies tonight.

1020
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,120
We talked about you
all evening.

1021
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,560
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, guess who?

1022
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,680
- Diana Vreeland?
- No.

1023
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,360
- John Lennon?
- No.

1024
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,880
Edie Sedgwick?

1025
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,880
No, I haven't seen her.

1026
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,800
Don't know where
she is.

1027
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,120
Hey, you wanna hear
my new idea for a movie?

1028
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,960
Think I can invite her
for dinner?

1029
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,600
- Who?
- Edie.

1030
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,360
You wanna introduce her
to your mother?

1031
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,760
Why?

1032
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Well, I hadn't thought--
I don't know.

1033
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,280
Might be nice.

1034
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,920
Jeez, Andy, you must really miss her.

1035
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,160
You never invite
anybody else over.

1036
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,480
Oh, cut it out.
You can't be that mean.

1037
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,640
Well, you never
invited me over.

1038
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,000
You need to lose
25 lbs first.

1039
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,440
My mother's not gonna feed you.
She's nastier than you are.

1040
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,640
She is not!

1041
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,680
I draw too, like Andy.

1042
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,200
Oh, you do?

1043
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,440
My husband work in
coal mine back then, yeah?

1044
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,680
And he very very
good-looking.

1045
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,520
Beautiful white hair.

1046
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,600
Every girl want this boy,
but he want me.

1047
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,000
- But I no want.
- Well, why didn't you want him?

1048
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,320
- I 15.
- Oh.

1049
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,520
But then one day,
he bring chocolate...

1050
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,760
...for purposes to
marry him.

1051
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,240
So for this candy,
I marry him.

1052
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,440
Oh!

1053
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,880
You make my Andy
so very happy.

1054
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,040
Oh.

1055
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,200
Oh, my special boy.

1056
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,520
With you, I think,

1057
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,080
all his skin blotches
go away.

1058
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,800
Mama, dost.

1059
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,320
Let me help you
with that.

1060
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,520
You the boss,
applesauce.

1061
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,680
You know, Andy, I've been spending
a lot of time with Billy.

1062
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,520
And I think that the more
I think about it,

1063
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,840
I really think that
you should meet.

1064
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,320
You'd really like
each other.

1065
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,640
Why would he want
to meet me?

1066
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,640
Well, because
you're a genius.

1067
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,760
And he's a genius.
Well, isn't he a genius, Julia?

1068
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,320
Oh, my boy a genius.

1069
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,520
Can you imagine how--
I mean, if we made a movie or something,

1070
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,520
wouldn't that be fun,
how explosive that would be?

1071
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,240
I just think if we
took him to The Factory

1072
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,560
everybody would respond very well.
Plus, he'd look beautiful--

1073
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,920
Edie, I just wanted to
get that for you.

1074
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,080
I know it's only $50,

1075
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,400
but, well, I just
like the word "genius."

1076
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,320
I just think you should
say it over and over.

1077
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,560
Genius, genius,
genius, genius...

1078
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,800
Yeah, I dream
of genius.

1079
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,280
- Genius?
- Mmm-hmm.

1080
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,120
He used that word?
That sounds like your word.

1081
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,800
Well, genius,
brilliant, superstar--

1082
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,640
they're just words.

1083
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,440
What's important
is the sentiment.

1084
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,080
What's important
is the word.

1085
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,920
Well...

1086
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,600
you say you want to make a movie
with me, let's make a movie.

1087
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,920
Why?

1088
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,120
You want to make a movie
with me, I need to know why.

1089
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,160
Oh, babycakes.

1090
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,160
You're gonna hurt that
enormous brain of yours

1091
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,280
with all that thinking
you do.

1092
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,880
Ow.

1093
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,480
Oh, Andy,
don't be nervous.

1094
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,480
Oh he's here.
Chuck, get the camera ready. He's here.

1095
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,600
- Oh, hello.
- There she is, baby.

1096
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,280
You know Andy.

1097
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,280
- Hey.
- Say hello. This is Andy.

1098
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,480
Hi. Oh, wow,
you're such a beauty.

1099
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh, here, would you
sign my book?

1100
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,400
Yeah, man.

1101
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,320
Oh, great.
Thank you.

1102
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,280
This is everybody.
This is The Factory.

1103
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,160
Should we start?
What do you think?

1104
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,760
Yeah, let's--

1105
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,520
I think we should
discuss salary

1106
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,840
in the beginning so there's
no misunderstanding.

1107
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,040
Oh, he never pays
the actors.

1108
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,920
You expect him
to work for free?

1109
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,240
Uh... um...

1110
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,560
- I could give him $11.
- $11?

1111
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,600
He's got $11.

1112
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,600
$11.

1113
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,080
Maybe we just take
11 of these instead.

1114
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,920
No, man.
Don't sweat it.

1115
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,440
I think my grandma's got 11 of these
stacked in her basement.

1116
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,680
You know?

1117
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,720
So...

1118
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,160
oh, you want
to make a movie?

1119
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,160
- Oh, yeah.
- Where do we start, Andy?

1120
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,160
Yeah, do you want to
just sit down here

1121
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,320
in front
of the camera?

1122
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,000
You know what, man?
Nah, I don't wanna sit.

1123
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,200
Can I just stand
in front of the chair?

1124
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,960
Oh, yeah. I mean, you know,
you can do whatever.

1125
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,600
It's your screen test.

1126
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,720
No, it's not.
It's yours.

1127
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Come on, man,
direct me.

1128
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,480
Well, sit down.

1129
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,840
I'm sorry.

1130
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,760
You could just look
at the camera maybe.

1131
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,960
Yeah, I could do it.

1132
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,640
So this is
where you work?

1133
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,440
This is where you paint
your cans of beans

1134
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,040
- or whatever?
- Yeah.

1135
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,400
It's a big space, man.

1136
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,400
- Thanks.
- Right in the city.

1137
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,760
Must be real expensive.

1138
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,520
Oh, no.

1139
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,920
- No, it's not.
- Guy like you...

1140
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,960
must be really
generous, huh?

1141
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,200
- I mean...
- No.

1142
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,240
taking care
of all these people.

1143
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,040
Do you smoke, man,
or you just do that faggy speed shit?

1144
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,720
Just the "faggy
speed shit."

1145
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,520
Come on, man.

1146
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,160
No, man. Keep it. That's for you.

1147
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,800
- Here.
- Yeah.

1148
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,120
I think we got it.

1149
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,920
Well, great.

1150
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,040
Yeah, that was
so interesting. Thanks.

1151
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,400
- Don't you think, Chuck?
- Yeah.

1152
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,080
- Got everything you want?
- Oh, yeah. It was neat.

1153
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,800
- All right.
- Thanks.

1154
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,760
Let's split.

1155
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,480
Well, guess you can't have
your cake and Edie too, huh?

1156
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,480
What the hell was that?

1157
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,680
- You understand that he's my friend.
- He's your friend?

1158
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,000
He's my friend.

1159
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,560
Baby, your friend
is a bloodsucker, you know that?

1160
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,480
You're his prop.

1161
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,880
Okay?
You're disposable to him.

1162
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,440
Man, you should
fucking hate him.

1163
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,320
- He'll fucking kill you.
- I can't hate him!

1164
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,600
Come on, man.
Let me out.

1165
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,560
I'm not kidding, man.
Let me out.

1166
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,880
Edie, come on.
Come with me.

1167
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,080
You're so scared,
baby.

1168
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,720
You're so scared
of losing everything

1169
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,360
that doesn't
mean anything.

1170
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,080
Take care
of yourself, babe.

1171
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,840
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

1172
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,360
He was the first
and the last person

1173
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,360
that I ever loved
like that.

1174
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,560
And I know everyone says
that about their first,

1175
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,720
but when he and I
were together

1176
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,600
it felt perfect.

1177
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,160
Are you filming
right now?

1178
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,120
Oh.

1179
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,840
So this is the movies.

1180
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,280
- Andy. Andy, I saw the craziest thing.
- Shh!

1181
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,520
I always thought they'd be bigger.
Do you want me to talk?

1182
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,080
Ingrid, tell us another one
of your hilarious stories.

1183
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,560
You're going to be such a big star.

1184
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,680
Ingrid Superstar!

1185
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,720
You know, I've never done
nothing like this before.

1186
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,880
Just be like Edie.

1187
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,840
Except the part where
she takes too many drugs.

1188
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,040
Is there another part?

1189
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,960
Oh no, I don't do
the heavy stuff.

1190
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,040
I think Edie and Ingrid
look like sisters.

1191
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,960
Andy, she doesn't
look anything like me.

1192
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,360
"Andy, she doesn't
look anything like me."

1193
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,160
The resemblance
is uncanny.

1194
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,160
Tell me about the first
time a boy touched you.

1195
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,640
Oh yeah, Charlie Connell

1196
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,480
paid me a nickel to put
his hand up my dress.

1197
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,400
After that, it was so easy I charged
all his friends a dime.

1198
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,440
Seriously,
by the time I was 15,

1199
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,080
between me and my friend,
we had 68 bucks,

1200
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,920
which was enough for a bus ticket

1201
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,880
and cab fare and a hot meal
at Cafe Figaro,

1202
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,960
where you guys
picked me up.

1203
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,200
Miss Sedgwick, open up!

1204
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,200
Miss Sedgwick!

1205
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,360
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Whitley.

1206
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,680
Christmas was last week,
Miss Sedgwick.

1207
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,640
So was December.

1208
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,920
November was the month
before that.

1209
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,840
And we all know
when October was.

1210
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,720
Happy New Year.
Your rent's three months late.

1211
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,880
Taxi!

1212
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,800
I need money, James.
I need it now.

1213
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,840
It's all spent,
Miss Sedgwick.

1214
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,760
I need to pay
for my apartment.

1215
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,160
Your father pays half your
rent every month, period.

1216
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,840
He calls it tough love.

1217
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,800
In my opinion, young lady,
he's been quite generous.

1218
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,040
You want to know what "tough love"
was for me, James?

1219
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,920
Trying to keep
my father

1220
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,760
out of my bed since
I was eight years old.

1221
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,120
My God.

1222
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,160
Does your
mother know?

1223
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,320
- Did you ever tell her?
- Yeah.

1224
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,280
What did she say?

1225
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,200
Nothing.

1226
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,760
Miss Sedg--

1227
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,520
Edie, I can help you.

1228
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,360
You can have
what I've got here.

1229
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,120
Oh, child, child.

1230
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,680
Child.

1231
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,240
Hello.

1232
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,520
Andy, it's Edie!

1233
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,400
He's not here.

1234
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,880
So, Silver,

1235
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,560
can-- can-- can
I borrow some money?

1236
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,200
Yeah.

1237
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,280
Let me have 50,
and I'll give you 10.

1238
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,600
I'm serious.

1239
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,000
You know, sweets,

1240
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,600
Andy's not the only
game in town.

1241
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,320
I have a friend Max.

1242
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,640
He's friends
with a friend

1243
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,240
who knows
Alfred Hitchcock.

1244
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,080
I think it could be good
for your career.

1245
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,720
I started to scheme

1246
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,400
about how
to get drugs.

1247
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,760
I shot heroin to come down
from speed

1248
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,400
and keep
the big sadness at bay.

1249
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,720
But I got completely
out of control.

1250
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,560
She really is like
a glamorous Viking, isn't she?

1251
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,240
An East Berlin original.

1252
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,800
You're so beautiful.

1253
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,040
Well, we're sponsoring
a new band.

1254
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,320
Oh, what are
they called?

1255
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,760
- The Velvet Underground.
- Oh, yeah.

1256
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,040
And since I don't believe
in painting any more,

1257
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,640
we thought it
would be a nice--

1258
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,080
A way of combining music,
films and art.

1259
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,520
Nico, how about a photo?

1260
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,840
Hello, Mum-mum.

1261
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,800
How are you, dear?

1262
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,640
Is-- is Fuzzy there?

1263
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,760
You're not going to ask
for money, are you, honey?

1264
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,200
No, no.

1265
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,480
I just wanted
to say hello.

1266
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,680
Oh, yes, of course.

1267
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,520
Let me get him.

1268
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,560
Fuzzy, darling,
it's Edith on the phone.

1269
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,320
You talk to her.

1270
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,320
- You've got to talk to her.
- Fuzzy.

1271
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,400
- It sounds like she's desperate.
- I hate the bitch.

1272
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,320
Talk to her. She's your daughter.

1273
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,360
Tell her to go make her movies.

1274
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,600
He'd love to talk,
darling, but he's tied up at the moment.

1275
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,520
- Take care, Mum-mum.
- He'll call you right back, okay?

1276
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,880
I'm just so tired.

1277
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,120
Andy Warhol superstar-
slash-socialite Edie Sedgwick

1278
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,440
was taken to Lenox Hospital
today after starting a fire.

1279
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,360
She almost burned down
the whole fucking place.

1280
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,520
She suffered first-degree
burns on her arms and legs.

1281
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,440
What do you want me
to do?

1282
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,600
I don't know.
See if she needs anything.

1283
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,320
I'd help her
if I could.

1284
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,840
What's up, baby?

1285
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,880
Richie, honey,

1286
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,320
I need to ask
you a favor.

1287
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,960
Richie, darling! It's been ages.
How's your father?

1288
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,560
He just bought my mother
a 10-carat stone.

1289
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,240
If anyone else, you'd think he was
screwing the Rockettes.

1290
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,840
Diana, I'm calling
about Edie Sedgwick.

1291
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,040
Yes.

1292
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,200
She's been trying
to reach you.

1293
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,120
I have her here.
I'm going to put her on.

1294
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,040
- Hello.
- Edie.

1295
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,760
Divine one,
how are you?

1296
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,600
Your pictures
were incredible.

1297
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,480
I'm afraid we can't sign
you right now, darling.

1298
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,200
Why not?

1299
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,160
The board feels--

1300
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,000
they feel...

1301
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,800
Andy Warhol's
mise-en-scne,

1302
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,960
it's become too seedy.

1303
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,760
The drugs, darling,
the riffraff.

1304
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,080
The patina is damaged.
They think you've become vulgar.

1305
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,880
Vulgar? How?

1306
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,040
I don't know, but it's
better than being boring.

1307
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,600
Now do take care
of yourself.

1308
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,360
You what?

1309
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,880
I hope you're happy.

1310
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,960
Everyone in New York
is laughing at me.

1311
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,120
I can't leave
my apartment.

1312
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,080
I can't get a job.

1313
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,560
Your movies have made
a fool out of me.

1314
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,400
Oh, no. They've made
you famous, Edie,

1315
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,880
and that's what
you wanted.

1316
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,000
No one will have
anything to do with me

1317
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,240
because of you.

1318
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,840
But every teenage girl from Jersey
wants to look like you, Edie.

1319
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,840
Andy, I have nothing.

1320
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,000
You owe me that money.
I need that money.

1321
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,520
But I gave you $50. I gave you money.
Did you spend it already?

1322
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,760
50 fucking dollars?

1323
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,160
I'm sure if you wait a year or two,

1324
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,520
someone from Hollywood
will put you in a movie

1325
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,160
with Tony Perkins. And then you can earn
all the money you want

1326
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,480
and spend all that too.

1327
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,560
You think that I'll
go to Hollywood?

1328
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:48,080
You think I can't function without you?
I'll be fucking fine.

1329
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,880
Are you going to live there

1330
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,360
with your boyfriend
and his wife?

1331
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,960
What?

1332
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,360
You filthy,
filthy, fucking--

1333
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,200
Edie, enough!

1334
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,200
- You fucked me up!
- That's enough!

1335
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,000
And your Factory!

1336
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,760
You fucked me up
and you know it!

1337
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,400
You look at me.

1338
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,640
Look at me!

1339
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,880
- Look at me!
- Enough, enough now.

1340
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,320
Look at what
you've created.

1341
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,680
You're the boss,
applesauce.

1342
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,760
Andy...

1343
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,800
who is this you
are talking about?

1344
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,120
I don't know what to say
to her anymore.

1345
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,680
And I don't know
what I did.

1346
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,240
She's such
a beautiful girl,

1347
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,920
but it's like she just
wants to be ugly now.

1348
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,840
And I don't understand

1349
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,320
why anybody
would want that.

1350
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,240
How do you stop somebody
from not doing something

1351
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,880
if they don't want to?

1352
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,840
We will say a prayer
for her

1353
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,880
and then we will
go and light a candle.

1354
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,640
I never met anybody
like her before.

1355
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,680
Who is he?

1356
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,440
Don't you remember?

1357
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,200
This is my friend, Max.

1358
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,920
The guy who knows the guy
who knows Alfred Hitchcock.

1359
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,880
Oh, right.

1360
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,160
Is your--
is your friend

1361
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,760
stealing my silverware?

1362
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,600
No, he's just
borrowing it.

1363
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,920
Is that okay?

1364
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,440
Just because I let
your friend

1365
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,960
fuck me last night

1366
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,640
doesn't mean that he
can take my silver.

1367
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,120
Did he film it?

1368
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,640
Yes, and you were great.

1369
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,960
- Are you done?
- Yeah, that's a wrap.

1370
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,240
- How do I look?
- You look groovy.

1371
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,480
Hey, Edie,

1372
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,240
can he borrow
your coat?

1373
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,160
That looks really
good on you.

1374
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,480
Thanks.

1375
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:59,240
All right, sweets,
I gotta go.

1376
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,720
Don't-- don't go.

1377
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,720
Don't leave me now.

1378
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,440
Maybe I'll come back later.

1379
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,480
Don't forget to blow out
all these candles.

1380
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,840
God, maybe you should
just sort of--

1381
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,680
Ciao.

1382
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
- Take off her coat, man.
- She said I could borrow it.

1383
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,920
No no no. Either you take it off
or I'm gonna take it off for you.

1384
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,720
- It's your choice.
- She just said that he could borrow--

1385
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,160
Take off the fucking coat!

1386
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,280
Hey, man,

1387
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,520
just mellow out, man.

1388
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,240
Now get the fuck
out of here.

1389
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,960
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Okay.

1390
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,040
We were just leaving,
man.

1391
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,600
Don't fucking touch me.

1392
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,120
Peace, man.
Hey, yeah.

1393
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,640
Bye, Edie.

1394
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,640
Syd, is that you?

1395
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,120
Let me see.

1396
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,280
What are you doing?

1397
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,840
I said it all to him.

1398
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,040
I told him.

1399
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,360
I-I said it to Andy.

1400
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,200
I said it all to him.
Is that why you're here?

1401
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,840
Are we going upstate like he said?
'Cause if we are,

1402
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,520
I just need to put
a few things into a bag.

1403
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,160
He's out of town,
all right?

1404
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,320
But maybe,
maybe when he gets back.

1405
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,120
All right?

1406
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,880
Did-- did my father
call you?

1407
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,280
Is that why--

1408
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,760
is he gonna lock me
up again?

1409
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,040
No.

1410
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,040
Syd, will you stay--

1411
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,080
- stay the night with me?
- No.

1412
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,040
Edie.

1413
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,000
Lately, I--

1414
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,400
I feel like
I'm gonna die.

1415
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,080
You're not
gonna die, Edie.

1416
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:10,400
You're gonna be fine.
I promise.

1417
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1418
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,320
Hey, how about I buy
you something to eat?

1419
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,040
Can I do that?

1420
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,080
Looks like an accident.
It may be a while.

1421
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,440
Where are we going, Syd?

1422
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,640
I want to show
you something.

1423
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,600
Do you remember
that girl?

1424
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,120
Huh?

1425
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,360
That's--

1426
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,640
what was I thinking?

1427
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:55,080
The only reason I ever
went to that class was because of you.

1428
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,040
It's true.

1429
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,800
Do you remember her?

1430
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,560
No.

1431
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,160
Edie!

1432
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,040
I'm not saying that
anyone else is responsible.

1433
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,600
I made decisions,

1434
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,560
life decisions
that I regret.

1435
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,960
But I really feel
like I can do this.

1436
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,800
I can stay
off the drugs,

1437
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,880
and I realize that it will
be a battle every day,

1438
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,920
but so far

1439
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,960
so good, right?

1440
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,240
But I'm home.

1441
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,360
Santa Barbara
is my home.

1442
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,560
And I have a small show.
Did I tell you that?

1443
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,320
I mean,
it's nothing major.

1444
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,160
It's just in a frame shop,
but it's something.

1445
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,840
I just think people forgot what emotions
were supposed to be.

1446
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,920
I mean,
it's too hard to care.

1447
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,520
I mean, you know,
I still care,

1448
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,560
but it would just be so
much nicer not to care.

1449
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,040
It's just easier
being detached.

1450
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,120
What about Edie?

1451
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,680
Oh, what about Edie?
I haven't seen her in years.

1452
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,680
You know she died
yesterday?

1453
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,640
Oh, yeah.

1454
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,400
Do you think your breakup had something
to do with that detachment?

1455
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,320
Well, it wasn't
a breakup.

1456
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:24,920
I mean, that makes
it sound like we were--

1457
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,000
I mean, this is gonna
be really hard if we have to-- if--

1458
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,320
You know, it was
just so long ago.

1459
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,320
I mean, I hardly
knew her at all, so...

1460
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,520
I wonder if people
are gonna remember us.

1461
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,920
- What, when we're dead?
- Yeah.

1462
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,120
I think people will talk about how
you changed the world.

1463
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,840
I wonder what they'll say about you

1464
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,720
in your obituary.

1465
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,920
- I like that word.
- Nothing nice, I don't think.

1466
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,160
Oh, no, come on. It'd say,

1467
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,320
"Edith Minturn Sedgwick,

1468
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,280
beautiful artist
and actress..."

1469
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,200
"And all-around loon."

1470
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,360
"Remembered for setting
the world on fire..."

1471
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,440
"And escaping the clutches
of her terrifying family."

1472
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,960
"Made friends
with everybody and anybody..."

1473
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,840
"Creating chaos
and uproar wherever she went.

1474
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,080
Divorced as many times
as she married,

1475
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,760
she leaves only
good wishes behind."

1476
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,520
That's nice, isn't it?

1477
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,880
Edie seemed
to understand from the beginning

1478
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,560
her life
was going to be short.

1479
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,960
She was a blip on
the radar suddenly.

1480
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,640
It just blew out everybody.

1481
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,960
You walk into a room
and Edie was there.

1482
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,560
Edie was what you saw.

1483
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,280
There was something
so vulnerable about Edie.

1484
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,960
She was a person
that everybody adored

1485
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,520
and kind of worshipped,

1486
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,280
but you knew that she was
basically fragile.

1487
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,920
Time sort of stopped
when you were with her.

1488
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,080
She was
an exquisite creature.

1489
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,720
She had sort of a gamine look.
Very long legs,

1490
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,600
very pale face,
very pale lips.

1491
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,320
And a waif, in a way.

1492
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,320
And I think probably
the weakness of her showed there.

1493
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,720
Andy was very struck by her.

1494
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,800
Andy would always
invite somebody, to say,

1495
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,720
"Would you want to be
in one of my movies?"

1496
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,400
And of course, Edie took Andy
very seriously on that.

1497
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,760
Who was Edie Sedgwick?
Edie Sedgwick was a combination

1498
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,640
of all the tragic women
who came before her.

1499
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,760
She looked great
in front of a camera.

1500
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,800
And she loved being
in front of one.

1501
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,200
Edie was taken advantage of,

1502
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,320
and hugely because she
was so loving and trusting.

1503
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,760
She was very trusting.

1504
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,960
She looked into your eyes.

1505
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,080
She listened to what
you had to say.

1506
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,960
She made you believe that you were
the most important person

1507
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,040
to her
or on the planet.

1508
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,600
Yeah, I think Edie took on Andy

1509
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,080
as the father
that she didn't have.

1510
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,560
Everybody I know that really
knew her wanted to save her.

1511
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,720
That was one of the things--
trying to keep her off drugs,

1512
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,520
trying to get her
to pull her life together.

1513
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,760
If you said "I love you,"
she just brightened up.

1514
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,960
So you got
an immediate response,

1515
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,640
and I think that's
how she caught people really strongly.

1516
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,560
She had her own sense
of style,

1517
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,480
which no one
had ever seen before.

1518
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,600
She invented
an entirely new look.

1519
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,600
She inspired us all to want
to take care of her.

1520
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,240
But believe me,
that was some job.

1521
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,280
And of course, she had
a terrible time with drugs

1522
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,200
and also the character
that comes with that.

1523
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,360
Endless searching
through her bag to try to find a key

1524
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,440
or to try to find lipstick
or whatever.

1525
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,360
But still
enchanting anyway.
