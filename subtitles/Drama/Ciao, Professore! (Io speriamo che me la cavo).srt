1
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,979
I'm glad to see you.

2
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,300
Please.

3
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:51,725
THE TWINS

4
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,552
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.

5
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:16,993
Opening of the will to
her two children,

6
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:21,056
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.

7
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:24,504
"In accordance with the will,

8
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:28,506
regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan,

9
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,576
the notary, Jean Lebel,

10
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:33,772
is named executor."

11
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:36,042
Hmm ... I must tell you here

12
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:39,015
that it was your mother's decision.

13
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,420
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

14
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:46,718
You know ...

15
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:50,888
... your mother was more
than an employee.

16
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:52,362
To my late wife and me

17
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:55,766
you felt more like part
of our family, so ...

18
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,296
I could not refuse.

19
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:04,042
Hum!
"All my assets are to be
shared between the twins,

20
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,443
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."

21
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,811
"The money is to be equitably
shared"

22
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,249
"My furniture distributed by
mutual agreement."

23
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,916
"Burial"

24
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,320
"Notary Jean Lebel will

25
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,724
bury me without a coffin, naked

26
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,058
and without prayers."

27
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:26,226
"My face turned towards the ground,
my back against the world."

28
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,902
"Tombstone and Epitaph"

29
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:33,933
"No headstone is to be
placed on my grave

30
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,442
and my name engraved nowhere."

31
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:38,843
"No epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises."

32
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,250
"To Jeanne and Simon"

33
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:46,653
"Childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat

34
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,123
which cannot be removed easily."

35
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,863
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will
hand you an envelope."

36
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,130
"This envelope is for your father."

37
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:04,104
"Find him

38
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,039
and hand him the envelope."

39
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:11,847
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

40
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,473
I've heard enough.

41
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:18,623
Oh ... but it's not finished.

42
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:22,549
Continue.

43
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:27,188
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

44
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,301
"This envelope is for your brother."

45
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,071
"Find him and hand it to him."

46
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:42,347
"When these envelopes
have been handed

47
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:46,178
to their addressees, a
letter will be given to you."

48
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:49,253
"When the silence is broken,
and the promise kept

49
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:52,551
a stone may be placed
on my grave

50
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:55,752
and my name engraved on
the stone."

51
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:12,744
I admit it's a bit strange.

52
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,112
Is there stuff to sign?

53
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,383
No, not today.

54
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:25,754
OK.

55
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,388
Thank you, Jean.

56
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:30,053
- Shall we?
- Wait.

57
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,598
You know, the history
of our father.

58
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:39,036
You know, we have no brother.

59
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,472
Why did you let her write this?

60
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,936
I understand your surprise.

61
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,309
It's ... it's very surprising.

62
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:48,415
Stop pretending to be innocent!

63
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,109
We know that we speak of, there is
nothing surprising in this.

64
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:53,483
We did not make these
things up, Simon...

65
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:54,919
They are part of a will.

66
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:57,582
There's that, too.

67
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,270
Well, this morning your mother
gave us something rather special.

68
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:20,975
We'll sleep on it, then ...

69
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:22,982
We'll meet again, huh?

70
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,587
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

71
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,623
Sit down, Simon.

72
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:30,487
Look, Jean ...

73
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:33,323
your secretary, she loved
working for you.

74
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:38,095
She did this well all her
life, congratulations.

75
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,432
Your secretary, however, was also
my mother.

76
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,302
Then her job as a mother,
that's another story.

77
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:44,498
Simon ...

78
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,133
You can bury your secretary
in any way you wish.

79
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,871
But my mother, I want her
buried in the normal way.

80
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,606
For once in your fucking life

81
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,809
make it something normal.

82
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,176
This is not negotiable.

83
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,401
Take your time.

84
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,165
And come see me when Simon
has calmed down.

85
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,672
I know it's very unusual, but ...

86
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:27,675
your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.

87
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,065
We have a large family now.

88
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,280
She spoke of a traitor?

89
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,010
In a big family, there's always a dog.

90
00:10:58,118 --> 00:11:00,746
How long will it be before we
find the traitor?

91
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,446
Fucking crazy woman!

92
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:11,024
I'll fix that with Jean.

93
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,564
Fix what?

94
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,260
We'll give her a
normal funeral.

95
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,409
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

96
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,624
Where are you going?

97
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,919
You bury her any way you like!

98
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,584
Oh, stop!

99
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:43,922
You feel guilty because
you were not there

100
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,067
when she died.

101
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,998
You feel guilty because
you were there

102
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:48,433
when she had her accident.

103
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:51,129
You need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

104
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:52,968
I am not feeling guilty
about anything.

105
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,600
Do you realize the significance of
what he just read?

106
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:56,938
Well, she's gone!

107
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,979
It's over, I'm at peace!

108
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,747
I have fucking peace!

109
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,986
I'm at peace now.

110
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,259
Yes, I see.

111
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:25,338
Mathematics as you
have known so far

112
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:29,434
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response

113
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:32,482
to precise and definitive problems.

114
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,108
Now, you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure.

115
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,711
The subject will be
intractable problems

116
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,448
that will always lead

117
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:43,493
to other problems just
as intractable.

118
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,357
People around you will
repeatedly insist

119
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:49,489
that what you are doing is
hopeless.

120
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,659
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

121
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,569
because they will be of an
overwelming complexity.

122
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,910
Welcome to pure mathematics,

123
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,036
the land of loneliness.

124
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,173
This is my assistant,

125
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,148
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

126
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,677
Hello!

127
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,723
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

128
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,033
What does your intuition
tell you?

129
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,039
Your intuition is always right.

130
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,405
That's why you got potential

131
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,945
to becoming a real mathematician.

132
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,709
But over there, you'll need help.

133
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,876
Do you have any family there?

134
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,085
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

135
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:48,753
You've come to learn that
a) your father is alive;

136
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,955
and b) you have another brother.

137
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,190
This is ridiculous

138
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,700
What is ridiculous to question
the inevitable.

139
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:57,293
You need to know.

140
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,967
Otherwise, your mind
will never be at peace.

141
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:06,640
And peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics.

142
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:12,378
You need a starting point.

143
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:20,425
My father died during
the war in Daresh.

144
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,792
That's the unknown variable
in the equation.

145
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,923
You never start with the
unknown variable.

146
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,801
My mother used to speak about
a village

147
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,769
called Der Om, in Fouad.

148
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:35,273
She graduated in French

149
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,775
at the University of Daresh.

150
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,848
If she studied, there is hope.

151
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,942
Said Haidar.

152
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,680
You'll go knock on the
door Said Haidar

153
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:49,256
an old friend of mine who
teaches at Daresh.

154
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,292
You can trust him.

155
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,206
What are you doing?

156
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,440
Mom! Are you Okay?

157
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:58,319
Madam, that's my towel, please.

158
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:01,146
Mom?

159
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,126
Mom!

160
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,009
Mom?

161
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,579
What happened?

162
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,693
Where's Jeanne?

163
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,188
Mom?

164
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,407
Does she suffer from migraines?

165
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:56,537
No.

166
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,843
- Memory loss?
- No.

167
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:01,112
Loss of balance?

168
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:02,277
No.

169
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:04,014
Absent-minded?

170
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:06,092
She's always absent.

171
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:08,626
No, she was never absent.

172
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,130
Wahab, come.

173
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:45,828
Just get out of my sister's way.

174
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,058
Son of refugees, where do you
think you're going?

175
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,907
Nicolas, stop!

176
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,502
Go back to your country.

177
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:02,643
Wahab!

178
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:06,308
We'll leave your hide
in your camps, believe me.

179
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:08,041
Give me.

180
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,587
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.

181
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:15,022
You have sullied the
family honor.

182
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:16,592
- Enough!

183
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:19,425
Go home!

184
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,363
Go home!

185
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,338
Outside.

186
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,240
What have you done!

187
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:42,854
You have humilliated us!
You have sullied the
name of our family!

188
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:46,751
Why God have you plunged
us in the dark?

189
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:52,895
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?

190
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:55,933
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?

191
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,032
I'm pregnant, grandma.

192
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:04,236
- My God, everything is black.
Why?

193
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,606
Why have you done this?

194
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:09,612
Do I have to kill you?

195
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,751
What will I do with you?

196
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:33,565
Come.

197
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:38,202
Eat if you want your
child safe.

198
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:46,377
Listen to me.

199
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,545
There's nothing here for you.

200
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,649
I'll help after the birth.

201
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:55,917
I want you to go away.

202
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:01,431
You'll go to live with
your uncle Charbel.

203
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,732
There, you'll go to school.

204
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,100
To learn to read,
to learn to think

205
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:10,332
out of this misery.

206
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,275
Promise me and I'll help you.

207
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:20,711
Promise me you'll go to school.

208
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,788
I promise you, grandmother.

209
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,594
I promise.

210
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,350
Shh.

211
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,101
Shh.

212
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:18,092
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.

213
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:27,542
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.

214
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,784
Be careful.
Don't worry.

215
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:16,964
Come on, it's time
for you to go.

216
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:22,092
I feel that something terrible
is coming ...

217
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:40,620
One day I'll find you, my son.

218
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:21,125
I received a message
from my friend Niv Cohen

219
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:23,320
but I can't help you

220
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:25,431
because at the time,

221
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,759
I taught

222
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,267
History of Mathematics
in Paris.

223
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:33,304
Specifically, the period

224
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,399
where Euler had
succeeded

225
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,445
to give the first

226
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,776
formal mathematical resolution

227
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,649
to the problem of the seven bridges
of Konigsberg, yes.

228
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:50,780
Diderot defied the Court

229
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,825
saying:

230
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,018
"Gentlemen ..."

231
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:57,791
I-ft plus

232
00:30:57,966 --> 00:30:59,297
Equals zero.

233
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:02,463
So, God exists!"

234
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:06,971
Niv, Niv, Niv ...

235
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,051
Hello! Do you speak French?

236
00:31:23,192 --> 00:31:25,057
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?

237
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:28,857
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone
who would have known this woman.

238
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,824
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.

239
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,394
Are you kidding me?

240
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,699
I wasn't even born.

241
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,001
Well, you're in the wrong
place...

242
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:41,302
I'm not kidding.

243
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,469
I'm sure you know someone
who can help me.

244
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:45,138
I have come from far away.

245
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:47,910
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.

246
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,521
You are very kind.

247
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:01,495
I'm not nice, I want
to get rid of you.

248
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,157
Najat, that's me.

249
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,764
You have time to waste?

250
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:09,372
That tells me something.

251
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:13,910
She may have worked in the
campus newspaper.

252
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:16,436
It's been a long time.

253
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:23,043
People who leave usually
change identities.

254
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,724
It is striking nonetheless.

255
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:43,201
Your mother was photographed
in Kfar Ryat.

256
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:44,798
Look here.

257
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:49,103
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.

258
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:53,050
It is a prison in the south.

259
00:32:57,122 --> 00:32:59,250
You do not know Kfar Ryat?

260
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
- No.

261
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:03,994
You're definitely not from
here.

262
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:08,098
You don't know the South.

263
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:43,095
If the international community

264
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:46,999
does not intervene now

265
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,001
The refugees in overcrowded

266
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:56,040
camps at the border ...will be
massacred.

267
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,844
She has arrived.

268
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,115
OK.

269
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:04,988
We, the students, are oppose
against the Nationalist Party

270
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,493
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders.

271
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:08,993
The National Party supports

272
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:10,688
militias of the Christian right,

273
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,733
who make open threats against
the refugees.

274
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:14,860
In the South, the refugees
are now armed.

275
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,801
And have the support

276
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:21,206
of much of the country's Muslim
population.

277
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:24,541
But you ...you're a Christian.

278
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,171
We are for peace.

279
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,682
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

280
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:40,261
Nawal!

281
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:43,522
Put the radio!
They've come to close
the University!

282
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,362
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

283
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:03,549
Nawal, come back.

284
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:06,016
Stay here.

285
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:11,618
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

286
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:15,593
There will be clashes.

287
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,928
Stay with me.

288
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:37,815
There is shooting outside ...

289
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,719
To the table, girls!

290
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,759
Mom, they're attacking
the university!

291
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,626
It's not a reason not to eat!

292
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:56,098
Aioua?

293
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:29,606
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

294
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:31,870
May God protect us!

295
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:34,037
That's why they closed
the university.

296
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:37,548
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

297
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:44,023
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

298
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,483
For how long?

299
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:48,220
We start tomorrow.

300
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:51,161
The rest of the family
is already there.

301
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,823
And the school?

302
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:56,335
Anyway, the school will close.

303
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:58,806
Only God knows how long.

304
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,569
And Le Journal?

305
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,900
Don't be afraid.

306
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:06,480
Le Journal can survive without
us for a while.

307
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:10,343
But ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them!

308
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,317
Exactly, Rafqa.

309
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:14,981
Exactly.

310
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,199
There are only two orphanages
in the region.

311
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,205
I will join you soon.

312
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,536
You will not go there now!

313
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:37,710
You had promised Grandma you
would finish your studies.

314
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,405
You heard your father.

315
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,576
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

316
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,054
The studies are finished.

317
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,387
I think of him every day.

318
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,224
That's my child.

319
00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:56,195
I want to find him alive.

320
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:19,791
I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

321
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,223
Hurry, Nawal.

322
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,382
- Your name?
- Nawal.

323
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,886
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

324
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:27,884
Where are you going?

325
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,259
South.

326
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:30,415
What for?

327
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,924
To meet my husband.

328
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:56,377
Wahab.

329
00:43:23,074 --> 00:43:25,474
You have only daughters?

330
00:43:26,077 --> 00:43:28,910
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.

331
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:34,545
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

332
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:08,038
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

333
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,682
There.

334
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:13,587
The children?
Where are the children?

335
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:16,922
You should speak with those
who were there.

336
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:22,496
The muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

337
00:45:22,998 --> 00:45:25,592
They fear reprisals will come.

338
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:29,163
The children may be with them.

339
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,275
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

340
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:43,113
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.

341
00:47:06,673 --> 00:47:08,641
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?

342
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:13,194
I am a Christian.

343
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:27,769
My daughter! My daughter!

344
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:35,813
Mom!

345
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,435
Hi, Simon, it's me!

346
00:55:05,538 --> 00:55:07,335
I am in Mama's village.

347
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:09,270
I wish you were here with me.

348
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,307
Listen.

349
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:35,499
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.

350
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:12,333
I told you never to come here again!

351
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:16,665
Hello!

352
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:19,002
Souha?

353
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:25,520
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

354
00:56:29,892 --> 00:56:32,952
I told you not to say that again!

355
00:56:35,697 --> 00:56:36,686
Hello.

356
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:38,257
Can I help you?

357
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:43,239
Hello.

358
00:56:44,707 --> 00:56:49,041
Does anyone speak French
or English?

359
00:56:49,712 --> 00:56:51,407
Where's Sami?

360
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:02,080
Marhaba!
Marhaba!

361
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:05,151
Hello!
Hello!

362
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:06,284
Hello!

363
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:09,422
(Arabic)

364
00:57:11,735 --> 00:57:13,008
Uh, Jeanne.

365
00:57:19,517 --> 00:57:20,814
Jeanne.

366
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:25,786
Jeanne.

367
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:29,123
Uh ...

368
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:34,754
Thank you.

369
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:53,773
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!

370
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:55,284
Hello.

371
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:57,856
My name is Samia.

372
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,288
I am Jeanne Marwan.

373
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,792
Thank you for helping me.

374
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:05,330
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.

375
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:06,988
Really?

376
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:10,494
Well, I'm from Canada.

377
00:58:11,537 --> 00:58:13,505
I'm looking for Souha.

378
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:15,800
She is Souha.

379
00:58:15,908 --> 00:58:18,638
She is my great-grandmother.

380
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:21,339
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.

381
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:31,052
The people in the corner shop
told me to come see you.

382
00:58:37,498 --> 00:58:39,090
I am looking for my father.

383
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:40,894
His name is Wahab.

384
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,939
Uh ...My mother's name
is Nawal Marwan.

385
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:52,906
She was born here.

386
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:02,412
We do not know her.

387
00:59:03,591 --> 00:59:05,115
Of course you know her.

388
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:14,698
The Marwan family was struck with
shame.

389
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,713
When the war came.

390
00:59:39,629 --> 00:59:41,995
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.

391
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:47,737
She does not know Wahab.

392
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:56,741
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.

393
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:09,783
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter,

394
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:13,988
you're not welcome here.

395
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:15,621
Go home.

396
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:22,036
She is looking for her father,

397
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:25,005
but she doesn't know
who is her mother.

398
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:02,098
<i>I arrived at the end of the massacre
in the Deressa refugee camp.</i>

399
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,475
<i>Everything was burning.</i>

400
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:10,178
<i>I looked for my son amid
waves of blood.</i>

401
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:15,013
<i>I was disheartened by what I saw
and heard.</i>

402
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:18,451
You claim to be against
our enemy.

403
01:03:19,191 --> 01:03:22,388
That does not make you our friend.

404
01:03:23,896 --> 01:03:26,456
Chamseddine. why would
he trust you?

405
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:30,031
My son's father was
a refugee from Deressa.

406
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:32,170
My son has been swallowed
by the war.

407
01:03:33,705 --> 01:03:35,832
I have nothing to lose.

408
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:40,736
My hatred is great toward
the Nationalists.

409
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:45,180
This is not what you wrote
in Charbel's journal.

410
01:03:46,252 --> 01:03:50,746
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage
peace with words and books.

411
01:03:52,325 --> 01:03:53,883
I believed that.

412
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:58,227
Life has taught me
something else.

413
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:02,831
What are you going to do now?

414
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:09,068
Teach the enemy what
life has taught me.

415
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,260
That's goog. That's good.

416
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,267
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.

417
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:14,972
So in French?

418
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,108
I ... I am much better, Dad.

419
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:20,750
They say "a lot" or "best"

420
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:23,581
but never both at the same
time, my darling.

421
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:29,254
I want my son to learn to speak
several languages.

422
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:32,293
I want him to understand others
without an intermediary.

423
01:05:58,723 --> 01:06:01,385
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.

424
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,893
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?

425
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:09,865
My mother is very well.
10:00 o'clock tomorrow.

426
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,666
Tomorrow.

427
01:07:03,224 --> 01:07:04,714
Marhaba.

428
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:30,876
Hello, beautiful.

429
01:07:31,053 --> 01:07:32,145
Good morning.

430
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:34,316
Then you will be going out
with us on Thursday?

431
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:35,478
No.

432
01:07:36,158 --> 01:07:37,090
Friday?

433
01:07:37,259 --> 01:07:38,317
No.

434
01:07:38,493 --> 01:07:39,425
Saturday?

435
01:07:39,594 --> 01:07:40,891
No.

436
01:07:42,464 --> 01:07:44,591
We are patient!

437
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,234
Me too.

438
01:08:00,149 --> 01:08:01,116
Never forget:

439
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:03,275
"Always" is "always".

440
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:06,473
Fucking bitch.

441
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:51,620
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was comdemmed in

442
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:54,661
several reports by Amnesty
International.

443
01:11:03,307 --> 01:11:05,275
Here is the women's section.

444
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:08,505
The cells are larger.

445
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:11,809
Some prisoners remained
there up to 15 years.

446
01:11:21,325 --> 01:11:24,658
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.

447
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:26,626
Just after the war began.

448
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:29,461
They have 600 political
prisoners jailed.

449
01:11:32,203 --> 01:11:33,534
You can come in, eh?

450
01:11:33,672 --> 01:11:35,196
I'll take a picture.

451
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:48,914
You know this woman?

452
01:11:49,854 --> 01:11:50,821
No.

453
01:11:50,922 --> 01:11:53,153
She was imprisoned here.

454
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,085
I don't know her.

455
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,389
It was a really long time
ago, you know? I...

456
01:11:58,531 --> 01:12:01,500
Maybe you know someone
who worked here.

457
01:12:41,476 --> 01:12:42,704
Hello.

458
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:51,111
Hello.

459
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:56,923
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.

460
01:13:00,595 --> 01:13:03,587
I am the school janitor.

461
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:05,632
Yes, but before, what were you?

462
01:13:05,768 --> 01:13:08,168
Before, hum!

463
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:11,170
That was before I became the
school janitor.

464
01:13:11,306 --> 01:13:14,605
It's been a long time since I'm
caretaker of the school.

465
01:13:16,845 --> 01:13:18,779
You know this woman?

466
01:13:18,947 --> 01:13:20,574
She was in Kfar Ryat.

467
01:13:23,519 --> 01:13:26,784
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.

468
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:31,986
I am looking for someone
who knew her.

469
01:13:32,128 --> 01:13:34,596
Someone who could
tell me about her.

470
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,600
This is my mother.

471
01:13:41,805 --> 01:13:44,672
This is the woman who sings.

472
01:13:44,808 --> 01:13:45,934
Number 72.

473
01:13:48,111 --> 01:13:50,545
It was she who murdered the
militia leader

474
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,147
of the christian right.

475
01:13:53,349 --> 01:13:55,511
They made her pay dearly.

476
01:13:55,653 --> 01:13:58,486
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.

477
01:14:03,494 --> 01:14:05,394
They used to call her the
woman who sings

478
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,690
because she sang all the time.

479
01:14:08,799 --> 01:14:10,824
Han, you are sure it's her?

480
01:14:11,902 --> 01:14:14,735
I spent 13 years as a watchman.

481
01:14:16,574 --> 01:14:21,342
Have you ever spent 13 years
overseeing someone?

482
01:14:24,316 --> 01:14:26,876
They did everything
to make her break.

483
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,581
In the end, she was
still standing,

484
01:14:32,724 --> 01:14:34,817
She looked ...

485
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,692
Ah! Never seen anything like it.

486
01:14:37,863 --> 01:14:40,195
She never broke.

487
01:14:40,332 --> 01:14:43,165
It was exasperating.

488
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:53,038
And then they sent Abu Tarek.

489
01:14:53,212 --> 01:14:54,201
Who's that?

490
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,417
Abu Tarek...

491
01:15:07,627 --> 01:15:11,120
You know, sometimes it's better

492
01:15:11,265 --> 01:15:13,790
not to know everything.

493
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:15,902
Sir, I live with it anyway.

494
01:15:16,904 --> 01:15:18,394
Continue.

495
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,134
Abu Tarek...

496
01:15:22,576 --> 01:15:26,068
Abu Tarek was a investigation
specialist.

497
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:28,407
He raped her repeatedly

498
01:15:28,582 --> 01:15:31,483
to break her before being
released.

499
01:15:31,618 --> 01:15:34,417
To stop her from singing.

500
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:41,588
Eventually she became pregnant.

501
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,098
It was like that.

502
01:15:45,266 --> 01:15:47,427
I'll never forget it.

503
01:15:47,602 --> 01:15:51,060
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.

504
01:15:52,974 --> 01:15:54,601
They waited ...

505
01:15:54,742 --> 01:15:57,234
for her to give birth in prison

506
01:15:57,346 --> 01:16:00,315
then they let her go.

507
01:16:03,619 --> 01:16:06,417
The child?
Did you see the child?

508
01:16:08,624 --> 01:16:12,025
There was a doctor who came
sometimes.

509
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:15,121
I think he's crazy.

510
01:16:15,297 --> 01:16:18,630
Others say he has a restaurant
in Tel Aviv ...

511
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:22,303
That's bullshit.

512
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:25,135
He went mad and died.

513
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:28,675
His nurse, I know her.

514
01:16:28,812 --> 01:16:30,973
She lives in Daresh.

515
01:16:34,017 --> 01:16:35,507
In Daresh?

516
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,559
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!

517
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,893
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!

518
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:51,524
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...

519
01:16:52,803 --> 01:16:54,668
Mom, she was raped.

520
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:58,232
Our brother, she had him in prison.

521
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:01,909
I need you here.

522
01:17:18,742 --> 01:17:22,842
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS

523
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:04,533
This, Simon, are notary Amyott
contracts

524
01:20:04,703 --> 01:20:05,692
from 1868 to 1892.

525
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:09,171
His son took over, Édouard,
until 1925.

526
01:20:09,274 --> 01:20:11,606
All the contracts are hand-written.

527
01:20:11,743 --> 01:20:14,507
My grandfather, Charles,
my father, Henry.

528
01:20:14,613 --> 01:20:16,080
And me.

529
01:20:16,215 --> 01:20:18,911
Yeah, well, it stops there
because as you know,

530
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:20,416
I am the last of the Lebel.

531
01:20:20,552 --> 01:20:22,952
I'll show you the
will of a man ...

532
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:27,723
... which took several lives.

533
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:31,929
His heirs have discovered

534
01:20:32,065 --> 01:20:33,896
he had three wives, all
at the same time.

535
01:20:34,033 --> 01:20:35,057
One here, one in Miami,

536
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:37,897
and another in Honduras,
where he did business.

537
01:20:39,305 --> 01:20:43,139
No, no ...he not longer has
three children in the file there, no

538
01:20:43,276 --> 01:20:44,243
There are eight.

539
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,605
That is sport, my man.

540
01:20:48,414 --> 01:20:50,279
Look. Hum!

541
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:54,810
Death is never the
end of a story.

542
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:56,650
There are still traces.

543
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,822
If you want to find
your brother,

544
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:03,395
you'll have to go back into
your mother's past.

545
01:21:03,497 --> 01:21:06,091
Jean, I'm going to fetch my
sister, that's all.

546
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:07,165
I'll take care of that.

547
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:09,496
Two, three small matters
to take care,

548
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:11,104
then it will take no time.

549
01:21:11,272 --> 01:21:13,001
Well, get your business ready

550
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,402
we should go in ...

551
01:21:14,508 --> 01:21:16,409
My passport ...

552
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:19,947
"We"? Don't you worry that
you already done enough already

553
01:21:20,081 --> 01:21:23,278
Exactly, this is not the
time to let you down.

554
01:21:25,253 --> 01:21:26,948
Make a man out of you, Simon.

555
01:21:27,088 --> 01:21:29,283
I know that you need me.

556
01:21:32,093 --> 01:21:33,685
We'll get it, then come back.

557
01:21:33,828 --> 01:21:35,193
I promise.

558
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,355
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan,

559
01:21:37,499 --> 01:21:40,662
a notary is on the order
of the sacred.

560
01:24:36,652 --> 01:24:38,779
Sing now.

561
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,957
Gently, gently.

562
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:51,460
He is coming out.

563
01:25:51,864 --> 01:25:53,263
We can see the head.

564
01:25:53,432 --> 01:25:54,797
Push, push.

565
01:25:55,434 --> 01:25:57,026
Go, girl.

566
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,969
The first came out.

567
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:31,165
Rest now ...

568
01:26:32,272 --> 01:26:33,637
I'm proud of you.

569
01:26:35,575 --> 01:26:37,601
Get ready for the second.

570
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:08,304
Stop.

571
01:27:08,543 --> 01:27:09,874
Stop.

572
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:11,978
What are you doing?

573
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:14,544
You are going to dump them in the
river as usual.

574
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:17,648
- It's dangerous.
- No.

575
01:27:17,786 --> 01:27:21,722
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.

576
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:23,517
I want to take care of them.

577
01:27:23,992 --> 01:27:26,553
These are the children of
the woman who sings.

578
01:27:46,549 --> 01:27:49,678
Oh, this country is a war
zone after another, eh!

579
01:27:49,853 --> 01:27:50,911
It's not complicated.

580
01:27:51,055 --> 01:27:53,546
If the notary had existed
at the time of Noah,

581
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:54,851
we would not be here.

582
01:27:54,992 --> 01:27:57,756
We need only to find the
original contracts.

583
01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:01,524
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.

584
01:28:01,665 --> 01:28:02,654
And we talk more about it.

585
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:04,199
Everyone would be happy.

586
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:07,166
Notaries have existed
only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.

587
01:28:07,271 --> 01:28:08,932
That's the problem.

588
01:28:09,073 --> 01:28:11,200
I should have been here from
the beginning.

589
01:28:11,342 --> 01:28:14,073
Thank you again for your
help, Me Maddad.

590
01:28:14,212 --> 01:28:16,737
The pleasure is all
mine, my dear fellow.

591
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:18,542
I have the result

592
01:28:18,683 --> 01:28:20,617
that you have requested
via email.

593
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:23,380
Simon my file on
the seat beside you.

594
01:28:23,521 --> 01:28:26,354
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?

595
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:29,393
You are very nice, but the
delay and everything ...

596
01:28:29,527 --> 01:28:31,791
I think I'll wait until later.

597
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,124
But I'll summarize.

598
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:34,891
For the father, it is
rather difficult

599
01:28:35,066 --> 01:28:36,966
because I can not find
the death certificate.

600
01:28:37,102 --> 01:28:38,069
For the brother ...

601
01:28:38,203 --> 01:28:40,069
Excuse me, but what
are we talking about here?

602
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:41,900
I asked for help, Simon.

603
01:28:42,074 --> 01:28:44,804
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand

604
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,275
to speed things up.

605
01:28:46,412 --> 01:28:49,711
I told you, Jean,
we came for Jeanne.

606
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:53,745
Your sister is the one person
in your family

607
01:28:53,919 --> 01:28:55,318
easiest to find.

608
01:29:02,495 --> 01:29:04,964
I'm so glad you're here.

609
01:29:05,098 --> 01:29:07,259
Me too.

610
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,775
OK, that's the nurse's name.

611
01:29:15,942 --> 01:29:17,773
which helped your mother give birth
in prison.

612
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:19,469
We can go today.

613
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,778
Jeanne, that's enough.

614
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,619
No, you shut up, then follow me.

615
01:29:26,787 --> 01:29:29,689
It's your job to find our
brother, not mine!

616
01:29:29,824 --> 01:29:32,122
Then, if you don't do it for
her or for you,

617
01:29:32,293 --> 01:29:33,988
the, do it for me!

618
01:29:40,168 --> 01:29:41,965
She is at the American hospital.

619
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:49,872
I'm glad you're here, Jean.

620
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:51,945
Me too, my owl, me too.

621
01:29:53,015 --> 01:29:55,313
If she is sleeping, you must return
later.

622
01:30:19,742 --> 01:30:21,232
Ms. Maika?

623
01:30:50,001 --> 01:30:53,164
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.

624
01:30:53,338 --> 01:30:54,703
Bonjour, Madame!

625
01:30:54,839 --> 01:30:56,329
Thank you for having us.

626
01:30:56,507 --> 01:30:59,340
We seek someone you know.

627
01:30:59,477 --> 01:31:01,707
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?

628
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:32,743
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison
as a nurse?

629
01:31:47,227 --> 01:31:49,525
She says she knows your mom.

630
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,960
You helped our mother
give birth in prison?

631
01:31:57,571 --> 01:31:58,902
Yes.

632
01:32:05,546 --> 01:32:09,243
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.

633
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:10,816
Can you help us?

634
01:32:14,455 --> 01:32:17,788
She worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

635
01:32:18,926 --> 01:32:21,487
She assisted her
during childbirth.

636
01:32:22,931 --> 01:32:24,922
She gathered the children.

637
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,402
Then she gave them back
to the woman who sings

638
01:32:34,509 --> 01:32:36,443
when she got out of prison.

639
01:32:37,646 --> 01:32:39,773
Nawal Marwan gave
birth to twins.

640
01:32:42,684 --> 01:32:44,152
Hush, hush, hush.

641
01:32:46,255 --> 01:32:48,120
Hush, hush, hush.

642
01:36:54,714 --> 01:36:57,376
You really know the
woman who sings?

643
01:36:57,516 --> 01:37:00,542
You don't know what
it means to me.

644
01:37:01,721 --> 01:37:03,689
Nawal Marwan worked for me

645
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:05,381
as a secretary for 18 years.

646
01:37:05,524 --> 01:37:07,754
My wife and I, we had
taken a liking

647
01:37:07,893 --> 01:37:09,383
to her and her children.

648
01:37:10,396 --> 01:37:11,727
But I confess that I

649
01:37:11,897 --> 01:37:14,389
didn't really know her till the end.

650
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:19,231
- Ready?
- Ready.

651
01:37:31,284 --> 01:37:32,774
Hmm ...

652
01:37:34,421 --> 01:37:36,912
Me Maddadi has conducted an
investigation, at my request,

653
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:40,254
to track your brother
and your father.

654
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,394
For the father, Abu Tarek,

655
01:37:47,502 --> 01:37:50,266
I still have not found
a death certificate.

656
01:37:50,438 --> 01:37:52,565
The country has a lot
of certificates missing.

657
01:37:52,673 --> 01:37:54,903
He could have gone abroad.

658
01:37:55,009 --> 01:37:58,308
That's what happened with
this kind of characters.

659
01:37:58,446 --> 01:37:59,845
They are dead or have disappeared.

660
01:37:59,981 --> 01:38:01,107
You have to see.

661
01:38:01,282 --> 01:38:03,444
Maybe it's better that way.

662
01:38:04,486 --> 01:38:06,852
For the brother ...

663
01:38:06,989 --> 01:38:09,287
your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan,

664
01:38:09,424 --> 01:38:11,289
comes from the village
of Der Om.

665
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,692
She gave the child to a midwife
who's named Elham

666
01:38:15,831 --> 01:38:19,631
who herself returned it to
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

667
01:38:19,802 --> 01:38:22,134
in May 1970.

668
01:38:23,472 --> 01:38:26,339
The main task was to
trace the registry records.

669
01:38:26,475 --> 01:38:29,036
Many documents have been
lost in the war.

670
01:38:30,046 --> 01:38:32,640
But I found the records

671
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,046
which were recovered and donated

672
01:38:35,185 --> 01:38:39,315
by the Sisters of Charity
to the National Archives.

673
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:43,152
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham

674
01:38:43,326 --> 01:38:46,159
filed a petition for adoption
of a male child.

675
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:50,960
This is the only boy in the
orphanage filed in that month.

676
01:38:51,067 --> 01:38:52,398
Look.

677
01:38:52,536 --> 01:38:55,699
It was registered under
the name Nihad.

678
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,668
The dates match.

679
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:01,300
That's him.

680
01:39:02,313 --> 01:39:05,476
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.

681
01:39:09,019 --> 01:39:11,010
Orphanage Kfar Kout,

682
01:39:11,155 --> 01:39:12,213
Nihad May.

683
01:39:12,356 --> 01:39:15,416
It's his name in the registry.

684
01:39:15,559 --> 01:39:16,753
Nihad from the month of May.

685
01:39:16,894 --> 01:39:19,329
They gave him a temporary name

686
01:39:19,431 --> 01:39:20,762
with the month of arrival.

687
01:39:20,899 --> 01:39:23,925
There was no adoption
during that period.

688
01:39:24,069 --> 01:39:25,866
It was the beginning of the war.

689
01:39:26,037 --> 01:39:28,767
The orphanage was destroyed
four years later.

690
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:32,703
We must ask those that destroyed
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

691
01:39:32,844 --> 01:39:35,711
to know what happened
to the children.

692
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:41,379
Between you and me, with what
happened in the region ...

693
01:39:42,388 --> 01:39:43,878
there is not much hope.

694
01:39:45,358 --> 01:39:47,383
They are probably also dead.

695
01:39:47,526 --> 01:39:49,585
I'm not saying they're dead.

696
01:39:49,729 --> 01:39:51,856
I say we lost track of them.

697
01:39:53,566 --> 01:39:55,397
They are both dead.

698
01:39:55,534 --> 01:39:57,968
We open the envelopes,
that's it, then.

699
01:39:58,104 --> 01:39:59,935
That I will not allow, Simon.

700
01:40:00,072 --> 01:40:01,903
This kind of thing is sacred.

701
01:40:05,745 --> 01:40:07,941
Luckily, I have a history.

702
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:12,744
Excuse me.

703
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:16,481
It is still worth exploring.

704
01:40:16,623 --> 01:40:19,888
But it is a little radical.

705
01:40:20,928 --> 01:40:21,895
The warlord

706
01:40:21,995 --> 01:40:24,623
that demolished the orphanage
at that time is still alive.

707
01:40:24,765 --> 01:40:26,824
And he may know what happened

708
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:29,162
to Nihad's children and where
they went.

709
01:40:29,303 --> 01:40:30,497
It's already been an eternity.

710
01:40:30,637 --> 01:40:32,299
You must understand

711
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:35,637
that during this period there were
a series of reprisals

712
01:40:35,777 --> 01:40:39,304
which fit one another in
a sort of inexorable logic,

713
01:40:43,284 --> 01:40:45,252
A warlord is exactly

714
01:40:45,353 --> 01:40:47,514
the type of man who
has a long memory.

715
01:40:47,655 --> 01:40:49,987
And he will remember, believe me.

716
01:40:51,426 --> 01:40:53,257
Wallat Chamseddine,

717
01:40:53,361 --> 01:40:54,794
is his name.

718
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:00,466
We can find him here?

719
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:03,594
If we don't find him, he
will find us.

720
01:41:06,475 --> 01:41:08,500
But we can try something.

721
01:41:10,346 --> 01:41:13,008
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

722
01:41:17,019 --> 01:41:18,987
It's your turn.

723
01:41:22,459 --> 01:41:24,188
You will go

724
01:41:24,327 --> 01:41:26,318
to the Deressa refugee camp.

725
01:41:26,496 --> 01:41:27,963
You will come to tea

726
01:41:28,064 --> 01:41:29,326
anywhere in the camp

727
01:41:29,499 --> 01:41:31,364
with the person that invite you.

728
01:41:31,501 --> 01:41:34,493
And you say you are the son
of the woman who sings

729
01:41:34,637 --> 01:41:36,502
and are looking Nihad May.

730
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:38,800
You can not go there alone.

731
01:41:40,076 --> 01:41:42,169
I'll find someone

732
01:41:42,312 --> 01:41:43,836
to accompany you.

733
01:42:05,936 --> 01:42:07,699
Welcome to Deressa.

734
01:43:16,276 --> 01:43:18,107
Ha! Ha! You know where you
are going, Simon?

735
01:43:18,278 --> 01:43:19,677
I know.

736
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,269
How are you?

737
01:43:48,611 --> 01:43:50,101
In the name of God, you've grown!

738
01:43:50,279 --> 01:43:53,043
I have finished my engineering studies.

739
01:43:53,215 --> 01:43:57,845
I cannot find work, so I'm
a taxi driver now.

740
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:00,045
What brings you here?

741
01:44:00,222 --> 01:44:05,285
I am with some foreign visitors, who
asked me to bring them here.

742
01:44:07,163 --> 01:44:09,028
Welcome, come.

743
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:11,530
No, thank you, we're
in a hurry.

744
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,532
Please, come.

745
01:44:18,842 --> 01:44:21,572
He is inviting us to tea.

746
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:22,837
Oh, good!

747
01:44:40,064 --> 01:44:43,898
Uh, I wonder why you have
come to Deressa.

748
01:44:47,038 --> 01:44:49,529
I am looking for someone
named Nihad de Mai.

749
01:44:58,883 --> 01:45:01,876
He does not know Nihad de Mai.

750
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:05,217
He asks me what are your names.

751
01:45:12,564 --> 01:45:15,397
My mother comes from the village
of Der de Om, in the South.

752
01:45:28,648 --> 01:45:30,741
My mother is the woman who sings.

753
01:45:56,143 --> 01:45:58,236
Yes, that's fine. Done.

754
01:46:03,417 --> 01:46:04,975
Wait for what?

755
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,289
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

756
01:46:40,389 --> 01:46:42,721
We are here to offer help.

757
01:46:42,858 --> 01:46:45,156
You will be back in an hour.

758
01:46:46,395 --> 01:46:47,885
Can I tell my sister?

759
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:51,056
No, you'll be back in
an hour, I promise.

760
01:46:52,535 --> 01:46:55,003
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.

761
01:46:57,807 --> 01:46:59,001
He will call.

762
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:00,740
He's going to go.

763
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:04,244
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.

764
01:47:04,381 --> 01:47:07,817
Ah, I told you: the South,
a spark and it exploded.

765
01:47:08,018 --> 01:47:09,417
Oh, okay.

766
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:26,928
You have been luck with us,
we'll help in our own way.

767
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:29,825
You must leave the country.

768
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:31,732
It'll be easier.

769
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:34,339
We will find you a house and a job.

770
01:48:35,275 --> 01:48:38,267
I want your life to be better.

771
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:42,844
We have many contacts
in America.

772
01:48:44,652 --> 01:48:46,847
You gotta go with your children.

773
01:48:47,455 --> 01:48:50,288
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.

774
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:57,124
The children will help
you, you'll see.

775
01:49:03,938 --> 01:49:06,874
You cannot ask me.

776
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:11,008
Your children are our
children, Nawal.

777
01:49:11,179 --> 01:49:13,306
Your family is our family.

778
01:49:13,815 --> 01:49:15,009
Trust me.

779
01:49:16,451 --> 01:49:19,386
I'll help you.

780
01:49:19,554 --> 01:49:22,887
I'm here for you and
your children.

781
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:13,899
Hello, Sarwan.

782
01:50:16,046 --> 01:50:19,709
Excuse my introduction, but
it is for your protection.

783
01:50:21,886 --> 01:50:24,787
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.

784
01:50:27,191 --> 01:50:31,525
Tell me, what can I do to
help, Sarwan Marwan?

785
01:50:33,264 --> 01:50:35,027
You knew my mother.

786
01:50:35,133 --> 01:50:37,761
They say she worked for me.

787
01:50:37,902 --> 01:50:40,928
What can I do to help?

788
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:48,243
I am looking for a
man named Nihad de Mai.

789
01:50:49,281 --> 01:50:51,408
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?

790
01:50:53,419 --> 01:50:54,477
He's my brother.

791
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:57,111
My mother asked me to find him.

792
01:50:58,824 --> 01:51:00,655
And how can you prove that

793
01:51:00,793 --> 01:51:03,819
Nihad de Mai is the son
of Nawal Marwan?

794
01:51:06,599 --> 01:51:08,396
My brother was
placed for adoption

795
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,264
at the Kfar Kout orphanage.

796
01:51:11,605 --> 01:51:14,574
We found the registry with
the original file.

797
01:51:15,575 --> 01:51:17,236
The dates ... Everything fits.

798
01:51:17,344 --> 01:51:19,574
Nihad de Mai is my brother.

799
01:52:02,824 --> 01:52:04,883
Me and my friends, we attacked

800
01:52:05,027 --> 01:52:07,359
the christian village at Kfar Kout ...

801
01:52:08,363 --> 01:52:09,830
In response to attacks

802
01:52:09,998 --> 01:52:12,831
that our brothers, the refugees,
were victims of.

803
01:52:14,469 --> 01:52:17,563
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Kout.

804
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:20,699
I saved the children.

805
01:52:20,842 --> 01:52:22,970
I took them with us.

806
01:52:23,079 --> 01:52:25,980
And Nihad was among them.

807
01:52:26,082 --> 01:52:28,016
We have trained and prepared

808
01:52:28,184 --> 01:52:30,379
them so that they can fight
alongside us.

809
01:52:31,587 --> 01:52:33,851
Nihad, he had a gift.

810
01:52:34,023 --> 01:52:36,514
He was at unique.

811
01:52:36,693 --> 01:52:39,856
And soon it became a
formidable fencer.

812
01:52:41,164 --> 01:52:45,692
But he wanted to
find her mother.

813
01:52:45,868 --> 01:52:47,837
He sought her for a long time.

814
01:52:49,273 --> 01:52:52,538
Nihad, I do not know what
he saw or heard.

815
01:52:53,544 --> 01:52:55,034
He started ...

816
01:52:56,213 --> 01:52:58,545
a crazy war.

817
01:52:58,716 --> 01:53:02,618
He came to see me, he
wanted to be a martyr

818
01:53:02,753 --> 01:53:05,221
so that his mother should see
his picture everywhere

819
01:53:05,389 --> 01:53:06,686
on the walls around the country.

820
01:53:07,925 --> 01:53:09,552
But I refused.

821
01:53:11,462 --> 01:53:13,454
He went back to Daresh.

822
01:53:14,532 --> 01:53:16,693
He became a maverick,

823
01:53:16,801 --> 01:53:19,065
one of the most dangerous  in the region.

824
01:53:19,237 --> 01:53:20,431
A real machine.

825
01:53:20,572 --> 01:53:22,437
He pulls on everyone.

826
01:53:22,574 --> 01:53:26,977
And then there was the
enemy invasion.

827
01:53:28,379 --> 01:53:29,869
And one morning ...

828
01:53:30,882 --> 01:53:32,816
They captured Nihad.

829
01:53:32,951 --> 01:53:34,748
He killed seven gunmen.

830
01:53:36,822 --> 01:53:38,585
They did not killed them.

831
01:53:38,724 --> 01:53:40,089
They captured him

832
01:53:40,226 --> 01:53:42,922
and sent him to the prison
in Kfar Ryat.

833
01:53:44,296 --> 01:53:45,991
He has been in prison?

834
01:53:46,132 --> 01:53:47,599
Yes.

835
01:53:49,969 --> 01:53:51,402
He is the executioner.

836
01:53:53,572 --> 01:53:55,472
He worked with my father?

837
01:53:55,608 --> 01:53:57,576
- No, he did not work

838
01:53:57,676 --> 01:53:59,610
with Abu Tarek, your father.

839
01:54:28,643 --> 01:54:30,110
- Are you okay?

840
01:54:34,782 --> 01:54:36,272
One plus one ...

841
01:54:37,285 --> 01:54:39,150
that makes two.

842
01:54:39,287 --> 01:54:40,777
What?

843
01:54:43,825 --> 01:54:45,884
One plus one makes two.

844
01:54:46,894 --> 01:54:48,384
You can not make one.

845
01:54:55,003 --> 01:54:56,800
Hey, you have a fever.

846
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:00,698
Jeanne?

847
01:55:02,578 --> 01:55:05,206
One plus one, does it make one?

848
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:28,735
Are there are empty seats, no.

849
01:55:28,872 --> 01:55:30,203
Oh, move ahead if you want.

850
01:56:58,999 --> 01:57:01,365
Can I help you, ma'am?

851
01:57:09,509 --> 01:57:11,477
Excuse me.

852
01:58:21,851 --> 01:58:24,217
<i>By becoming a hangman</i>

853
01:58:24,354 --> 01:58:26,845
<i>your brother has changed
its name.</i>

854
01:58:26,956 --> 01:58:29,516
<i>He became Abu Tarek.</i>

855
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:35,399
<i>Nihad de Mai is Abu Tarek.</i>

856
01:58:39,637 --> 01:58:42,105
<i>We know that he now lives in Canada</i>

857
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:44,264
<i>under a new identity.</i>

858
01:58:44,408 --> 01:58:46,899
<i>Nihad Harmanni.</i>

859
01:59:25,418 --> 01:59:26,908
Mr. Harmanni?

860
01:59:30,156 --> 01:59:31,123
Yes?

861
01:59:38,631 --> 01:59:40,121
This is for you.

862
02:00:26,147 --> 02:00:28,843
<i>My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.</i>

863
02:00:29,017 --> 02:00:30,575
<i>I recognized you.</i>

864
02:00:30,718 --> 02:00:33,346
<i>But you didn't.</i>

865
02:00:33,521 --> 02:00:35,387
<i>It's a wonderful miracle.</i>

866
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:37,185
<i>I'm your number 72.</i>

867
02:00:37,326 --> 02:00:41,592
<i>This letter will be delivered
by our children.</i>

868
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:43,721
<i>You will not recognize them</i>

869
02:00:43,866 --> 02:00:45,697
<i>because they are beautiful,</i>

870
02:00:45,868 --> 02:00:48,200
<i>but they know who you are.</i>

871
02:00:56,879 --> 02:00:59,110
<i>Through them, I want to tell you</i>

872
02:00:59,249 --> 02:01:01,217
<i>you're still alive.</i>

873
02:01:01,384 --> 02:01:03,375
<i>But soon, you'll be quiet.</i>

874
02:01:03,553 --> 02:01:05,043
<i>I know.</i>

875
02:01:06,389 --> 02:01:09,051
<i>Because silence is
all to the truth.</i>

876
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:13,120
<i>Signed: The whore 72.</i>

877
02:01:26,777 --> 02:01:29,439
<i>I speak to my son.</i>

878
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:31,605
<i>I am not talking to
the executioner.</i>

879
02:01:31,749 --> 02:01:34,718
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

880
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:40,052
<i>That's the promise I made you
at birth, my son.</i>

881
02:01:40,157 --> 02:01:43,422
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

882
02:01:44,562 --> 02:01:46,962
<i>I've searched my whole life.</i>

883
02:01:47,098 --> 02:01:49,590
<i>I found you.</i>

884
02:01:49,735 --> 02:01:53,262
<i>You, you could not recognize me.</i>

885
02:01:53,438 --> 02:01:56,236
<i>You have your tattoo
on the right heel.</i>

886
02:01:56,341 --> 02:01:57,740
<i>I've seen it.</i>

887
02:01:57,843 --> 02:01:58,901
<i>I recognized you.</i>

888
02:02:00,412 --> 02:02:02,846
<i>And I found you beautiful.</i>

889
02:02:02,981 --> 02:02:06,348
<i>I'll remember you with all the
sweetness of the world, my love.</i>

890
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:09,977
<i>Console yourself because nothing
is more beautiful</i>

891
02:02:10,122 --> 02:02:11,783
<i>than being together.</i>

892
02:02:11,957 --> 02:02:13,619
<i>You were born of love.</i>

893
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,094
<i>Your brother and your sister
were also born of love.</i>

894
02:02:19,766 --> 02:02:23,133
<i>Nothing is more beautiful
than to be together.</i>

895
02:02:23,303 --> 02:02:26,295
<i>Your mother, Nawal Marwan.</i>

896
02:02:27,307 --> 02:02:29,673
<i>Prisoner number 72.</i>

897
02:02:37,985 --> 02:02:40,044
"When these envelopes
have been handed

898
02:02:40,187 --> 02:02:41,552
"to the addressee,

899
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:43,316
"You will be given a letter."

900
02:02:43,457 --> 02:02:44,651
"The silence will be broken,

"A stone may then be placed
on my grave,

903

the stone facing the sun."

904
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,353
<i>My love ...</i>

905
02:03:15,523 --> 02:03:17,423
<i>Where did your story begin?</i>

906
02:03:18,693 --> 02:03:21,355
<i>When you were born?</i>

907
02:03:21,529 --> 02:03:23,724
<i>Then she starts in horror.</i>

908
02:03:24,933 --> 02:03:28,062
<i>At the birth of your father?</i>

909
02:03:28,204 --> 02:03:31,401
<i>Then she begins a
great love story.</i>

910
02:03:33,442 --> 02:03:36,934
<i>I say that your story
begins with a promise</i>

911
02:03:37,079 --> 02:03:39,513
<i>that will break
the thread of anger.</i>

912
02:03:41,384 --> 02:03:44,717
<i>Thanks to you, today I finally
managed to do it.</i>

913
02:03:44,887 --> 02:03:46,855
<i>The thread is broken.</i>

914
02:03:46,956 --> 02:03:49,891
<i>And I can finally take
the time to rock you in my arms...</i>

915
02:03:51,261 --> 02:03:53,422
and softly sing you a lullaby

916

<i>to comfort you.</i>

917

918
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:01,560
<i>I love you.</i>

919
02:04:02,939 --> 02:04:06,102
<i>Your mother, Nawal.</i>
