TO TRY AND GET A LOAN

283
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,404
WHAT'S THE PROPERTY WORTH?

- OH, YEAH.

286
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,747
MR. BARNES,
I BELIEVE THERE'S

287
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,615
TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD.

288
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,684
OWNERS AND RENTERS.

289
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,320
I WANNA OWN SOMETHING.

290
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,023
- AND WHY IS IT
THAT YOU WANNA OWN

291
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,492
THE MARYLAND CUP
FACTORY BUILDING?

292
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,293
I MEAN, THAT PLACE
IS BARELY STANDING.

293
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,230
- IT'S LOCATION.
LOCATION, MR. BARNES.

294
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,098
THERE'S NO PLACE
ALONG THE HARBOR

295
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,667
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO
FOR BIG CRABS AND LIVE MUSIC.

296
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,504
WE'RE GONNA RESTORE THE FEELING
OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE

297
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,272
BACK IN THE '50s.

298
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,208
LIKE THE WAY OUR PARENTS
USED TO DO IT.

299
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,344
I GET THE BEST CRABS
FOR THE CHEAPEST PRICE.

300
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,412
- HOW SO?

301
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,680
- IT'S ALL IN THE PLAN.

302
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,652
- "ALL IN THE PLAN."

303
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,795
I DON'T KNOW, YOU REALLY THINK
WE NEED ANOTHER CRAB SHACK?

304
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,597
THERE'S GOTTA BE 100 OF 'EM
IN BALTIMORE ALONE, HUH?

305
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,399
- IT'S NOT ONLY CRABS.

306
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,768
I MEAN, WE'RE CREATING
AN EXPERIENCE

307
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,604
WHERE YOU GET TO CELEBRATE
LIFE'S GREATEST MOMENTS.

308
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:57,108
ANYTHING FROM WEDDINGS,
PROMS, CONCERTS.

309
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,346
WE COULD EVEN HAVE
BAR MITZVAHS THERE.

310
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,283
- WELL...

311
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:09,720
YOUR...CREDIT REPORT
SEEMS TO BE...

312
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,192
GOOD.

313
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,299
YOUR BUSINESS PLAN IS...

314
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,734
INTRIGUING.

315
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,304

316
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,772

MAN, NOW,

796
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,563
- WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DIDN'T
THEY GIVE US THE MONEY?

797
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,867

804
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,948

805
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,617
I TOLD YOU WHAT TO DO!

806
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,319
I TOLD YOU WHAT TO DO!
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO WHAT I SAID?

807
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,188

808
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,056
- MAN, YOUR MAMA
DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU!

809
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,359

WE WAS JUST PLAYING A GAME.

836
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:35,271
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HURT
IN ANY KINDA WAY, HAVE YOU?

837
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,642

- I'M REALLY TIRED,
I'M GOING HOME.

841
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,455
- WE AIN'T GOT NO HOME, MAN.

842
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,276
YOUR GRANDMOTHER--
SHE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOU.

843
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,051
I'M ALL YOU GOT.

844
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,186

WHY YOU HIT ME

845
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:29,091
AND PUT ME
THROUGH ALL THIS TODAY?

846
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,163

847
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:40,369
PEOPLE I THOUGHT I TRUSTED, MAN,
I CAN'T TRUST--

848
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,239
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY--

849
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:44,740
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

850
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:50,546
I DON'T KNOW.
TELLING YOU, I DON'T KNOW.

851
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,483
- THEN WHY'D YOU SAY THAT
ABOUT MY MOTHER?

852
00:50:55,752 --> 00:51:01,323
- I LOVE YOUR MOTHER.

853
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:06,295
I LOVE YOU TOO, MAN.

854
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,766

00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,866

00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,237
- TONIGHT.

861
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,766
- THAT ONE'S GONE.

862
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,403
BALTIMORE'S
A BEAUTIFUL CITY, MAN.

863
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,906
- YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE YOU'RE FROM HERE, RIGHT?

864
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:25,841
- [chuckling]
NAW, I LOVE THIS PLACE, MAN.

865
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:29,211
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

866
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:32,715
- UGH.

867
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:35,417
- SEE THAT BUILDING
RIGHT THERE?

868
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:37,219
- WHERE? RIGHT THERE?

869
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,755
- YEAH, THE WHITE ONE.

870
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:42,558
THAT'S MY GAME CHANGER.

871
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,728
THAT'S IT.

872
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,696
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

873
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:51,700
WHEN I SEE MY MOTHER,
I'MA TAKE HER OUT TO FAIDLEY'S.

874
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:54,203
YEAH. I'M GONNA
GET HER EVERYTHING.

875
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,472
FATTEST CRABS
YOU COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF.

876
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,541
SHRIMP, CRAB CAKES.

877
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:02,745
- BET YOUR MOTHER'LL
LOVE THAT.

878
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:06,949
YOU KNOW, A LONG TIME AGO,
A BOAT SAILED THIS HARBOR...

879
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,621
WITH A YOUNG SLAVE.

880
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:17,293
HE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE.

881
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:18,761
HE WAS SPECIAL, THOUGH,

882
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:21,330
'CAUSE HE TAUGHT HIMSELF
HOW TO READ AND WRITE.

883
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:25,701
HE TAUGHT OTHER SLAVES
HOW TO READ AND WRITE TOO.

884
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,505
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT?
- YEAH.

885
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:32,308
FREDERICK DOUGLASS.

886
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,543
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?

887
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,313
- WE LEARNED ABOUT HIM
IN SCHOOL.

888
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:40,316
HISTORY CLASS.

889
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,817
- OH, THAT'S TIGHT.

890
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,786
IT'S GOOD THEY TEACHING
Y'ALL THAT.

891
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:47,356
- YEAH.

892
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:49,658
SO ANYTIME
YOU START FEELING LIKE...

893
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,895
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT...

894
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:56,865
THINK ABOUT YOUR ANCESTORS.

895
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:01,704
THAT'S WHAT'S IN YOUR SPIRIT.
YOU HEAR?

896
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,875
- THINK MA
STILL LOOKS THE SAME?

897
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:10,312
- BET SHE LOOK BETTER.

898
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,463
- NO WORD ON
WHO PUT OUT THE HIT.

899
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,031
COULD BE FISH.

900
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,500
COULD'VE BEEN JAMISON HIMSELF.

901
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,403
UH...AND THEN THERE'S
LITTLE BABY.

902
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:39,575
- I KNOW HE GOT PROBLEMS
WITH ME.

903
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:42,444
BUT HE AIN'T GONNA TRY
TO GET ME KILLED

904
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,979
UNLESS FISH SAY SO.

905
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,915
THIS GODDAMN BAG--IT'S A NOOSE
AROUND MY NECK.

906
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,585
I GOTTA GET IT OFF.

907
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,587
SO WE IN BUSINESS?

908
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,656
- LOOK, I'MA TELL YOU.

909
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:57,426
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD
GETTING THESE YOUNG BOYS

910
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:00,362
TO BUY FROM SOMEBODY
THEY AIN'T FAMILIAR WITH.

911
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:04,066
ENOCH IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE
OF GETTING ANY MONEY TONIGHT.

912
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,035
- MAN, I DON'T FUCK
WITH YO LIKE THAT.

913
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:08,404
HE PROBABLY KNOW WHO I AM.

914
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:10,773
SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
YOU TRYING TO PUT ME IN THAT.

915
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,875
- WHAT'S YOU BEEFIN'
WITH ENOCH FOR, UNC?

916
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:15,077
- HIS LITTLE BROTHER, MAN,

917
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,646
HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO DO TOO MUCH.

918
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,949
HE TRIED TO MOVE IN
ON SOME OF MY CORNERS.

919
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,785
THEN HE GOT KILLED.

920
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:25,087
AND ENOCH HEARD THAT I DID IT.
- OH, COME ON.

921
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,822
HE DON'T KNOW WHO YOU IS.

922
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,691
YOU KNOW, YOU AIN'T NEVER
CROSSED PATHS.

923
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:30,759
- MAN, WHAT TYPE OF GAMES
YOU TRYING TO PLAY WITH ME?

924
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,528
- NOW, HOLD,
HOLD RIGHT THERE NOW, HOLD.

925
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,597
NOW, I AIN'T TRYING
TO PLAY NO GAME.

926
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,500
NOW, I OWE ENOCH SOME MONEY.

927
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,737
HE TOLD ME IF HE CAN GET
THE SHIT ON DISCOUNT,

928
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,439
HE'D WIPE THE SLATE.

929
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,074
- SEE THAT'S THAT BULLSHIT
RIGHT THERE, MAN.

930
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:47,409
- AIN'T NO BULLSHIT.
YOU TAKING THIS SHIT ALL WRONG.

931
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,478
I MEAN, LISTEN.
ENOCH IS A BUSINESSMAN.

932
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,780
ALL HE CARE ABOUT
IS HIS SCRATCH, HIS MONEY.

933
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,115
HE AIN'T THINKING ABOUT YOU.

934
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,684
- I'LL SELL IT FOR YOU.

935
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,624
I KNOW WHAT'S UP.

936
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,361
- YOU KNOW ENOCH?

937
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:06,929
- NO, BUT WHAT I DO KNOW--

938
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,665
AIN'T NOBODY WALKING UP
ON THE CORNERS OF PARK HEIGHTS

939
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:13,969
WITHOUT HIS SAY-SO.

940
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,572
HE DON'T KNOW ME.

941
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,144
- SHIT.

942
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:26,081
BOY'S GOT A POINT.

943
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:30,652
IF HE CAN KEEP
THE FOCUS ON HIM...

944
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:35,157
THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE Y'ALL
CAN WALK OUT OF THERE WITHOUT--

945
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,661
WITHOUT HIM NOTICING YOU.

946
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:42,664
- YO, YOU WANT THE MONEY
OR NOT?

947
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,883
- 40,000.

948
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:03,652
THEY GONNA TRY TO CUT YOU SHORT.

1110
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:26,507
I BEEN COOKING LIVE CRABS

01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,576
YOU BEST BELIEVE

1112
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:31,946
THEM LITTLE BITCHES KNOW
WHEN THE HOT WATER'S COMING.

1113
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:34,382
- YOUNG WOODY,
HE'S LYING TO YOU.

1114
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:37,685
TELL YOU HOW HE GOT THOSE SCARS,
IS HIS EX-WIFE CHASING HIM

1115
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,755
DOWN SOUTH BALTIMORE WITH
A SWITCHBLADE AFTER HIS ASS.

1116
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:43,658
- I'M TRYING TO TELL HIM
LIKE IT IS.

1117
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,793
A BOY DESERVES THAT.

- WE ALL DO.

1119

1121
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,710
- LITTLE PUNK LISTENED
TO ANYTHING I TELL HIM.

1122
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,445
- YEAH, THAT TIME
YOU TOLD HIM

1123
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:07,882
HE HAD TO EAT
THE WHOLE CRAB SHELL.

1124
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,952
- HIS CRAZY ASS
TRIED TO EAT IT.

1125
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:13,521
- YEAH.

1126
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:17,158
THERE WAS A TIME YOUR WORD
MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME.

1127
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,596
- YEAH, WELL...

1128
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:24,799

01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:27,602
- THAT REALLY WORKED OUT.

1130
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:30,671
- COME ON, VINCENT,
LET IT GO.

1131
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:33,875
- I TREATED YOU
LIKE YOU WERE ONE OF MY SONS.

1132
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:36,811
- YOU WERE ALWAYS TALKING
THAT FAMILY SHIT.

1133
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:40,114
YOU DON'T REALLY LOOK OUT
FOR NOBODY BUT YOU.

1134
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,116
- HMM.

1135
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:47,155
THIS PARANOIA'S EATING AT YOU
LIKE CANCER.

1136
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:50,858
I AIN'T YOUR ENEMY, SON.
- WHO MY MOTHERFUCKIN' ENEMY?

1137
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,462
'CAUSE JAMISON AIN'T HAD
NO MOTHERFUCKIN' MONEY.

1138
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:56,597
SO WHO MY ENEMY?

1139
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:59,734

A LONG TIME AGO...

1140
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:02,003
IF I REALLY WANTED TO.

1141
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,771
- HEY, COME ON.

01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,040
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN

ALL THOSE SIDE DEALS

1146

1147
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,240
I AIN'T NO THIEF.

1148
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:43,711
- FOR YEARS,
I LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

1149
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:52,720
YOU THINK I'M STUPID, V?

1150
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:55,690
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING DOWN...
