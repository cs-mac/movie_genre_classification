12
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,313
       - [Voiceover] Eh!        

13
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,882
     That's a gun asshole.      

14
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,159
      What the fuck are         
      you doing here, huh?      

15
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,462
 This can't be no coincidence.  

16
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,364
         Who sent you?          

17
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,299
         Who sent you?          

18
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,703
    Nobody in this town         
    crosses Lorenzo, no one.    

19
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,938
       You're a dead man!       

20
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,274
           (gunshot)

24
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,688
             - Hey!             

25
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,390
              Hey!              

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,558
              Hey!              

27
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,692
           You, you!            

28
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,227
         Motherfucker!          

29
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,662
       (tires squealing)

      (cell phone ringing)      

34
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,823
            - Hello?            

35
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,757
         - [Thief] Roy?         

36
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,826
      - Jimmy, what's up?       

37
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,327
       - Things went bad        
       man, really bad.         

38
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,562
         - Hey hold on.         

39
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,830
      What happened, now        
      do you have the car?      

40
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:25,831
      - Yea I got the car,      
      but what the fuck         

41
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,832
      did you get me into?      

42
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,700
    - Hey, now take it easy.    

43
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,836
  Now, tell me what happened.   

44
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,903
 - I did exactly what you said! 

45
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,605
 I was there within the window. 

46
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,524
 And then some guys show's up,  

47
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,442
  puts a gun in my face, and    
  you guaranteed me that time!  

48
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,711
      - But you got away?       

49
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,747
 - Yea I got away but I had     
 to stab the dude in the neck!  

50
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,783
   I boost cars, I don't stab   
   motherfuckers in the neck!   

51
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,018
      - Okay, now listen.       

52
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,387
        We can fix this.        

53
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,957
    But, you got to bring       
    the car to the location.    

54
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,891
      I'll meet you there.      

55
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,394
        - Who's Lorenzo?        

56
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,562
    (ominous ambient music)     

57
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,697
  - How do you know that name?  

58
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,898
          - Who is he?          

59
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,500
    Roy, you fucked me man!     

60
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,901
   - Now Jimmy, you knew this   
   was going to be risky.       

61
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,354
         Now trust me.          

62
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,772
     You don't want to fuck     
     with these people.         

63
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,707
       If you bring us          
       the car right now,       

64
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,841
        I can fix this.         

65
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,576
          - Fuck you!           

66
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,878
           Who's us?            

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,946
      You fucked me man,        
      you knew those guys       

68
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:15,847
    were going to be there.     

69
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,982
         You set me up!         

70
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,551
   - Think about this Jimmy.    

71
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,687
      This is going to be       
      the most important        

72
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,021
       move of your life.       

73
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,024
  It's bad enough you have one  
  gangster out to kill you.     

74
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,000
             Jimmy.             

75
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,468
             Jimmy!             

76
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,636
         (phone beeps)          

77
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:44,609
    (dramatic ambient music)    

78
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,667
    (ominous ambient music)     

79
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,016
             (bang)             

80
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,022
   (upbeat synthesizer music)   

81
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,107
         (engine roars)         

82
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,746
       (heavy breathing)        

83
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,715
  - Detroit's a single mother   

84
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,251
    living in a trailer park    
    with a baby on her hip.     

85
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,087
      And L.A.'s a porn         
      star with fake tits,      

86
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,290
       deep pockets, and        
       a coke problem.          

87
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,126
    Everybody comes out         
    here to find something.     

88
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,595
  Or run away from something.   

89
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,597
        I'm doing both.         

90
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,266
      Figured it was my         
      environment that was      

91
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,235
      making me who I was.      

92
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,237
When you fuck around like this, 

93
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,739
      doesn't matter what       
      city you live in.         

94
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,942
        Sooner of later,        

95
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,778
things are bound to get bloody. 

96
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,814
        Rule number one.        

97
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,216
    Stay away from cars less    
    than five years old.        

98
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,118
       I usually go for         
       Toyotas or Hondas.       

99
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,087
The Japs know how to make cars. 

100
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,157
       Rule number two,         
       stay away from any       

101
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,992
  high-end luxury sports cars,  

102
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,895
      Mercedes, BMW, Audi.      

103
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,997
        Sure, the payout        
        might be higher,        

104
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,231
    but then so is the risk.    

105
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,835
       Rule number three.       

106
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,605
     Mental focus, it's         
     all about the breath.      

107
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,374
 (steady deliberate breathing)  

108
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,610
    Keeping your head           
    clear, and being present    

109
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,978
is of paramount importance when 

110
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,245
     a boost is going down.     

111
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,148
    I started this when I       
    was young and desperate     

112
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,284
      and bored, but I          
      had a talent for it.      

113
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,353
    On my best days, I would    
    say it's a calling.         

114
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,089
   Not like the other           
   fuckos who joyride around    

115
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,223
         and abuse it.          

116
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,293
     And yes, if you aren't     
     a moron, being a thief     

117
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,861
      ain't so dangerous.       

118
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,230
    But this is my practice,    
    this is my discipline.      

119
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,735
     Rule number four,          
     perception is reality.     

120
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,103
   You'd be amazing with        
   what you can get away with   

121
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,371
if you look like you're working.

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,740
       But I am working.        

123
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,243
    Rule number five, you       
    pick the day in advance,    

124
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,378
        but not the car.        

125
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,047
    Picking the car is          
    like deciding if you're     

126
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,915
      going to go talk to       
      a girl at the bar.        

127
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,385
It's a frequency you tune into. 

128
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,987
You can call it a gut instinct, 

129
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,223
 for me, it's been like a       
 wave at the back of my spine.  

130
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,691
      And I don't know if       
      it's the excitement       

131
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,660
       of the unknown,          
       or the adrenaline,       

132
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,328
     but it's never wrong.      

133
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,032
    I guess deep down, it's     
    the part I like best.       

134
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,202
     I've stolen 336 cars       
     in the last 10 years,      

135
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,938
and this whooptie maked it 337. 

136
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,443
   Rule six, you never          
   trust anyone in the game.    

137
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,377
             Ever.              

138
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,414
      And one last thing,       

139
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,784
    always know your price.     

140
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,919
    My name is Jimmy Greco.     

141
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,889
     And this is the story      
     of the day I died.         

142
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,058
        (dramatic bass)         

143
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,897
      (gentle piano music)      

144
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,267
       (knocking on door)       

145
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,877
         Good morning.          

146
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,746
        - Good morning.         

147
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,014
          - Surprise.           

148
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,093
      - [Girl] Do all guys      
      from the East Coast       

149
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,394
     put it down like you?      

150
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,831
- [Jimmy] I'm from Detroit baby.

151
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,399
           (laughter)           

152
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,968
       - That's basically       
       the East Coast.          

153
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,771
     - [Jimmy] Not really.      

154
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,842
 - Well it's closer to New      
 York than it is to California. 

155
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,443
            - True.             

156
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,011
           (laughter)           

157
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,047
      But the answer's no.      

158
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,817
           - No what?           

159
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,020
   - [Jimmy] No, not all guys   
   from the East are like me.   

160
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,391
    Want to know the reason     
    it feels so good?           

161
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,528
             - Why?             

162
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,929
      - 'Cause I love you.      

163
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,068
        - Careful Jimmy.        

164
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,440
     - You're the one that      
     needs to be careful.       

165
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,042
I'm fine expressing my emotions.

166
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,311
     I know what it means.      

167
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,479
       - Is that a fact?        

168
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,516
    - I could die tomorrow,     
    and then what?              

169
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,419
      Think any of this         
      is going to matter?       

170
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,322
        We're dust baby.        

171
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,059
  - We're not just dust Jimmy.  

172
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,328
      We're human beings.       

173
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,298
      - But it's our human      
      minds that assign         

174
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,133
     meaning to our lives.      

175
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,036
  I fucking love you, so what?  

176
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,438
       What are you going       
       to do about it?          

177
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,907
        - How romantic.         

178
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,144
  I'll think about that while   
  I make your breakfast.        

179
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,915
- Brew the coffee strong please.

180
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,350
    (ominous ambient music)     

181
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,019
   - I know how you like it.    

182
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,522
        (distorted bass)        

183
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,425
       - [Voiceover] Shit       
       is fucking good!         

184
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,363
- [Voiceover] Yea, it's not bad.

185
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,334
     - [Voiceover] Not bad?     

186
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,401
 It's way better then anything  
 else out there right now.      

187
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,970
       - [Voiceover] So?        

188
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,505
    Doesn't make it amazing     
    just 'cause it's better     

189
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,106
       than all the other       
       shit out there.          

190
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,143
    - Babe, this negativity     
    is really off putting.      

191
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,978
     I mean yea, we finally     
     get some good shit,        

192
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,479
     and you're over there.     

193
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,884
 I totally forgot this fucking  
 monkey was sitting here.       

194
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,487
         What's up man?         

195
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,523
    Hmm, you got the money?     

196
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,894
     Maybe I'll just bleed      
     you out instead.           

197
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,364
      - It's okay Gevorg.       

198
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,334
       Baby, nobody's           
       getting cut today.       

199
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,871
   Too messy, I'm in no mood.   

200
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,645
            - Fine.             

201
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,951
      Why the fuck are you      
      still sitting here?       

202
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,592
    (ominous ambient music)     

203
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,431
         - [Roy] Hola!          

204
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,933
    - Yo, what the fuck man?    

205
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,534
         - Como estas?          

206
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,571
     - [Boy] Yo, I told you     
     not to come out here       

207
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,273
   without calling me first.    

208
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,540
           (laughter)           

209
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,042
     - Hey you think I          
     give a shit about your     

210
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,244
       chavalos and your        
       powder pushing?          

211
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,580
  - Do all you fucking beaners  
  got maize in your ears?       

212
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,917
    Or is it just you, huh?     

213
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,152
       - Let me tell you        
       something, loco.         

214
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,022
      You keep pushing me,      

215
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,124
      you're not going to       
      like what happens.        

216
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,362
    - Fuck you going to do?     

217
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:37,001
  - How about, I call some of   
  my cartel boys down here,     

218
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,637
   to rape your little slut,    

219
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,442
     gouge your eyes out,       
     watch you peck around      

220
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,678
 like a fucking blind chicken.  

221
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:51,582
        (pecking noises)        

222
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,422
Hey, come on, lighten up, loco! 

223
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,224
     Shit, I called you, I      
     left a message, read?      

224
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,626
   You never got back to me.    

225
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,461
 So I came down here in person, 

226
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,031
    to discuss some             
    time-sensitive business.    

227
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,502
- Fucking blow got me all jumpy.

228
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,204
           (laughter)           

229
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,639
   What the fuck do you want?   

230
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,740
         Make it quick.         

231
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:19,043
    - How would you like to     
    expand your business?       

232
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,579
- Well you know I would love to,

233
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,348
   but Lorenzo runs the show.   

234
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,183
    I'm already at              
    capacity, in accordance     

235
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,751
      with our agreement.       

236
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,619
            (snorts)            

237
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,555
   - [Roy] What if Lorenzo's    
   not around anymore?          

238
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,157
      - What if, what if?       

239
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,360
            What if?            

240
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,998
     - Some shit's getting      
     ready to go down.          

241
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,304
        - I'm listening.        

242
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,139
       - The question is,       
       how much would you       

243
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,142
       be willing to pay        
       to get in on it?         

244
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,746
             - Huh.             

245
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,487
     Since you seem to be       
     the man with the plan,     

246
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,055
       why don't you save       
       us both the time         

247
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,656
    and let me know how much    
    it's going to cost me?      

248
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,725
        - I'm not sure.         

249
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,528
      I'm going to have to      
      talk to my best guy.      

250
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,063
      And then double it.       

251
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,768
- Yea, why do we need the best? 

252
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,105
      - Word is, Lorenzo's      
      dying, amigo.             

253
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,407
       He needs a kidney.       

254
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,542
  - Yea, how do you know this?  

255
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,446
    - Because birdies           
    talk, and birdies sing.     

256
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,647
           (laughter)           

257
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,550
       And then Big Tommy       
       pays me a visit.         

258
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,318
    (ominous ambient music)     

259
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,653
        Yea, well well.         

260
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,089
     - Don't start with         
     me bro, I'd prefer to      

261
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,491
     make this as painless      
     as possible, alright?      

262
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,360
 - Good to see you old friend.  

263
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,097
      - We're not friends       
      anymore, are we Roy?      

264
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,534
       - Well, since your       
       little accident.         

265
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,071
  - I'm here to talk business.  

266
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,839
         - Okay, well,          

267
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,375
    how about a little drink    
    for old time's sake?        

268
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,579
             - No.              

269
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,082
       I need you to move       
       something for me.        

270
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,486
     - You know what they       
     say about forgiveness?     

271
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,458
      To forgive is to          
      set a prisoner free.      

272
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,428
      Then you find you         
      that prisoner's you.      

273
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,667
     - It's time sensitive.     

274
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,769
    And extremely valuable,     
    and that's why              

275
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,637
         I came to you.         

276
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,709
    - He wants me to courier    
    a package from Mexico.      

277
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,780
    Tells me that there's a     
    kidney inside that box.     

278
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,249
  - Yea, makes sense I guess.   

279
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,551
Nobody's seen Lorenzo in months.

280
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,488
       - Big Tommy was          
       very, very serious       

281
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,423
     about the time frame.      

282
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,758
 - Won't they know it was you?  

283
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,195
       - They'll suspect.       

284
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,396
    With all the                
    connections I got, I got    

285
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,798
      diplomatic immunity.      

286
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,733
     - And what if they         
     come after you anyway?     

287
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,137
 - You let me worry about that. 

288
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,307
    Lorenzo's got way too       
    many enemies down south.    

289
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,677
 - And little birdie's do talk. 

290
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,550
     - [Jimmy] When you're      
     alone, it's hard           

291
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,152
       to be present with       
       your thoughts.           

292
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,421
      And that's our            
      innate fear of death      

293
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,790
    manifesting around the      
    things we can't control.    

294
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,726
           - No, man.           

295
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,829
 It's 'cause I've got regrets.  

296
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,832
- But you can't change the past.

297
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,535
   - Yea, but at least if       
   I'm going to get clipped,    

298
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,370
      I know it's going to      
      fucking happen fast.      

299
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,772
  What I'm most terrified of,   

300
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,708
      is the thought of a       
      slow painful death,       

301
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,944
      not actually dying.       

302
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,179
  Especially after what I saw   
  my dad go through, you know?  

303
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,681
      - God rest his soul.      

304
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,715
             - Yep.             

305
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,517
      Cheers to that, man.      

306
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,689
    (dramatic ambient music)    

307
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,728
       What's up with           
       the lotus ink bro?       

308
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,898
  - Take the boy out the hood.  

309
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,868
    - Is that a gang tattoo?    

310
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,504
  - No man, we just got pride   
  from where we're from.        

311
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,540
     Those guys had my          
     back and I had theirs.     

312
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,977
    We weren't a gang in the    
    traditional sense, but      

313
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,512
    we protected each other.    

314
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,614
   - So why'd you leave, man?   

315
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,650
          - Honestly?           

316
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,458
           Too cold.            

317
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,793
           (laughter)           

318
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,828
           - Uh huh.            

319
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,333
So is that really why you left? 

320
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,802
          The weather?          

321
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,871
   - Me and my boys got in a    
   fight outside The Derby.     

322
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,241
     One of them got shot.      

323
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,909
   Did you know Rick McKeeum?   

324
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,311
          - Nah, man.           

325
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,249
   - After that, things         
   just kind of slowed down.    

326
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:52,683
       Felt like I was          
       waiting around for       

327
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,951
    something bad to happen.    

328
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,921
  Figured if I came out here,   

329
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,823
give me a chance to start fresh.

330
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,425
- How's it working out for you? 

331
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,995
        - It's working.         

332
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,734
       'Cause I'm sitting       
       here, with Clyde,        

333
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,869
       drinking beers           
       and getting a tan.       

334
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,439
    (dramatic ambient music)    

335
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,575
What about you, why'd you leave?

336
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,945
       - Do you remember        
       Mike, my cousin?         

337
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,848
  - [Jimmy] I never knew him,   
  I remember he got killed.     

338
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,351
      - Yea, well after...      

339
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,656
   My father died, and Mike,    

340
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:36,360
   I kind of realized I was     
   going down the wrong path.   

341
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,397
   - [Jimmy] I'm sorry, I       
   know you guys were close.    

342
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,633
   - I wasn't ever really       
   that close to my dad, man.   

343
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,068
         Not like you.          

344
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,070
    (dramatic ambient music)    

345
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,479
 - I was talking about Michael. 

346
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,850
        - Right, right.         

347
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,952
    (dramatic ambient music)    

348
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:10,528
       (engine rumbling)        

349
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:16,901
            - Jimmy!            

350
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,336
          - Mr. Slick!          

351
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,939
    - Come on to the office.    

352
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,908
 - Nah man, I got to get going. 

353
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,376
       I just got to go.        

354
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:26,744
     - I got some tequila,      
     and I want to              

355
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,379
  talk to you anyway, come on.  

356
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:35,953
  (Tejano music over intercom)  

357
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,527
       - There's an extra       
       1,000 bucks here.        

358
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,963
    - I thought you             
    deserved a little bonus.    

359
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,367
      - [Jimmy] No thanks.      

360
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,435
    - Jimmy, don't be rude.     

361
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,870
- I don't mean to be rude, but I

362
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,672
    like our arrangement        
    just fine the way it is.    

363
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,140
     And I know what it         
     means if I take that.      

364
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,943
 - What are you talking about?  

365
00:22:58,945 --> 00:22:59,977
   - It means I work for you.   

366
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,979
   - And what do you do now?    

367
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,815
   - Now I work with you,       
   there's a big difference.    

368
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,150
         - How's that?          

369
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,552
           - Simple.            

370
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,088
       I bring you cars         
       for $2,500 a pop.        

371
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,023
 And you know as well as I do,  

372
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,792
   I can go anywhere in town    
   and get that same price.     

373
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,428
  What makes us special, is     
  that we're both consistent.   

374
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,029
           (laughter)           

375
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,030
       - Is that a fact?        

376
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,165
    - [Jimmy] Damn straight.    

377
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,534
          - You know?           

378
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,706
      This tequila's            
      made from a cactus.       

379
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,411
Meant to be sipped, and enjoyed.

380
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,980
      To power and money.       

381
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,117
           (laughter)           

382
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,621
 You know, but sometimes Jimmy, 

383
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,156
you got to just say, "fuck it." 

384
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,792
    (ominous ambient music)     

385
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,795
    - What's this about Roy?    

386
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,965
 - I got a special job for you. 

387
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,135
   - I don't do special jobs.   

388
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,504
   - Not even for big money?    

389
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,706
     - How much we talking?     

390
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,442
          - 20 grand.           

391
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,445
     - I just told you I        
     don't do special jobs.     

392
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,679
           - 50 then.           

393
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,114
    - You're just going to      
    throw numbers at me now?    

394
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,515
      - Yea, I'm serious.       

395
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,451
       - Well then again,       
       respectfully Roy,        

396
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,052
 I'm going to have to decline.  

397
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,521
        - Well how about        
        a respectable...        

398
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,089
           100 grand?           

399
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,093
- [Jimmy] Thanks for the drink. 

400
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,130
    (ominous ambient music)     

401
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,999
          - 200 grand.          

402
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,769
    (ominous ambient music)     

403
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,607
Ah, now I've got your attention.

404
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,875
       - Are you serious?       

405
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,177
  - I don't fuck around Jimmy.  

406
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,080
    (ominous ambient music)     

407
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,986
 - What kind of job we talking? 

408
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,921
     - Just another boost.      

409
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,491
      You got five minutes      
      to steal a car,           

410
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,060
     containing some            
     really valuable cargo.     

411
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,896
       It's going down          
       in broad daylight.       

412
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,131
       All you got to do,       
       bring me the car.        

413
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,201
    Don't ask any questions,    
    and that's it.              

414
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,036
          - That's it?          

415
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,906
       - Yep, that's it.        

416
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,242
    (ominous ambient music)     

417
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:12,810
          - Two fifty.          

418
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:15,946
    - I got to make a call.     

419
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,248
          - What for?           

420
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,818
    - Now I know your price.    

421
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,220
         (static hiss)          

422
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:26,090
    (ominous ambient music)     

423
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,668
       - Tommy, you mind?       

424
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,309
    (ominous ambient music)     

425
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,751
       You know who I am?       

426
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,121
     - You must be Lorenzo.     

427
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,991
 But you don't look sick to me. 

428
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,226
   - That's because I'm not.    

429
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,695
   At least not in the body.    

430
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,697
       Maybe in the mind.       

431
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:10,067
  - I thought this was all      
  about you needing a kidney.   

432
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,203
    - What's your name kid?     

433
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,005
            - Jimmy.            

434
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,907
    - What do you do Jimmy?     

435
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,309
       What's your thing?       

436
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,778
        - I boost cars.         

437
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,781
     - And how did you wind     
     up working for Austin?     

438
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,784
   - I don't work for nobody.   

439
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,185
    - And yet, here we are.     

440
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,788
    (ominous ambient music)     

441
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,658
     It's amazing isn't it?     

442
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,927
      How crystal clear         
      a situation becomes       

443
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,063
     when you're looking at     
     it from the outside?       

444
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,999
       - It's a matter          
       of point of view.        

445
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,167
           - Exactly.           

446
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,136
         We're animals.         

447
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,038
 That's part of our conundrum.  

448
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,941
      Greed serves us           
      very well in nature,      

449
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,944
    but in the human world,     
    we have our intellect       

450
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,245
     to tell us otherwise.      

451
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,116
  - If you were me, you would   
  have done the same thing.     

452
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,352
         - Hard to say.         

453
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:07,257
  (ominous heart beat effect)   

454
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:21,271
    (ominous ambient music)     

455
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,784
       You know I have to       
       kill you, right?         

456
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,186
    (ominous ambient music)     

457
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,921
- You don't have to do anything.

458
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:41,191
  - I didn't get to be in this  
  position by being merciful.   

459
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,360
            - Mercy?            

460
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,829
       Is that what we're       
       talking about?           

461
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,698
 - If you were in my position,  

462
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,299
    you'd do the same thing.    

463
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,269
         - Hard to say.         

464
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,706
     - How old are you kid?     

465
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,274
             - 26.              

466
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:58,976
            - Jesus.            

467
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,112
       When I was 26, I         
       lived in Chelsea.        

468
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,182
     - Why'd you come here?     

469
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,384
      - Because I knew          
      that I would have to      

470
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,286
       burn some people         
       if I wanted to get       

471
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,988
     where I wanted to go.      

472
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,190
    Or, move somewhere else,    

473
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,425
    and take what was mine.     

474
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:15,726
      I chose the latter.       

475
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,931
  - Makes sense, but why L.A.?  

476
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,766
    It's the weather, right?    

477
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,269
     I'm from Detroit, you      
     ever been to Midwest?      

478
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,804
       It's fucking cold.       

479
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,274
  - First I went to New York.   

480
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,276
 But the Guineas run that town. 

481
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,044
          Also, cold.           

482
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,047
      After a few years,        
      I came out to L.A.,       

483
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,750
       and I knew right         
       away, I'd hit it.        

484
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,220
       - How'd you know?        

485
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,457
      - Back then, my           
      main thing was blow,      

486
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,460
     and this bitch ran all     
     the coke from Mexico.      

487
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,029
 Ruthless cunt named Graciela.  

488
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,965
  Bat shit crazy, that broad.   

489
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,935
       And good looking         
       too, huge titties.       

490
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,504
    But if she even thought     
    you'd crossed her,          

491
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,874
   she'd have you burned        
   alive, cut out your eyes,    

492
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,409
    and chop off your dick.     

493
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,011
      That's the funny          
      thing about people,       

494
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,314
    you can deify them, but     
    that the end of the day,    

495
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,483
      their flesh is just       
      as soft and fragile       

496
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,251
       as a baby girl's.        

497
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,888
 - Something tells me things    
 didn't end well for Graciela.  

498
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,260
- She fell victim to her vanity.

499
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,996
       And then I put a         
       gun under her chin       

500
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,531
 and blew her fucking head off. 

501
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,069
      Men get a bad wrap,       
      but it never ceases       

502
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,471
     to surprise me, how        
     stupid a woman becomes     

503
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,507
   when she sees a big dick.    

504
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,780
      Just like that, pow,      
      no more Graciela,         

505
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,515
      and I'm running the       
      coke from Mexico.         

506
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:47,351
      You think the             
      wetbacks give a fuck      

507
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,986
    who's running the shit?     

508
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,855
   They don't, trust me, as     
   long as you're consistent.   

509
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,491
   (tense synthesizer music)    

510
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,364
     You ever been in love?     

511
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,100
            - What?             

512
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,836
    - You ever been in love?    

513
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,438
         - Sure I have.         

514
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,108
      - Tell me about it.       

515
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,510
   (tense synthesizer music)    

516
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,081
 - First time was Sarah Madson. 

517
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,518
      She was a couple of       
      years older than me.      

518
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,254
    She lived up the street.    

519
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,158
  When I was 16, we hooked up.  

520
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,494
   Spent the summer together.   

521
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,463
Used to pick her up in my truck,

522
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,965
    and we'd sleep under        
    that stars at this lake     

523
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,333
       near my home town.       

524
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,169
      - Was she beautiful?      

525
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,439
             - Yea.             

526
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,943
        - So that's it?         

527
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,511
          Just Sarah?           

528
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,116
     - And my girl Sherry.      

529
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,085
           - Sherry?            

530
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,454
    - Yea, my girl Shereen.     

531
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,557
      - Tell me about her.      

532
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,127
       - She's different.       

533
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,463
         She's special.         

534
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,499
   (tense synthesizer music)    

535
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,569
     I can't figure it out.     

536
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,638
  She never asks me for much.   

537
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:19,476
 She maintains this, distance.  

538
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,113
       I tell her I love        
       her all the time         

539
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,015
   'cause honestly I do, but.   

540
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,417
    (dramatic ambient music)    

541
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,324
          - But what?           

542
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,160
   - I don't know, nothing      
   man, it's hard to explain.   

543
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,495
    What do you care anyway?    

544
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,401
      - All my life, I've       
      spent avoiding love.      

545
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,572
   I've had a few meaningful    
   relationships, but           

546
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,008
    when it comes to women,     

547
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,111
      friends, family, in       
      our line of work,         

548
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,913
   it's best to keep it lean.   

549
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,649
      Loved ones become...      

550
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,452
       Like blind spots.        

551
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,659
   I have a daughter, Jimmy.    

552
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,594
            Sierra.             

553
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,262
          She's seven.          

554
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,598
    Never loved her             
    mother, but, the moment     

555
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,199
 I laid eyes on my little girl, 

556
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,935
       my world flipped.        

557
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,005
      Except for Tommy,         
      I kept her a secret       

558
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,574
  from my entire organization.  

559
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,411
The only reason I'm telling you,

560
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,713
     is that she's the one      
     who's dying, not me.       

561
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,049
      And I need your help      
      to save her life.         

562
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,988
      - This whole thing's      
      about a little girl?      

563
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,191
       A little girl, and       
       a blood disease.         

564
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,661
      It's ironic really.       

565
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,232
  All the energy I expended     
  trying to keep her a secret,  

566
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:53,704
    and now, apparently,        
    it's the very same thing    

567
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,539
      that's brought us         
      to this unfortunate       

568
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,607
     and somewhat               
     impossible situation.      

569
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,710
    (ominous ambient music)     

570
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,311
  - Why should I believe you?   

571
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,647
     - You said it              
     yourself, look at me.      

572
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,215
   I'm as healthy as a horse.   

573
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,185
     Now I'm going to           
     level with you Jimmy.      

574
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,621
     Because we're running      
     fucking short on time,     

575
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,457
       and we could chat        
       here all night.          

576
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,160
 Even if the kidney is intact,  

577
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,998
    she still has only a        
    70% chance of it taking.    

578
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,234
      I'm not going to          
      sit here and make up      

579
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,069
  some elaborate lie about how  

580
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,305
       if you help me, I        
       will let you go.         

581
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,374
     You fucked me, Jimmy.      

582
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,509
 And I know you didn't mean it, 

583
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,211
     but you did it anyway.     

584
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,612
       And now you have         
       to pay the price.        

585
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,681
  So, this is going to go down  

586
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,750
    one of either two ways.     

587
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,352
       One, you're going        
       to tell me where         

588
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,022
       the kidney is, and       
       when I have it,          

589
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,623
      Tommy here, is going      
      to put a bullet           

590
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,191
      through your heart.       

591
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,293
       Or, you don't tell       
       me where it is,          

592
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,696
      and I have one of my      
      less civilized guys       

593
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,097
       go to work on you.       

594
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,700
   (tense synthesizer music)    

595
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,704
       - What if I set          
       everything right?        

596
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,043
 - Jimmy, I have my reputation. 

597
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,677
        - So that's it?         

598
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,681
          - That's it.          

599
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,384
   (tense synthesizer music)    

600
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,693
    (ominous ambient music)     

601
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,834
   - Although I myself am not   
   a violent man, Lorenzo,      

602
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,670
 I understand people like you.  

603
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,706
 So before I agree to anything, 

604
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,708
       here are my terms.       

605
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,811
       I need two things.       

606
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:42,679
              One,              

607
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,714
          I want 150K.          

608
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,117
      For my girl Shereen.      

609
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,518
Put her brother through college,

610
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,753
 take care of her for a while.  

611
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,689
            And two,            

612
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,092
      you got to let me go      
      for a couple hours.       

613
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,829
   I'll bring you back the      
   kidney, that's a promise.    

614
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,798
     But I need some time.      

615
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,302
       - You know I can't       
       do that Jimmy.           

616
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,670
      - Just hear me out.       

617
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,673
   Like I said, I understand    
   people like you.             

618
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,641
   I know that you'll find      
   the thing that I love most   

619
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,477
      and destroy it if I       
      try to skip town or       

620
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,845
      do anything stupid.       

621
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,148
       And I don't value        
       my life that much,       

622
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,684
         I never have.          

623
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,122
    But just so we're clear,    
    I'm not asking you.         

624
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,523
        I'm telling you.        

625
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,825
     I need a little time.      

626
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:33,597
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

627
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,315
  - Jimmy, what the fuck man?   

628
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,584
- I need your help, I'm in deep.

629
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,521
         - This is bad.         

630
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,890
      This is really bad.       

631
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,658
           - I know.            

632
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,827
  I got caught up in this       
  shit and it's all fucked up.  

633
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,362
          - What shit?          

634
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,430
     Buy, sell organs on        
     the black market shit?     

635
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,832
 - No, it's not my thing, it's. 

636
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,233
   - Then what is your thing?   

637
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,169
        - I boost cars!         

638
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,375
   - I always knew you were     
   into some shady shit man,    

639
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,743
      but this is serious.      

640
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:20,911
           - I know!            

641
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,613
      - That kidney             
      belongs to somebody       

642
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,248
    and they're going to die    
    if they don't get it.       

643
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,183
           - I know.            

644
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,552
     - Then what the fuck?      

645
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,789
    - I was hired to steal      
    this car for big money.     

646
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,191
       I didn't know it         
       was in the trunk,        

647
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,592
    I knew it was valuable,     
    I figured it was drugs.     

648
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,860
             - And?             

649
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,795
     - And during the boost     
     some guy shows up          

650
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,697
    and puts a gun in my        
    face and I stab him man,    

651
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,632
     I stab him in the neck     
     with a screwdriver.        

652
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,337
   - Wait, wait, wait, wait,    

653
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:48,972
       you stabbed a guy?       

654
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,707
     - It was self defense!     

655
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,776
    (dramatic string music)     

656
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,311
 - Look, Jimmy, that's murder.  

657
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,645
     - What are you doing?      

658
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:57,981
        - I'm a cop man.        

659
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,749
 I know that we got a history,  

660
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,451
   but I got to take you in.    

661
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:02,986
         - Take me in?          

662
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,321
      I called you 'cause       
      I need you help!          

663
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,324
 - Put your hands on your head. 

664
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,226
  - Are you serious right now?  

665
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,429
   Friendship, loyalty, does    
   that mean anything to you?   

666
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:13,663
   We're practically family!    

667
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,699
        - I know Jimmy.         

668
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,235
      But I'm not one of        
      your lotus brothers       

669
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,337
    and I certainly won't be    
    an accessory to murder.     

670
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,938
       Now put your hands       
       behind your head!        

671
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,006
             - No.              

672
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:24,608
           (gunshot)            

673
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,943
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

674
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,652
            Come on.            

675
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,289
   You made me do it man, I'm   
   not going to shoot you.      

676
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,426
      I called you 'cause       
      I need your help          

677
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,328
   and no one in this fucking   
   town's got my back.          

678
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,965
  These guys want to kill me,   
  bad guys want to kill me.     

679
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,635
   So you can either help me    
   survive the next 24 hours,   

680
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,470
       and be part of the       
       solution, or not,        

681
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,038
  and then you're just          
  another part of the problem.  

682
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,042
     - Jimmy I'm a cop man.     

683
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,912
  This could cost me my badge.  

684
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,682
       This is my career.       

685
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,917
- Then forget I ever called you.

686
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,021
 - [Clyde] Jimmy I'm sorry man. 

687
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,289
       - Fuck you Clyde.        

688
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,958
     (somber string music)      

689
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,627
        (engine rumbles)        

690
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,830
         - Jimmy wait!          

691
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:23,867
(suspenseful synthesizer music) 

692
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:30,540
            - Boys!             

693
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,042
- [Tommy] Shut the fuck up Roy. 

694
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,410
             (thud)             

695
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,948
        (distorted bass)        

696
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,318
              Roy?              

697
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,719
              Roy?              

698
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,054
              Roy?              

699
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:44,921
          - The fuck?           

700
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,423
      - Roy listen to me.       

701
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,859
   One of my guys got           
   stabbed in the neck today,   

702
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,063
      with a screwdriver,       
      during your pickup.       

703
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,597
    - You mean your pickup!     

704
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:55,965
          (Roy yells)           

705
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,703
     - Listen, our personal     
     stuff aside Roy,           

706
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,072
    I trusted you again         
    and you have fucked me.     

707
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,574
   So you got about 30          
   seconds to start talking,    

708
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,544
   or I am going to make        
   your life miserable, huh?    

709
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:08,411
    - I don't know anything!    

710
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:09,079
           - Sledge.            

711
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:09,946
             (thud)             

712
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,381
           (coughing)           

713
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,815
     You like to talk Roy,      
     everybody in town          

714
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,085
     knows that you like to     
     talk, so talk to me.       

715
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,020
              Huh?              

716
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,488
     - Hey, I don't know        
     what you're talking--      

717
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,955
      - Goddammit I don't       
      get people like you!      

718
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,424
       You know what, you       
       just keep digging        

719
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:22,592
    deeper and deeper right?    

720
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,027
      You just won't look,      

721
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,028
         grab his hand.         

722
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,962
             (thud)             

723
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,031
  You know what infuriates me?  

724
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,899
 Is that think you're so smart, 

725
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,534
      but you're not Roy,       
      and on top of that,       

726
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,937
  you're a horrible liar, so    
  all that ends up happening,   

727
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,540
    is you waste important      
    people's valuable time,     

728
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,843
with all of your bullshit, huh? 

729
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,511
     - [Roy] Wait, wait,        
     wait, what's he doing?     

730
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,012
      - [Tommy] Every           
      time you lie to me,       

731
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,481
      I'm going to rip out      
      one of your fucking       

732
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,815
       fingernails, okay?       

733
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,983
       So start talking!        

734
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,151
      - Okay I'll tell you      
      everything I know!        

735
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,786
       Wait, wait, wait!        

736
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,154
  Okay, I'll tell you, I'll     
  tell you everything I know.   

737
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:55,658
     Okay, word is, this        
     coked up kid, Austin.      

738
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,026
He found out about the package. 

739
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,745
      He must have thought      
      that it was like,         

740
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,463
    a load of blow, because     
    that's his deal.            

741
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,465
 Hey, hey, he lives in Vernon.  

742
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,435
  - I know who Austin is Roy.   

743
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,771
     But what that doesn't      
     account for is how         

744
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,073
 Austin knew about the package, 

745
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,474
      unless you told him!      

746
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,477
      - I swear to God, I       
      didn't say a thing!       

747
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,113
    He deals to the             
    Armenians, and he knows     

748
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,648
 all the real border borthers!  

749
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,949
      They must have            
      fond out something!       

750
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,050
     I didn't say a thing.      

751
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,153
    (ominous ambient music)     

752
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:24,954
            I swear.            

753
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,065
  - That is a great story Roy.  

754
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,500
     That is a great story.     

755
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,886
           You know?            

756
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,870
 I guess a half truth is better 
 than no truth at all, so.      

757
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:46,009
    I'm going to pay you for    
    that info, thank you.       

758
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,778
   But you still owe me one.    

759
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,682
          (screaming)           

760
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,017
     I'm going to call you.     

761
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,085
 Get your money for you, okay?  

762
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,588
    (ominous ambient music)     

763
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,962
         - God damnit!          

764
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,468
- Listen, I'm going to need you 
to start from the beginning.    

765
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,102
         I'm all ears.          

766
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,972
    But if you want my help,    

767
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,641
I need to know everything, okay?

768
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,079
 - I don't know where to begin. 

769
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,852
   - What about the guy that    
   put a gun up to your head    

770
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,086
      in the parking lot?       

771
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,055
      Did he say anything?      

772
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,757
       - He asked me who        
       I was working for.       

773
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,962
     He mentioned Lorenzo.      

774
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,631
      - He said "Lorenzo?"      

775
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,568
            Oh shit.            

776
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,004
     He must be talking         
     about Lorenzo Champs.      

777
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,606
         - Who's that?          

778
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,177
  - He's a big time gangster.   

779
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,981
    Runs a lot of operations    
    in and out of L.A.          

780
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,250
      He's our west             
      coast kingpin, man.       

781
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,586
 You know, we've been trying to 
 nail him down for years, but.  

782
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:04,521
          - But what?           

783
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,258
       - He's good Jimmy.       

784
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,226
        He's real good.         

785
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,696
     All of his businesses      
     are legit now.             

786
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,898
      Except for the coke.      

787
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,835
       - So what's he           
       want a kidney for?       

788
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,870
        - Who knows man?        

789
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,140
      People pay a lot of       
      money for the shit.       

790
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,209
     - I just keep thinking     
     about that guy             

791
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,877
    in the parking lot man.     

792
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,913
    I didn't have a choice,     
    you got to believe me.      

793
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,116
      - Oh I believe you.       

794
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,286
   Now I need you to tell me    

795
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,222
       exactly what it is       

796
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,291
    that you want me to do.     

797
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,730
       (seagulls calling)       

798
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,234
    (ominous droning music)     

799
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,577
      - You must be Jimmy.      

800
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,078
     Come on in, have seat.     

801
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,714
    (ominous droning music)     

802
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,223
      You don't need that       
      pistol, cowboy.           

803
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,592
  - I'll be the judge of that.  

804
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,694
   - We're on the same side.    

805
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,731
      So where's this box?      

806
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:22,932
   I want to see this thing.    

807
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,102
        - It ain't far.         

808
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,770
       Where's my money?        

809
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,640
  - You'll get your money when  
  you deliver the package.      

810
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,275
     So if there's someone      
     you need to call,          

811
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,643
   now would be a good time.    

812
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,111
      - No, we'll wait          
      'till Roy gets here,      

813
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,813
     then I make that call,     
     and I decide how this      

814
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,348
   is going to work together.   

815
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,049
         - Okie dokie.          

816
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,752
    I'm Crystal by the way.     

817
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:46,356
       Your services are        
       much appreciated.        

818
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,658
 Roy spoke very highly of you.  

819
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,093
         - That a fact?         

820
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:52,962
       - So you thirsty?        

821
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,031
   Care for a tasty beverage?   

822
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,069
        Or maybe a bump?        

823
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,771
     - No thanks, I had a       
     pretty rough morning.      

824
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,241
   - Yea, I heard about that.   

825
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:08,344
             Sorry.             

826
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,948
     Could you please stop      
     pointing that at me?       

827
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,751
     I'm a girl, it's rude.     

828
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,386
        (lighter clicks)        

829
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,989
        - [Jimmy] So how        
        do you know Roy?        

830
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:24,093
      Everyone knows Roy.       

831
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,428
      - Wasn't he supposed      
      to be here by now?        

832
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,364
  - Dude, relax, you're tense.  

833
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,102
  You're kind of cute though.   

834
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:36,239
        Where you from?         

835
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,240
           - Detroit.           

836
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,210
     - Yea, I can see that.     

837
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,945
   You kind of got that whole   

838
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,081
 trashy urban guy thing going.  

839
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:46,949
     - Yea, where you from?     

840
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:50,420
          - The Hills.          

841
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,157
      Oh, do you want one?      

842
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,192
        (dramatic bass)         

843
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,394
      Mellow the fuck out!      

844
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,229
       You just made a          
       shit ton of money,       

845
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,198
     and as soon as you         
     deliver your package,      

846
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,400
all's going to end well for you.

847
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,439
     How about that drink?      

848
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,075
      - I don't like this,      
      you're stalling!          

849
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,042
          - Excuse me?          

850
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,343
  - Where's my fucking money?   

851
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,313
    - I don't like your         
    tone Jimmy from Detroit.    

852
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,665
      - Well I almost           
      got killed earlier,       

853
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,016
     so don't really give       
     a shit what you think.     

854
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:21,217
 Now where's my fucking money?  

855
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,420
       - Alright, you           
       left me no choice.       

856
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,355
 - [Jimmy] What are you doing?  

857
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:28,424
      - Helping you relax.

860
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,270
      You really are new        
      at this, aren't you?      

861
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,342
     Now take one more          
     step, and I'll shoot.      

862
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,010
             Baby!              

863
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,512
     You can come out now!      

864
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:52,482
  (sensual synthesizer music)

868
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:34,957
       - [Lorenzo] What?        

869
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:37,360
           - Nothing.           

870
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,398
- Have a soft spot for the kid? 

871
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,168
       - Yea, I guess so.       

872
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,003
     (gentle string music)      

873
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,039
  - What was I supposed to do?  

874
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,541
          Let him go?           

875
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,509
      - No, I don't know.       

876
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,313
     It just, this doesn't      
     feel right, you know?      

877
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,548
    - [Lorenzo] It happens.     

878
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,448
     - Yea, but not like        
     this, and when the kid     

879
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,050
  did the right thing Lorenzo.  

880
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,955
      - Maybe in the end,       

881
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,124
      he got mixed up with      
      the wrong people.         

882
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,892
  Roy, that weirdo coke head.   

883
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:11,394
           - Austin.            

884
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:14,063
   - Nobody with half a brain   
   would work for that guy.     

885
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,465
    - Yea, I don't think he     
    was working with Austin.    

886
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,435
     I mean, Roy maybe, but     
     he didn't know Austin      

887
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,970
     from a hole in the         
     wall, I mean that guy      

888
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,504
    was cutting his face up     
    when we went in there.

892
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,197
          - It's you.           

893
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,936
  - [Tommy] What the fuck is    
  the matter with you Austin?   

894
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,608
     - Are you really going     
     to lecture me old man?     

895
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,445
   - Look, what's up with       
   the sense of entitlement?    

896
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,113
              Huh?              

897
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,514
       I mean, didn't we        
       talk about this?         

898
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,649
One day I'm going to be too old 

899
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,618
     and too tired to deal      
     with this bullshit?        

900
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,654
     And then it was going      
     to be Austin's time.       

901
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,656
      Right, but you            
      couldn't wait, huh?       

902
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:16,259
       You just insist on       
       disrespecting me         

903
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:19,328
 over and over and over again.  

904
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,230
      - Disrespecting you?      

905
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:24,500
      I'm just trying to        
      expand my business.       

906
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,269
    If you were in my shoes,    
    you would be doing          

907
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,271
     the exact same thing.      

908
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,607
         - Fair enough.         

909
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,577
However, if I want someone dead,

910
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,046
     I get them dead, and       
     I make damn well sure      

911
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:39,215
   they know it was me, that    
   wanted them that way.        

912
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,616
    You idiots, you get         
    involved in shit without    

913
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:43,619
any concept of cause and effect.

914
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,057
         - Wow, you...          

915
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,694
    Do realize we're talking    
    about drug trafficking?     

916
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:54,597
   Transporting human organs    
   on the black market          

917
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,531
          and murder?           

918
00:48:56,367 --> 00:49:00,002
 This isn't Sicily circa 1940.  

919
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,305
  We're not in The Godfather.   

920
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:04,607
  Some stupid gangster movie.   

921
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,310
  Okay, I saw an opportunity.   

922
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,445
       It's that simple.        

923
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:14,517
 And when Lorenzo's body is     
 drained and cold in the Earth, 

924
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,521
    no one is going to gove     
    a shit how it happened.     

925
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,524
    (ominous ambient music)     

926
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,228
     - [Tommy] I guess you      
     didn't see all the         

927
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,497
       guys in nice suits       
       with huge guns.          

928
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:32,535
             Okay.              

929
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:33,569
I'm going to explain it to you. 

930
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,272
      There's a gulf here,      
      there's a divide.         

931
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,740
  A great divide, if you will.  

932
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,543
     On the one side you        
     got classy gentlemen,      

933
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:43,212
     that get nice              
     things, cars, houses.      

934
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,148
       Beautiful women,         
       big bank accounts.       

935
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:48,150
         Fillet Mignon.         

936
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,720
    Manicured lawns, and we     
    get to have those things    

937
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,655
        because well, we        
        live by a creed.        

938
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,024
  A sense of civility, right?   

939
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,692
     And then on the other      
     side, there's you.         

940
00:49:58,396 --> 00:49:59,695
     You're a fuck up, man.     

941
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,097
      You're a psychopath.      

942
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,499
    You make bad decisions,     
    both personally,            

943
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,569
     and businesswise, that     
     affect other people.       

944
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,005
     You have no reverence      
     for the game               

945
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,439
    and you played it wrong.    

946
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,308
   You're lost in the woods     
   without a compass Austin,    

947
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,176
      and do you know           
      where that gets you?      

948
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,714
       - Lorenzo doesn't        
       have the kidney.         

949
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,717
    Okay, and time's            
    running out, right, huh?    

950
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:25,654
      Jimmy here is             
      working with a cop.       

951
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:29,458
      And he's the one who      
      has the package, so.      

952
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:30,593
        - Is that right?        

953
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:34,764
        - That's right.         

954
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,132
            Ask him.            

955
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,400
  - [Tommy] Is that true kid?   

956
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,775
       - You really going       
       to shoot me Tommy?       

957
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,478
      Wouldn't Lorenzo          
      rather whack the guy      

958
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,780
       who sold him out?        

959
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,715
  That would make sense to me.  

960
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,251
    (ominous ambient music)     

961
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,592
    - Austin, you are a         
    tragic character in this    

962
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,394
    play of fools, brother.     

963
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:07,663
         - How's that?          

964
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,699
 - Because you played it wrong. 

965
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,271
         - Killing me,          

966
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,540
   would be bad for business.   

967
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,409
    I move too much product.    

968
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,614
         - That's true.         

969
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,684
      However, that's why       
      these guys are here.      

970
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,689
    (ominous ambient music)

    (ominous ambient music)     

973
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,593
           - No, no!            

974
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:38,861
              No!               

975
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,362
   You don't have to do this!   

976
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:41,430
           Tommy, no!           

977
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:42,765
             Baby!              

978
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:44,700
              No!               

979
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:46,502
           (screams)

    (ominous ambient music)     

981
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,738
   - You were just too eager.

    (ominous ambient music)

        (Austin gagging)        

985
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,282
    Will you untie the kid?     

986
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,183
Let's get the fuck out of here. 

987
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,552
    (ominous ambient music)     

988
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,559
     - So, no more Austin.      

989
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,495
     - Yea, good riddance.      

990
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,430
   Wish I'd taken care of the   
   whacko a long time ago.      

991
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,466
 - These things play out Tommy, 

992
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,634
   that's just the way it is.   

993
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,202
       - No, I know, but        
       I don't like it.         

994
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,769
      I mean Roy's the one      
      that made this mess.      

995
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,509
  - He wanted the guy whacked,  

996
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,644
   just think of this as part   
   of the payment process.      

997
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,579
   - But even if that's true,   

998
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:31,847
     what, we're just happy     
     to have the Armenians      

999
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,549
      do Roy's dirty work?      

1000
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:34,717
     - Doesn't matter now.      

1001
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,388
      - Alright, so let me      
      get this straight.        

1002
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,340
Even thought you and I both know

1003
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:42,857
       that it was Roy          
       that sold us out,        

1004
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,829
      you're not thinking       
      what I'm thinking?        

1005
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:48,831
          - No Tommy.           

1006
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,768
  You know we can't touch him.  

1007
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,639
      This'll blow the lid      
      off the whole thing.      

1008
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,241
Got a lot of things on my mind, 

1009
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,708
     the last thing I need      
     is some bigger problem     

1010
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,777
      south of the border.      

1011
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:02,945
           - Come on.           

1012
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,747
       - This isn't open        
       for discussion!          

1013
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:08,184
           - Alright.           

1014
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:10,953
        How's she doing?        

1015
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,190
          - We'll see.          

1016
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,794
       (heartbeat effect)

     (somber string music)

1022
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,455
            - Jimmy.            

1023
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,657
     What the fuck happened     
     to your face man?          

1024
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,658
         - Where is it?         

1025
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,726
 - [Clyde] It's in the kitchen. 

1026
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:24,960
    - if I'm not back later,    

1027
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,730
    you need to give this to    
    my girl Shereen, okay?      

1028
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:31,800
      Here's her address.       

1029
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,969
       Promise me you'll        
       give it to her!          

1030
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:36,672
            - Jesus.            

1031
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:38,140
         - Promise me!          

1032
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,607
       - Jesus, I promise       
       man, I promise!          

1033

1038
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,019
      - Take care of this.      

1039
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,822
    (ominous ambient music)

1042
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:53,916
- [Jimmy] What would you do with

1043
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:54,983
   a few hundred grand, baby?   

1044
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:57,986
            - What?             

1045
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,655
      - [Jimmy] What            
      would you do with a       

1046
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,690
      few hundred grand,        
      if you go it today?       

1047
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,759
          Or tomorrow?          

1048
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,928
      (gentle piano music)      

1049
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,995
        - I don't know.         

1050
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,997
Put it down on a house, I guess.

1051
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,568
      I have no idea, why?      

1052
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:13,936
   - [Jimmy] Just wondering.    

1053
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:17,940
       - I would put some       
       money away for           

1054
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,075
   Mickey's college, I          
   would definitely do that.    

1055
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:22,544
        (bacon sizzling)        

1056
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,912
 - [Jimmy] I would start a lot. 

1057
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,915
  - What, like a parking lot?   

1058
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,650
       - [Jimmy] No, like       
       a used car lot.          

1059
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,052
   I would buy and sell cars.   

1060
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,291
 Maybe I'd take you on a trip.  

1061
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,625
  I hear Pontiac, Michigan's    
  beautiful this time of year.  

1062
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:37,960
      - [Shereen] Let's go      
      to the East Coast.        

1063
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:38,827
          - Let's go.           

1064
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,996
      (gentle piano music)      

1065
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,999
 Mm, this bacon's so good baby. 

1066
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:45,834
         - You like it?         

1067
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:47,970
     - I'm in love with it.     

1068
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,938
     Almost as much as you.     

1069
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:52,040
  - You don't need money when   

1070
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,809
   bacon makes you so happy.    

1071
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:55,944
         - Damn right.          

1072
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,984
       I was going down         
       to Alvera Street,        

1073
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,752
       and I saw it and         
       I thought of you.        

1074
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,721
          You like it?          

1075
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,189
          - I love it.          

1076
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:09,558
      (gentle piano music)      

1077
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,698
        - [Jimmy] What?         

1078
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,133
           - Nothing.           

1079
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,169
   - Then what's the problem?   

1080
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,805
     - It makes me feel         
     uncomfortable when you     

1081
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:24,173
     look at me like that.      

1082
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,543
     - You're going to have     
     to explain that to me.     

1083
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,478
      (gentle piano music)      

1084
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:32,047
            (sighs)             

1085
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,051
      - I love you Jimmy.       

1086
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:39,121
             I do.              

1087
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,658
            I just.             

1088
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:45,060
          - Just what?          

1089
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,133
   - Let me tell you a story.   

1090
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,440
   When I was a little girl,    

1091
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:58,941
       I went to visit my       
       family in Mexico.        

1092
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,644
      And that summer           
      they had this goat.       

1093
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:05,581
          On the farm.          

1094
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,017
      I loved little Billy      
      more than anything.       

1095
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,053
       He was black and         
       white, and used to       

1096
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:12,821
     follow me everywhere.      

1097
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:15,891
       I was only five          
       years old, and I'd       

1098
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:17,593
  never been on a farm before.  

1099
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,862
     So I didn't understand     
     that they would            

1100
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:22,531
     raise a goat once a        
     year, to be harvested      

1101
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:25,167
    in the Fall, for the        
    festival to make berria.    

1102
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,103
     One day, I was             
     called to the corral,      

1103
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,705
as everyone else in the family. 

1104
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:32,641
     We gather around, and,     

1105
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,277
  we watched as my              
  grandfather slaughtered him.  

1106
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,814
      Being so young, I         
      had no idea this was      

1107
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,249
     going to happen, so...     

1108
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,519
            I was...            

1109
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,187
Desperate and I started to cry. 

1110
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,657
       As my grandfather        
       cut his throat.          

1111
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:52,127
     When he heard my           
     cries, the poor billy      

1112
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:54,830
     became distressed          
     and started to panic,      

1113
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:58,100
   and struggle for his life.   

1114
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,203
  - He was being slaughtered.   

1115
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:03,105
             - No.              

1116
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,108
        That wasn't it.         

1117
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,547
      Everyone else,            
      including the goat,       

1118
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:14,049
      up to that point,         
      were extremely calm.      

1119
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:17,052
       It was actually          
       me who scared him.       

1120
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,656
My Tia grabbed my hand and said,

1121
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:21,890
         "Let him go."          

1122
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:24,192
 "Your fears are scaring him."  

1123
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,995
"His life was not meant for you,

1124
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,230
  "he doesn't belong to you."   

1125
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,166
    "His life was meant for     
    a different purpose."       

1126
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,070
       "He gives his body       
       and blood to us,         

1127
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,838
       "and we thank him        
       by honoring him          

1128
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,106
      "for his sacrifice."      

1129
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,309
     (gentle string music)      

1130
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:43,245
    At first I was confused.    

1131
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,049
     But then I understood.     

1132
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:50,252
     (gentle string music)      

1133
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:53,121
   And my empathy evaporated,   

1134
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,591
 and I realized she was right.  

1135
00:59:57,895 --> 00:59:59,628
       It was me who was        
       keeping him here.        

1136
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,167
     - So what did you do?      

1137
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:07,603
    (ominous ambient music)     

1138
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,008
           (sobbing)            

1139
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,248
        - I let him go.         

1140
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,786
            (sighs)             

1141
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,289
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1142
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:32,894
           Thank you.

01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,330
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1144
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:47,409
           (humming)            

1145
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,264
      - Hey man, I got to       
      ask you something.        

1146
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,133
             - Hm?              

1147
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,702
      - You consider Pizza      
      Hut a pizzeria?           

1148
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,174
        - I don't know.         

1149
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,110
  - I'm asking you a question.  

1150
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,812
           Yes or no?           

1151
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,390
    - No, I don't think         
    Pizza Hut is a pizzeria.    

1152
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:36,958
             - No?              

1153
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,027
   They serve fucking pizza.    

1154
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:40,462
            - Okay.             

1155
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:42,330
      You know, I went          
      there the other day       

1156
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:43,899
     and got in an argument     
     with the waitress.         

1157
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,333
    I asked for two slices.     

1158
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,270
        She says, "No."         

1159
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:51,273
    - I don't think they        
    do slices at Pizza Hut.     

1160
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:52,340
    - That's not the point.     

1161
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,043
     The point is, I            
     asked for two slices,      

1162
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,779
    she goes, "What do we       
    look like, a pizzeria?"     

1163
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,715
     Now tell me that           
     wouldn't piss you off.     

1164
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,719
     - Got to work on your      
     anger management.          

1165
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,387
    - Yea, anger management.    

1166
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,388
           - Breathe.           

1167
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,758
   - Take it in, let it out.    

1168
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,992
      Pop her in the face.      

1169
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:12,160
           (chuckles)           

1170
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,131
   What's the plan here, man?   

1171
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,203
     - Keri's going to pull     
     up, drop the car off,      

1172
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,139
     he's going to be           
     under the wheel well,      

1173
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,741
    package is in the back.     

1174
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,342
    - Under the wheel well,     
    or on the wheel well?       

1175
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,911
      - [Tommy] It's            
      under the wheel well      

1176
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,479
       in like a, little        
       hide-a-key thing.        

1177
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,013
   - The fuck's a hide-a-key?   

1178
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,815
  - Know what a hide-a-key is?  

1179
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,917
    Little fucking black        
    box, got magnets on it?     

1180
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,419
Slidey door, key goes in there, 

1181
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,521
    your stick it under the     
    car, in case you leave.     

1182
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,356
          - (mumbles).          

1183
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,291
    - A fucking hide-a-key.     

1184
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:45,861
        - I'll find it.         

1185
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,129
    - Got those hide-a-keys     
    that got those              

1186
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,831
    little fake rocks, you      
    never seen those shits?     

1187
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,532
   - Dude, I'm from Brooklyn,   
   we got no fake rocks.        

1188
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,134
       (tires squealing)        

1189
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:53,969
      I'll find it though.      

1190
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:02,544
- [Gangster] Can't see anything.

1191
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,312
    - Just give it a minute.    

1192
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,148
       Run run runnin'         
      through a hot block       

1193
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,449
     Duckin' from a top cop    

1194
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:08,984
        Smith and Wesson       
       teachin' lessons         

1195
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:10,352
   Lookin' for that chop shop  

1196
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,920
   Never have to knock knock   

1197
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,388
   I'm never gonna stop stop   

1198

 Wearin' what I'm wearin's

       the name homie           

1200

     Jimmy when I'm insane     

1201

      Got the shotgun

1202
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:22,230

1203
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,199
   Hey blast from the pastor   

1204
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:26,468
      These other rappers      
     listen and they know      

1205
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,540
          Alright, go.          

1206
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:40,549
      Fucking hide-a-key,       

1207
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:42,417
     don't know what a          
     fucking hide-a key is.     

1208

   (dramatic keyboard music)    

1210
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:20,956
           The fuck?            

1211
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,159
            No, no!             

1212
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,026
           (gunshot)            

1213
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:25,894
          No, no, no!           

1214
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,162
          Oh fuck, no!          

1215
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:31,233
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1216
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:33,435
              Hey!              

1217
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,970
           You, you!            

1218
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:35,904
         Motherfucker!          

1219

        (phone beeping)         

1222
01:06:07,731 --> 01:06:09,664
     (tense keyboard music)     

1223
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,641
       (cell phone rings)       

1224
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:24,212
       (cell phone rings)       

1225
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,717
       (cell phone rings)       

1226
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:33,588
            - Hello?            

1227
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,124
         - Who is this?         

1228
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:39,394
         - Who's this?          

1229
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,396
     - This is the guy          
     that knows that you're     

1230
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:44,599
    speaking on a dead man's    
    cell phone, that's who.     

1231
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,169
     Some stunt you pulled      
     back there kid.            

1232
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,339
      - What do you want?       

1233
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,509
           Big Tommy?           

1234
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,747
       - Alright, listen.       

1235
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,616
     Before you and I get       
     off on the wrong foot,     

1236
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,151
       I'm going to give        
       you an opportunity       

1237
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,486
       to set this right.       

1238
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,204
Under normal circumstances, that

1239
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:07,755
   wouldn't exist for someone   
   in your predicament.         

1240
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,625
       Right, but this          
       shit is personal.        

1241
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,763
     Keep in mind that the      
     man that I work for,       

1242
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:16,398
       he's not going to        
       stop until you are       

1243
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,067
  cut into little tiny pieces.  

1244
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:20,769
      - You think I don't       
      know that already?        

1245
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:21,736
     - Well then what's it      
     going to take for you      

1246
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,438
   to bring me back the car?    

1247
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,440
    - Don't you mean kidney?    

1248
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,711
   That's not going to happen   
   until I have my money.       

1249
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:35,216
 - How much did they offer you? 

1250
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,389
          - 250 grand.          

1251
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:44,359
        - I'll match it.        

1252
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:47,429
            - Go on.            

1253
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,699
- I want to know who hired you. 

1254
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:55,637
     - I'm not saying           
     anything until I have      

1255
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:56,805
      my insurance policy.      

1256
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,142
    - Well, you're going to     
    need more than that kid.    

1257
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,711
    (ominous ambient music)     

1258
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,182
      - What do you mean?       

1259
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,783
    - It's going to take        
    more than a simple trade    

1260
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:11,686
   to set this straight, you    
   killed one of our guys.      

1261
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,154
            Alright?            

1262
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,389
      That being said,          
      there's going to be       

1263
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:16,424
    a price on your head,       
    people are going to die.    

1264
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,826
    If you want to get this     
    straight, you and I,        

1265
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,594
      we're going to have       
      to work together          

1266
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,596
     so that means that we      
     will have to establish     

1267
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,131
          some trust.           

1268
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:24,732
            Alright?            

1269
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:28,736
 I want to know who hired you.  

1270
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,839
    (ominous ambient music)     

1271
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,378
      - I'll call you back      
      in a half an hour.        

1272
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,780
      In the mean time,         
      you can talk to Roy.      

1273
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:42,684
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1274
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,697
       (heavy breathing)        

1275
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:59,400
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1276
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,907
  - Now I need you to tell me   

1277
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:10,278
    exactly what it is          
    that you want me to do.     

1278
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,314
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1279
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:15,884
         - Nothing yet.         

1280
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:17,585
    I just need the package.    

1281
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,787
       Some place safe          
       for my protection.       

1282
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:22,790
   Just go home and hang        
   tight, and I'll call you.    

1283
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:26,561
     - Okay, but I thought      
     you wanted my help         

1284
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:27,829
        with these guys.        

1285
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,666
       - The only thing         
       I need now is for        

1286
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:32,800
      the package to be         
      some place safe with      

1287
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,636
      someone I can trust.      

1288
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,505
 Can you do that for me Clyde?  

1289
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,208
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1290
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:42,877
             - Yea.             

1291
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,346
      Yea, I can do that.       

1292
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:47,749
       - Then I need to         
       make a phone call.       

1293
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:51,953
          (screaming)           

1294
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,388
     - I'm gonna call you,      

1295
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,356
 get your money for you, okay?  

1296
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,393
              Bye.              

1297
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,530
       That motherfucker.       

1298
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:04,666
        - [Sledge] Yea.         

1299
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,568
       What are you going       
       to to about it?          

1300
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,739
  - I'm a lead the kid there,   

1301
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,341
     and let him handle it.     

1302
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:14,542
        That's the plan.        

1303
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,843
      (cell phone buzzes)       

1304
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,445
          Here he is.           

1305
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,215
You want your money, don't you? 

1306
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,516
         - [Jimmy] Yea.         

1307
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,684
     - Then you're going to     
     have to go in there,       

1308
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:23,985
       and you're going         
       to have to get it.       

1309
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,588
      Alright, that's the       
      deal we're making.        

1310
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,358
Look, we'll be right behind you.

1311
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,860
      Okay, as soon as the      
      Armenians get here,       

1312
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:33,928
    we're going to swoop in.    

1313
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,698
    (ominous ambient music)     

1314
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:41,402
   (dramatic swelling effect)   

1315
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,270
           (gunshot)            

1316
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,338
       - [Crystal] Baby?        

1317
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,505
     You can come out now.      

1318
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:47,508
           (yelling)            

1319
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,543
      - [Austin] You'll         
      only make it worse!       

1320
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,912
           (yelling)            

1321
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:53,314
           (yelling)            

1322
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,749
           (yelling)            

1323
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:55,750
           (yelling)            

1324
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:59,687
           (yelling)            

1325
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,024
        Is it the pain?         

1326
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:06,761
     Or the horror of being     
     maimed that's worse?       

1327
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:10,698
      - You're a monster!       

1328
01:11:12,636 --> 01:11:13,968
        - I'm an artist.        

1329
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,571
            (crying)            

1330
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:19,007
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1331
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,613
  You know why I'm an artist?   

1332
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:31,452
      It's because the          
      lines you can draw.       

1333
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,522
     The layers of a person     

1334
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:36,724
       you can peel away.       

1335
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,992
         Like an onion.         

1336
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,529
   If it's (mumbles) enough,    

1337
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,031
         you see steam          

1338
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,833
      rising off of them.       

1339
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,771
         All that heat.         

1340
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,441
         All that life.         

1341
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:55,910
           Literally.           

1342
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:58,746
          Evaporating.          

1343
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,748
           (sobbing)            

1344
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,817
       I feel its fever.        

1345
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,386
           (sobbing)            

1346
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:07,722
       - [Jimmy] Help me!       

1347
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,791
         Help, help me!         

1348
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:12,460
 - You can scream all you want, 

1349
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:16,764
      nobody can hear you!      

1350
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,900
    (ominous ambient music)     

1351
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:22,603
           (sobbing)            

1352
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:23,805
             Ready?             

1353
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,073
              Huh?              

1354
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:25,940
            - Wait!             

1355
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:26,874
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!     

1356
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:27,742
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!     

1357
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:28,743
     - [Austin] Baby, baby!     

1358
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:29,844
   This is my favorite part.    

1359
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,512
           (laughter)           

1360
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:35,049
            - Baby?             

1361
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,618
    (ominous ambient music)     

1362
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,357
    - Gevorg, what the fuck?    

1363
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,792
    (ominous ambient music)     

1364
01:12:56,473 --> 01:13:00,007
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1365
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,944
      - What the fuck,          
      where were you guys?      

1366
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,013
   - We had to wait for the     
   cavalry to show up Jimmy.    

1367
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,917
       - So what's next,        
       what are we doing?       

1368
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,120
     - You're going to take     
     the money to Roy's.        

1369
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,091
    Look, I promised him        
    the money for the info.     

1370
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:21,796
       Then we ripped his       
       fingernail out.          

1371
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:25,733
Then I guess you could say that 

1372
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,635
     I needed an                
     insurance policy too.      

1373
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:30,405
    (ominous ambient music)     

1374
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,087
           Thank you.           

1375
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,054
        I appreciate it.        

1376
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:48,489
   I'll call you later okay?    

1377
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:49,924
            Thanks.             

1378
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:59,434
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1379
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:04,472
  You alright with this, huh?   

1380
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:07,175
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1381
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,913
     - So basically I have      
     to convince this guy       

1382
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:14,048
       that I'm going to        
       give up my life,         

1383
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,516
    and give him the kidney?    

1384
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,686
         - [Tommy] Yea.         

1385
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,022
           Basically.           

1386
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,525
  - What if he doesn't buy it?  

1387
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,763
  - Look Jimmy, just play it    
  like we talked about, okay?   

1388
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,132
   Assure him, reassure him.    

1389
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:32,800
         Convince him.          

1390
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,837
      - He's just going to      
      give me 150 grand?        

1391
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:38,072
 - Yea, if you can convince him 
 that you're willing to die.    

1392
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,074
     I think he will, yes.      

1393
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:43,144
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1394
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:46,147
     You can do this Jimmy.     

1395
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,584
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1396
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,087
      - And I don't value       
      my life that much,        

1397
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:54,755
         I never have.          

1398
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:56,591
    But just so we're clear,    

1399
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,892
      I'm not asking you,       

1400
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,260
        I'm telling you.        

1401
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:00,828
     I need a little time.      

1402
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,233
    (ominous ambient music)     

1403
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,279
   - He needs a little money,   

1404
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:19,780
 and you're going to drive him. 

1405
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,117
- And we'll just meet back here?

1406
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:24,752
       - [Lorenzo] Yea.         
            - Okay.             

1407
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,255
We're going to let him keep it? 

1408
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:30,291
      - What do you think?      

1409
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:32,760
    (tense orchestral music)    

1410
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,930
      - I don't know, he        
      seems alright to me.      

1411
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,067
And if he brings us the package.

1412
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:43,170
       - Shame it had to        
       go down like this.       

1413
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:44,238
             - Yea.             

1414
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,040
    (tense orchestral music)    

1415
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,646
    Could have been any of      
    us back in the day, huh?    

1416
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:53,981
        - But it wasn't.        

1417
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,151
    (tense orchestral music)    

1418
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,153
  - Alright, well I should go.  

1419
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,773
         - If the kid,          

1420
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:03,324
     so much as hints that      
     he's going to book,        

1421
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:04,959
            do him.             

1422
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,027
            - Okay.             

1423
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:06,994
      - You got two hours.      

1424
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,196
     I'll go get the money.     

1425
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,632
    (tense orchestral music)    

1426
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,007
      (crickets chirping)       

1427
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:20,975
  - So you talked to your guy,  

1428
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:22,310
      he knows what to do?      

1429
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,345
- I told him exactly what to do.

1430
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:27,715
- But I mean, you're confident? 

1431
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:29,249
   I mean you trust him that    
   he can do this, right?       

1432
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:32,153
      - He said he would.       

1433
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:33,020
       - Alright, but,          
       you know, this has       

1434
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:34,188
    got to look real Jimmy.     

1435
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,289
       If this is going         
       to work, you know,       

1436
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,924
     for both of us, okay?      

1437
01:16:38,161 --> 01:16:39,927
     - Don't worry, this        
     guy's a perfectionist.     

1438
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,863
     (tense ambient music)      

1439
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,198
        - He better be.         

1440
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,134
     (tense ambient music)      

1441
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:41,989
     (pounding on the door)     

1442
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,392
 - [Jimmy] Here's her address.  

1443
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:46,260
       Promise me you'll        
       give it to her.          

1444
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:48,863
           - Jesus.             
         - Promise me!          

1445
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,865
       - Jesus, I promise       
       man, I promise!          

1446
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:53,300
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1447
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,429
   - I don't have much time.    

1448
01:18:23,066 --> 01:18:24,398
     - Yo Jimmy, wait man!      

1449
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,469
     I got something I got      
     to say before you go.      

1450
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,406
     After my mother died,      

1451
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:37,778
   my father and I were never   
   really the same, you know?   

1452
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:44,218
     And I know that he saw     
     you as more of a son       

1453
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,953
      than he ever saw me.      

1454
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:48,122
       And that was hard.       

1455
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:54,395
   I never got to say           
   goodbye to my father, man.   

1456
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,935
    And I know you did right    
    by him when he was sick.    

1457
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:06,407
    And I never got a chance    
    to thank you for that.      

1458
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:11,412
  So in case for some reason,   

1459
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,882
  I don't ever see you again,   

1460
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,119
        I love you man.         

1461
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:21,021
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1462
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,435
      You sure you're           
      going to be alright?      

1463
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:36,537
           You sure?            

1464
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:37,872
        - Yea, I'm sure.        

1465
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:41,008
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1466
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:04,865
           (sobbing)            

1467
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,235
           (gunshot)            

1468
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:11,539
    (ominous ambient music)     

1469
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,509
 - [Lorenzo] Take care of this. 

1470
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,914
    (ominous ambient music)     

1471
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:24,451
           (panting)            

1472
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:27,388
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1473
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,828
    - [Tommy] It's alright.     

1474
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:36,363
          You alright?          

1475
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,999
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1476
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,451
     You did good, come on.     

1477
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,120
            Come on!            

1478
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,856
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1479
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:03,290
     Come on, walk it off.      

1480
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,392
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1481
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:06,293
              Woo.              

1482
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,428
        (Jimmy coughing)        

1483
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:08,495
            Alright.            

1484
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:10,998
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1485
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:19,006
        (Tommy humming)         

1486
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:23,577
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1487
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:49,637
     (dramatic piano music)     

1488
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:00,681
             Ready?             

1489
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:03,050
     (dramatic piano music)     

1490
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:44,692
             (bang)             

1491
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:48,329
              Hey.              

1492
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,169
          You alright?          

1493
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:57,304
         You did good.          

1494
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,653
        - So that's it?         

1495
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,457
       - Unless she dies        
       Jimmy, and then          

1496
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:17,758
  I'm going to come find you.   

1497
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:20,227
          - She won't.          

1498
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:21,595
             - Yea.             

1499
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:25,099
        But if she does.        

1500
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:28,736
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1501
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,144
        Oh my goodness.         

1502
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:38,512
           (chuckles)           

1503
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:40,381
   You know Jimmy, you and I    

1504
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:41,382
       actually made a          
       pretty good team.        

1505
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:43,550
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1506
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:47,721
   - Can I ask you something?   

1507
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:49,189
        - [Tommy] Sure.         

1508
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,059
        - Why'd you want        
        to work with me?        

1509
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,361
          - I didn't.           

1510
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,133
 Jimmy, I did this for Sierra.  

1511
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:01,602
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1512
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,704
    - Lorenzo's little girl?    

1513
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:06,106
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1514
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:11,512
    - Yea, Lorenzo's her        
    father,you know, but...     

1515
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,450
     She's my little girl.      

1516
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:20,320
            - I see.            

1517
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,558
  - He wasn't lying, you know?  

1518
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:25,759
He would have killed you Jimmy, 

1519
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:27,094
   he would have killed you.    

1520
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:28,695
    He wouldn't have            
    thought twice about it.     

1521
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:30,564
           You know?            

1522
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,432
   But then we would have       
   lost the package and I...    

1523
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:34,234
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1524
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:36,804
          I just, I...          

1525
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:38,405
     I couldn't have that.      

1526
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:41,608
    And I'm sure he gave        
    you a great performance     

1527
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,710
   when he was                  
   interrogating you, but...    

1528
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,549
       Truth is, he is a        
       horrible father.         

1529
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:52,853
       - So you love her?       

1530
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:54,822
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1531
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,367
  - Can't have kids of my own.  

1532
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:12,840
        And it's not her        
        fault, you know?        

1533
01:25:12,842 --> 01:25:14,308
    It's not her fault that     

1534
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,144
    her father's a gangster,    
    and mom was a whore.        

1535
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:21,515
   And she can say, you know?   

1536
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,519
      It's not her fault.       

1537
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,759
      I don't know Jimmy.       

1538
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,659
     There's no playbook        
     for this type of shit.     

1539
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:35,729
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1540
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,766
I didn't like letting you walk, 

1541
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:43,303
   after what you did to Lou.   

1542
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:49,209
      Like I said,              
      there's no playbook.      

1543
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,513
      All I know is that,       

1544
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:54,448
  in this line of work, you...  

1545
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:55,849
    You make the guy that's     
    got the thing you want,     

1546
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,417
     you make him an ally.      

1547
01:25:58,721 --> 01:25:59,887
         Not an enemy.          

1548
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:03,757
    That's how I played it.     

1549
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:06,860
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

1550
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:10,814
 - Well I hope you know that I  

1551
01:26:10,815 --> 01:26:11,864
     never would have taken     
     this job if I had          

1552
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:13,901
known what the package was for. 

1553
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:18,839
     - Doesn't matter now.      

1554
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:22,876
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1555
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:28,782
             Here.              

1556
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:31,952
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1557
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:40,360
     - Time to cash in          
     that insurance policy?     

1558
01:26:42,932 --> 01:26:44,398
             - Yea.             

1559
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:48,569
       I want you to call       
       me when it's done.       

1560
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,871
             Okay?              

1561
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:54,608
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1562
01:26:58,714 --> 01:26:59,846
           Hey Jimmy.           

1563
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,818
      You asked me, but...      

1564
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:07,821
        Why'd you do it?        

1565
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:10,724
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1566
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:14,328
  - It was the ultimate boost.  

1567
01:27:14,863 --> 01:27:17,965
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1568
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:22,269
      - You disappear kid.      

1569
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:24,805
    (dramatic ambient music)    

1570
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:37,651
       (door chimes ring)       

1571
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:40,821
      - Back the fuck up!       

1572
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:42,489
          Take a seat!          

1573
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,324
       - Jimmy, Jimmy,          
       take it easy man!        

1574
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:45,425
        - Take it easy?         

1575
01:27:45,995 --> 01:27:47,728
  - Please, have a seat Jimmy.  

1576
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,496
- I'm not sitting anymore today.

1577
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:51,365
     I don't want to talk,      
     I just want my money.      

1578
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,899
          Pick it up!           

1579
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,335
          Open it up!           

1580
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:00,540
            Shut it!            

1581
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:02,843
           - Please.            

1582
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:04,711
      Now, come on, Jimmy.      

1583
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:05,879
      - [Jimmy] Fuck you.       

1584
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,016
         - Do you mind?         

1585
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:11,285
         - Do it slow!          

1586
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:16,023
    - You know I lied Jimmy.    

1587
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,060
           - No shit!           

1588
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:21,595
      - About the tequila.      

1589
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:23,864
       It's really cheap.       

1590
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:25,499
 - All tastes like shit to me.  

1591
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:28,435
- Okay, one last request, amigo.

1592
01:28:31,507 --> 01:28:32,873
  How did we end up this way?   

1593
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,643
     - I guess I got lucky.     

1594
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:38,912
   - I don't believe in luck.   

1595
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:41,014
  - You could use some by now.  

1596
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:43,550
      - Hey you don't           
      have to do this man,      

1597
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:44,785
      you got your money.       

1598
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,953
      - And you almost got      
      me killed, twice!         

1599
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,723
   - Hey, it wasn't personal!   

1600
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:50,724
         - How's that?          

1601
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,092
           - Lorenzo.           

1602
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,361
   Killed my cousin Graciela.   

1603
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:57,331
      This was my first         
      chance to get even.       

1604
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,900
       - Why me, why the        
       bullshit story?          

1605
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:03,370
- I wanted to get rid of Austin.

1606
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,940
      I figured Lorenzo's       
      guys would kill him.      

1607
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:09,810
     And I was hoping you'd     
     get away, and you did!     

1608
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:11,011
   - You're a terrible liar.    

1609
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,846
   But it doesn't matter now.   

1610
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:15,048
I'm not killing you for Lorenzo.

1611
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,384
  He already thinks I'm dead.   

1612
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:19,953
   - So Tommy gets his wish.    

1613
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:22,356
  At the hands of a dead man.   

1614
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,591
    - These things play out.    

1615
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,793
 - That's why I like you Jimmy. 

1616
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,096
     'Cause you're smarter      
     than the average bear.     

1617
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,898
      But let me give you       
      a word of advice.         

1618
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,066
        For the future.         

1619
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:36,970
      You wear your heart       
      on you sleeve.            

1620
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:40,440
    And that makes you weak.    

1621
01:29:43,912 --> 01:29:46,046
        - So my life was        
        worth 500 grand?        

1622
01:29:46,982 --> 01:29:49,116
     And now I'm buying it      
     back for a lot more.       

1623
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:53,053
   - You would have done the    
   same thing in my position.   

1624
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:55,021
         - Hard to say.         

1625
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,125
         - Salut Jimmy.         

1626
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:00,093
          - Salut Roy.          

1627
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,429
           (gunshot)            

1628

           (humming)            

1629
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:10,003
      (cell phone buzzing)      

1630
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:14,508
            - Hello?            

1631
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,576
          - It's done.          

1632
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:20,414
     - No, sorry, you got       
     the wrong number, bud.
