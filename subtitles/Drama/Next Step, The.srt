1
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Move over

2
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Hey this is Luke

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
this is my film

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
let me ask you a couple of questions

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,320
why do you dance?

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
because it’s like

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
breathing, it’s like walking to me

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,600
I’m not pretending, and
when I dance, I don’t pretend

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,720
I’m more myself when I dance
then any other moment in the day

10
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,760
I dance to become someone else

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,800
there is a so many things in this
world want to push down on you

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,920
but when you dance you're free

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,560
we started dancing at the age of 7

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,240
in our house, in the living room

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,560
just dancing dancing copy
ah copy Michael Jackson

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,800
and I’m just like listening to
the music in the grocery store

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
just like dancing to the
elvis and stuff like this

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,360
she is like.. contain
yourself! calm down

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,960
and I’m like, I can’t stop, I
have to do it, I have to do it

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,680
after every bodies went to sleep I would

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,560
open the garage and just practice

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,040
that’s pretty much when I knew like

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,960
I love it, because I never detected so
much time and efforts to something like that

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,440
it’s not like just jumping
around dance has vocabulary

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920
I’m from Argentina

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Miami
- Florida

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
there is a allot of gangs and violent

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
my village was attacked

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,720
my parent didn’t even
want me around anymore

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
she actually kicked me out of the house

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,840
I have to go

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,960
dance save me

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,440
dance definitely saved me

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
look if it wasn’t for dance, I
don’t know what we'll doing right now

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
I didn’t have anything
I don’t have money

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,280
I was sleeping with 15 dollars a week

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,400
dance brought us together to

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,320
all around the world, we're here

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
the truth is everybody
is a dancer for him self

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,360
we all have a heart beat

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,880
I have a rhythm inside me.. be be be be

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320

43
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,160

its sound stupid but I do feel like that

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,560
and if we listened hard enough

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,960

all plugged into the same song

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680

00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:57,566
my parents used to be dancers and they
started this place for people like them

312
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,726
but they didn’t just want
to be a back up dancers

313
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:05,766
you know, do their own
thing build their own respect

314
00:38:07,006 --> 00:38:09,566
I thought that was cool so I
wanted to carry on the tradition

315
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:12,046
in my own way but for them you know

316
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:17,406
so what is they think of you
turning this place into a mad house

317
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:22,326
they never get to see it

318
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:30,486
I’m so sorry

319
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:32,846
no don’t be, it’s okay

320
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:36,046
so that’s why you so
devoted to this place?

321
00:38:37,126 --> 00:38:38,526
carrying on what your parents wanted

322
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:39,766
family are family

323
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:43,246
you know, the vault used to
be their life and now it’s mine

324
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:46,966
it’s amazing what we do
for families sometimes

325
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,006
so tell me about your parents

326
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:51,966

327
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:54,766
and me and my older brother

328
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:00,526

now? we're still close

329
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:02,566

okay, you got to stop complaining oh I’m sorry,
I just feel ridiculous holding this giant cup

357
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:31,647
whoever said that it was okay to have
small, medium, large and then giant-enormous

358
00:41:32,687 --> 00:41:37,087
hey look; that’s you

359
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,887
what you talking about? this
guy looks exactly like you

360
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:40,767
no he doesn’t

361
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:44,127
look he's got a camera popping out of his
head he's got the pretty little chin bones

362
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,447
he does not look anything like me and
I will not ... to those controverters

363
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,127
I’ve seen your works and you don’t ...

364
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,727
yeah but just for fun it’s
not something professional

365
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:57,127
well what if the pirates
and the rivalry didn’t exist?

366
00:41:57,127 --> 00:42:00,047
wouldn’t you give your
film making a shot?

367
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:02,607
that film academy sounds amazing

368
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,007
yeah but it’s not an option

369
00:42:04,007 --> 00:42:05,927
so I don’t think about it

370
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:08,087
the world jams are my main focus

371
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:11,247
okay you should tell
me then how you do it?

372
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:12,247

373
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:13,927

374
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:17,127
I don’t know, I just try to see
things that people don’t really see

375
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:20,367

376
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:23,167

382
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:29,927

387
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:41,127

so I hope you're prepared

388
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:42,887
hey we've got a problem

389
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:45,807
no problems man this is
round 2 you got to be there

390
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:49,047
we can’t have any missing links so we
won’t be eliminated from the world jam

391
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:51,887
I know, I have a test

you how much this test counts

395
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:10,287

407
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:02,568
why its online?

408
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:04,728
it cannot be they know our whole set

409
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:06,728
what do you mean? who would
do that? Julian and the samurai

410
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:09,808
how could they get our rehearsal
footage does everyone has their DVDs?

411
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,568
they're just staling it alright we
just got to figure something else

412
00:50:16,168 --> 00:50:16,928
okay you see there?

413
00:50:16,928 --> 00:50:20,088
if you could just let go on
that spin we can Laing this thing

414
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:22,568
those guys may have our
tapes but that won’t stop us

415
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:23,568
trust me

416
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,808
Luke I don’t know

417
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:27,848
maybe somebody else should do it

418
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,568
if we pull this off
we'll kill on the stage

419
00:50:30,568 --> 00:50:32,048
Julian won’t even know what hit him

420
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,888
whatever happened between you two?

421
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:39,528
me and Julian?

422
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:42,088
he used to be a pirate

423
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:46,208
we used to be best friend back on the
days but as time were on I think he changed

424
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,808
how do you mean he changed?

425
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:49,888
we found out he had a gambling problem

426
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:53,328
he run out in bad bets, so desperate
that he bets against his own house

427
00:50:53,328 --> 00:50:54,928
and threw the battle to win the bet

428
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,488
he threw a battle to win a bet?

429
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:59,528
the whole house was devastated
so we had to kick him out

430
00:50:59,528 --> 00:51:02,248
he is been trying to
take us down ever since

431
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:06,248
the crazy thing is if we don’t win
the world jam he can actually do it

432
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:51,128
hey, welcome home

433
00:51:51,128 --> 00:51:52,648
you lied to me

434
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,888
you told me Luke kicked you
out because he was jealous

435
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:57,928
but it wasn’t that, was it?

436
00:51:57,928 --> 00:52:00,008
you threw a battle for a bet!?

437
00:52:00,008 --> 00:52:02,728
Natalie, you have to don’t I
went in there for you Julian

438
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:05,568
I can’t believe you stole
that DVD and put it online

439
00:52:05,568 --> 00:52:06,488
what you talking about?

440
00:52:06,488 --> 00:52:08,368
what kind of BS that
you said about me now

441
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:09,848
Luke was jealous

442
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:12,128
he want it to be the
leader so he kicked me out

443
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,688
he used me and he kicked me out

444
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:20,689
I’m sorry

445
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:24,529
we have to stick together
Natalie you know that

446
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:26,729
I don’t like to be lied too

447
00:52:28,009 --> 00:52:29,689
I just want our house
to win the world jam

448
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:30,969

449
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:34,209
we have too much in
this we work too hard

450
00:52:34,169 --> 00:52:37,569
despite what mom and dad said doesn’t
always have to be about winning

451
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:39,089
you start to sound like him

452
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,489
you need to check your self and
remember whose side you're on

453
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:42,769
freaking ridiculous

454
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:45,769
you know Luke isn’t some monster Julian

455
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:48,169
he is a good guy he takes care
of the people that he loves

456
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:49,129
who you goanna believe?

457
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,129
him or your family?

458
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:52,489
you goanna talk to me about family?

459
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:54,809
when Luke is not even related
to any of those dancers

460
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:57,809
he would never lie
to them oh I’m a liar?

461
00:52:57,809 --> 00:52:59,649
what about you?

462
00:52:59,649 --> 00:53:04,329
how do you think your precious Luke is goanna feel
when he finds out that you have been playing him?

463
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:06,289
actually now that I think of it

464
00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:09,249
you should come clean

465
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:11,929
that might be just what I need to
throw a game off for world champ.

466
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:14,969
thanks sis you really helped me

467
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:19,889
I’m not putting a man on the
street over some stupid rivalry

468
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:24,089
I will not be part of it

469
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,809
Jacob, you scared me

470
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:44,209
you don’t seem like a
girl that get easily scared

471
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:51,529
tell Luke I’m sorry

472
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:58,369
you have a choice you know

473
00:54:02,649 --> 00:54:03,889
it’s not that easy

474
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:07,209
the most important decisions
in life were never easy

475
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:26,049
dance can reveal a lot about a person

476
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:28,809
the way they move, the
way they learn new steps

477
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:30,649
I mean if you were dancing for real

478
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,969
it comes from the most
truthful parts of your self

479
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,769
I dance to express how I feel inside

480
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:40,609
whether its anger, happiness, loneliness

481
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:49,329
this is where I feel safe, is where
I belong this where my family is

482
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:51,409
this place is very special, is our world

483
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:54,889
finally, well I have some
place where I can be my self

484
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:58,409
people said that you don’t
really choose your family we did

485
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:00,689
if you want to be one
of us Luke will find you

486
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:49,249
Luke why would she just leave like this?

487
00:55:49,249 --> 00:55:50,409
I don’t know

488
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:53,169
but for the moment we got
bigger problem than that

489
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:56,129
the bank put the house in the auction

490
00:55:56,129 --> 00:55:57,009
what?

491
00:55:57,009 --> 00:55:58,929
they're selling it

492
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:02,529
hey look I’m goanna
deal with this alright

493
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:07,249
what the hell wait? hey
Luke, how are ya? sit down

494
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:08,409
I don’t want to sit down

495
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:10,689
Luke, I understand
how hard this might be

496
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:13,049
if you can just wait a few
days we'll have the money

497
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:15,009
you're 5 month behind on your morgage

498
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:19,289
unless you can catch up with your payments I’m
afraid there is nothing more I can do for you

499
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:23,689
ware house is in prime property and the bank
is well aware what its goanna go for an auction

500
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:24,809
I need more times

501
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:28,489
I see it can get them to suspend the
closure but don’t get your hopes up

502
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:31,649
I can take your ware house today Luke

503
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:34,329
I guess that never goanna
happen cause it’s not for sale

504
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:39,449
look what I just got from Natalie

505
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:41,489
wait what is it mean?

506
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:44,529
I don’t know, but I’m goanna find out

507
00:56:48,689 --> 00:56:51,849
come with me me? yeah I need you

508
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:55,769
I have a Halloween party I
mean I would but I can’t miss it

509
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:58,089
college parties start late I
get you back in time I promise

510
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:00,409
I supposed to be Ashley Olsen man

511
00:57:00,169 --> 00:57:04,289

long to get straighten my hair

Luke, I’m so glad you made it

533
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:26,970

535

to come and celebrate the birthday

537
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,130

c'mon I got caught up great, thanks

552
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:48,890
I’ve been dancing

553
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,410
before school, during school and after

554
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:02,610
so you've been lying to me and
dishing me for some secret life

555
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,690
I mean you could have at least told me

556
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:13,290
but I guess I’m not important
enough in your new cool life to know

557
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,890
I should I’ve just told you

558
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,530
I know.. I’m sorry okay

559
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,530
and it’s all over now

560
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:28,050
you're right, it’s over now

561
01:03:54,491 --> 01:03:56,571

01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:13,371

01:11:51,452 --> 01:11:53,612
you were born to dance

610
01:11:53,612 --> 01:11:56,452
give it up, you're suck

611
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,932

612
01:12:02,892 --> 01:12:06,332

613
01:12:06,332 --> 01:12:11,012
I’m a good dancer but
moose you're a great dancer

614
01:12:11,012 --> 01:12:16,692
my parents give up everything so
you wouldn’t have to, I know.. I know

615
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,212
we can figure this out

616
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:19,972
together

617
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,292

01:12:33,692 --> 01:12:34,532

619
01:12:34,172 --> 01:12:37,532

620
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:38,532
what you doing here?

621
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:43,572
and I still think we should go to
the world jam to get the house back

622
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:45,572
and you are out of your mind

623
01:12:45,572 --> 01:12:46,572
I thought that’s why you like me

624
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,532
yeah but you still crazy cause
we have nobodies left but I’m here

625
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:55,692
Luke, you're the only one that can get
everybody back together to save your house

626
01:12:55,692 --> 01:12:59,572
the pirates need your leadership,
that’s it they don’t need me

627
01:13:01,572 --> 01:13:02,852
you really don’t know what you've done!

628
01:13:02,852 --> 01:13:06,932
Luke, you gave these people a place so they can
live up their dreams and be what they really are

629
01:13:06,932 --> 01:13:09,212
sit down man dude, I got table to work

630
01:13:11,452 --> 01:13:12,332
its better be quick

631
01:13:12,332 --> 01:13:14,372
you never ask me why I ever dance!?

632
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:16,252
you want to know why

633
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,652
I dance because dance
could change things

634
01:13:21,132 --> 01:13:22,652
one move

635
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:25,452
can set a whole
generation free like Elvis

636
01:13:27,412 --> 01:13:30,452
one move can make you believe
like you're something more

637
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:38,012
moose sit down before you
make a fool of both of us

638
01:13:41,132 --> 01:13:42,692
and some moves

639
01:13:49,532 --> 01:13:51,052

Luke, I’m so sorry

718
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:14,414
I know I lied to you

719
01:23:16,494 --> 01:23:20,334
but everything we had was real

720
01:23:20,854 --> 01:23:22,294
I’m leaving tomorrow

721
01:23:24,294 --> 01:23:26,254
I’m taking a train to California

722
01:23:26,254 --> 01:23:30,014
and I would not have the
courage to do that without you

723
01:23:30,774 --> 01:23:39,174
I know you have train too this
is crazy, but come with me?

726
01:24:01,254 --> 01:24:05,254

729
01:25:04,214 --> 01:25:08,094
here comes the samurai

730
01:25:45,894 --> 01:25:47,854
oh oh, this is personal

731
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:48,975
samurai wipe up the
floor with these guys

732
01:28:48,975 --> 01:28:52,935
it looks like it’s over it
looks like it’s over people

733
01:28:55,575 --> 01:28:58,535
hey, we can take him

734
01:28:58,535 --> 01:29:00,375

yourself, we're not ready

735
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:02,215
you can trust me

736
01:29:09,575 --> 01:29:10,895
oh what’s this?

737
01:29:10,895 --> 01:29:12,535
the pirates has answer back

738
01:29:12,535 --> 01:29:14,295
get off the stage

739
01:29:16,335 --> 01:29:17,615
stop it what you doing?

740
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:22,855
what happen to family?
this is my family Julian

741
01:29:24,815 --> 01:29:26,735
lets come back to business people

742
01:33:14,696 --> 01:33:21,336
but now it’s time for our judges to
decide whose going home with this 100,000 $

743
01:33:21,336 --> 01:33:24,216
judges; are you ready with the decision?

744
01:33:24,216 --> 01:33:30,256
whose flag you goanna raise? black & gold for
the samurai or red and black for the pirates

745
01:33:32,376 --> 01:33:34,136
pirates

746
01:33:36,816 --> 01:33:45,456
oh my god, the house of pirates are
the winner of the first annual world jam

747
01:33:46,296 --> 01:33:53,176
it’s over, 100,000 $
to the house of pirates

748
01:34:41,496 --> 01:34:45,456
you can go if you want to, I will take
care of everything until you get back

749
01:34:45,456 --> 01:34:49,176
you give us a chance to live our dreams

750
01:34:49,176 --> 01:34:53,936
and now it’s time for you
to go and live your dreams

751
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,856
you know some famous guy once said

752
01:35:15,856 --> 01:35:19,536
to travel is better than to arrive

753
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:22,616
and I was like, what?

754
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:23,616
maybe because I used to think that there is only
one path to take to what you goanna be in life

755
01:35:29,096 --> 01:35:33,656
but if you choose that one path it
doesn’t mean you have to ban the other ones

756
01:35:33,656 --> 01:35:39,176
I realize that if I see what
happen along the way that counts

757
01:35:41,976 --> 01:35:48,336
to stumbles, no any falls and pressures

758
01:35:48,336 --> 01:35:53,616
it’s your journey not to destination

759
01:35:53,376 --> 01:36:01,096
you kind of, I guess, trust that the
future will work so fine like it suppose to

760
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,576
but I’m ready to jamb

761
01:36:07,576 --> 01:36:15,856
what you're asking for here is a
double major in engineering and dance

762
01:36:15,856 --> 01:36:20,336

763
01:36:31,816 --> 01:36:32,936
