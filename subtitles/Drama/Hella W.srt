2
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:02,497
We believe Mrs. Wuolijoki
is actively working for the NKVD.

3
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,583
The Russians call her the Poet.

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,879
We also heard she's an operative
for Germany, or Japan.

5
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:14,676
Yesterday she visited the Medea
office in Helsinki. - What is it?

6
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,555
A front set up by her sister
Salme Dutt, a communist spy.

00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:28,440
Lady Muriel Paget, a British agent
and a guest at Wuolijoki's home.

9
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:32,361
The British businessman
she helped enter the country.

10
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,739
Obvious connections with Ml6.

11
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,159
I'm sorry.
We have reason to believe -

12
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:44,081
that Mrs. Wuolijoki
works for the British.

Finnish State Police
Helsinki 1929

14
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,212
Moscow and London
give us conflicting information.

15
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,423
We have to know
who that woman is spying for!

16
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,803
God only knows. Lately,
she's been focusing on her business.

17
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,808
Buying sawmills and petrol stations,
importing Russian films to Finland.

18
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:07,521
Raivio, I want everything
we have on Wuolijoki. - Virtanen!

19
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:24,621
The lady seems to travel a lot.
- We need the lady for questioning.

20
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,203
I could've become
the leader of Turkestan -

21
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:52,584
as soon as I'd negotiated loans for
their coffee and cotton plantations.

22
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:59,049
I would've had all the power,
even military power. I told them no.

23
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,097
I told them thank you,
but no thank you.

24
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,768
I am first and foremost
a businesswoman.

25
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:14,273
<i>My mother was the most successful
businesswoman in Helsinki.</i>

26
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,693
<i>She was able to supply anything.</i>

27
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,280
<i>After the war, everything sold.</i>

28
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,783
Commissar Krasin
has already appointed me.

29
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,704
I would've had all the power,
including military power.

30
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,429
<i>My father.</i>

31
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:51,018
<i>The esteemed Member of Parliament,
lawyer, journalist, Master of Arts.</i>

32
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,704
Where's my wife?
- She's with guests, sir.

33
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:55,958
I'm not so drunk
that you need to beat me! - No.

34
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,002
Except all week,
and on Sunday and Monday.

35
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:03,340
You told people I was in a delirium
and you'd called the police.

36
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,553
What can one do when
someone's raging like an animal?

37
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:14,393
No one has ever called me an animal,
and neither will you again.

38
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,564
I made you a woman, Ella Murrik!

39
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,402
I dreamed of you
not so long ago.

40
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:29,241
I cried and ranted,
because I was afraid you'd leave me.

41
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:35,038
We agreed to build our life
together, but you deceived me.

42
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:42,796
I could leave,
without any scandal or revenge.

43
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,093
Go on my way, and no one
would notice! For a while.

44
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,729
<i>Me, ten years old.</i>

45
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:08,030
I would've become a man
with so little.

46
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,533
But not in the way you thought.

47
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:19,333
I bought the Marlebäck mansion,
in litti.

48
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:25,399
We'll use these only on Sundays.
- No, we'll eat from them every day.

49
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,501
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

50
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,799
Do you understand? - Yes.

51
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:57,181
Good. - I read it in the paper
four weeks ago.

52
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,002
Annual exports rose to
20,000 standards.

53
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:31,798
How did you get a loan
from the Bank of England?

54
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,717
I'm a good talker.

55
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,315
<i>The state police
were watching my mother-</i>

56
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:52,110
<i>because of her connections
with the Soviet Union.</i>

57
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:48,000
10 years later

58
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,594
<i>Mother was always
away on business -</i>

59
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:02,055
<i>all around Europe
and the Soviet Union.</i>

60
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,475
<i>I grew up alone in the mansion.</i>

61
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,617
What are you clattering here for?
- I got hungry at the sawmill.

62
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,871
You made Jussi pick you up
in the middle of the night.

63
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:31,418
Jussi didn't complain.
Give me some milk, Vappu.

64
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:42,387
No one dares complain.
- Why not? I'm a democratic person.

65
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:47,351
You know that I abide by
a socialist world view.

66
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,480
Next year, I'll have
2,400 workers at the sawmill.

67
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,942
Do you pay Jussi a salary?
- I educated him.

68
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,948
I paid for his books and gave him
money whenever he needed it.

69
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,494
Klaara, does Hella pay you a salary?

70
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:10,666
I taught Klaara to be independent.

71
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:16,880
I have 8-hour working days,
collective supervisors, open books.

72
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,676
We're like one big family.
I've earned all I've got.

73
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,429
Don't eat so much,
you'll become shapeless.

74
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,684
Did I raise you to talk
to your mother like that?

75
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:33,981
<i>You didn't raise me.
Fräulein raised me.</i>

76
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:52,791
110,000 logs came from Russia,
but they have a seller's market.

77
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,461
We'll see once the invoice arrives.
The bank trusts me.

78
00:13:56,545 --> 00:14:00,299
Have you applied for
an extension on the fee payments?

79
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,802
What's the rush?
- We haven't paid them for two years.

80
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:09,224
No, we haven't. - The bank wants us
to at least pay the interest.

81
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:14,438
Let them show up at my door.
And why did they contact you?

82
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,192
You ignore them,
even though you owe millions.

83
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:23,363
That's right. - You seem to follow
your own rules, Madam.

84
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:33,457
<i>0ctober 29, 1929.
Black Tuesday.</i>

85
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,210
<i>The New York Stock Exchange
is in a panic.</i>

86
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:40,088
<i>Frantic investors have scrambled
to unload their stocks.</i>

87
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,008
<i>Everyone wants to sell,
no one wants to buy.</i>

88
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,429
<i>Suddenly the most gilt-edged
securities are valueless.</i>

89
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:52,309
<i>The stock market crash has come,
and the Great Depression...</i>

90
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:08,158
Ask the bank for an extension
on the interest payment.

91
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:13,580
I already did, a few months ago.
- That was then. Ask again.

92
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:19,294
Take these to the pawn shop,
but tell them not to sell them yet.

93
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:23,173
You should pawn this too.

94
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,220
Not that. It's a keepsake.

95
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,228
It's just an object.
You should let go.

96
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,649
You should sell Marlebäck.
- Never.

97
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,987
Well, start writing then.

98
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:54,746
White Finland wouldn't dare
produce a play by Hella Wuolijoki.

99
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,680
<i>Mother decided to write
under a pen name.</i>

100
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:17,311
<i>First, she was Felix Tuli.
Then, Juhani Tervapää.</i>

101
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:25,235
<i>Her first play had been published
20 years earlier -</i>

102
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,198
<i>but it was banned
in Helsinki and Tallinn.</i>

103
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:40,125
<i>The pen name allowed her to avoid
censorship and prejudice.</i>

104
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:48,133
<i>We sent plays to publishers
and theatres, here and there.</i>

105
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,220
<i>They were rejected everywhere.</i>

106
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:01,146
<i>We sent one to the most famous
director in the country -</i>

107
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,398
<i>Eino Salmelainen.</i>

108
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,443
Juhani Tervapää,
"Any objections?"

109
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,446
The writer and the play
have original names.

110
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,034
The name of the play is bad,
but the text is brilliant.

111
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,038
With a new playwright, we won't
get in trouble with the union.

112
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:23,669
It's hard to find props
in these financial times.

113
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,755
I'm happy to help
fledgling writers.

114
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,968
Your assistant stage manager
told me -

115
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,887
that I'll get
my furniture back soon.

116
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,599
"The Women of Niskavuori"
won't run very long -

117
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:41,812
even though it's directed
by Eino Salmelainen.

118
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:47,401
"The Women of Niskavuori"
Premiere 1936

119
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:17,848
A marvellous performance.
Congratulations, Mrs. Wuolijoki.

120
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,501
Well, did they slate it?

121
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:09,525
This is sheer praise.
"The Women of Niskavuori".

122
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,869
<i>The judge takes out
a brandy bottle.</i>

123
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:26,542
<i>"Leave the girl be. Her story is sad
in this time of unemployment. "</i>

124
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,255
"Even cigarette factories are
firing people, not to mention..."

125
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:36,718
One moment! - "It's sad that Hulda
is beyond redemption as a citizen."

126
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:40,013
"Women of the streets don't vote."

127
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:46,270
"Hulda is so pretty that
it's unlikely she'll be rescued."

128
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:51,191
Can I take a cigarette break?
- Don't you like that line, Firinä?

129
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,570
I do, but I'd also like a cigarette
and some coffee.

130
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,073
I'll have Hulda make coffee
for the gentlemen.

131
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:02,286
That's a good idea,
isn't it, Firinä?

132
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,874
She doesn't hear or listen.
I wonder if her heart's in this.

133
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:18,010
They won't accept me as a member
of the playwright's union. - Why not?

134
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:23,682
They don't tell why.
- It's political.

135
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:32,608
I wouldn't feel bad.
- I'm not fit to be a Finn.

136
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:36,445
Or an author in this country.

137
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,032
Valued plays
run at the National Theatre -

138
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:45,287
and my plays under an alias at the
People's Theatre, with my furniture.

139
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,168
Give me a cigarette, Vappu.

140
00:20:56,048 --> 00:21:00,594
I'll have Hulda smoke
in the final scene.

141
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,765
Smoke cigarettes and
drink cocktails. What do you think?

142
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,859
THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER

143
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:50,936
<i>What a nice-looking girl.
- A real country girl.</i>

144
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,398
<i>Sitting there
with her plywood box.</i>

145
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,735
<i>I can tell she's
from our part of the country.</i>

146
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,281
<i>I am, and I recognise you,
Mr. Ali-Lehtonen.</i>

147
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:07,411
<i>So you are from Sääksmäki!
- Yes, my name is Hulda Juurakko.</i>

148
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:14,168
<i>Good evening.
I've been eagerly waiting for you.</i>

149
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,838
<i>Are you still going on
with that foolishness?</i>

150
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:23,343
<i>Hulda... a ring isn'
too rich a price for you.</i>

151
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:28,724
<i>Do you honestly believe
I want a ring from you? Never!</i>

152
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:34,229
<i>For seven years, you've been
weighing me up with your eyes.</i>

153
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,485
<i>I honestly don't know
why I like you so much!</i>

154
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,657
<i>I don' want to become your wife.
Do you hear me?</i>

155
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:51,163
<i>You're struggling in vain.
You know that, don' you?</i>

156
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,416
<i>You can' escape it.</i>

157
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:09,389
<i>Mother's plays were
also successful abroad.</i>

158
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:28,242
Ladies and Gentlemen.

159
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,411
One of the top industrialists
in our country -

160
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:35,457
Mrs. Hella Wuolijoki,
is 50 years old today.

161
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:41,421
Her school of life
has been as follows:

162
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:45,467
Cooking school in Estonia,
university in Helsinki...

163
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:51,515
A congratulatory call from America.
Ernestine Evans.

164
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:10,993
<i>The response has been great.
Everybody loves your plays.</i>

165
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:15,497
That's lovely to hear.
- How can such nonsense succeed?

166
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:19,751
<i>But they want to know
if you're a socialist.</i>

167
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:24,131
As my agent, you can tell them
all the great writers are.

168
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,719
<i>Well, I'll tell them.
Happy birthday, Hella.</i>

169
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,431
As we have witnessed -

170
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:36,560
this "factory" can produce
a three-act play in a week.

171
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:43,567
What's more, the factory
has started exporting its products.

172
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:48,864
The trademark Hella Wuolijoki
is already world-famous.

173
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:53,452
Her fatherland congratulates her.

174
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:14,431
This is Hella Wuolijoki's idea of
a person corrupted by capitalism.

175
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,767
Listen to this line, for example:

176
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,230
"Dear Robert, everything that I have
I've paid for in bed."

177
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:26,109
She portrays a society lady
as a street woman and a vampire.

178
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:30,822
This Hilda Harmaalahti
talks and acts like a harlot.

179
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:36,203
Goddammit,
what stuffy sociology! - Right.

180
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:46,004
<i>I always try to forget
stories that end sadly.</i>

181
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:52,469
<i>Do you succeed?
- You're too curious.</i>

182
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:58,559
<i>What was the story then?
- Centuries ago....</i>

183
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,436
Well, what do you think?

184
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:15,784
You didn't have to kill
"Green Gold" at the theatre.

185
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,954
It wasn't your best play.

186
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,419
It's the one dearest to me.

187
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:31,175
But the critics were unanimous.

188
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:37,264
Sentimentality doesn't suit you.
- It's not sentimentality but poetry.

189
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,852
Why don't you
write about yourself?

190
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:48,025
As you are. That would be
a guaranteed success.

191
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,989
I write world literature.

192
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,576
I can't help it
if the audience loves it.

193
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,781
<i>Dear Foreign Minister Tanner.
I escaped the bombs to Marlebäck -</i>

194
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,202
<i>and I've been sitting here
paralysed for three weeks.</i>

195
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,913
<i>The cows need to
be taken care of-</i>

196
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:48,794
<i>but God, isn't there anything more
I could do in this tragedy?</i>

197
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:54,466
<i>Are you attempting
any kind of dialogue with Moscow?</i>

198
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,137
<i>They should be willing
to get out of this situation.</i>

199
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:04,685
<i>I'm one of the few people
they've been friendly with.</i>

200
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:09,398
<i>I'm sure they would
negotiate with me.</i>

201
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:14,361
<i>I can contact the Soviet ambassador
to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai.</i>

202
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,364
You can't afford to say no.

203
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:22,244
Every possibility
must be taken into account.

204
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,293
We can't afford to say no.

205
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:32,004
Every possibility
must be taken into account.

206
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:37,092
<i>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs
of Sweden confirms contact -</i>

207
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,555
<i>between Finland and the Soviet Union
to start negotiations.</i>

208
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,813
<i>Grand Hotel, Stockholm 1 939</i>

209
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:53,609
<i>Foreign Minister Tanner
has been visiting Stockholm.</i>

210
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,403
<i>As an unofficial representative -</i>

211
00:28:56,486 --> 00:29:02,868
<i>Hella Wuolijoki was allowed
to contact the Soviet ambassador-</i>

212
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,913
<i>Madam Kollontai.</i>

213
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,584
How are you, Hella?

214
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,675
Goddammit, Madam Kollontai.

215
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,888
<i>With her contacts,
Mother arranged peace for Finland -</i>

216
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:29,937
<i>but once the official negotiations
started, she was pushed aside.</i>

217
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,194
<i>The situation in Marlebäck
was disastrous.</i>

218
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:42,324
<i>The bank called in the loans.
There was no feed for the cattle.</i>

219
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,786
<i>Mother couldn' pay the bills.</i>

220
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,854
<i>I've cleared
75 hectares of new fields.</i>

221
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,025
<i>Now we have 140 hectares in all.</i>

222
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:24,116
The main building was renovated
in the style of Engel.

223
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:30,122
There are 22 fireplaces,
and 50 hectares of forest.

224
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:36,211
The offer of Director Laaksonen
and Mrs. Rissanen is the best.

225
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,591
Well, the only one.

226
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:50,184
Damn it. I've been managing
this mansion for 20 years.

227
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,770
Do I have to leave it now?

228
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,733
The contents of the house
must be left as they are.

229
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:01,486
That's the condition of the offer.

230
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:24,676
<i>Jokela mansion, January 1 941</i>

231
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:41,610
<i>I live close to Helsinki now.
- Mother tried to assure Tanner -</i>

232
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:46,949
<i>that the Soviet Union would be
a better ally than Germany.</i>

233
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:49,910
Their ambassador's behaviour
suggests different.

234
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:54,039
Terentyev promised to replace him
with someone better.

235
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:58,752
Finland's neutrality will be
rewarded with commercial benefits.

236
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,213
We can guarantee that.

237
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,509
I'll be frank with you.

238
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:10,430
The Soviet Union wants to
focus on more significant matters -

239
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:13,600
and not aggravate
the situation with Finland.

240
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:17,813
So, the Soviets have more
pressing matters to worry about?

241
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:22,818
I should've known better
than to handle politics with women.

242
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,208
<i>Finland is entering another war.</i>

243
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:43,046
<i>Hitler declares that we will fight
the Soviet Union in alliance -</i>

244
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,800
<i>im bunde, with Germany.</i>

245
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:21,585
March 1942

246
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:06,213
Madam Wuolijoki,
there's someone here to see you.

247
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,937
Good evening.
- Good evening.

248
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:29,194
My name is Elina Hämäläinen.
- Who sent you?

249
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:34,616
I'm looking for work.
My husband died in the Winter War.

250
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,423
Do you have children?
- I was ordered to see the Poet.

251
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:53,886
I'm supposed to live here
as a secretary or a maid.

252
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,765
Parachutists are
always caught and shot.

253
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,394
I bring greetings
from Comrade Terentyev.

254
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,617
Who was it?
- Some poor girl, looking for work.

255
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,663
She had injured her foot. I told her
she could spend the night.

256
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:25,459
Where had she injured her foot?

257
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:29,046
Take something warm to drink
to the library.

258
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:50,025
How could peace give the Germans
a foothold in this country?

259
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:54,738
Moscow regrets that they didn't
occupy Finland in the war.

260
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,867
The Soviet Union acted stupidly
after the Winter War.

261
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:01,995
And what has
their propaganda been like?

262
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,873
If only they'd tried
a bit of humour -

263
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,919
but they have no
sense of humour whatsoever.

264
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:14,883
Terentyev sent you this.
It's 10,000 marks.

265
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:21,223
He remembered his debt.
Bertolt Brecht's fare to America.

266
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:26,979
It's not a debt.
It's a reward for the Poet.

267
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:32,234
I'll keep it for you.
- I have my own money. That's yours.

268
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,071
Someone will make a bed for you -

269
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:40,617
but you'll have to leave
first thing tomorrow.

270
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:44,746
My real name isn't
Elina Hämäläinen.

271
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:16,987
I was sent here to find out
the situation in Finland.

272
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,367
<i>How many Germans are there?
- 1 00,000, in Northern Finland.</i>

273
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:27,664
I have to inform Moscow. - They know.
They have contacts with the English.

274
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,543
There's a clever British spy here.
A journalist.

275
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,880
We know that
the Germans are everywhere -

276
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,841
and that they eat
Finland's food supplies.

277
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:43,722
Do you know anything at all?
What's your position?

278
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:51,271
The Germans have their own supplies,
and they buy meat from us.

279
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:54,650
This house has hosted
peace negotiations.

280
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:58,070
You were going to
show me your papers.

281
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:06,119
I don't have
any food or clothes coupons.

282
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:11,166
I don't have food coupons either.
We're a self-sufficient household.

283
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:16,255
I'll come back for my transmitter,
once I've settled.

284
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,424
You'll take your
radio transmitter with you.

285
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:23,887
If they inspect the train,
throw it out of the window.

286
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,057
How can I contact you?

287
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:52,082
Drop her off before the station.
People might recognise the horse.

288
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:11,018
She's about 30 years old.

289
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:17,858
<i>Height... 1 70 centimetres.</i>

290
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:24,698
Dark hair, red lips.
- Thank you, that's enough. Please.

291
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:30,370
You're an exceptionally
perceptive woman.

292
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:33,790
Upstairs and out.

293
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:39,213
In the small hours of March 30th,
a female was parachuted into Vihti.

294
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:43,884
She came to Wuolijoki's mansion
on that evening and spent the night.

295
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:50,224
And Wuolijoki hurried to Stockholm.
- Where's my call to Stockholm?

296
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:57,105
Sofiahemmet Hospital
Stockholm

297
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:00,150
I thought this would
cheer you up.

298
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:03,654
It was nothing serious,
so there'll be no operation.

299
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:07,032
But I should eat more healthily.

300
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,246
You should stay in Sweden.

301
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:16,542
You earn enough money
from your plays.

302
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,878
No one would
harass you anymore.

303
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:24,258
Was I being followed?
Were there policemen outside?

304
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:30,430
The key to the code
is on page six.

305
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:35,602
The Swedish police will stop
when their working day is done.

306
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,152
Can I borrow this?

307
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:49,533
A merry-looking trollop.

308
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:54,246
Mrs. Yartseva is not a trollop,
Raivio. She's a spy.

309
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:58,667
Alexandra Nikolaevna,
or actually Voskresenskaya.

310
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,379
Do any of them
have only one name?

311
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:07,968
I want Wuolijoki charged
with treason. Nothing less.

312
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,812
Why did they send that woman to me?
- What do you mean?

313
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:24,151
The parachutist whom Terentyev sent.
- I don't think he sent anyone.

314
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:29,490
<i>She gave me 1 0,000 marks
and said they were from Terentyev.</i>

315
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,868
We'll take care of her.

316
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:39,958
Find out from Tanner and Paasikivi
if Finland is interested in peace.

317
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:46,507
Here's an English translation
of your play.

318
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,845
There's nothing dangerous in it.
- I can't. They'll search my things.

319
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:57,309
Take it. Unless you want to lose
the Soviet Union's trust.

320
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:00,896
Have a good journey home.

321
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:47,067
Good evening, Mrs. Wuolijoki.

322
00:42:57,286 --> 00:43:01,039
Take that bench down.
I need to lie on my back.

323
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,545
The bench stays where it is.

324
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:12,050
I'm an old woman.
I come straight from hospital.

325
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:22,060
There's not even room to walk.

326
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:10,943
Could you dust them
while you're at it?

327
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:24,623
Did a Soviet parachutist
visit you at Jokela? - No.

328
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:29,753
We heard otherwise. - A woman called
Elina Hämäläinen asked for work.

329
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:32,923
You knew that wasn't her name.
- No, I didn't.

330
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:36,009
Why did you leave
for Sweden right after?

331
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:39,012
I was supposed to have
an operation there.

332
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:43,851
Well, did you?
- No. It wasn't necessary.

333
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:48,230
You know that messages
to the Soviet Union go via Sweden.

334
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:52,401
On what grounds are you holding me?
- Of aiding the enemy.

335
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,197
You met with Soviet diplomats,
or spies, in Sweden.

336
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:59,700
I will prove it.

337
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:04,872
Bring the parachutist here,
so I can see her too.

338
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:09,501
Take Mrs. Wuolijoki
back to her cell.

339
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,674
She knows that
we haven't caught the parachutist.

340
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:20,512
They're always caught.
It's just a matter of time.

341
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,848
We have to release Wuolijoki.

342
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:28,854
Since you suspect me of all kinds
of things, it's best I leave.

343
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,193
What can I do
if I'm not trusted?

344
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:38,447
It must've come as a surprise
that I came back.

345
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:48,123
State police 1942

346
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:00,677
Name?
- Elina Hämäläinen.

347
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:14,149
You say you're Elina Hämäläinen?

348
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:17,611
Elina Sigrid Hämäläinen.
I'm a Bolshevik.

349
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:22,825
I love my country, which sent me on
a reconnaissance mission to Finland.

350
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:27,162
Did you tell the writer Wuolijoki
your real name?

351
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:30,290
Who do you mean?

352
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:38,757
You shouldn't leave
your radio transmitter in a laundry.

353
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:46,723
You're Kerttu Nuorteva,
the daughter of Santeri Nuorteva.

354
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:52,604
From a cultural family.
Relatives in important positions.

355
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:55,274
How about I make you an offer?

356
00:46:55,357 --> 00:47:00,612
We could arrange for you
to move to Sweden or America.

357
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:09,538
A betrayal of trust can be hard
for a convinced person.

358
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:15,961
The Soviet Union has left you
to your own devices.

359
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:25,262
One. Hella Wuolijoki passed on
secret correspondence -

360
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,473
with red prisoners
sentenced for treason.

361
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:33,061
Two. She arranged Otto-Ville
Kuusinen's escape to Sweden.

362
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:37,191
Three. She hid
the American communist John Reed.

363
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:40,944
Four. Communists spent
fancy holidays at her mansion.

364
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:45,365
Five. She hosted a political salon
at her luxury apartment.

365
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:50,871
They were all there. Film stars,
spies, communists, and traitors.

366
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:56,293
We know that, and everything else.
The parachutist confessed in full.

367
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:34,957
<i>May 1 943</i>

368

00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:34,850

00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:40,564
Date and place of birth?

371
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:47,738

372
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,407
Nationality?
- Finnish.

373
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:54,453
Estonian nationality,
Finnish citizenship.

374
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:58,582
Spouse and children?
- Sulo Ilmiö Wuolijoki, divorced.

375
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:02,669
Daughter Vappu Wuolijoki.
- Vappu Tuomioja, née Wuolijoki.

376
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:10,219
<i>Height 1 60 - 170.
Face round, full, and cone-shaped.</i>

377
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:14,264
Double chin, a scar
on the joint of her little finger.

378
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,855
Clean up.

379
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,292
The spitting bowl.

380
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,213
I don't use it. Take it away.

381
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:50,759
Nothing is taken away.
You're going to clean it.

382
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:56,473
I wash my own dishes,
not other people's.

383
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:03,730
You'll do as I tell you.

384
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:17,452
I brought Finland peace
from the Winter War.

385
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,955
The state owes me for timber.

386
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:23,292
My works are read
all over the world.

387
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:27,337
And you take
a parachutist's word over mine.

388
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:38,182
Nuorteva made a full confession.
- Is her name Nuorteva?

389
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:43,395
The daughter of the President
of the Karelian ASSR. You knew.

390
00:51:43,479 --> 00:51:47,191
Santeri Nuorteva's daughter.
I didn't know that.

391
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:50,736
You'd better just
confess everything.

392
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:54,907
What does that mean?
Do you want to make me a spy?

393
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,203
You shouldn't be upset,
Mrs. Wuolijoki. - No.

394
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:03,248
Even though you've suggested
that my execution is certain.

395
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:06,502
Who suggested that?
- You said -

396
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:11,965
that the author Rantamala broke down
when he heard his death sentence.

397
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:16,929
It was just what I'd heard.
It wasn't a threat.

398
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:20,432
Why did you bring the message
from Stockholm? - What?

399
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:26,021
The one that was written
on your play with invisible ink!

400
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:31,068
I don't know what was in it.
I lost the key.

401
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:40,160
Is it true that Minister Tanner
doesn't want to see me? - Yes.

402
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:47,251
If I have to die useless, so be it.
But I will not die a spy.

403
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:53,632
You'll be sent to prison
to await sentencing.

404
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:03,392
<i>September 1 943</i>

405
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,443
The watch too.

406
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,977
Get yourself settled.

407
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,712
<i>Wake up!</i>

408
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,591
<i>Emptying of the latrine buckets!</i>

409
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,973
Emptying of the latrine buckets!

410
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:27,202
Your bucket.

411
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:39,882
I can't.

412
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:45,095
Get the lady's bucket.

413
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:34,686
<i>Managing the Jokela farm
was left up to me.</i>

414
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:40,943
<i>64 hectares of land
and over 20 cows.</i>

415
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:45,989
<i>There were no workmen.
Everyone was fighting on the front.</i>

416
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:53,163
My eye and heart medicine.
Ask the orthopaedist about my back.

417
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,625
I want Thesleff's biography
of Minna Canth.

418
00:56:56,708 --> 00:57:01,129
And why can't you manage
to send me that mattress?

419
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:04,341
And the pink duvet.

420
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:08,512
I'm trying not
to think about Jokela.

421
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:13,600
It's good that you learn
what it takes to run a mansion.

422
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:17,896
Has anyone asked after me?

423
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:24,153
No one visits me.

424
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:10,449
Keep your distance!
Take your hands out of your pockets!

425
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,748
Keep moving!

426
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:26,924
Take your hands
out of your sleeves!

427
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,468
Eyes down!

428
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:34,515
<i>Mother never talked
to Kerttu Nuorteva again.</i>

429
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:55,702
<i>While waiting for her sentence,
Mother began to write her memoirs.</i>

430
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:12,261
<i>0ne morning, at the end
of September in 1904 -</i>

431
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:16,473
<i>an 18-year-old Estonian girl
arrived at Helsinki station.</i>

432
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:20,561
<i>She had a basket and
an old-fashioned leather bag.</i>

433
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:29,194
I'm here for having
18 food rationing cards.

434
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:32,447
I know you would've asked.
- How do you know that?

435
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,533
They say you ask a lot.

436
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:39,454
Why can't a rich and civilised lady
get herself more privileges?

437
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:43,417
How does one get them?
- I have everything I need.

438
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,964
Information and cigarettes.
I know all the messaging systems.

439
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:54,970
You need to be on good terms
with the cooks and others.

440
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:00,601
Smoking is not allowed
in the cells.

441
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:09,443
And no one sits on my bed,
especially not like that.

442
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:13,739
You don't know how the women
of the world sit in their lounges.

443
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:19,411
When I get out, I'm going to
Hotel Torni with my friends.

444
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:23,332
I'll drink myself into a stupor.

445
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:27,586
Have you had a lot of men?
I bet you have.

446
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:34,510
Men go after money and fame.
And you're a handsome woman.

447
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:03,413
<i>"November 27th, 1 943. The field
court-martial has sentenced -</i>

448
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:08,418
the author Hella Wuolijoki to life
in penal servitude for treason."

449
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:15,342
What does penal servitude mean?
- Less rations and privileges.

450
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:20,180
You're not allowed to receive
food from home, or newspapers.

451
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:25,435
The Minister of Justice has decreed
that prison food is sufficient.

452
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,232
"The sentence has been submitted
to the court-martial appeal court."

453
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:32,943
"The matter is still undecided."

454
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,490
Can I still be sentenced to death?
- It's possible.

455
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:56,008
December 1943

456
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:10,522
Väinö sends his regards
and wishes you a Happy New Year.

457
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:14,067
He has tried to do
everything he can.

458
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:18,447
You need a presidential pardon
before you're sentenced to death.

459
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,949
But I've done no crime.

460
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:26,038
They seem to think you knew
what that woman wanted from you.

461
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:33,212
All I wanted was peace. I thought
she came to negotiate peace.

462
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:38,592
I wrote the petition for you.
Read it at least.

463
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:46,266
Why do I have to petition for
a pardon, as if I was a criminal?

464
01:02:57,611 --> 01:03:01,698
<i>The girl stood alone and helpless
on the platform -</i>

465
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:06,286
<i>until a porter saw her
and took her luggage to a carriage.</i>

466
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,878
<i>Court-martial appeal court 1 944</i>

467
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:25,259
I don't deny my guilt of actions
that can be considered treason -

468
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:28,011
and for which I can be
sentenced to death.

469
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:33,225
But I sincerely believe
that the relations I established -

470
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:37,479
were of great importance
to our country's fate.

471
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:39,648
I made contact with the enemy -

472
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:44,403
only to sever our country
from its disastrous ally, Germany -

473
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:47,906
and to find a way toward peace.

474
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,201
Thank you.

475
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:58,792
With votes of 3 - 2, the appeal
court sentences Hella Wuolijoki -

476
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:02,629
to life in penal servitude.

477
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:18,645
<i>Mother avoided the death sentence
by one vote.</i>

478
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:50,928
<i>Here's part two, 21 5 pages.
Take it to the publisher.</i>

479
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:56,975
You're not surprised. People expect
great feats from your mother.

480
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:01,563
I would've written a play too,
but my back doesn't allow it.

481
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,610
What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

482
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:11,114
Don't complain, you're free.
Are you tired from work?

483
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:18,330
Where are the accounts then?
- I run the farm day and night.

484
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:25,003
I take care of the loans, interest,
lawyer's fees, and salaries.

485
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:31,885
And I have to wait on you.
You make unreasonable demands.

486
01:07:33,095 --> 01:07:36,431
You have never thanked me
for running Jokela.

487
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:42,479
I do commend you.
- Maybe to others, but not to me.

488
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:49,444
Why did you want a child
in the first place?

489
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:57,536
Do you love me at all?
Are you able to love anyone?

490
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:08,839
How much love did you get for
paying your husband to be a steward?

491
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:14,887
For giving your lover 300,000 marks
worth of timber stocks?

492
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,598
Did you record
the debits and credits?

493
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:22,019
How much did you give
and how much love did you get?

494
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:27,816
I've never had a strong man.

495
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:34,615
I was almost
sentenced to death.

496
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:36,783
Goodbye, Mother.

497
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:39,096
The child is coughing!
Who's coughing?

498
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:27,394
<i>Peace has come!</i>

499
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:57,883
The Minister of Justice
ordered you to be released today.

500
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:13,649
Nuorteva will be deported
back to the Soviet Union.

501
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:21,073
The winner will be demanding
heads on a platter.

502
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:26,703
If I were President Ryti,
I'd leave for Sweden.

503
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:32,501
Ryti is a moralist,
he won't escape. But I will.

504
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:06,178
Give me a cigarette, Vappu.

505
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:17,689
Well?

506
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:23,320
Do you think there's still
use for me in this country?

507
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,605
After the war, Hella Wuolijoki
became a Member of Parliament -

508
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:02,359
and the director of
the Finnish Broadcasting Company.

509
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:07,698
She died in 1954
in Helsinki at the age of 67.

510
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:14,788
Her plays and the movies
based on them are beloved classics.

511
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:32,639
<i>Finally! You naughty girl.</i>

512
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:39,521
<i>I was in danger of becoming
a rich lady's lover.</i>

513
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:46,361
<i>Hello! - Hello, Heta.</i>

514
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:51,074
<i>Welcome, Loviisa.
- What a handsome house!</i>

515
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:57,164
<i>Just like Niskavuori.
- It's a few metres longer.</i>

516
01:14:57,372 --> 01:15:04,296
<i>Marry me? An uncultured girl
you'd have become tired of.</i>

517
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:08,759
<i>It would've been a marriage
similar to your present one.</i>

518
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:12,262
<i>Cocktail, Miss Juurakko.
- Thank you, Professor.</i>

519
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:16,058
<i>Is this a martini?
I don' drink anything else.</i>

520
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:19,686
<i>Cheers, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

521
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:27,236
<i>I thought I'd forbid you
to visit my grave.</i>

522
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:32,866
<i>But do come.</i>

523
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,329
<i>Great God in Heaven,
give me love.</i>

524
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:42,543
<i>Give me love,
give me love!</i>

525
01:15:54,346 --> 01:15:57,391
<i>Dear radio listeners.</i>

526
01:15:57,474 --> 01:16:01,353
<i>As I'm leaving
the Finnish Broadcasting Company -</i>

527
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:04,690
<i>I would like to say a few words
to my listeners.</i>

528
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:08,443
<i>To all of you who have
these four years supported-</i>

529
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:12,656
<i>the programmes
broadcast by this institution.</i>
