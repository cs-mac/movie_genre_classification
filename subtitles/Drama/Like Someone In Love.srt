1
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,663
I'm not lying to you.

2
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,291
When did I ever lie to you?

3
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,545
I said no.

4
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,590
You already asked me.

5
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:34,053
I'm with Nagisa, I told you.

6
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,141
It's the two of us.

7
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,895
In Cafe Teo.

8
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,147
I'm telling you the truth.

9
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,986
I told you already.

10
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,113
You keep repeating yourself.

11
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,869
It's your problem if you don't believe me.

12
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,996
I'm telling you the truth.

13
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,459
Come on...

14
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,879
You imagine whatever you want.

15
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,509
I swear to you I'm telling you the truth.

16
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,720
I will let you talk with Nagisa.

17
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,723
Hello, how are you?

18
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,811
It's been a long time.

19
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,105
It's like you are avoiding us.

20
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:30,318
I was just taking to Akiko
to arrange to get all of us together.

21
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,404
And Mokoto would like to see you.

22
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,450
It's arranged then.

23
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,869
I will put her back on.

24
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,955
Bye.

25
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,794
Hello?

26
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,672
But I told you...

27
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:55,134
I'm with Nagisa in Cafe Teo.

28
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,514
I can't today.

29
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,517
I have an exam tomorrow.

30
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,979
Also my grandma is here.

31
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,273
I must see her.

32
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,943
It's not possible.

33
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,864
We have a lot to talk about.

34
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,284
Some other time.

35
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,705
Why?

36
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,583
I have to go?

37
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,504
Would you go if someone asked you?

38
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,050
You suspect me again?

39
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,597
And then you will leave me alone?

40
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,183
In that case, I will go.

41
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:51,065
Good, I will go.
But stop calling.

42
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,986
Phones are forbidden in the toilets.

43
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,206
What a mess.

44
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,668
- I blew it.
- What happened?

45
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:56,005
He wanted to know were I was
and I told him I'm in Cafe Teo.

46
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,507
I heard that.

47
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:01,511
He asked me with whom and I told him "With Nagisa".

48
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,431
He asked me to go to the toilet, and I went.

49
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,559
And I flushed the toilet...

50
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,019
thinking he would then leave me alone.

51
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,522
Then he started to tell me something about tiles.

52
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:13,690
What?

53
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,402
He asked me to count the tiles on the floor.

54
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,153
Why?

55
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,614
So he can come himself later...

56
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,034
to count them and know if I was lying.

57
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,495
What a crazy guy!

58
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:28,997
And then?

59
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,249
Nothing, I hung up on him.

60
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,336
I think he also heard Hiroshi's voice.

61
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,925
- What a mess.
- It's your fault.

62
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,887
You spoil him.

63
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,657
Ki.

64
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:08,161
- Can I tell you a joke?
- If you want.

65
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,372
Two centipedes marry.

66
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:14,209
On the wedding night, the male tells the female:

67
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,712
"It's late, I'm very tired and I've been drinking.

68
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,465
"I'm up to it...

69
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,426
"but I want some help."

70
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,303
What does he say then?

71
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:30,350
"Tell me which legs I have to open".

72
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,227
Excuse me?

73
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,282
Did you think it over?

74
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,662
So much time talking on the phone...

75
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,206
you can't even think about it.

76
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,500
I told you that today...

77
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,960
Listen.

78
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,547
This is your own life.

79
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,842
I do not want to intrude.

80
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,761
But continuing with this story...

81
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,847
you will only feel pain.

82
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,392
You will be destroyed.

83
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,022
You must bring it to an end.

84
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,069
Give them to me.

85
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,863
Thank you.

86
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,951
I'm not telling you this only because of your job.

87
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,414
It's not my fault.
It's hard for me.

88
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,958
It's nobody's fault.

89
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,087
And he is having a hard time too.

90
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,174
I have understood what is happening.

91
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:49,512
Everything should be made clear from the beginning...

92
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,515
so that the lines are not crossed.

93
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,143
If one of you two oversteps them...

94
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,021
then it's over.

95
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,318
We are a couple...

96
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,238
it's normal to quarrel.

97
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,908
I understand what you are telling me.

98
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:13,870
You have told me before.

99
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,957
All couples fight.

100
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:23,213
But not necessarily, if you have a healthy relationship.

101
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,095
Or at least...

102
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,432
they don't fight all the time.

103
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,603
Ever since you became a couple...

104
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,813
you keep on suffering.

105
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,858
It's you own business, of course.

106
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,820
But it's also mine.

107
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,535
Thank you.

108
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,457
Only you can decide whether to break up.

109
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:03,753
I tell you this for your own sake.

110
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:07,924
I know.

111
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:14,973
So...

112
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,183
What will you do?

113
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:20,436
I will discuss it with him...

114
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,397
It's not what I meant.

115
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,315
I mean tonight.

116
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,736
I can't tonight.
I have to revise for my exam.

117
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:31,489
I studied all night, I didn't close my eyes.

118
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,075
I'm exhausted.

119
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,036
Also my grandma is here.

120
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,997
I must see her.

121
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,082
Lousy excuses.

122
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:46,087
I could predict the exam...

123
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:49,007
but not the visit of my grandmother.

124
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,301
Here you are.

125
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,513
She left me a message.

126
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,391
You can listen to it.

127
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:07,275
She arrived in Tokyo early this morning.

128
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:08,735
It's...

129
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,612
I don't hear anything.

130
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,450
Now?

131
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:22,582
She came for a day.
She will leave tonight.

132
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,126
I must see her.

133
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,547
It's the first time she comes and I'm worried.

134
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,092
I wonder where she found my phone number.

135
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:37,222
I must see her tonight.

136
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,432
She wanted to have lunch together.

137
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,851
I didn't answer her calls.

138
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:45,021
For this reason...

139
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:47,649
I can't tonight.

140
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:53,488
I understand.

141
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,908
You are worried for her.

142
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,456
There is no point, however,
in seeing her and leaving after a while.

143
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,918
She won't enjoy it.

144
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,507
Relax, and let her return to her house.

145
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,843
It's better if you don't see her.

146
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:20,348
She will think she got the wrong number.

147
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,811
I once called my uncle from this number,

148
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:29,107
but I'm sure he didn't give it to her.

149
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,876
Then...

150
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:51,045
let's go back to business.

151
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,100
Are you ready for tonight?

152
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,311
It won't be possible.

153
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:15,612
- You don't have another choice.
- I can't.

154
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,785
You have already refused in other occasions.

155
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,246
That time...

156
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,957
I didn't force you.

157
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:31,419
Now it's different.

158
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,089
This is someone I respect.

159
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,426
Send Nagisa.
Why me?

160
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,640
I don't know why.

161
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,809
You will know when you go.

162
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,020
I don't force you to work.

163
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:52,690
I do it for this specific person.

164
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,360
I don't want to disappoint him.

165
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:59,405
I'm sure you will not regret it.

166
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:02,283
Is he a politician?

167
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,707
Stop with the questions.

168
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,126
You will see for yourself.

169
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,963
Come on...

170
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,924
Finish your drink and go.

171
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:22,345
You will sleep in the taxi.

172
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,472
It's one hour drive.

173
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:27,475
You must be there at 10.30.

174
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:30,311
I'm not going, I told you!

175
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:08,117
Akiko?

176
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,800
You are just in time.

177
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:28,346
Take a small nap.

178
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,934
Here you go, sir.

179
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,482
Have a nice trip.

180
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:47,156
<i>You have seven new messages.</i>

181
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,158
<i>First message.</i>

00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,370
<i>12 of the month at 9:38.</i>

183
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,041
<i>Ki, my dear, it's grandma.</i>

184
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:02,130
<i>I'm on the train.
I arrive in Tokyo at 10.30.</i>

185
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:06,259
<i>I called you on your phone but you didn't answer.</i>

186
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:11,139
<i>I don't want to tell you who gave me this number.</i>

187
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,351
<i>She told me not to tell you.</i>

188
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:18,855
<i>I don't even know if you received my message.</i>

189
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:22,025
<i>I will call you again as soon as I arrive in Tokyo.</i>

190
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:24,402
<i>I won't stay long.</i>

191
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:27,030
<i>I've already bought the return ticket.</i>

192
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,282
<i>I will leave tonight 11.</i>

193
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,703
<i>I left your grandpa by himself and I must come back.</i>

194
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,997
<i>I will call you again.</i>

195
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,125
<i>Second message.</i>

196

198
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:54,098
<i>I will wait for you in the bench close to gate 5.</i>

199
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:57,185
<i>You will find me easily.</i>

200
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:02,190
<i>I'm calling you from a booth close to the bench.</i>

201
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:07,278
<i>The is a man here who plays the accordion.</i>

202
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:12,534
<i>You will hear him as soon as you enter the station.</i>

203
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:18,665
<i>I would really like to go have lunch together, my dear.</i>

204
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,000
<i>Third message.</i>

205
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,337
<i>12 of the month at 14:03</i>

206
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,509

207
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:32,220
<i>I'm calling you from a restaurant.</i>

208
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:35,890
<i>I left the station to go eat some noodles.</i>

209
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:39,060
<i>It only has cafeterias inside.</i>

210
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,646
<i>I felt like eating soup.</i>

211
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,024
<i>I would have like to lunch together.</i>

212
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,361
<i>The restaurant is in front of the station.</i>

213
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,864
<i>Come to find me whenever you can.</i>

214
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,701
<i>Otherwise as soon as I finish I will go back to gate 5.</i>

215
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:57,579
<i>I will wait for you in the bench.</i>

216
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,915

217
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,085
<i>Fourth message.</i>

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,173
<i>12 of the month at 14:42.</i>

219
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:13,094
<i>Yes, Ki? I took your book.</i>

220
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,346
<i>Fifth message.</i>

221
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:18,474
<i>12 of the month at 16:01.</i>

222
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:21,311
<i>Do you miss Matsuda, Akiko?</i>

223
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,105
<i>I calling you from the bank...</i>

224
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:26,065
<i>Sixth message.</i>

00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:30,320
<i>12 of the month at 16:18.</i>

226
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:33,740
<i>Yes?</i>

227
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:35,867
<i>I returned to the station.</i>

228
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:40,163
<i>In the booth they have put up a photograph.</i>

229
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,291
<i>The girl looks a lot like you.</i>

230
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,212
<i>She looks like you but she doesn't.</i>

231
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:50,965
<i>She closes her eyes and smiles.</i>

232
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,469
<i>I called the number under the photograph.</i>

233
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:58,515
<i>A man answered, rather rude.</i>

234
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,143
<i>I will call you, then, to this number.</i>

235
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:05,522
<i>I will tell you.
Nagisa's mother...</i>

236
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:08,233
<i>gave me your number.</i>

237
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,903
<i>She is very worried about her daughter.</i>

238
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,490
<i>Me, on the contrary, I'm not.</i>

239
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:21,246
<i>I know that my Ki is smart and sensible.</i>

240
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,375
<i>I'm sure that you don't do stupid things.</i>

241
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,086
<i>The is here another photograph.</i>

242
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:31,881
<i>This one looks like Nagisa...</i>

243
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,969
<i>but with red hair.</i>

244
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:39,180
<i>I can't be her.</i>

245
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,349
<i>Miku married.</i>

246
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,855
<i>And Mitsuko, Etsuku
and Yuko. I have so much to tell you.</i>

247
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,023
<i>It's 4 o'clock.</i>

248
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,027
<i>I have so many things to tell you, my dear Ki.</i>

249
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,947
<i>Seventh message.</i>

250
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:59,993
<i>12 of the month 21:48.</i>

251
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:05,540
<i>It's almost 10. I imagine
I won't see you finally.</i>

252
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,210
<i>I'm close to the station.</i>

253
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,046
<i>I will take the train at 11.</i>

254
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,925
<i>I will spend this hour waiting for you...</i>

255
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,719
<i>under the statue.</i>

256
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:20,972
<i>Maybe you received my messages.</i>

257
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:26,477
<i>I will seat here so you can easily see me.</i>

258
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,565
<i>End of new messages.</i>

259
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:33,610
Excuse me.

260
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,987
Are we far away from the station?

261
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,073
No, it's nearby.

262
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:42,452
Can we pass through there?

263
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:05,159
Could we drive around it again?

264
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:08,204
Of course.

265
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:16,804
Welcome.

266
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,723
Excuse me.

267
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:21,935
I'm looking for door number 3771.

268
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:26,105
It's supposed to be here.

269
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:29,859
- Here is the address.
- Call the number on it.

270
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:32,111
They don't answer.

271
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:38,368
Sir...

272
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:52,799
I called but they didn't pick up.

273
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:55,134
She slept all the way from Tokyo.

274
00:28:56,696 --> 00:29:00,867
<i>You have reached the voicemail.
You may also send a fax.</i>

275
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:53,336
Hello?

276
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,129
Is it you?

277
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:57,006
What is the matter?

278
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:03,888
I can't, I'm busy.

279
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,519
No, as I told you,

280
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,106
I don't have time.

281
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:19,737
<i>Your sister is worried.
She wanted to show up to see you.</i>

282
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:24,450
Sorry, are you there?

283
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,286
<i>So?</i>

284
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,746
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

285
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:36,588
I told you, I can't.

286
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:39,048
I will call you tomorrow.

287
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:42,677
<i>Tomorrow? Why do you
think I'm calling you now?</i>

288
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,430
<i>I have been calling you all evening.</i>

289
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,183
What do you want?

290
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:52,312
<i>A small translation.
It's barely five lines.</i>

291
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,940
I can't tonight.
Tomorrow, if you want.

292
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:58,860
<i>Five lines.
I'm not asking for much.</i>

293
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:01,571
It's not possible tonight.

294
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:04,324
<i>What are you up to tonight?</i>

295
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:06,326
<i>You sound weird.</i>

296
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:10,788
Nothing special.
I simply have to work.

297
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:15,502
If it's urgent, I could call Kobayashi.

298
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,047
<i>Why call him for something that you could also do?</i>

299
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:21,549
<i>I could also call him.</i>

300
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,177
<i>I want you to translate it.</i>

301
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:27,138
Okay, fine.

302
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,934
Tell me then.

303
00:31:31,226 --> 00:31:32,852
I will write it down.

304
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:35,313
<i>Will you do it tonight, or later?</i>

305
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:38,525
I already told you that I can't tonight.

306
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,736
I will do it tomorrow morning.

307
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:45,990
<i>It's just five sentences.
What is the big deal?</i>

308
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:49,285
Tell me, I'm listening.

309
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:51,955
<i>I will start, are you writing?</i>

310
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,750
<i>"My respectable son...</i>

311
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:00,547
What else?

312
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:02,507
<i>You broke my train of thought.</i>

313
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:05,218
What are you talking about?

314
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:10,098
You must have something written.
Read it to me.

315
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:12,225
<i>"My respectable son...</i>

316
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:16,896
<i>"Sekigutsi Masahiro states"...</i>

317
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:20,191
<i>It's a permanent job to be a parent.</i>

318
00:32:20,358 --> 00:32:21,901
<i>Something you will also know.</i>

319
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,779
Forget the comments and read.

320
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,492
<i>I will give you the basic idea and you write the words.</i>

321
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,579
<i>"The exposition from my respected son...</i>

322
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:36,332
<i>"with support from the cultural organisation Tanaka...</i>

323
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:40,253
<i>"will open to the public on 18 December".</i>

324
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:44,465
I have things to do.

325
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,509
Hurry up.

326
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:48,595
<i>You wrote it all down?</i>

327
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,347
<i>About the rest I/m not sure.</i>

328
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:54,225
<i>Make it sound nice.</i>

329
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:05,278
Good evening.

330
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:08,072
What did you tell me before?

331
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,785
You can hang your coat if you want.

332
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:16,289
Thank you, but I/m a bit cold.

333
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,708
I've been waiting for you for some time.

334
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,585
Seat down.

335
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:32,805
You have a nice house.

336
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:35,016
Thank you.

337
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,520
Do you like this painting?

338
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,689
Isn't it beautiful?

339
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:44,609
It was given to me as a gift.

340
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:51,324
My uncle gave it to me went in my 14th birthday.

341
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,370
He told me that he had painted my portrait.

342
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:59,874
When I arrived in Tokyo two years ago...

343
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,837
I went to the University Museum and I saw it.

344
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:05,755
Then I understood that he was joking.

345
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:11,886
It is a very famous painting.

346
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:13,680
Really?

347
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:18,476
It's from 1900.

348
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:20,854
From 111 years ago.

349
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:24,440
Long before I was born.

350
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,943
It's a smart parrot.

351
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,196
Called "Educating a parrot".

352
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:33,324
Seriously? Strange title.

353
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:38,288
The girl is teaching the parrot to speak.

354
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:42,876
My grandma used to tell me...

355
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:47,505
That the parrot seemed to be teaching the girl.

356
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:49,757
Why not?

357
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:52,594
That's how I saw it.

358
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,763
Before this painting...

359
00:34:56,014 --> 00:35:00,476
all our paintings were adopting a western style.

360
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:05,607
This was the first painting
with pure Japanese theme and style.

361
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,817
That's why it is special.

362
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:10,028
And therefore famous.

363
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:16,951
They used to tell me often
that I look like the little girl.

364
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:20,205
When I was little, my grandmother...

365
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:22,832
made me a kimono like that one.

366
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:27,086
I wonder if there is indeed some similarity.

367
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:29,172
I'm not so sure.

368
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,590
It's possible.

369
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,383
You think so?

370
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:34,886
Can I borrow a pencil?

371
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:42,268
She used to dress me with a kimono

372
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,480
and make me a hair bun…

373
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,983
and we used to go to the celebrations in the village.

374
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:55,198
With my hair stick.

375
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:03,540
- Now I see the resemblance.
- Really?

376
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:12,382
Every day someone tells me...

377
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,552
that I look like someone else.

378
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:21,599
I didn't really believe it was me on the painting.

379
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:25,895
My eyes are bigger, aren't they?

380
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:27,647
Indeed.

381
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:29,607
Do you agree?

382
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:32,777
Can I?

383
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:39,242
I think that we look very much alike.

384
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,078
Who is her?

385
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,538
Mika.

386
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:45,331
Mika.

387
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:48,835
And in another photograph...

388
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:50,795
Can I bring it?

389
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,600
Her.

390
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,104
Who is the woman?

391
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:09,689
Yoko.

392
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,482
Yoko.

393
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,694
Your wife?

394
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:18,823
Don't I look a bit like her?

395
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,825
Probably.

396
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,122
Do you live alone?

397
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:33,796
Are you a remarkable person?

398
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,635
What do you mean remarkable?

399
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,845
Hiroshi said...

400
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:46,226
that he really respects you and that you are a great man.

401
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,896
He said that?

402
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,858
What do you do in your life?

403
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:58,363
I write and translate books.

404
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,073
Sometimes...

405
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,619
they call me to give some lecture and other things.

406
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:09,832
That's why you have so many books.

407
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,002
You have read them all?

408
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:15,213
Yes, more or less.

409
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,507
Incredible.

410
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:20,134
You don't throw them away after reading them?

411
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:24,430
No, I need them for my research.

412
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:32,355
I know a joke related to books.

413
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:35,108
I have a friend, Nagisa.

414
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:37,610
We work together.

415
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:40,029
She told me the joke.

416
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:45,243
What do a book and a woman have in common?

417
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,912
A book and a woman?

418
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,040
In common?

419
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,418
I don't know.

420
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:55,670
Should I tell you?

421
00:38:58,256 --> 00:39:01,926
I don't dare, I'm shy.

422
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:05,138
I will tell you a better one.

423
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,349
Also Nagisa told it to me.

424
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:12,270
Even with very important people...

425
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,815
she is very comfortable and speaks freely.

426
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:19,569
She's sweet and funny.
We get along very well.

427
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:23,239
I will tell you the joke.

428
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:27,911
It's a story about two centipedes.

429
00:39:28,286 --> 00:39:29,996
They got married...

430
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:32,665
and the female...

431
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:37,295
wants to sleep with the male on the wedding night.

432
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:43,301
The male, however, is very tired...

433
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,303
and asks her for help.

434
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,224
He asks her which legs should he open.

435
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:53,645
Why do you laugh?

436
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:59,192
You told me a joke, so I laughed.

437
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,362
Every time people laugh.

438
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,574
I don't understand, where's the joke?

439
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,535
I don't know.

440
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:10,328
You know. Tell me.

441
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:14,040
Come to drink some wine, better.

442
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,669
I would like to go to the toilet first.

443
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:20,171
- It's at the back.
- May I?

444
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,090
Of course.

445
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:21,186
What are you doing?

446
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:22,937
You want to sleep?

447
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:26,858
Come, food is ready.
We will also drink wine.

448
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:31,237
I'm sleepy.

449
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:47,253
I made you a soup.
Specialty of your region.

450
00:43:47,462 --> 00:43:49,589
You will like it for sure.

451
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:54,177
How do you know where I'm from?

452
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:58,306
Hiroshi told me.

453
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:02,352
He told me you are from the same place.

454
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,439
He also told me the name of the village, but I forgot.

455
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,444
What do you know Hiroshi from?

456
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,325
He brings you girls?

457
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:23,623
Yes, it smells like perfume.

458
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,500
Impossible.

459
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:30,213
Hiroshi and me...

460
00:44:31,464 --> 00:44:33,925
we know each other for a long time.

461
00:44:34,551 --> 00:44:37,095
He is a former student of mine.

462
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:44,227
I'm from Fukuri.

463
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:49,858
Now in December, it's the season of mandarins.

464
00:44:50,984 --> 00:44:53,194
When did you last go?

465
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:55,697
New Year.

466
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,036
You will go again soon.

467
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:06,416
I have a surprise.

468
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:11,963
I made you a very special soup.

469
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,134
What soup?

470
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,721
A broth with shrimps.

471
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,015
Very delicious.

472
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:26,311
I hate it.

473
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:32,275
My grandma used to make it very often when I was little.

474
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:34,569
I could never eat it.

475
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:40,158
It's a pity then.

476
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:45,163
Never mind, I will eat it later by myself.

477
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:47,832
Come.

478
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:53,421
You are not sleepy?

479
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:57,175
On which side do you sleep?

480
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:58,927
Here?

481
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:02,055
Come to eat.

482
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:04,766
I cooked for you.

483
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:08,186
I'm not hungry, I'm sleepy.

484
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:10,980
So come to drink some wine.

485
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:13,358
It will heat us up.

486
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,361
Come to heat me up in bed.

487
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:18,488
It's warmer in the other room.

488
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,283
We will drink a small glass.
We will talk.

489
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,827
I'm sleepy.

490
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:28,748
I usually sleep on this side.
Can I?

491
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,167
Here?

492
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,837
Come join me.

493
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:37,507
Let's go to the other room.

494
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:41,010
The telephone is ringing.

495
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:45,315
We arrived, Akiko.

496
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:49,027
Already?

497
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:51,988
I knew a shortcut.

498
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,824
You know your way around here.

499
00:51:55,116 --> 00:51:58,620
I used to pass from here for 30 years to go to work.

500
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:00,622
To work?

501
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:02,498
I used to teach here.

502
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:04,626
You were a teacher here?

503
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:06,336
What did you teach?

504
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:09,923
What you are studying.

505
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:13,426
So you know this book by heart?

506
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:15,220
More or less.

507
00:52:16,012 --> 00:52:19,766
- I will wait for you here.
- I might be a bit late.

508
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:22,393
I have time.

509
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,522
I can take you wherever you want.

510
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:29,150
We can you to eat.

511
00:52:29,484 --> 00:52:31,694
You didn't eat anything this morning.

512
00:52:40,203 --> 00:52:41,996
What is your name?

513
00:52:42,413 --> 00:52:44,541
Watanabe Takashi.

514
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:49,624
Excuse me, do you have light?

515
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:15,817
Thank you.

516
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:21,299
Excuse me...

517
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,177
but who are you?

518
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:28,473
Do I have to answer?

519
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:33,353
Just wondering.

520
00:56:37,982 --> 00:56:41,319
I could ask you the same.
Who are you?

521
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,534
Can I come in?

522
00:57:00,713 --> 00:57:03,091
I'm Higuchi Noriaki.

523
00:57:03,675 --> 00:57:04,843
Hi.

524
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:09,931
Watanabe Takashi.

525
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:12,100
Nice to meet you.

526
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:21,568
What relationship do you have with Akiko?

527
00:57:30,326 --> 00:57:32,370
What do you think?

528
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:36,416
Her grandpa?

529
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,002
Definitely not her father.

530
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:45,884
I thought her grandma was here.

531
00:57:47,218 --> 00:57:49,095
Nice to meet you.

532
00:57:49,512 --> 00:57:51,055
And you?

533
00:57:51,556 --> 00:57:53,683
What is your relationship with her?

534
00:57:59,772 --> 00:58:01,566
I'm her fiance.

535
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:09,866
I have asked her many times
to introduce me to her family.

536
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,620
She told me you are not okay.

537
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,041
Is your knee any better?

538
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:22,712
Yes, thank you.

539
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:24,589
So...

540
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:29,802
can I come to introduce myself to you officially?

541
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:33,723
You mean...

542
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:35,725
to marry her?

543
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:38,394
Yes.

544
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:42,524
Nowadays...

545
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,528
people get married without consent of the family.

546
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:49,447
For me, however, it's important.

547
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:54,494
What is your job?
What did you study?

548
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:56,704
I have a small business.

549
00:58:58,164 --> 00:59:01,417
I left school when I was 16.

550
00:59:02,502 --> 00:59:05,672
I know that some people prefer to lose time in college.

551
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,466
I wanted to work.

552
00:59:10,218 --> 00:59:13,972
When my buddies are in need, they come find me.

553
00:59:15,223 --> 00:59:18,810
- What is your business about?
- A car repair shop.

554
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:24,566
When things get hard, I do other things.

555
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:28,194
Work it's something important...

556
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:32,532
but you are both very young to marry.

557
00:59:33,241 --> 00:59:36,035
You lack the experience.

558
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:40,123
You think so?

559
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,503
I have been with several...

560
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,342
and girls don't need experience before marriage.

561
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:57,098
I think it's the right moment.

562
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:04,939
Seeing you together earlier...

563
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,027
things didn't seem to be so great.

564
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,241
We have our disagreements...

565
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:18,328
but it's nothing serious.

566
01:00:21,497 --> 01:00:25,168
You shouldn't hesitate about the issue of marriage.

567
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:29,756
As my grandfather used to say...

568
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:34,844
"When you meet your better half,
marry her."

569
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,097
"Don't let her go."

570
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:41,518
You don't have to
over-analyse everything.

571
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:49,526
I understand what you are saying, though.

572
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,364
It's difficult to understand women.

573
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,494
If I loose her...

574
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:02,330
I won't find another like her.

575
01:01:04,249 --> 01:01:06,709
Why would you lose her...

576
01:01:07,585 --> 01:01:09,712
if it's so good between you?

577
01:01:11,506 --> 01:01:13,550
Yes, that is true.

578
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:21,641
I will be honest.

579
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:24,894
How to say it?

580
01:01:26,938 --> 01:01:28,648
For example...

581
01:01:29,107 --> 01:01:31,401
when people have problems...

582
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:35,321
they often discuss them.

583
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:38,783
We, however, we don't.

584
01:01:41,244 --> 01:01:45,248
She says, "Who do you think you are?
You're not my husband."

585
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:49,752
And indeed, I'm not.

586
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:54,841
Her phone was off all night.

587
01:01:56,176 --> 01:01:58,052
No explanation.

588
01:01:59,387 --> 01:02:02,473
She told me something about the battery.

589
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:06,311
She didn't give me a clear answer.

590
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:08,188
Isn't it weird?

591
01:02:08,897 --> 01:02:10,607
Indeed, it is.

592
01:02:11,524 --> 01:02:13,401
So you understand.

593
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:17,030
That's why I want to marry her.

594
01:02:18,156 --> 01:02:20,283
That way she won't have a choice.

595
01:02:24,162 --> 01:02:26,289
She knows nothing about life.

596
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,586
You should also know...

597
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,547
we live in a jungle.

598
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:37,008
She tells me...

599
01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:40,094
"I know, I'm studying sociology."

600
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:44,224
What do they teach them in here?

601
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:48,019
As if the dusty books…

602
01:02:48,478 --> 01:02:50,522
will open their eyes.

603
01:02:51,397 --> 01:02:54,817
This city is merciless and dangerous.

604
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:56,778
I worry for her.

605
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:59,155
So I will marry her.

606
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:02,534
That way I will be able to protect her.

607
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,410
To reassure the family.

608
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,372
Last night...

609
01:03:07,956 --> 01:03:10,583
she turned off her phone at 10.

610
01:03:11,543 --> 01:03:14,712
We were talking and she hung up...

611
01:03:14,963 --> 01:03:18,716
and now she's playing it hard.

612
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:21,761
I understand.

613
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:24,389
On the other hand...

614
01:03:24,556 --> 01:03:29,352
even if you get married, she might
still leave your questions unanswered.

615
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:31,271
What will you do then?

616
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:35,525
If we get married, she will be obliged to answer me.

617
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:41,114
Ideally, yes.

618
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:46,494
That's why I tell you that you lack experience.

619
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:49,455
Not at all.

620
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:57,463
Experience means to accept the lies?

621
01:03:57,755 --> 01:03:59,632
To accept everything?

622
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:05,930
When you know you will be lied to,
it's better not to ask.

623
01:04:06,556 --> 01:04:09,100
That's what experience teaches us.

624
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:12,145
What are you implying?

625
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,443
I say forget the marriage.

626
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:20,403
Why?

627
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:23,948
I love her.

628
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:27,619
Who told you not to love her?

629
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:31,372
I'm telling you not to marry her.

630
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:35,376
And not to ask her many questions...

631
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:40,381
or to accept her answers, no matter what they are.

632
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,177
When you understand this,
then you are mature enough to marry.

633
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:46,054
This also applies to women?

634
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:48,223
I'm not sure.

635
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,143
The only thing you care about...

636
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:55,480
is to defend your granddaughter.

637
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,567
As much as she is my granddaughter,

638
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:02,237
also are you.

639
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:05,490
I'm her grandfather...

640
01:05:06,074 --> 01:05:08,785
as much as I'm yours.

641
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:13,831
I'm just telling you how things are.

642
01:05:14,165 --> 01:05:18,461
You can either accept it or reject it.

643
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:20,964
I told you my opinion.

644
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:30,056
Your only goal...

645
01:05:32,183 --> 01:05:34,394
is to discourage me.

646
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,650
Did Akiko talk to you about me?

647
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:03,173
You told Noriaki that your grandma was coming?

648
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:06,426
I became grandmother now?

649
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:10,680
Wasn't your grandma coming?

650
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:15,685
I didn't understand correctly?

651
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:19,939
Anyway.

652
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:24,611
He was looking for grandma, but he found grandpa.

653
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,782
Where are we going?

654
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,746
You need a book.

655
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:40,084
Indeed.

656
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:41,920
Which?

657
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:45,715
One for school.

658
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:53,097
I will get off a little later.

659
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,747
How did it go?

660
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,169
Quite good but...

661
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:25,672
But what?

662
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:28,424
It was hard to concentrate.

663
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:35,390
You screwed up?

664
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:43,439
Sorry about before.

665
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:47,277
I was upset.

666
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:55,201
I will explain it later.

667
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:01,291
What topics were in the exam?

668
01:08:04,169 --> 01:08:08,798
The Theory of Evolution.
Isn't it Durkheim?

669
01:08:09,883 --> 01:08:11,676
No, Darwin.

670
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:15,054
I wrote Durkheim.

671
01:08:15,555 --> 01:08:20,768
Durkheim reinterpreted Darwin's theory.

672
01:08:21,895 --> 01:08:23,521
What else?

673
01:08:26,566 --> 01:08:31,279
It's better not to find all the mistakes I made.

674
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:35,366
I feel quite depressed.

675
01:09:00,975 --> 01:09:02,936
Your timing belt is complaining.

676
01:09:03,478 --> 01:09:04,729
Really?

677
01:09:04,938 --> 01:09:06,981
It makes a strange noise.

678
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,067
I didn't notice.

679
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:13,321
Since when does it do it.

680
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:16,658
I have no idea.

681
01:09:22,163 --> 01:09:24,916
You entered the highway like this?

682
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,551
Stop the car.
I will take a look.

683
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,302
Not here.

684
01:09:37,929 --> 01:09:39,889
A bit later.

685
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:43,268
Pull over.

686
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:02,370
Did he ask you anything?

687
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,963
I didn't tell him anything.

688
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,257
Start the engine.

689
01:10:16,676 --> 01:10:18,887
Press the pedal.

690
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:23,391
Now turn off the engine.

691
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,226
What did he say?

692
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:37,780
It could break in any moment.

693
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:42,202
If you can, come to my garage.

694
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:44,329
I will change it for you.

695
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:46,497
I don't have much time.

696
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:49,876
- Will it take a lot of time?
- Ten minutes.

697
01:10:50,877 --> 01:10:52,754
Ok, if you want.

698
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:59,719
- Should I go straight?
- Yes, all straight.

699
01:11:07,894 --> 01:11:09,395
Hi.

700
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:11,105
What's up?

701
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:14,359
Can you go and see...

702
01:11:15,693 --> 01:11:18,947
if we have timing belts for Volvo?

703
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:24,077
I will be there in 10 minutes.

704
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,621
Wait a minute.

705
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:31,084
If we don't have, call Tachibana
and tell him to send us one.

706
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:39,384
Tell Yutaro to call him.

707
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:41,886
Is he there?

708
01:11:45,974 --> 01:11:47,851
What is his problem?

709
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:51,896
Put him on.

710
01:11:53,857 --> 01:11:55,733
I will tell you later.

711
01:11:57,777 --> 01:12:02,156
Will you call Tachibana for the timing belt?

712
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:06,828
A timing belt for Volvo.

713
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,293
Sorry.

714
01:12:19,174 --> 01:12:21,384
The guy is an asshole.

715
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:26,472
The other way I was working...

716
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:30,310
and he showed me this.

717
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,647
"Who is it?", he asked me...

718
01:12:35,273 --> 01:12:38,526
hiding the bottom with his hand.

719
01:12:40,904 --> 01:12:43,448
Akiko, I told him.

720
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:46,701
He burst out laughing.

721
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:50,246
He moved his finger and I see the number.

722
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:55,960
Looks a bit like Akiko.
The face, the smile.

723
01:12:58,838 --> 01:13:01,216
- Don't you think so?
- No.

724
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:09,682
Why did he show me?
We are going to marry.

725
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:14,020
He made me angry and we had a fight.

726
01:13:15,772 --> 01:13:18,691
He could never conquer such a girl.

727
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:20,652
I was very upset.

728
01:13:50,265 --> 01:13:52,475
In a while, we turn left.

729
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,688
- Have you been here before?
- Yes.

730
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:58,565
Well, just once.

731
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,443
I don't like to bring my fiancée here.

732
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,320
Here we go left.

733
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,663
And then right.

734
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:24,174
Here we are.

735
01:14:25,925 --> 01:14:28,303
- Hi.
- Hi.

736
01:14:37,562 --> 01:14:39,355
Sorry, pal.

737
01:14:51,492 --> 01:14:56,039
How did this small guy manage to move such a giant.

738
01:14:57,498 --> 01:14:59,876
He has three dan in karate.

739
01:15:01,753 --> 01:15:04,589
- You like that?
- What?

740
01:15:05,715 --> 01:15:07,509
That he is strong.

741
01:15:10,303 --> 01:15:12,096
I used to like it.

742
01:15:13,848 --> 01:15:16,684
Where did he find the photograph?

743
01:15:17,143 --> 01:15:18,645
It's old.

744
01:15:18,811 --> 01:15:23,775
I took it two years ago when I came to Tokyo.

745
01:15:24,526 --> 01:15:27,529
I throw them to the garbage whenever I find one...

746
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:30,114
buy maybe I missed some.

747
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:32,867
Also my grandma saw one.

748
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:43,002
What do you see in him exactly?

749
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:48,842
I'm not sure.

750
01:15:55,974 --> 01:15:57,308
You will seat in the back?

751
01:15:57,475 --> 01:15:59,602
What are you talking about?

752
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,113
Again?

753
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:14,534
Why else would you come for?

754
01:16:15,326 --> 01:16:17,120
All yours.

755
01:16:17,328 --> 01:16:20,582
I will take a look.
Give me two minutes.

756
01:16:29,382 --> 01:16:31,593
Look at that.

757
01:16:39,017 --> 01:16:40,393
Hello.

758
01:16:42,562 --> 01:16:45,523
Maybe you don't remember me, professor.

759
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:48,610
I was in the police school.

760
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:52,197
I took your course.

761
01:16:53,156 --> 01:16:55,366
The police school?

762
01:16:56,409 --> 01:16:58,369
30 years ago.

763
01:16:59,037 --> 01:17:01,164
I was also enrolled in sociology.

764
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:05,126
I was actually teaching...

765
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:10,340
an annual sociology program there.

766
01:17:11,216 --> 01:17:13,259
You don't know me.

767
01:17:14,844 --> 01:17:17,639
I find it logical.
We were few.

768
01:17:19,182 --> 01:17:23,561
However now we are almost neighbours.

769
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,104
Really?

770
01:17:25,271 --> 01:17:28,441
Can I buy you a coffee?

771
01:17:29,776 --> 01:17:33,279
I'm late to work, unfortunately.

772
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:39,160
What do you do now?

773
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:44,707
I left the police.
I am now a freelance worker.

774
01:17:46,668 --> 01:17:48,461
That's good.

775
01:17:50,213 --> 01:17:53,800
I recently read your last book...

776
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:55,677
and it was very interesting.

777
01:17:56,261 --> 01:17:57,762
Thank you very much.

778
01:17:57,929 --> 01:17:59,806
I left the police...

779
01:18:00,014 --> 01:18:03,101
but I'm interested in the topic
of violence in the society.

780
01:18:03,852 --> 01:18:05,562
Do you know each other?

781
01:18:05,937 --> 01:18:07,814
We know each other from many years ago.

782
01:18:08,022 --> 01:18:09,732
Almost ready.

783
01:18:10,316 --> 01:18:12,193
Come a bit further.

784
01:18:19,951 --> 01:18:21,744
A bit more.

785
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:44,350
Ready.

786
01:18:44,517 --> 01:18:46,311
You can drive without worries.

787
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:49,355
It was very worn out.

788
01:18:50,148 --> 01:18:51,941
Put it back.

789
01:18:53,818 --> 01:18:55,361
You will leave today?

790
01:18:55,653 --> 01:18:57,280
Yes.

791
01:18:57,822 --> 01:19:00,200
We can have lunch together.

792
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:02,535
Some other time.

793
01:19:04,746 --> 01:19:07,207
Would you give me your mobile phone?

794
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:10,418
I don't have a mobile phone.

795
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:15,507
Give me yours and I will call you.

796
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,557
Here you have my card.

797
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:32,565
- Have you arranged anything for later?
- No.

798
01:19:33,107 --> 01:19:36,194
Let's go eat together?
We have to talk.

799
01:19:38,655 --> 01:19:41,991
- Thank you for this.
- No, I thank you.

800
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,244
Always take care of yourself.

801
01:19:45,328 --> 01:19:47,455
How much do I owe you?

802
01:19:47,747 --> 01:19:49,249
Nothing.

803
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:52,418
- I insist.
- Nothing, really.

804
01:19:52,627 --> 01:19:54,671
I will arrange it with Akiko.

805
01:19:55,046 --> 01:19:57,799
I owe you one.

806
01:19:59,259 --> 01:20:03,638
We will go for lunch to the bookstore
if you change your mind.

807
01:20:04,222 --> 01:20:05,932
Okay.

808
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:08,393
See you at 1 o'clock.

809
01:20:09,018 --> 01:20:10,979
I will help you get out.

810
01:20:31,332 --> 01:20:33,626
Attention to your right.

811
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:41,801
Are you okay?

812
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,512
Drive safely.

813
01:20:48,558 --> 01:20:50,518
Sorry for the wait.

814
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:24,427
At least we know where we are going.

815
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:28,598
What will I do?

816
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:33,770
Don't worry.
Things will get better.

817
01:21:33,937 --> 01:21:36,147
Whatever will be, will be.

818
01:21:37,982 --> 01:21:41,736
- You understood it?
- I understood.

819
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:45,615
Looks like they know each other well.

820
01:21:45,782 --> 01:21:49,702
Noriaki will ask him about you.

821
01:21:50,245 --> 01:21:54,165
He will find out that he was your student.

822
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:57,335
I had told him...

823
01:21:57,669 --> 01:22:00,380
that my grandfather was a fisherman.

824
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:02,841
Fisherman?

825
01:22:06,302 --> 01:22:08,346
Never mind.

826
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:12,058
Everyone has two grandfathers.

827
01:22:12,225 --> 01:22:15,478
From the father and from the mother.

828
01:22:16,896 --> 01:22:22,235
One can be a fisherman and the other a teacher.

829
01:22:23,403 --> 01:22:25,363
Indeed.

830
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,449
I still worry.

831
01:22:29,075 --> 01:22:32,745
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

832
01:22:33,621 --> 01:22:36,374
Whatever will be, will be.

833
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:44,382
<i>Whatever will be, will be</i>

834
01:22:44,716 --> 01:22:47,719
<i>The future we can't predict.</i>

835
01:22:47,927 --> 01:22:52,891
<i>What will be, will be.</i>

836
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:03,401
What did you two talk about?

837
01:23:04,444 --> 01:23:07,697
Relax, about nothing special.

838
01:23:07,906 --> 01:23:10,909
I didn't tell him anything specific.

839
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:13,661
He asked me if I was your grandfather.

840
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:19,167
I replied that I am as much your grandfather as I'm his.

841
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:22,754
You could be my granddaughter

842
01:23:23,213 --> 01:23:26,466
and you can call me whenever you need me.

843
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:28,968
Do you have my number?

844
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:48,196
Here is the bookstore.

845
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,990
Don't get stressed.

846
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:55,370
You don't need to worry about anything.

847
01:23:55,787 --> 01:23:57,997
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

848
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:07,669
Mr. Watanabe?

849
01:26:08,419 --> 01:26:12,173
You must be happy that
your granddaughter came to see you.

850
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,551
Was also your daughter with you?

851
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:19,848
Sorry, but your car...

852
01:26:20,056 --> 01:26:24,310
Could you park it a bit farther ahead next time?

853
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:30,191
If you park like that, I can't see outside.

854
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:35,154
Seriously? I think
you can see very well.

855
01:26:35,655 --> 01:26:39,492
I park exactly there...

856
01:26:39,784 --> 01:26:42,078
upon your request.

857
01:26:42,579 --> 01:26:46,082
Because I offered to clean the windshield...

858
01:26:46,249 --> 01:26:47,959
with the short hose.

859
01:26:48,168 --> 01:26:49,878
I can wash it somewhere else.

860
01:26:50,044 --> 01:26:53,798
Yes, but I told you that I will do it.

861
01:26:54,048 --> 01:26:55,842
I don't take my words back.

862
01:26:56,634 --> 01:27:02,182
That wasn't very polite.

863
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:01,449
<i>Hello, Mr. Watanabe.</i>

864
01:28:01,616 --> 01:28:04,536
<i>We had a small problem in printing.</i>

865
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:06,412
<i>I already called you yesterday...</i>

866
01:28:06,579 --> 01:28:09,582
<i>but your voicemail wasn't working.</i>

867
01:28:09,874 --> 01:28:12,252
<i>Call us as soon as possible, please.</i>

868
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,337
<i>Thank you.</i>

869
01:29:33,082 --> 01:29:35,126
<i>Mr. Watanabe?</i>

870
01:29:36,586 --> 01:29:38,463
<i>Are you there?</i>

871
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:40,507
<i>It's Miwa.</i>

872
01:29:41,132 --> 01:29:43,760
<i>Are you home?</i>

873
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:49,265
<i>They called me from the printing house.</i>

874
01:29:50,141 --> 01:29:52,268
Hello, Mr. Miwa?

875
01:29:54,938 --> 01:29:56,481
Really?

876
01:29:58,066 --> 01:30:00,902
Hold on, I will take a look.

877
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:05,490
<i>It's like a line is missing.</i>

878
01:30:07,325 --> 01:30:11,788
<i>They stopped printing and they aren't happy.</i>

879
01:30:12,247 --> 01:30:14,290
<i>I won't take long.</i>

880
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:17,043
<i>- Let me read it to you.
- Yes, tell me.</i>

881
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:19,170
<i>Will your also look in your computer?</i>

882
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:21,130
Where can I find it?

883
01:30:21,297 --> 01:30:24,217
<i>Chapter 10, page 132.</i>

884
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,136
Page 132.

885
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:30,098
<i>Line seven.</i>

886
01:30:30,265 --> 01:30:32,058
<i>I will read it to you.</i>

887
01:30:32,559 --> 01:30:35,478
<i>"man with little experience..."</i>

888
01:30:38,398 --> 01:30:40,024
Then?

889
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:43,111
Hello?

890
01:30:43,736 --> 01:30:45,613
The line cut off.

891
01:30:52,954 --> 01:30:55,415
Sorry, the line cut off.

892
01:30:59,502 --> 01:31:00,753
Hello?

893
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,547
Who is it?

894
01:31:08,178 --> 01:31:09,888
Akiko!

895
01:31:10,597 --> 01:31:12,307
What is going on?

896
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,267
Where are you?

897
01:31:16,144 --> 01:31:19,814
I'm coming to get you.

898
01:31:20,315 --> 01:31:22,442
Stay where you are.

899
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:25,570
Don't move. I come right over.

900
01:34:56,322 --> 01:34:58,199
Get in the car.

901
01:36:45,098 --> 01:36:49,102
Why do you sit here?
It's cold, let's go upstairs.

902
01:36:49,269 --> 01:36:52,021
I want to be alone for a while.

903
01:36:52,188 --> 01:36:55,191
No, let's go inside.

904
01:37:03,324 --> 01:37:07,245
Let me see it.

905
01:37:13,459 --> 01:37:15,420
I will go to the pharmacy.

906
01:37:16,045 --> 01:37:18,173
Wait for me upstairs.

907
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:21,551
Go, there is nobody there.

908
01:37:44,115 --> 01:37:46,409
Miss...

909
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:48,703
What happened to you?

910
01:37:49,078 --> 01:37:52,999
Aren't you the granddaughter
of Mr. Watanabe?

911
01:37:53,499 --> 01:37:56,461
You look exactly like your mother when she was young.

912
01:37:56,669 --> 01:38:01,132
Of course, after what happened, nothing was the same.

913
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:03,718
But this belongs to the past.

914
01:38:04,469 --> 01:38:06,429
Your mother also came?

915
01:38:07,722 --> 01:38:09,516
No.

916
01:38:10,558 --> 01:38:13,645
Why do you talk like that?

917
01:38:14,729 --> 01:38:17,106
I have a toothache.

918
01:38:19,442 --> 01:38:23,279
Gargle with salt water.

919
01:38:24,364 --> 01:38:27,283
I saw you this morning...

920
01:38:27,575 --> 01:38:30,286
when you left with your grandfather.

921
01:38:30,662 --> 01:38:33,456
But later, he came back alone.

922
01:38:33,748 --> 01:38:37,585
I wanted to ask you something.

923
01:38:38,336 --> 01:38:42,423
I told him something and he became angry.

924
01:38:42,799 --> 01:38:45,969
At least you look at me.

925
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:48,513
Lately...

926
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:52,058
he doesn't look at me or greet me.

927
01:38:53,059 --> 01:38:56,396
I didn't ask anything difficult.

928
01:38:56,646 --> 01:39:00,567
Only if he could maybe park a bit farther back.

929
01:39:01,985 --> 01:39:04,279
You will stay long?

930
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,407
I'm not sure.

931
01:39:07,866 --> 01:39:12,328
Your mother didn't come to see her father?

932
01:39:13,621 --> 01:39:15,164
No.

933
01:39:15,707 --> 01:39:21,880
Nowadays people don't visit the elderly.

934
01:39:22,088 --> 01:39:24,632
I'm single...

935
01:39:25,091 --> 01:39:28,511
and I don't have children, and that's it.

936
01:39:28,761 --> 01:39:32,432
I spend my time looking through the window.

937
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,311
It's my only hobby.

938
01:39:36,728 --> 01:39:38,855
All I have left.

939
01:39:39,939 --> 01:39:41,316
Let me tell you something.

940
01:39:41,941 --> 01:39:45,278
I would have liked to marry your grandfather.

941
01:39:45,445 --> 01:39:46,779
Really?

942
01:39:46,946 --> 01:39:48,656
How can I say it?

943
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:50,825
When your grandmother came...

944
01:39:51,117 --> 01:39:54,954
I had to forget my dreams.

945
01:39:55,205 --> 01:39:59,501
The truth is that those times with your grandfather...

946
01:39:59,834 --> 01:40:02,795
She was his colleague, an educated woman…

947
01:40:02,962 --> 01:40:05,590
cute, tall.

948
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:08,801
How know how men are.

949
01:40:10,303 --> 01:40:12,347
She caught his attention.

950
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,058
Me, however, to tell you the truth...

951
01:40:15,391 --> 01:40:18,353
I was beautiful in my time.

952
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,689
Maybe not so tall.

953
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:28,488
Of course, I had my disabled brother.

954
01:40:28,988 --> 01:40:32,909
If I had married your grandfather,
since we are neighbours...

955
01:40:33,117 --> 01:40:36,788
I could have taken care of both him and my brother.

956
01:40:36,996 --> 01:40:39,123
Unique opportunity.

957
01:40:39,457 --> 01:40:45,004
I could not ask for anything better.

958
01:40:45,421 --> 01:40:47,632
But then, your grandmother came.

959
01:40:47,841 --> 01:40:49,717
It was meant to be, I guess.

960
01:40:49,926 --> 01:40:52,470
Now I look at him when he passes by.

961
01:40:52,637 --> 01:40:55,098
It's my only pleasure.

962
01:40:57,392 --> 01:41:00,311
Sorry, it's my brother.

963
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:04,691
<i>Take this away from here!</i>

964
01:41:04,816 --> 01:41:07,819
<i>Take it!</i>

965
01:41:41,186 --> 01:41:46,232
Why didn't you go upstairs?
It's cold.

966
01:41:55,491 --> 01:41:57,452
Come in.

967
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:07,795
Sit.

968
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:16,763
I will reheat the soup.

969
01:42:17,138 --> 01:42:21,059
No, you said you don't eat soup.

970
01:42:21,601 --> 01:42:25,104
Do you prefer some milk?

971
01:42:27,106 --> 01:42:28,816
I will warm it for you.

972
01:42:29,108 --> 01:42:30,818
Do you drink milk?

973
01:42:31,402 --> 01:42:34,239
Let's see if I have any.

974
01:42:39,202 --> 01:42:40,828
I do.

975
01:42:40,995 --> 01:42:42,956
I will heat it for you.

976
01:42:48,294 --> 01:42:50,839
It won't take long.

977
01:43:36,759 --> 01:43:38,469
It's coming.

978
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,393
Show me your wound.

979
01:43:48,605 --> 01:43:50,565
Let me see.

980
01:43:50,815 --> 01:43:52,775
Move your hand.

981
01:43:54,277 --> 01:43:56,237
We must clean it.

982
01:43:56,654 --> 01:43:58,448
Otherwise it will swell.

983
01:43:59,282 --> 01:44:01,075
We will fix it.

984
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:03,578
That's what we will do.

985
01:44:06,998 --> 01:44:10,084
Don't be afraid, it won't sting.

986
01:44:11,586 --> 01:44:14,339
Otherwise it will become infected.

987
01:44:14,589 --> 01:44:17,217
You are not scared, right?

988
01:44:24,474 --> 01:44:26,351
Move your hand.

989
01:44:26,518 --> 01:44:28,144
It won't sting.

990
01:44:28,353 --> 01:44:30,563
Really, you won't feel anything

991
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:35,360
Who is it? Just a minute.

992
01:44:56,756 --> 01:44:58,550
<i>Can you open?</i>

993
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:00,468
Everything is okay.

994
01:45:02,762 --> 01:45:05,640
<i>Do you hear me?
I want to talk to you.</i>

995
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,811
<i>Open!</i>

996
01:45:22,073 --> 01:45:24,826
<i>Don't pretend you don't hear me.</i>

997
01:45:25,577 --> 01:45:28,204
<i>Open!</i>

998
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:36,504
<i>Liar!</i>

999
01:45:37,088 --> 01:45:38,965
<i>Come down!</i>

1000
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:25,303
<i>Why are you hiding?</i>

1001
