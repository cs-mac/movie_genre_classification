1
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:10,257
<i>These violent delights
have violent ends...</i>

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,018
<i>And in their triumph die...</i>

3
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,707
<i>...like fire and powder,</i>

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,215
<i>Which, as they kiss...</i>

5
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:20,810
<i>...consume.</i>

6
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,654
Gran?

7
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:57,578
Edward, don't!
She will see you.

8
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:08,936
Okay.

9
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,390
Grandma, I would like
you to meet...

10
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,319
Happy birthday, Bella.

11
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:05,175
Happy birthday, Bells.

12
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,607
I thought we agreed,
no presents.

13
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:14,566
Well, the one from me is not
wrapped. So, it doesn't count.

14
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:20,348
It's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.

15
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,881
Uh, goes with this one
from your mom.

16
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,667
We coordinated.

17
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,028
Well, she coordinated me.

18
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,346
It's to put your pictures in,
from senior year.

19
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,140
Senior year.

20
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:37,794
How'd you get so old so fast?

21
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,984
I didn't.
It's not that old.

22
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,199
I don't know.

23
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,519
Is that a grey hair?

24
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:45,156
No! No way!

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,717
Happy Birthday.

26
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,594
It's really funny.

27
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:55,888
<i>Another missing hiker brings
the total to three presumed dead.</i>

28
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:58,295
<i>The Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...</i>

29
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,864
Oh, it's Bella.
Bella!

30
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,664
- Hey.
- Hey.

31
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:13,939
Today is the big day, Bella.

32
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:16,137
Uh, R and J essay due?

33
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:17,653
Oh, yeah!

34
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,893
"Wherefore art thou, Bella?"

35
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:23,110
I wanna take a picture of you guys.
My Mom...

36
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,756
...wants me to put together, like
a scrapbook full of memories.

37
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,461
Oh, of course, yeah.
-I take them, I'm not in them.

38
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:29,821
No, no, no, come here.

39
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,379
You'll photoshop my nose
if it looks big, right?

40
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,784
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

41
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:34,785
It's good.

42
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:38,775
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.

43
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:39,776
Yay.

44
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,034
Well, catch you later.

45
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,636
Happy birthday.

46
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,934
Don't remind me.

47
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:11,976
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,637
But my aging is not.
- Your aging?

49
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:19,838
I think 18 is a little young
to start worring about that.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,391
It's one year older than you.

51
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:24,009
No, it isn't.
I'm a hundred and nine.

52
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:27,225
Wow! Maybe I should'nt be
dating such an old man.

53
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:30,971
It's gross!
I should be thoroughly repulsed.

54
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,597
We have to go to class.

55
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:45,357
Okay.

56
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,621
Wait a second.

57
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,329
Someone wants you.

58
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,366
Bella!

59
00:04:54,367 --> 00:05:00,309
- Jacob!
- I'll leave you to talk.

60
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:09,459
Hello, biceps! You know, anabolic
steroids are really bad for you.

61
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,688
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

62
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,806
You know, wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

63
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:17,218
We should switch schools.

64
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,703
Then you can come hang out
with the pale faces.

65
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:19,690
I'm alright.

66
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,795
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.

67
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:24,651
They let any old rift raft into this place.

68
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,851
I see.
Why are you slumming it?

69
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:29,198
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

70
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:32,072
You should really come, take a ride,
when it's done.

71
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:33,302
Is it fast?

72
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:37,196
Uhm..it's decent.

73
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,197
Okay.
- Okay, good.

74
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,980
Hey, happy birthday.

75
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,122
Your Dad told my Dad.
So...

76
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:47,912
Yeah, of course, he did.

77
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:51,979
I saw this the other day and
thought of you.

78
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:54,445
It catches bad dreams.

79
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:58,648
Thats kind of perfect.

80
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,628
Thank you.

81
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,485
No problem.

82
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,914
See you soon. Bye.
- Yeah, see you later.

83
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:12,021
So, how come Jacob Black gets to
give you a gift and I don't?

84
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:16,011
Because I have nothing
to give back to you.

85
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,931
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

86
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:25,020
See? Thank you.
That's all I want.

87
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,218
Bella!

88
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:28,816
Happy Birthday!

89
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:29,975
Shhh!

90
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,690
Alice, I thought I told you,
no presents.

91
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:37,120
I've already seen you open it
and guess what? You love it!

92
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,861
You're gonna wear it tonight,
our place.

93
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:45,271
Come on, please?
It will be fun.

94
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:49,768
Okay. Alright.

95
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,161
Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

96
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:56,127
Jasper...

97
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,431
...no fair with the mood control
thing.

98
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,368
Sorry, Bella.

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,860
Happy...
Never mind.

100
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:07,894
You can't trust vampires.

101
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,029
Trust me!

102
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,772
<i>O, my love!
My wife!</i>

103
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:15,937
<i>Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath.</i>

104
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:18,498
<i>Hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.</i>

105
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:21,218
<i>Thou art not conquered.</i>

106
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:27,058
<i>Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips
and in thy cheeks.</i>

107
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,098
<i>And death's pale flag
is not advanced there.</i>

108
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:31,640
I hate being celebrated.

109
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,271
There are worse tragedies.
Hm, look at Romeo.

110
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:37,462
He kills his true love
out of sheer stupidity.

111
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,456
Yeah.

112
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,682
Though I do envy him,
one thing.

113
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:48,804
Juliet. She's like perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

114
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:56,677
No, not the girl, dear.
The suicide.

115
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:06,655
It's nearly impossible for
some people.

116
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:13,085
For humans,
a little poison...

117
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,155
...a dagger to the heart...

118
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,510
So many different options.

119
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,465
Why would you say that?

120
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,809
Because I had to considered it once.

121
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:31,393
I didn't know,
if I'd get to you in time.

122
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,915
I had to come up with
some kind of plan.

123
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:38,881
And what was the plan?

124
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,564
Uh, go to Italy,

125
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,305
...provoke the Volturi.

126
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,343
The what?

127
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,499
The Volturi.

128
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,933
Now, who would like to repeat
the last few lines...

129
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:50,134
of iambic pentameter just to show,
they were paying attention?

130
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:51,965
Mr. Cullen.

131
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,719
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy. Uhm.

132
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:02,455
<i>O, here.
Will I set up my everlasting rest,</i>

133
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:07,825
<i>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.</i>

134
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:10,528
<i>Eyes, look your last!</i>

135
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,358
<i>Arms, take your last embrace!</i>

136
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:17,330
<i>And lips, O you,
the doors of breath,</i>

137
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:20,197
<i>...seal with a righteous kiss.</i>

138
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:22,332
<i>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</i>

139
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,309
Eyes on the screen, people.

140
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,560
<i>Thus with a kiss I die.</i>

141
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:36,758
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

142
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,924
I guess, the closest thing to royalty
my world has.

143
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:42,635
Is that Carlisle?

144
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,646
Yeah. He lived with them
for a few decades.

145
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,893
Described them as
very refined.

146
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:51,448
No respect for human life,
of course, but...

147
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,747
...respect for the arts
and sciences at least.

148
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,220
<i>And the law...</i>

149
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,134
<i>...above all, the law.</i>

150
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,798
<i>Vampires have laws?</i>

151
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,131
<i>Not very many.</i>

152
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,833
<i>And only one thats
regularly enforced.</i>

153
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,013
<i>What is it?</i>

154
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,587
<i>That we keep the existence
of our kind a secret.</i>

155
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,142
<i>We don't make spectacles
of ourselves.</i>

156
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:28,211
<i>And we don't kill conspicuously.</i>

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,364
<i>Unless, of course,
you want to die.</i>

158
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,714
We have to stop talking
about that.

159
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:54,307
I can't even think...
...about someone hurting you.

160
00:10:55,882 --> 00:11:00,885
Bella, the only thing that
can hurt me is you.

161
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,536
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

162
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,478
That's not true.

163
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,608
Victoria?
She will come for me one day.

164
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:16,319
Alice will see
what she decides and...

165
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:18,031
...we will be ready.
- I can protect you.

166
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:20,698
If you change me.

167
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:23,851
Bella, you already do protect me.

168
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:31,537
You're my only reason
to stay alive,

169
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:33,200
...if that's what I am.

170
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,625
But it's my job to protect you.

171
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:43,097
From everyone...

172
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,600
...except my sister.

173
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,367
It's time!
It's time! It's time! It's time!

174
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:58,987
Sorry about all this.

175
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,860
We tried to rein Alice in.

176
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,216
Like it's even possible.

177
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,866
Happy big Birthday, Bella!

178
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:04,789
Thanks.

179
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,790
I found it in your bag...

180
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,690
Do you mind?

181
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:12,573
Dating an older woman?
Hot!

182
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,045
What?

183
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,066
You first Rosalie.

184
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:23,159
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

185
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,480
Thanks.

186
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,171
Show me the love.

187
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:34,697
This one's from Emmett.

188
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,879
Already installed it in your truck.

189
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,687
Finally, a decent sound system
for that piece of cr...

190
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:43,659
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.

191
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,990
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

192
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,886
Just a little something
to brighten your day.

193
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,146
We think, you're looking
kind of pale lately.

194
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:58,147
Ow.

195
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,883
Paper cut.

196
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,569
Jas... Jas!... shh, shh.
It's okay.

197
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:31,368
It's just a little...blood.

198
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,388
Get Jasper out of here.

199
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:48,267
I'm sor...
I'm sorry, I can't.

200
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:52,207
I'll have to stitch this up
in my office.

201
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,704
Check on Jasper. I'm sure
he's very upset with himself.

202
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:01,480
And I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

203
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,091
Edward.

204
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,859
I never wanted to have a party.

205
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,807
It's not your fault.

206
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:22,291
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

207
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:25,721
How do you do it?

208
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,880
Years and years of practice.

209
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:30,993
Did you ever think of...

210
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:33,738
...just doing it the easier way?

211
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:38,661
No. I knew who I
wanted to be.

212
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:42,500
I wanted to help people.
Brings me happiness.

213
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,805
Even if I'm damned about this.

214
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:51,733
Damned?
Like... like hell?

215
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,604
Carlisle, you can't be damned.

216
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:02,128
You couldn't, it's impossible.

217
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:04,505
Thank you, Bella.

218
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:08,780
You always been very
gracious about us.

219
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:16,375
So, that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

220
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,728
Imagine the situation in reverse.

221
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:25,584
If you believed as Edward does

222
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:28,628
...could you take away his soul?

223
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,137
You can't protect me.

224
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,458
From everything.

225
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:59,206
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

226
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:03,228
It's gonna be an accident,

227
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,309
....or illness,

228
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,748
...or old age.

229
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:09,732
As long as I'm human.

230
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:12,870
And the only solution
is to change me.

231
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,371
That's not a solution,
it's a tragedy.

232
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:19,603
You're not gonna want me
when I look like a grandmother.

233
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:35,078
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you? No?

234
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:46,087
Carlisle told me how you
feel about your soul.

235
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,088
I don't believe that.

236
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,207
So don't worry about mine.

237
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:52,649
You should go inside.

238
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:08,427
It's still my birthday.

239
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,024
Can I ask one thing?

240
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:19,526
Kiss me?

241
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,243
I love you.

242
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:53,923
I love you.

243
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:12,884
Hey.

244
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:19,777
Come for a walk with me.

245
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,085
We got to leave Forks.

246
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,464
Why?

247
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:54,208
Carlisle's supposed to be
ten years older than he looks.

248
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:58,066
People are starting to notice.

249
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:01,175
Okay,I..

250
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,743
I gotta think of something
to say to Charlie.

251
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:17,202
When you say "we"...

252
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,429
I mean to my family and myself.

253
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:31,060
Edward, what happened with Jasper,

254
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:32,537
...it's nothing.
- You're right.

255
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:34,312
It was nothing.

256
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:38,652
Nothing the way
I always expected.

257
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,901
And nothing compared to
what could have happened.

258
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:51,960
You just don't belong
to my world, Bella.

259
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:59,028
I belong with you.

260
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:03,156
No, you don't.

261
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,122
I'm coming.

262
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:12,033
Bella...
I don't want you to come.

263
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:22,024
You don't want me?

264
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:27,869
No.

265
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:34,940
This changes things...a lot.

266
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,186
But if it's not
too much to ask...

267
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:42,139
...can you at least
promise me something?

268
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,305
Don't do anything reckless.

269
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,931
For Charlie's sake.

270
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:54,540
And I'll promise something
to you in return.

271
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,612
This is the last time
you'll ever see me.

272
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:00,048
I won't come back.

273
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,392
And you can go on
with your life...

274
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:03,793
...without any interference from me.

275
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,895
It will be like I never existed,
I promise.

276
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:14,037
If this is about my soul, take it.

277
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:14,958
I don't want it without you.

278
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,028
It's not about your soul.

279
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:23,698
You're just not good for me.

280
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,319
I'm not good enough for you?

281
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,186
I'm just sorry,
I let this go on for so long.

282
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:33,744
Please...

283
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,537
...don't.

284
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:43,088
Goodbye.

285
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,002
Edward?

286
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,307
Edward!

287
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:16,596
Edward!

288
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:21,131
Edward?

289
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:29,832
Edward.

290
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,665
I'll try to call Cullens place again.

291
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:25,920
The Cullens left town, Charlie.

292
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:26,961
Good riddance!

293
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:28,398
Where did they go?

294
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,342
We'll find her, Charlie.

295
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,022
Thanks, Harry.

296
00:25:33,055 --> 00:25:34,085
Charlie!

297
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,580
She's alright.

298
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:42,111
I got her.

299
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:44,144
Thank you, Sam.

300
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:13,120
October.

301
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:40,542
November.

302
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:54,828
<i>Alice... ...you've disappeared.</i>

303
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:58,499
<i>Like everything else.</i>

304
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,818
<i>But who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.</i>

305
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:09,078
December.

306
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,097
<i>When you left...</i>

307
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,477
<i>and he left...</i>

308
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:18,762
<i>You took everything with you.</i>

309
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:23,292
<i>But the absence of him
is everywhere I look...</i>

310
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:34,913
<i>It's like a huge hole has been
punched through my chest.</i>

311
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:57,795
<i>But in a way I'm glad.</i>

312
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,279
<i>The pain is my only reminder that
he was real...</i>

313
00:28:01,373 --> 00:28:03,737
<i>...that you all were.</i>

314
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:07,462
<i>"Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender"</i>

315
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:14,000
Alright, that's it.

316
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:17,579
What?

317
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,074
You're going to Jacksonville

318
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,771
...to live with your mother.

319
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,101
I'm not leaving Forks.

320
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:31,464
Bells, he's not coming back.

321
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:34,635
I know.

322
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:38,506
It's just not normal,
this behavior.

323
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:42,435
Quite frankly, it's scaring
the hell outta me and your Mother.

324
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:46,877
Baby, I... I don't want you to leave.

325
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:50,192
Go to Jacksonville,

326
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,295
...make some new friends.

327
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,881
I like my old friends.

328
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:54,531
Well, you never see them anymore.

329
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:56,471
I do, yeah.

330
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:03,766
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow,
with Jessica.

331
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:06,307
You hate shopping.

332
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:10,853
I need a girl's night out.

333
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:15,903
Alright.
Girl's night.

334
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,750
Shopping.

335
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:23,860
I like it, go.
Buy some good stuff.

336
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,528
<i>Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.</i>

337
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,725
<i>Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.</i>

338
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:43,360
I don't know, why you wanna sit through
all those zombies eating people,

339
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:46,529
...and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.

340
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:48,904
Like why there are
so many zombie movies anyway?.

341
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,942
Is it supposed to like
draw a parallel about leprosy?

342
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:53,581
My cousin had leprosy,
it's not funny, you know?

343
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,651
And like is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

344
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:01,303
Cause don't be so pleased with your own
like, self-reverential cleverness, you know?

345
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:05,053
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

346
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:07,206
Although I was surprised you
even called at all, you know?

347
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:11,193
Like, your depression thing.
I get it. I'm totally totally worried.

348
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:13,698
After a while, it's like,
she's still bumming?

349
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,459
And I'm going through
stuff too, you know?

350
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:18,124
Like Mike deciding
he wanted to "just be friends" !

351
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:20,272
It's hard, you know?

352
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:21,273
<i>What's up, guys?</i>

353
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:22,274
<i>Where you going?</i>

354
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:32,869
<i>Keep walking.</i>

355
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:37,083
<i>This is dangerous.</i>

356
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:46,517
Dude, come on.

357
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:47,518
<i>Come here for a sec!</i>

358
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:53,912
I think, I know those guys.

359
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:55,543
<i>We got beer! We got bikes!</i>

360
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:59,508
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?

361
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,988
I just need to see something.

362
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:04,989
<i>Hey, girlie!</i>

363
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:11,346
Alright, Alright!
We got a taker.

364
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:13,899
<i>Turn around.</i>

365
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>

366
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:37,735
Sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.

367
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,319
That's cool! I'll be whomever
you want to be, honey.

368
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,744
So, what do you say?

369
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,480
<i>You promised me nothing reckless.</i>

370
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:57,029
You promised, it would as
if you never existed.

371
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:03,147
You lied.

372
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:06,376
Say some'n, babe?
You know what? Never mind.

373
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:23,197
Stop.

374
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,456
Stop! Stop! Stop!

375
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:38,849
Hey, um, what the hell is wrong with you?
-Just curious.

376
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,866
I thought that I saw something.

377
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:46,592
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.

378
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:49,582
That homeboy
could have been a psycho.

379
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:53,882
I was about to end up in a FBI interview
room,like some lame TV show.

380
00:32:54,744 --> 00:32:58,160
That was such a rush!
-Awesome!

381
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:00,751
So, you're an adrenaline junky now?

382
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,334
That's cool!
You can go bungee jumping.

383
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:04,763
You don't get on the back of some
random loser's motorcycle!

384
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:05,942
Crazy!

385
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,858
<i>Alice, I saw him.</i>

386
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:17,233
<i>Maybe I'm crazy now,
but I guess that's okay.</i>

387
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:24,261
<i>If a rush of danger is what it takes
to see him, then that's what I'll find.</i>

388
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:29,262
Bella!

389
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:33,066
Where the hell have you been, looker?

390
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,740
I... brought you something.
- Okay.

391
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:42,623
It's a little crazy.

392
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:50,578
Wow, scrap metal!
You shouldn't have.

393
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,482
I saved it from the junkyard.

394
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,687
I think, they'll probably cost
more to fix than they're worth..

395
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:02,212
But then I thought that if I had a
mechanic friend to help me out,

396
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:06,341
Ah! Me, being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.

397
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,970
Since when are you into motorcycles?

398
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:10,297
Since now.

399
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:19,009
I get it if you think that this
is really stupid and reckless.

400
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:21,642
Yeah, it's completely
stupid and reckless.

401
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,467
When do we start?

402
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:31,715
Now!

403
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,232
Please.
- Alright.

404
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:39,784
Oh, hey, be careful. These things
are actually really...heavy. So,

405
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:49,732
Jake, you're like buff. How that can happen?
You're like 16, I don't get it.

406
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:53,973
Age is just a number, baby.
What, you're like 40, now?

407
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,679
Feels like that sometimes.

408
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:11,952
That song was good.
You don't like it?

409
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:16,206
I don't really like music anymore

410
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:19,179
...kind of.
- Okay.

411
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:21,225
No more music.

412
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:26,553
I was thinking,if we're gonna do this
everyday, and hopefully we will,

413
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,912
We have to, like, fit some
homework in there somewhere.

414
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:32,304
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

415
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,808
You influence me?

416
00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:36,361
Please.

417
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:40,621
Are you...?
I'm older than you.

418
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:43,815
So that makes me the influencer
and you the influence.

419
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:49,385
No, no, no. My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you.

420
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,481
Because of your gentle paleness
and lack of know-how.

421
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,798
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

422
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,370
Don't you think that makes
you funny, young and naive?

423
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:59,996
Okay.
So, where do we stand?

424
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,095
I'm thirty five...

425
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,733
...and you might be like 32.

426
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:04,845
Come on.

427
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:05,767
Yo, Jake, you in there?
- No, it's okay.

428
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:08,859
It's... It's just my boys.

429
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:09,873
Hey, Jake...

430
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:11,806
Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

431
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,121
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.

432
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:16,448
I'm Quil Ateara.

433
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:19,868
So the bike building story is true.

434
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:22,224
Oh, yeah, yeah!
I taught him everything he knows.

435
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:25,013
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

436
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,458
Uh, we're friends, you know?

437
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,986
Hmm. Burn!

438
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:32,793
Actually, I remember, I said
she's a girl and a friend.

439
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:34,569
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

440
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:35,458
Nope!

441
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:37,760
So you guys have girlfriends.
It's awesome.

442
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:40,264
Yeah, right.

443
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,555
Quil's actually taken his cousin to prom.

444
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,835
Yeah, that's still a riot.

445
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,695
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.

446
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:49,696
Jesus!

447
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,331
I got five bucks on Quil.

448
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:54,869
You're on.

449
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:19,439
<i>Dear Alice, I wish,
I had your real address.</i>

450
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,210
<i>I wish, I could tell you
about Jake.</i>

451
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,419
<i>He makes me feel better..</i>

452
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:30,252
<i>I mean,
he makes me feel alive.</i>

453
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:32,849
<i>The hole in my chest...</i>

454
00:37:33,974 --> 00:37:36,410
<i>...while when I'm with Jake,</i>

455
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:39,136
<i>It's like, it almost healed.</i>

456
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:40,784
<i>For a while.</i>

457
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,226
Quil keeps asking to come over.

458
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,044
I think he likes you
a little too much.

459
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:50,124
Oh, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing, you know?

460
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:54,801
What's up with you and age?

461
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:58,965
I mean, how old was that
Cullen guy anyway?

462
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,886
<i>But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.</i>

463
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:18,193
Hey, Bella!  Shh, Shh, Shh,
you're alright. You're okay.

464
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:30,739
I thought this thing was
starting to work,

465
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,804
...but I guess not.

466
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:40,894
Can I ask you something?

467
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:45,369
Hanging out with Jacob...

468
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:48,665
...that seems to take your mind
off things for a bit, doesn't it?

469
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:59,688
You know, sometimes you gotta
learn to love what's good for you.

470
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,728
You know, what I mean?

471
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,711
Of course, what do I know?

472
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,108
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

473
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,108
Famous ladies man.

474
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:18,917
Okay...

475
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:21,580
Go to bed.

476
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:24,350
I love you.

477
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:34,812
If I told you, I couldn't fix these
bikes, what would you have said?

478
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,433
Are you doubting your mad skills?

479
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:40,899
No.

480
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,924
No, definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.

481
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,912
It's just, uh...

482
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:51,031
May be if I was smarter I would've
dragged out the rebuild a bit.

483
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:59,923
If you told me, you couldn't fix these
bikes. I would say that that's...

484
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:03,956
...really too bad but were gonna
find something else to do.

485
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:09,749
Is that Sam Uley?

486
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,112
Yeah, and his cult.

487
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:20,255
Oh, my God!

488
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,273
Did you see that?

489
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,083
They're not really fighting, Bella.

490
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,830
They're cliff diving.

491
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,651
Scary as hell,
but a total rush

492
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:38,048
Rush?

493
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,465
Most of us jump from lower down.

494
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:43,158
We'll leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

495
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:47,563
Is some kind of beef
with them or something?

496
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:50,973
Oh, no.

497
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:53,291
They just think they run this place.

498
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:57,697
Embry used to call them hall
monitors on steroids.

499
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:01,660
Now, look at him.
- That's Embry?

500
00:41:01,694 --> 00:41:03,061
Yeah.
- What happened to him?

501
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:05,222
He missed some school...

502
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:08,805
...and all of a sudden started following
Sam around like a little puppy.

503
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:11,444
Same thing with Paul and Jared.

504
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:18,982
Sam keeps giving me this look, like
he's been waiting for me or something.

505
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,912
It's kinda starting to freak me out.

506
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,032
Well, you should just avoid him.

507
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:29,429
I'll try.

508
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,430
Okay.

509
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:50,857
You look scared.
- I'm not.

510
00:41:52,665 --> 00:41:53,544
Alright!

511
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:55,924
Brake.

512
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:01,512
Clutch. Good.

513
00:42:01,546 --> 00:42:03,087
Gas.

514
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,529
Ready?

515
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:09,951
Now slowly... release the clutch.

516
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,607
<i>Bella</i>

517
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:18,196
<i>Stop.</i>

518
00:42:23,169 --> 00:42:24,636
You alright?

519
00:42:25,982 --> 00:42:27,550
I'm gonna go again.

520
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:48,311
Hit the brake!

521
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:03,574
I wanna go again.

522
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:05,043
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

523
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:07,653
I'll try again.
- No, forget it.

524
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:10,772
No more bikes.

525
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,991
Man, your head.

526
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:17,814
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

527
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:21,165
You're apologizing for bleeding?

528
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,210
Yeah, I guess, I am.

529
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:27,841
Well, it's just blood, Bella.

530
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:29,732
No big deal.

531
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:42,961
What are you staring at?

532
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,130
You're sort of beautiful.

533
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:58,553
How hard did you hit your head?

534
00:43:58,554 --> 00:43:59,554
I dont know.

535
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,038
Let's go.

536
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:11,101
I did see something.
- Totally, baby, I believe you.

537
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,102
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

538
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,398
It was jet black and huge.

539
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:20,592
On all fours, it was still taller
than a person.

540
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:22,430
A bear, maybe?

541
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:25,282
Or an alien.
You're lucky that you didn't get probed.

542
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:28,542
Oh, yeah.
- Well, I saw it.

543
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:30,555
You're not the only one.

544
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:33,846
My Dad's been getting
reports at the station.

545
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,737
Like five hikers been killed by some bear.

546
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:39,294
But they can't find the bear.

547
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:45,403
Last time you clowns
doubt my girlfriend.

548
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:52,133
So, I mean...
Bella is back!

549
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,198
Yeah, I guess so.

550
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,921
Huh, that's cool...
Welcome.

551
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,847
So listen, not now that...
You know, you're talking and...

552
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,826
...eating again, you know?

553
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:10,748
You gotta get that protein in there.

554
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:16,287
I was just wondering,
if you wanted to go see a movie with me.

555
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:21,537
Yeah, sure.

556
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,088
Yeah, I do.

557
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:30,886
Cool, um, let me see...We could check out
"Love Spelled Backwards Is Love".

558
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:32,834
Yeah, it's a dumb title,

559
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:35,166
...but, um, it's a romantic comedy.
I mean, it's supposed to be.

560
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,994
No. No romance.

561
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:43,457
How about "Face Punch"?
You heard of that?

562
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:47,812
Well, it's an action movie.
- Yeah, it's perfect.

563
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:52,579
With guns... adrenaline...
...it's my thing

564
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,138
Okay.

565
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:57,666
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys wanna go see...

566
00:45:57,764 --> 00:46:00,126
..."Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"? Yeah!

567
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:02,548
Mike, hey, we were supposed
to watch that?

568
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:04,579
Remember the trailer's like punch faces...
- Yeah?

569
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:08,066
Movie night with Bella!

570
00:46:11,023 --> 00:46:14,159
So, "Face Punch", huh?
You like action movies?

571
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:18,450
Not really.

572
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:23,710
I heard it sucks. Bad.

573
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:27,084
Hey, are you even old enough
to see this movie?

574
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:29,955
I mean, you know, without adult supervision?
- Right, yeah.

575
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,154
Well, she's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it, okay.

576
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:36,402
Jessica bailed

577
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:39,629
...and Angela's got the stomach flu,
so Eric's taking care of her.

578
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,747
So, it's just us three.
- Great.

579
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:45,389
Great.
- Yeah.

580
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,993
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

581
00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:52,755
<i>Put your gun down or I'm gonna
blow your freaking head off.</i>

582
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:58,088
<i>Put both of your guns down or I'm gonna
blow both of your freaking heads off.</i>

583
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:02,386
<i>Alright, let's do this!</i>

584
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:21,224
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up!

585
00:47:26,558 --> 00:47:30,164
Jesus!
- What a marshmallow!

586
00:47:31,162 --> 00:47:33,963
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

587
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:37,607
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

588
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:40,832
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.

589
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,994
I feel bad. He probably has
that flu that's going around.

590
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:52,878
What? I can't hold your hand?
- No, of course, you can.

591
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:59,862
I just think it means
something really different to you.

592
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:05,655
Okay, tell me something.
You like me, right?

593
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,291
And you think, I'm sorta beautiful?

594
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,646
Jake, please...
don't do this.

595
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,724
Why?

596
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:31,055
Because you are about
to ruin everything.

597
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,581
And I need you.

598
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,986
Well, I've got loads of time.

599
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:47,630
I'm not gonna give up.

600
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,240
I don't want you to.
- But...

601
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:55,802
It's just because I don't want you
to go anywhere.

602
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,327
It's... it's really selfish.

603
00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:07,198
You know, I'm not like a car
that you can fix up.

604
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:12,262
I'm never gonna run right.

605
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:15,908
So I should be fair to you.

606
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:19,975
It's because of him, right?

607
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:33,673
Look, I know what he did to you.

608
00:49:34,977 --> 00:49:40,234
But, Bella, I would never,
ever do that.

609
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:45,874
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.

610
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:48,713
I won't let you down.

611
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:50,650
You can count on me.

612
00:49:58,305 --> 00:49:59,993
Well...

613
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,283
I need to go home.

614
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:16,205
I'm... I was feeling sick
before the movie, okay?

615
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:19,983
What is your problem?

616
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,094
Right now?
You are my problem.

617
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:26,947
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

618
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:28,962
Do you want me
to put you in the hospital?

619
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:32,779
Jake... Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

620
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:36,788
Jake, you're really hot.

621
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:39,878
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

622
00:50:40,702 --> 00:50:43,695
I don't know what's happening.

623
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:47,378
I gotta go.

624
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:53,479
That dude is weird.

625
00:50:56,317 --> 00:50:59,502
<i>Jake, Uh, your Dad says you have mono.</i>

626
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:03,225
<i>He won't let me visit but...
would you call me?</i>

627
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:13,661
<i>Hey, uh, it's me again. I just...I'm sorry
about what I said at the movie theatre.</i>

628
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:19,800
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice.
So, no pressure.</i>

629
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:25,977
Jacob, please call me.

630
00:51:26,015 --> 00:51:29,661
Okay, we should be
back around three.

631
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:40,786
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
- Yes, you do.

632
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:43,183
Yeah, you do. Go.
What are you talking about?

633
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:46,256
Just be careful.
- I always am.

634
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,981
Those bears won't get
the drop on me, Bella.

635
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,361
My kung foo is strong.

636
00:52:23,704 --> 00:52:26,123
Jake!

637
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:34,035
You cut your hair off?

638
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,066
And got a tattoo?

639
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,793
Bella...

640
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,327
I thought you were too sick
to come outside.

641
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,514
Or pick up the phone
when I'd call.

642
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:54,161
Go away.
- What?

643
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,234
Go away.

644
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,921
What happened to you?
What's wrong?

645
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,571
Hey, what happened?

646
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:09,025
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

647
00:53:09,025 --> 00:53:13,097
Sam's trying to help me,
don't blame him.

648
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:15,594
But if you want somebody to blame,

649
00:53:15,594 --> 00:53:19,492
How about those
filthy bloodsuckers, you love?

650
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:20,493
The Cullens.

651
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,997
I don't know what are you talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

652
00:53:30,113 --> 00:53:33,531
You been lying to everyone.
Charlie...

653
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:37,294
But you can't lie to me.

654
00:53:38,063 --> 00:53:42,671
Not anymore, Bella.
- Come on! Jacob!

655
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,469
Look, Bella...

656
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,118
We can't be friends anymore.

657
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,919
Jake, I know that I have
been hurting you.

658
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:02,644
It's... it's killing me.
It kills me.

659
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:07,215
If you, may be,
give me like some time.

660
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:08,636
Don't!

661
00:54:09,404 --> 00:54:11,362
It's not you.

662
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,047
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?

663
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:20,427
It's true!
It is me.

664
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,535
I'm not... good.

665
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:30,605
I used to be... a good kid.

666
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:33,716
Not anymore.

667
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,749
This doesn't even matter, alright?
This is over.

668
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:40,207
You can't break up with me.

669
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:43,703
I mean...

670
00:54:44,432 --> 00:54:47,005
I mean, you're my best friend.

671
00:54:48,772 --> 00:54:51,077
You promised me.

672
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:56,992
I know. I promised that
I would'nt hurt you, Bella.

673
00:54:57,453 --> 00:55:00,372
And this is me keeping
that promise, Bella.

674
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:02,369
Go home.

675
00:55:02,561 --> 00:55:06,786
And don't come back.
Or you're gonna get hurt.

676
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:22,341
<i>Alice...
Things are...</i>

677
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:26,605
<i>Things are bad again.</i>

678
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:31,406
<i>Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.</i>

679
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:35,669
<i>I don't see Edward anymore.</i>

680
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:40,240
<i>Now it really feels like
he never existed.</i>

681
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:50,495
<i>I will find a place
where I can see him again.</i>

682
00:56:43,076 --> 00:56:46,649
- Bella.
- Laurent.

683
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:50,912
I didn't expect to find you here.

684
00:56:52,755 --> 00:56:57,594
I went to visit the Cullens, but...
their house is empty.

685
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:01,474
I'm surprised they left you behind.

686
00:57:01,742 --> 00:57:03,585
Weren't you sort of a, um,

687
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:06,697
...a pet of theirs?

688
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:08,849
Yeah. You could say that.

689
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,652
Do they Cullens visit often?

690
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:17,606
<i>Lie.</i>

691
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:24,864
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
- Lie better.

692
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,591
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

693
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:31,470
I probably shouldn't tell...

694
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,697
...Edward.

695
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:39,499
Because he's pretty protective.
- But he's far away, isn't he?

696
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:43,108
Why are you here?

697
00:57:43,147 --> 00:57:47,986
I came as a favor to Victoria.

698
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,635
Victoria?

699
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:55,360
She asked me to see if you were still
under the protection of the Cullens.

700
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:59,316
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate...

701
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,161
...given he killed hers.

702
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:03,272
An eye for an eye.

703
00:58:03,504 --> 00:58:06,345
Threaten him.
- Edward would know who did it!

704
00:58:06,576 --> 00:58:08,343
And he'd come after you.

705
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:11,031
I don't think he will.

706
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:14,795
After all, how much could
you mean to him...

707
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,597
...if he left you here unprotected?

708
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:22,976
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you.

709
00:58:23,014 --> 00:58:25,397
But I can't help myself.

710
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:28,277
You're so mouthwatering.
- Please, don't!

711
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,158
I mean, you've helped us.
- Shhhh!

712
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:35,114
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.

713
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:40,644
Victoria plans on killing you
slowly, painfully,

714
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:45,944
...where as I'll make it quick.
I promise.

715
00:58:45,983 --> 00:58:48,057
You will feel nothing.

716
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:55,278
Edward...

717
00:58:57,529 --> 00:58:59,349
Edward, I love you.

718
00:59:01,557 --> 00:59:03,900
I don't believe it.

719
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,247
Dad, I saw them!

720
01:00:09,324 --> 01:00:12,206
What's the matter?
- In the woods. They are not bears!

721
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:14,817
What you mean in the woods? Bells, what
the hell were you doing out in the woods?

722
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:18,544
They are wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves!

723
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:21,541
Are you sure about that, Bella?
- Yeah, I just saw them.

724
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,153
They were after... something.

725
01:00:24,345 --> 01:00:28,110
Wolves? You saw 'em?

726
01:00:30,722 --> 01:00:35,562
Alright. Well, Harry,
feel like going hunting?

727
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:37,291
Get some of your guys together?

728
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:40,941
Sure, yeah. I'll...
I'll just...

729
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:44,053
<i>I know that those wolves
will be dead.</i>

730
01:00:45,013 --> 01:00:47,318
<i>And Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.</i>

731
01:00:48,086 --> 01:00:49,699
<i>Victoria.</i>

732
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:52,619
I should go to the station.

733
01:00:52,658 --> 01:00:55,039
Yeah, you should...
You should go.

734
01:00:55,232 --> 01:00:57,806
You can just stay in the house?

735
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:23,429
Bella!

736
01:01:25,273 --> 01:01:26,733
Oh, you scared me.

737
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:29,806
What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I'm coming up.

738
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:42,807
Hey.

739
01:01:45,212 --> 01:01:47,631
Look, look, I'm sorry.

740
01:01:53,394 --> 01:01:55,814
For what?
- I wish I could explain,

741
01:01:55,852 --> 01:01:59,310
...but I literally... can't!

742
01:02:07,377 --> 01:02:10,565
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone?

743
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:13,678
One that wasn't yours to share.

744
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:20,747
Well, that's what
it's like for me. Or worse.

745
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:26,047
You have no idea,
how tight I'm bound.

746
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:27,777
I hate this.

747
01:02:28,507 --> 01:02:30,466
I hate what they have
done to you.

748
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,793
I mean, the killer part is
you already know!

749
01:02:51,172 --> 01:02:56,167
Bella, do you remember,
when walked on the beach in La Push?

750
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,509
The sto...

751
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:06,923
The story...
The story about the cold ones.

752
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:13,070
I guees, I understand why that's
the only part you remember.

753
01:03:19,715 --> 01:03:23,403
There must gotta be something
You can do...

754
01:03:23,403 --> 01:03:25,901
No.
I'm in it for life.

755
01:03:26,746 --> 01:03:28,705
May be we should just
get out of here for a while.

756
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:32,777
We'll just leave.
Just you and me.

757
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:35,159
You can do that?

758
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,654
I'll do it for you.

759
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:49,162
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

760
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:54,522
But I would run away with you.

761
01:03:57,056 --> 01:03:59,746
If I could.

762
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:06,545
I gotta go.
They'll certainly wonder where I am.

763
01:04:09,696 --> 01:04:11,155
Come here.

764
01:04:15,343 --> 01:04:19,223
Please...
Try to remember.

765
01:04:20,683 --> 01:04:25,600
It would be so much easier
if you knew...

766
01:04:27,982 --> 01:04:30,671
I'll try, but...
Jake.

767
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:33,629
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.

768
01:04:40,429 --> 01:04:41,888
Jake.

769
01:04:57,832 --> 01:04:59,560
Edward, I'm scared.

770
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,019
You should be.

771
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:08,703
<i>Really it's just like an old story...</i>

772
01:05:08,703 --> 01:05:10,316
<i>That we're not supposed to
say anything about...</i>

773
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:13,927
<i>Did you know, the Quileute are
supposed to be descendants from wolves?</i>

774
01:05:28,065 --> 01:05:29,486
Bella.

775
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:30,985
I need to see him.

776
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,788
He's not in.

777
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:37,610
I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella?

778
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,225
What did you do?

779
01:05:55,226 --> 01:05:56,226
Okay, what did you do?

780
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:58,606
Hey! What did you do to him?
- Easy!

781
01:05:58,606 --> 01:06:00,527
He didn't want this!
- What did we do?

782
01:06:00,527 --> 01:06:02,831
What did he do? What did he tell you?
- Both of you calm...

783
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,944
Nothing! He told me nothing,
because he's scared of you!

784
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:14,088
Too late, now.
- Bella, get back.

785
01:06:14,396 --> 01:06:17,353
Paul, calm down now.

786
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:26,803
Bella!

787
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:29,531
Run!

788
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:33,296
Jake, run!

789
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:12,757
Take Bella back to Emily's place.

790
01:07:13,602 --> 01:07:15,886
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

791
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:24,857
<i>Alice, is it possible that everything is true?</i>

792
01:07:24,896 --> 01:07:27,009
<i>Fairy tales and
horror stories?</i>

793
01:07:27,393 --> 01:07:31,235
<i>Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane and normal at all?</i>

794
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:34,846
Hey, I think, we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay..

795
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,343
I hope Paul sink some teeth into him.
Serves him right.

796
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:40,416
No way. Jake's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?

797
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,376
I gott a five that says,
Paul doesn't touch him.

798
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:44,988
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.

799
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:46,794
Speak for yourself.

800
01:07:56,858 --> 01:07:59,279
Oh, hey, about Emily...
Sam's fiance,

801
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:01,679
...don't stare.
It bugs Sam.

802
01:08:03,428 --> 01:08:05,234
Why would I stare?

803
01:08:05,272 --> 01:08:08,920
You guys hungry?
Like I have to ask...

804
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,720
Who's this?

805
01:08:16,835 --> 01:08:19,101
Bella Swan.
Who else?

806
01:08:21,214 --> 01:08:24,019
So, youre the vampire girl.

807
01:08:26,324 --> 01:08:29,052
So, you're the wolf girl.

808
01:08:31,126 --> 01:08:32,586
Guess so.

809
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:35,814
Well, I'm engaged to one.

810
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:40,193
Save some for your brothers.

811
01:08:40,231 --> 01:08:42,074
And the ladies first.

812
01:08:42,113 --> 01:08:45,302
Muffin?
- Sure. Thanks.

813
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:48,683
Leave it up to Jake to find
a way around Sam's gag order.

814
01:08:48,721 --> 01:08:52,293
He didn't say anything to me.
- That's a wolf thing.

815
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,752
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want to or not.

816
01:08:54,752 --> 01:08:57,172
Oh, and check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.

817
01:08:57,172 --> 01:09:00,131
Will you just shut up?
These are trade secrets.

818
01:09:00,131 --> 01:09:03,435
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.

819
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:06,161
Can't really run with vampires.

820
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,118
Because they're fast.

821
01:09:10,157 --> 01:09:14,075
Yeah? Oh, we are faster.

822
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:16,150
Freaked out yet?

823
01:09:17,265 --> 01:09:20,414
You're not the first monsters I've met.

824
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:23,642
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.

825
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,154
Sorry.

826
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,597
So you're a werewolf?

827
01:10:02,902 --> 01:10:06,169
Yeah, last time I checked.

828
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:10,280
A few lucky members of the
tribe have the gene.

829
01:10:10,587 --> 01:10:15,273
If a bloodsucker moves into town,
then the fever sets in.

830
01:10:17,232 --> 01:10:18,653
Mono?

831
01:10:19,499 --> 01:10:21,803
Yeah, I wish.

832
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:28,641
Well, can't you find a way to stop?

833
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:33,368
I mean it's wrong.

834
01:10:34,904 --> 01:10:37,362
It's not a life-style choice, Bella.

835
01:10:37,592 --> 01:10:40,071
I was born this way,
I can't help it.

836
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,579
You are such a hypocrite.

837
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:43,575
What, I'm not the
right kind of monster for you?

838
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:47,643
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.

839
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:49,602
They never hurt anybody.

840
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,902
You killed people, Jake.

841
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,743
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

842
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:58,545
Then, who is?

843
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,963
We're trying to protect
you people from them.

844
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:03,803
The only thing we do kill.

845
01:11:05,492 --> 01:11:07,449
Vampiers.

846
01:11:08,217 --> 01:11:10,021
Jake, you can't...
- Don't worry,

847
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:11,978
...we can't touch your little
precious Cullens.

848
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:14,243
Unless they violate the Treaty.

849
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:16,277
It's not what I'm saying.

850
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:19,770
You can't kill vampires, though.

851
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:23,340
They will kill you.
- Really? We took out

852
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,413
...that leech with the dreads easy enough.

853
01:11:29,058 --> 01:11:30,478
Laurent?

854
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:32,820
And his redhead girlfriend is next.

855
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,430
Vic... Victoria is here?
- Was.

856
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,002
We chased her all the way to the
Canadian border the other night.

857
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,460
But she keeps coming back.

858
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:42,492
We don't know what she's after.
- I do.

859
01:11:45,064 --> 01:11:47,444
Me.

860
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,498
Don't worry,
we've got this place covered.

861
01:11:58,535 --> 01:12:00,916
She wont get near you or Charlie.

862
01:12:01,491 --> 01:12:03,487
But you gotta be careful.

863
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:06,751
She's fast, you don't know,
how fast she is.

864
01:12:06,751 --> 01:12:09,744
You know, your lack of confidence
in us is a little insulting.

865
01:12:11,586 --> 01:12:14,042
Alright, I better go.

866
01:12:14,388 --> 01:12:18,264
And you gotta go.
- Yeah.

867
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:21,181
I got a vampire to kill.

868
01:12:34,346 --> 01:12:37,302
<i>Alice, I'm alright.</i>

869
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,105
<i>Until I'm alone.</i>

870
01:12:41,102 --> 01:12:43,712
<i>And lately,
that's all the time.</i>

871
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:46,591
<i>Jacob's gone,
he's hunting for Victoria.</i>

872
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,854
<i>And Charlie is hunting Jacob.</i>

873
01:12:48,893 --> 01:12:50,352
<i>And you're gone.</i>

874
01:12:51,311 --> 01:12:53,691
<i>And so is Edward.</i>

875
01:12:56,494 --> 01:12:58,987
<i>And I just have nothing now.</i>

876
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:03,555
You got something, Harry?

877
01:13:04,285 --> 01:13:07,240
Nope, nothing.

878
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:15,954
<i>But I realize where I have to go,</i>

879
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:18,025
<i>What I have to do
to see him again.</i>

880
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:10,823
<i>Don't do this.</i>

881
01:16:15,044 --> 01:16:17,348
You wanted me to be human.

882
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,569
Watch me.

883
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:27,059
<i>Please? For me?</i>

884
01:16:27,059 --> 01:16:29,131
You won't stay with me
any other way.

885
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:34,428
<i>Bella. Please.</i>

886
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,205
Breathe.

887
01:18:03,898 --> 01:18:06,737
Come on, Bella.
Breathe.

888
01:18:12,571 --> 01:18:16,218
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?

889
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:23,012
Jake.

890
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:36,100
What the hell were you thinking, huh?
- I just needed to see something.

891
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:40,437
Take her home.
I'm gonna go help over at Harry's place.

892
01:18:42,971 --> 01:18:45,197
What happened at Harry's?

893
01:18:45,197 --> 01:18:47,576
Harry Clearwater
had a heart attack.

894
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:51,107
Charlie and my Dad are at Harry's place
with his family.

895
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:56,019
Is he okay?
- He's gone.

896
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:03,083
Come on, I'll give you something dry
and drive you home.

897
01:19:12,717 --> 01:19:16,056
Hundred and eight degrees over here.

898
01:19:17,822 --> 01:19:22,082
God! My hands are freezing.

899
01:19:23,886 --> 01:19:26,266
It must be nice, never getting cold.

900
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:30,565
Its a wolf thing.
- It's not.

901
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:34,825
Its a Jacob thing.
Youre just warm.

902
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:39,661
You're like, your own sun.

903
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:46,799
This is better.
Now that you know about me.

904
01:19:49,487 --> 01:19:51,367
But...?

905
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,353
You saw what happened to Emily.

906
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:05,799
Sam got angry, lost it for a split second...

907
01:20:06,759 --> 01:20:09,561
...Em was standing too close.

908
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:14,013
He will never be able
to take that back.

909
01:20:16,124 --> 01:20:18,695
What if I get mad at you?

910
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,784
Sometimes...

911
01:20:33,051 --> 01:20:36,044
I feel like, I'm gonna disappear.

912
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,405
You know you don't need me,
to tell you something like this.

913
01:20:48,634 --> 01:20:52,856
But I always will.
You're not gonna loose yourself.

914
01:20:54,774 --> 01:20:57,154
I won't let that happen.

915
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,993
How?

916
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:06,558
I'll tell you all the time.

917
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:12,316
How special you are.

918
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:33,771
Thank you...
...for everything.

919
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:40,334
Wait!

920
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:45,708
There's a vampire.
- How do you know?

921
01:21:46,323 --> 01:21:49,278
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out.

922
01:21:50,314 --> 01:21:54,612
That's Carlisle's car!
Theyre here.

923
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:58,643
Bella, it's a trick. Stop!
You gotta come with me.

924
01:22:01,714 --> 01:22:03,133
They won't hurt me.

925
01:22:03,288 --> 01:22:06,589
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

926
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:09,620
The treaty says we can only
defend in our own lands.

927
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:13,574
I can't protect you here.
- Okay, it's okay. You don't have to.

928
01:22:15,609 --> 01:22:17,566
Youre about to cross a line.

929
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:21,059
Then don't draw one. Please?

930
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:39,405
Alice?!
Oh my God!

931
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:40,826
Bella?
- What are you...?

932
01:22:41,592 --> 01:22:44,817
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't believe you're here. Is...is..

933
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:48,848
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

934
01:22:49,461 --> 01:22:52,416
What?
- I saw a vision of you.

935
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:56,791
You jumped off a cliff. Why in the hell
would you try and kill yourself?

936
01:22:56,791 --> 01:23:00,017
I mean, what about Charlie? What about...?
- I didn't try to kill myself.

937
01:23:00,362 --> 01:23:03,471
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally!

938
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:06,349
It was fun.

939
01:23:07,193 --> 01:23:12,528
I have never met anyone more prone
to life-threatening idiocy.

940
01:23:18,095 --> 01:23:21,241
Did you... did you tell him?
- No.

941
01:23:22,624 --> 01:23:26,500
He only calls once in a few months.

942
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,417
He said he wants to be alone.

943
01:23:34,906 --> 01:23:39,281
Bella, what is that
God awful wet dog smell?

944
01:23:40,701 --> 01:23:43,618
That's probably me

945
01:23:45,307 --> 01:23:48,531
Or... it's Jacob.
- Jacob who?

946
01:23:49,606 --> 01:23:56,228
Jacob's kind of a werewolf. Ugh! Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep!

947
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,796
Speak for yourself.

948
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,610
I had to see if you were safe.

949
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,968
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

950
01:24:10,332 --> 01:24:12,156
Guess, I don't care.

951
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:17,798
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

952
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,348
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

953
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:23,689
We're talking about the other
bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella

954
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:25,686
...because of you.
- Victoria?

955
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,835
Yeah, Victoria has been around.

956
01:24:27,835 --> 01:24:32,901
I didn't see her. I didn't see you
get pulled out of the water either.

957
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:37,392
I can't see past you
and your pack of mutts!

958
01:24:37,392 --> 01:24:40,156
Don't get me upset.
- Hey, stop!

959
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:43,264
Things are gonna get very ugly!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

960
01:24:48,715 --> 01:24:50,865
I will give you a minute.

961
01:24:58,157 --> 01:25:01,420
You're going anywhere,
you're gonna come back, right?

962
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,069
As soon as you put the dog out.

963
01:25:11,284 --> 01:25:14,277
Is he...?

964
01:25:17,309 --> 01:25:21,148
Are there others? How many Cullens are here
and how long are they staying?

965
01:25:22,721 --> 01:25:25,178
No. It's just Alice.

966
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:32,010
And she can stay
as long as she like.

967
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:36,040
Are the rest coming back?

968
01:25:42,181 --> 01:25:43,870
No.

969
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:47,364
Not that I know of.

970
01:25:47,671 --> 01:25:49,397
Anything else?

971
01:25:52,813 --> 01:25:54,752
That's it.

972
01:25:56,728 --> 01:26:00,278
Well, if that's all, then you better go
run back to Sam.

973
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:05,594
I have done it again.

974
01:26:05,979 --> 01:26:09,087
I keep breaking my promise.

975
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:15,535
We don't have to do this to each other.

976
01:26:19,527 --> 01:26:22,138
Yes, we do.

977
01:26:32,617 --> 01:26:34,074
Bella...

978
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:41,115
"Que Quowle"
(Stay with me, forever)

979
01:26:55,722 --> 01:26:57,910
Swan Residence.

980
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:08,061
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.

981
01:27:22,052 --> 01:27:27,732
Who is that? What?
- Always in the way.

982
01:27:29,345 --> 01:27:32,453
Who was that?
- Bella, step back.

983
01:27:32,453 --> 01:27:34,028
Jake, who was that?
- Stop.

984
01:27:34,259 --> 01:27:36,944
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you are dead.

985
01:27:37,097 --> 01:27:40,208
Rosalie told him,
why I came here.

986
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:44,046
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

987
01:27:44,046 --> 01:27:46,309
He didn't ask for you.
- I don't care!

988
01:27:46,309 --> 01:27:48,805
Bella, he's going to the Volturi.

989
01:27:49,227 --> 01:27:51,530
He wants to die too.

990
01:27:53,526 --> 01:27:56,212
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore, remember?

991
01:27:56,212 --> 01:27:59,724
But I'm not gonna let him
kill himself out of guilt.

992
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:03,658
What about your Dad?
- I'm eighteen,

993
01:28:03,658 --> 01:28:06,269
I'm legally free to go.
And I left a note.

994
01:28:07,651 --> 01:28:13,255
Please, Bella.
Just... stay here.

995
01:28:14,175 --> 01:28:16,362
Not for Charlie.

996
01:28:17,898 --> 01:28:20,202
For me...

997
01:28:20,393 --> 01:28:23,158
I have to go.

998
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,912
I'm begging you.

999
01:28:31,678 --> 01:28:34,057
Please.

1000
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,474
Goodbye, Jacob.

1001
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:46,417
Okay.

1002
01:29:44,297 --> 01:29:47,291
So you made up your minds?

1003
01:29:47,406 --> 01:29:50,246
I'm afraid your particular gifts...

1004
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:53,663
...are too valuable
to destroy.

1005
01:29:53,778 --> 01:29:57,116
But if you're unhappy
with your lot,

1006
01:29:57,615 --> 01:29:59,497
...join us.

1007
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:03,565
We would be delighted
to utilize your skills.

1008
01:30:03,758 --> 01:30:06,751
Won't you consider
staying with us?

1009
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,397
You know what will happen anyway.

1010
01:30:10,589 --> 01:30:13,391
Not without cause.

1011
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,957
Such a waste.

1012
01:30:24,522 --> 01:30:26,518
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1013
01:30:26,518 --> 01:30:28,667
I figured, you wouldn't be
opposed to grand theft auto.

1014
01:30:28,667 --> 01:30:30,125
Not today.

1015
01:30:32,813 --> 01:30:36,267
What? What are you seeing?
- They refused him.

1016
01:30:36,267 --> 01:30:39,299
So...?
- He's gonna make a scene.

1017
01:30:39,299 --> 01:30:41,295
Show himself to the humans.
- No! When?

1018
01:30:42,945 --> 01:30:46,130
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at it's highest.

1019
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:51,273
Alice, you gotta hurry up.
- There's Volterra.

1020
01:31:15,339 --> 01:31:18,257
Why are they all in red?
- Saint Marcos Day festival.

1021
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:20,752
They're commemorating the expulsion
of vampires from the city.

1022
01:31:20,944 --> 01:31:22,440
It's the perfect setting.

1023
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,935
The Volturi will never let him
get far enough to reveal himself

1024
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:29,503
We have 5 minutes.
- I know. Bella? Just breathe.

1025
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Alice!?

1026
01:31:35,568 --> 01:31:37,870
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1027
01:31:37,985 --> 01:31:40,980
If I go, he will read my thoughts,
he'll think I'm lying and rush into it.

1028
01:31:41,555 --> 01:31:44,818
Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

1029
01:33:32,556 --> 01:33:34,245
No!

1030
01:33:35,511 --> 01:33:36,971
Heaven.

1031
01:33:37,009 --> 01:33:38,429
You have to move!

1032
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:42,190
Open your eyes, look at me.
I'm alive.

1033
01:33:42,574 --> 01:33:44,493
You have to move!

1034
01:33:44,992 --> 01:33:46,450
Bella?

1035
01:33:53,436 --> 01:33:56,334
You're here.
- Yeah.

1036
01:33:58,158 --> 01:33:59,943
You're alive!

1037
01:34:02,648 --> 01:34:04,144
Yes.

1038
01:34:12,617 --> 01:34:15,284
I needed to make you see me once.

1039
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:20,023
You had to know that I was alive.
You didn't have to feel guilty or anything.

1040
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,008
I can let you go now.

1041
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,993
Never like that again.

1042
01:34:34,453 --> 01:34:37,829
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1043
01:34:39,478 --> 01:34:42,088
But you said...
- I lied.

1044
01:34:42,357 --> 01:34:45,733
I had to lie
and you believe me so easily

1045
01:34:50,224 --> 01:34:54,138
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1046
01:34:56,517 --> 01:35:00,277
I'm nothing... human.
Nothing.

1047
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:05,343
Bella, you're everything to me.

1048
01:35:06,379 --> 01:35:08,260
Everything.

1049
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,890
I won't be needing your services
after all, gentlemen.

1050
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:36,848
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1051
01:35:36,887 --> 01:35:38,959
No rules were broken.
- Nonetheless, we should take this

1052
01:35:38,959 --> 01:35:42,182
...conversation to a more
appropriate venue.

1053
01:35:42,259 --> 01:35:44,177
Fine.

1054
01:35:44,562 --> 01:35:47,055
Bella, why don't you go enjoy
the rest of the festival?

1055
01:35:47,133 --> 01:35:50,278
The girl comes with us.
- No. You can go to hell.

1056
01:35:52,352 --> 01:35:55,420
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.

1057
01:35:55,536 --> 01:35:57,762
We wouldn't want to make a scene.

1058
01:35:58,107 --> 01:35:59,872
We wouldnt.

1059
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:01,407
Enough!

1060
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,132
Jane.

1061
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:07,010
Aro send me to see
what's taking so long.

1062
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:17,218
Just do as she says.

1063
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:30,668
Go ahead.

1064
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:36,271
Are you scared?

1065
01:36:36,827 --> 01:36:38,534
Are you?

1066
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,453
No.

1067
01:36:40,454 --> 01:36:41,454
Hmmh.

1068
01:37:10,902 --> 01:37:12,724
"Buon pomeriggio!"
(Good afternoon!)

1069
01:37:16,927 --> 01:37:19,345
Is she human?
- Yes.

1070
01:37:22,108 --> 01:37:25,102
Does she know?
- Yes.

1071
01:37:25,485 --> 01:37:27,384
Then why would...

1072
01:37:28,786 --> 01:37:30,704
She wants to be...

1073
01:37:30,896 --> 01:37:33,889
And so she will be.
- Or dessert!

1074
01:37:41,985 --> 01:37:45,937
Sister, sent you out to get one
and you bring back two.

1075
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,164
And a half.

1076
01:37:48,893 --> 01:37:49,967
Such a clever girl.

1077
01:37:50,351 --> 01:37:52,578
What a happy surprise!

1078
01:37:52,999 --> 01:37:56,261
Bella is alive after all.

1079
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:59,791
Isn't that wonderful?

1080
01:37:59,983 --> 01:38:02,247
I love a happy ending.

1081
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:08,157
They are so rare.

1082
01:38:11,726 --> 01:38:14,335
"La Tua Cantante"
(Your Singer)

1083
01:38:14,373 --> 01:38:17,060
Your blood appeals to you
so much...

1084
01:38:18,019 --> 01:38:20,013
...it makes me thirsty.

1085
01:38:20,053 --> 01:38:22,816
How can you stand
to be so close to her?

1086
01:38:22,893 --> 01:38:26,443
It's not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.

1087
01:38:29,032 --> 01:38:31,412
Aro can read every thought
I ever had.

1088
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:33,061
With one touch.

1089
01:38:33,638 --> 01:38:35,402
And now you know everything.

1090
01:38:36,323 --> 01:38:37,897
So, get on with it.

1091
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:44,726
You're quite a soul reader
yourself, Edward.

1092
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:50,138
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1093
01:38:52,632 --> 01:38:54,359
Fascinating!

1094
01:38:57,852 --> 01:39:03,454
I would love to see if you are an
exception to my gifts, as well.

1095
01:39:05,373 --> 01:39:07,329
Would you do me the honor?

1096
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:29,127
Interesting.

1097
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,772
I see nothing.

1098
01:39:41,482 --> 01:39:43,057
I wonder if...

1099
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:47,008
Let's see if she is immune
to all our powers.

1100
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:49,541
Shall we, Jane?

1101
01:39:51,344 --> 01:39:53,494
No!
- Pain.

1102
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:12,029
Stop!
Don't. Please stop!

1103
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:16,173
Stop! Stop hurting him!
Please, please!

1104
01:40:17,325 --> 01:40:18,936
Jane?

1105
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:22,121
Master?

1106
01:40:25,842 --> 01:40:27,800
Go ahead, my dear.

1107
01:40:32,827 --> 01:40:34,707
This may hurt just a little.

1108
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:52,627
Remarkable!

1109
01:40:53,933 --> 01:40:56,926
She confounds us all.

1110
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:00,878
So, what we do with you now?

1111
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:04,217
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1112
01:41:04,562 --> 01:41:08,744
She knows too much,
she's a liability.

1113
01:41:12,582 --> 01:41:14,117
That's true.

1114
01:41:17,686 --> 01:41:19,298
Felix.

1115
01:42:22,654 --> 01:42:25,915
Please! No, no!
Please! Please!

1116
01:42:28,448 --> 01:42:31,903
Kill me... kill me.
Not him.

1117
01:42:42,032 --> 01:42:45,179
How extraordinary.

1118
01:42:46,061 --> 01:42:51,205
You would give up your life
for someone like us.

1119
01:42:51,396 --> 01:42:52,931
A vampire.

1120
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:56,806
A soulless monster.

1121
01:42:56,807 --> 01:42:58,807
Just get away from him!

1122
01:43:02,217 --> 01:43:07,167
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1123
01:43:09,168 --> 01:43:16,078
"Forse n del vostro l'uno l'altro"
(Maybe yours is one or the other)

1124
01:43:17,451 --> 01:43:19,754
This is a sadness.

1125
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:25,204
If only it be your intention
to give her immortality.

1126
01:43:33,339 --> 01:43:34,836
Wait!

1127
01:43:36,063 --> 01:43:38,135
Bella will be one of us.

1128
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:41,051
I've seen it.

1129
01:43:42,855 --> 01:43:44,736
I'll change her myself.

1130
01:44:17,122 --> 01:44:18,735
Mesmerizing!

1131
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:24,146
To see, what you have seen.
Before it is happened.

1132
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:31,513
Your gifts will make for
an intriguing

1133
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:33,701
...immortal.

1134
01:44:33,778 --> 01:44:36,694
Isabella.

1135
01:44:40,148 --> 01:44:44,407
Go now.
Make your preparations.

1136
01:44:44,676 --> 01:44:47,400
Let us be done with this.

1137
01:44:48,476 --> 01:44:51,468
Heidi will arrive, any moment.

1138
01:44:52,082 --> 01:44:57,224
Thank you for your visit.
- We'll return the favor.

1139
01:44:57,302 --> 01:45:02,482
I would advise that you follow through on your
promise soon. We do not offer second chances.

1140
01:45:04,016 --> 01:45:08,352
Goodbye, my young friends.

1141
01:45:12,996 --> 01:45:14,971
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1142
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:17,102
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1143
01:45:17,179 --> 01:45:19,175
Save some for me.

1144
01:45:19,749 --> 01:45:23,434
This way, please.
Stay together.

1145
01:45:37,435 --> 01:45:38,435
Stop! Stop!

1146
01:45:48,414 --> 01:45:50,411
You're here.

1147
01:45:51,984 --> 01:45:53,921
You can sleep.

1148
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:59,966
I'll still be here
when you wake up.

1149
01:46:02,805 --> 01:46:06,758
Bella, the only reason
I left

1150
01:46:07,334 --> 01:46:10,710
...was because I thought
I was protecting you.

1151
01:46:12,168 --> 01:46:14,931
I needed you to have a chance...

1152
01:46:14,931 --> 01:46:18,577
...at a normal, happy life.

1153
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:24,909
It was so easy for you to leave.

1154
01:46:26,137 --> 01:46:30,512
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in a 100 years.

1155
01:46:36,075 --> 01:46:38,685
I swear...

1156
01:46:39,145 --> 01:46:42,906
I will never fail you again.

1157
01:46:43,789 --> 01:46:46,014
I'm so sorry.

1158
01:46:47,473 --> 01:46:49,430
Charlie's coming.
- Hey!

1159
01:46:52,499 --> 01:46:54,572
You okay?

1160
01:46:55,186 --> 01:46:56,950
Fine.

1161
01:46:59,062 --> 01:47:01,325
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1162
01:47:01,978 --> 01:47:06,161
Yeah, last time you said that you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.

1163
01:47:07,235 --> 01:47:09,921
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1164
01:47:11,112 --> 01:47:15,754
Bella, do not ever do that
to me again.

1165
01:47:17,443 --> 01:47:19,054
Ever.

1166
01:47:21,164 --> 01:47:23,045
And you're grounded...

1167
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:26,230
...for the rest of your life.

1168
01:47:26,268 --> 01:47:27,996
Okay.

1169
01:47:37,397 --> 01:47:40,160
I'm not technically breaking
any of his rules.

1170
01:47:42,578 --> 01:47:45,648
He did say, I couldn't take a step
inside through the door.

1171
01:47:46,148 --> 01:47:48,564
I came in through the window.

1172
01:47:51,941 --> 01:47:54,896
He's not going to forgive me easily.

1173
01:47:56,777 --> 01:47:58,273
I know.

1174
01:47:59,846 --> 01:48:01,611
Can you?

1175
01:48:04,604 --> 01:48:06,983
I hope you can because...

1176
01:48:07,176 --> 01:48:10,860
I honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1177
01:48:13,967 --> 01:48:16,961
Come here.

1178
01:48:32,578 --> 01:48:36,570
Once Alice changes me,

1179
01:48:37,837 --> 01:48:40,522
...you can't get rid of me.

1180
01:48:41,367 --> 01:48:44,053
She won't need to change you.

1181
01:48:44,475 --> 01:48:47,352
There are always ways to keep
the Volturi in the dark.

1182
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:52,341
No.

1183
01:48:58,059 --> 01:49:00,515
You all know what I want.

1184
01:49:01,973 --> 01:49:06,272
And I know,
how much I'm asking for.

1185
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:10,646
The only thing I can think of...
for it to be fair is to just vote.

1186
01:49:10,723 --> 01:49:13,794
You don't know what you just...
- Shut up!

1187
01:49:15,213 --> 01:49:16,709
Alice?

1188
01:49:16,862 --> 01:49:19,395
I already consider you my sister.

1189
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,614
'Yes'!
- Thank you.

1190
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:26,839
I vote, 'yes'.

1191
01:49:27,301 --> 01:49:31,215
It would be nice to not wanna
kill you all the time.

1192
01:49:33,709 --> 01:49:35,781
I'm sorry.

1193
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:40,463
I'm really sorry, both of you,
for the way I've acted.

1194
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:44,684
And I'm really grateful that you were brave
enough to go and save my brother.

1195
01:49:46,027 --> 01:49:49,903
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.

1196
01:49:51,477 --> 01:49:54,968
And I wish that there had been
someone to vote 'no' for me.

1197
01:49:57,732 --> 01:50:00,340
So... 'no'.

1198
01:50:00,685 --> 01:50:03,026
I vote hell yeah!

1199
01:50:04,369 --> 01:50:06,787
We can pick a fight with
these Volturi's some other way.

1200
01:50:06,787 --> 01:50:09,206
I already consider you,
a part of the family.

1201
01:50:10,165 --> 01:50:12,198
'Yes'.

1202
01:50:16,842 --> 01:50:19,029
Why are you doing this to me?

1203
01:50:20,488 --> 01:50:23,979
You know what this means.
- You've chosen not to live without her,

1204
01:50:24,056 --> 01:50:25,976
...which leaves me no choice.

1205
01:50:26,436 --> 01:50:28,660
I won't lose my son.

1206
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:36,758
<i>I'll wait until after graduation...</i>

1207
01:50:36,758 --> 01:50:39,597
<i>...to make it easier on Charlie.</i>

1208
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:45,852
I want you to be the one
to do it.

1209
01:50:52,222 --> 01:50:54,487
He wants to talk to me.

1210
01:50:57,326 --> 01:50:58,977
See, you're still alive for now.

1211
01:50:59,016 --> 01:51:01,278
He thinks, it's me keeping you away.

1212
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:03,657
You stay the hell out of my head.

1213
01:51:04,771 --> 01:51:09,069
Jacob, I know you have
something to say to me.

1214
01:51:10,373 --> 01:51:13,289
But I wanna say something to you first.
If that's alright?

1215
01:51:15,017 --> 01:51:17,088
Thank you.

1216
01:51:19,813 --> 01:51:23,498
Thank you for keeping
Bella alive when I didnt.

1217
01:51:23,498 --> 01:51:26,568
No, you didn't.

1218
01:51:27,066 --> 01:51:29,829
And it wasn't for your benefit,
trust me.

1219
01:51:29,944 --> 01:51:31,824
I'm still grateful.

1220
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:33,628
But I'm here now.

1221
01:51:33,628 --> 01:51:36,198
And I'm not gonna leave her side
till she orders me away.

1222
01:51:36,275 --> 01:51:38,233
We'll see.

1223
01:51:41,494 --> 01:51:43,644
Hey, my turn to talk.

1224
01:51:46,713 --> 01:51:49,745
I'm here to remind you about
a key point in the Treaty.

1225
01:51:50,282 --> 01:51:52,086
I haven't forgotten.

1226
01:51:52,279 --> 01:51:53,737
What key point?

1227
01:51:53,812 --> 01:51:58,341
If any of them bites a human,
the truce is over.

1228
01:51:59,799 --> 01:52:01,756
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1229
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:04,481
No... No, I won't let you.

1230
01:52:05,018 --> 01:52:07,397
You're not gonna be
one of them, Bella.

1231
01:52:07,512 --> 01:52:09,622
It's not up to you.

1232
01:52:10,045 --> 01:52:11,580
You know what we'll do to you.

1233
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:14,074
I won't have choice.
- Bella, please come.

1234
01:52:14,151 --> 01:52:15,992
Wait.

1235
01:52:17,221 --> 01:52:19,677
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.

1236
01:52:26,431 --> 01:52:28,924
Jake...

1237
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:37,176
I love you.

1238
01:52:40,091 --> 01:52:42,279
So, please...

1239
01:52:46,116 --> 01:52:48,841
Don't make me choose.

1240
01:52:53,675 --> 01:52:55,902
Because it'll be him.

1241
01:52:58,473 --> 01:53:01,198
It's always been him.

1242
01:53:08,199 --> 01:53:09,199
Bella.

1243
01:53:16,432 --> 01:53:19,310
Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!

1244
01:53:24,107 --> 01:53:26,064
Bella, get out of here.

1245
01:53:27,636 --> 01:53:30,132
Stop!

1246
01:53:30,822 --> 01:53:32,357
Stop!

1247
01:53:32,434 --> 01:53:35,236
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1248
01:53:53,425 --> 01:53:55,113
Jake...

1249
01:54:08,927 --> 01:54:10,731
He's right.

1250
01:54:11,384 --> 01:54:14,147
You shouldn't become
what I am.

1251
01:54:18,292 --> 01:54:20,324
I can't do this alone.

1252
01:54:23,088 --> 01:54:25,351
Then please just wait.

1253
01:54:31,645 --> 01:54:34,869
Just give me... five years.

1254
01:54:39,473 --> 01:54:41,507
It's too long.

1255
01:54:45,075 --> 01:54:47,416
Then, three?

1256
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:53,672
You're so stubborn.

1257
01:54:54,362 --> 01:54:57,202
What are you waiting for?

1258
01:55:04,762 --> 01:55:09,328
I have one condition...

1259
01:55:10,173 --> 01:55:13,779
...if you want me
to do it myself.

1260
01:55:16,312 --> 01:55:18,308
What's the condition?

1261
01:55:18,768 --> 01:55:21,225
And then, forever.

1262
01:55:22,184 --> 01:55:25,255
That's what I'm asking.

1263
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:38,684
Marry me, Bella.

1264
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:48,920
