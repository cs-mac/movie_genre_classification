1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,120
I've got it, I've got it!

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,720
Pick him up, pick him up, pick him up

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,520
49 to 48. Game point, let's go
Oh,damn!

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
- Right, always engage him on the left

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
- We need three points
- Left

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,520
- Hey when you two guys are  ready?

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,200
- Check off
- Check

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,920
- Go! Go! Go!

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,000
- Left! Left! Left!

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,320
- And that is how is done baby!

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,000
- Good game!
- Good game

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,520
- Good job man,
you're ready to play again?

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
- No more!

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,200
- Would?- What?
- Afraid of your one on one

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,520
- Whatever, this isn't my game

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,720
- Really? So, what is the game?

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
- Alex!

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,920
- What? They've gone.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,320
- But don't never do that here

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,120
- You're kidding, right?

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,120
- Why are you gonna put
that gay shit all the time?

22
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,321
- What?

23
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:25,022
- I  just wanna be able to play ball

24
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,923
and not make some kind of
social statement, okay?

25
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,224
- It was just a kiss. Come on.

26
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,925
Trevor! Trevor!

27
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:46,726
Look, I was just fooling around

28
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,827
- Look, promise me you stop with
all the civil rights show

29
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:52,328
- Civil rights show?

30
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,329
- Okay?

31
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,130
Give me at least, you know,
hug it out...

32
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,631
No one's watching

33
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:21,432
Well, this is romantic...

34
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,333
- Whatever...let's go

35
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:34,334
Hey, you've seen my keys?

36
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,535
- One,two, three, four, five,six...

37
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,536
One,two, three, four, five,six...

38
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:43,937
One,two, three, four, five,six...

39
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:48,538
Nice, let the music carry you body. Yes...

40
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,039
Back straight young man, this is a waltz

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,440
Very nice!

42
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,541
- Alex, you have my keys?

43
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,542
Alex...my keys...

44
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,043
- Do you wanna dance?
- What?

45
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:13,444
- Come on!

46
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:15,545
- Alex, I think you've  my keys, do?

47
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,046
- You wanna dance?
Answer the question

48
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,047
- We're going to the club tonight, okay?

49
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:21,748
- I don't think we can waltz in the club

50
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,049
- You've just promised me
you wouldn't do this

51
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,050
- It's just a waltz

52
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,651
- Excuse-me boys.

53
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:30,252
Are you here
for the dance lesson, jaa?

54
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:32,453
- Yes
- No

55
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,454
Actually we're on our way out

56
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:37,955
- No! He is on his way out.

57
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:40,656
I'm not trying to make a statement.

58
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:42,357
I just wanna dance
with my boyfriend!

59
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,458
- You'll need a dance partner, jaa?

60
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,159
- No! He can dance alone

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,560
- All right everyone.
Eyes on your partners.

62
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,361
We'll take it from the top.

63
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:13,462
And you young man
will dance with me, jaa?

64
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:14,863
All right, ready?

65
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:18,264
One,two, three, four, five,six...

66
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,365
Right...chin up...

67
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:22,966

68
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,967
- You got be kidding me

69
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:18,268
- You're a very good dancer young man

70
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,269
Now everyone, let's take it from the top.

71
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,370
This time with music.

72
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,771
You there.

73
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:28,072
Young man, what are you doing
standing there?

74
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:30,073
Get ready to dance, jaa?

75
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:46,274
Now, just place the hands
where they need to be.

76
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,275
You put your hand there,
your hand on his shoulder.

77
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,876
Very nice...Very nice...

78
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:56,277
Your hands up in the air...
Hold them like that...

79
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:57,978
You lead, jaa?

80
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,379
All right. Ready?

81
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,880
One,two, three, four, five,six...

82
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,681
One,two, three, four, five,six...

83
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:07,282
very nice.

84
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,583
One,two, three, four, five,six...

85
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:14,584
Very good...Chins up...
Hands straight...

86
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:26,481
- Fine...you win!

87
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,082
- What? What you want me to do?

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,683
- It shouldn't be this hard.

89
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:34,584
- You should be dancing!

90
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,785
- I don't like feeling like a freak,
okay?

91
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,586
I don't need that.

92
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,687
- The only reason everyone
is looking at you,

93
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:42,788
it's  because you're making
such a big deal out of dancing,

94
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,989
not because you dance with me.

95
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,790
- Alex! Alex

96
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,091
Hold on to these, okay?

97
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:01,092
Just while we finish dancing

98
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,393
- And who are you gonna dance with?

99
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:12,694
- This is not my game.

100
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,895
You will have to lead this on.

101
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,296
- Waltz.

102
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,897
Afraid of a little one on one?

103
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:31,398
- So, will I be seeing you both
next week?

104
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:33,899
Yes!

105
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,400
Wonderful. That will be
25 dollars a piece, jaa?

106
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:46,001
