1
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,736
<i>A wave of riots
has swept U.S. prisons.</i>

2
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,990
<i>Within 20 months,
riots have occurred in 35 states.</i>

3
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,200
<i>It began in Trenton, New Jersey...</i>

4
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,370
<i>moved quickly
to Jackson, Michigan.</i>

5
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,039
<i>Here at Michigan Penitentiary
for five days...</i>

6
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:05,002
<i>the world's largest walled prison
is torn to pieces by maddened convicts...</i>

7
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:07,838
<i>who destroy everything
they can put their hands on.</i>

8
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:11,341
<i>Damage is estimated
at $2 1/2 million.</i>

9
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,052
<i>Then, in Pennsylvania,
inmates seize...</i>

10
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:17,222
<i>five guards as hostages
in Western State Penitentiary.</i>

11
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,683
<i>Damage runs high,
as we can see...</i>

12
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:22,352
<i>in this view inside one
of the wrecked cell blocks.</i>

13
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,438
<i>At almost the same time...</i>

14
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:27,399
<i>231 convicts carry out
a similar rebellion...</i>

15
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,027
<i>in Rahway, New Jersey,
at the state prison farm.</i>

16
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:33,113
<i>Here, bed sheets,
scrawled with slogans...</i>

17
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,073
<i>are hung from broken windows.</i>

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,492
<i>The convicts hold out
for 4 1/2 days...</i>

19
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,369
<i>before submitting to authority.</i>

20
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,580
<i>In Menard Prison
at Chester, Illinois...</i>

21
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,415
<i>state police are called.</i>

22
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,584
<i>Ten guards are held
as hostages...</i>

23
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,378
<i>three of them by prisoners
in the psychiatric division.</i>

24
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,756
<i>Here, the inmates
insist on speaking...</i>

25
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:53,508
<i>only to the governor
about their grievances.</i>

26
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,386
<i>These riots, costing millions...</i>

27
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,138
<i>and millions
of taxpayer dollars...</i>

28
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,557
<i>have aroused
great public interest.</i>

29
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,618
<i>Mr. McGee,
what, in your opinion...</i>

30
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:22,579
<i>is the reason
these riots occur?</i>

31
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:26,666
I would like to paraphrase the report
of the American Prison Association...

32
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,877
on riots and their causes.

33
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,838
The recent widespread occurrence
of prison riots...

34
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,591
is almost always
the direct result...

35
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,844
of the shortsighted neglect
of our penal institutions...

36
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,305
amounting to
almost criminal negligence.

37
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:43,809
<i>Who is responsible
for this negligence?</i>

38
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:47,687
Public leaders, such as governors,
legislators and others...

39
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,190
who must share
the responsibility for prisons...

40
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,442
as well as for
other branches of government.

41
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,612
<i>And that neglect
includes the public?</i>

42
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:59,324
Yes, indeed. In the final analysis,
especially the public.

43
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:01,284
<i>One final question:</i>

44
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,246
<i>Do you look
to further riots in the future?</i>

45
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:07,874
I abhor riot and disorder...

46
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,585
but until something is done
to correct the situation...

47
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,004
we will not see the end
of prison troubles.

48
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,173
<i>Thank you, Mr. McGee.</i>

49
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,718
<i>All over America,
prison officials wonder...</i>

50
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:21,304
<i>"Where will the next riot occur?"</i>

51
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,495
- Mac, you ever been
in the punishment block?
- No.

52
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,248
Keep your nose clean,
or we'll leave you in there.

53
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,400
Well, how's it doing
after a couple of weeks?

54
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:19,571
I like it. Still can't help but feeling
sorry for these guys, though.

55
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:21,406
You'll get over it.

56
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,784
Okay with the crosses.

57
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,287
What's so different
about these guys?

58
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,831
<i>X marks the wild animal.</i>

59
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,852
Must be Thursday.

60
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,616
Hey, you gonna feed
or ain't you?

61
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:07,244
<i>You know what
you can do with that garbage?</i>

62
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,912
Take it.

63
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,623
<i>This is Honest Hal, folks, bringing you...</i>

64
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:13,375
<i>the greatest value
in used cars.</i>

65
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,877
<i>We're actually giving
these cars away.</i>

66
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,964
<i>Ha! If I'd have knew that,
I wouldn't be here.</i>

67
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,886
<i>Now, I want you to rush
right down here to 2730 Main Street -</i>

68
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:29,140
<i>Get that? 2730 Main Street -
right away.</i>

69
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:32,102
<i>- I'm a-comin', boss!
- Now, don't wait.</i>

70
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:36,106
<i>The right car
for the right price for you.</i>

71
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,692
Thanks.

80
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,187
When you get out,
find out if my little girl's still sick.

81
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,150
Well, I'm not out yet.

82
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,945
I gotta find out.
I ain't heard in almost two months.

83
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,116
- Your wife will write you.
<i>- Naw, she won't write.</i>

84
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:31,119
That's the reason
I'm in here.

85
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,375
I thought I told you
to take that bush off.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,002
Yes, sir.

87
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,921
Uh, 63.

88
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,674
Gotcha.

89
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:39,104
- Barrett speaking.
- Block 11, 238.

90
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,815
Hold it a minute.

91
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:49,030
- Go ahead.
<i>- Block 11, 238.</i>

92
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,907
Eleven, 238.

93
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,951
Okay, you're in.

94
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:58,289
- Barrett. Go ahead.
<i>- Block 4, 637.</i>

95
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:01,501
Four block, 637.
Okay, you're in.

96
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:06,297
- Go ahead, 5.
<i>- Block 5, 433.</i>

97
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,300
Five, 433.
Okay, you're in.

98
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,732
<i>"O Lord, God of my salvation...</i>

99
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,984

00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,695
<i>Let my prayer

and my life draweth nigh
unto the grave.

104
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:39,247
I am counted with them

<i>Mother?</i>

Monroe!

<i>Monroe, 48!</i>

116
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,104
Yeah?

117
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:48,817
What do you want, Schuyler?

118
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:52,862
They're moving me to a new block
tomorrow, and I got a present for Gator.

119
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,989
Would you give it to him now?

120
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,950
Yeah, sure.

121
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,094
- How'd you make it?
- I got Monroe.

122
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,764
Good. Now for the others.
There's only four screws tonight.

123
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,933
- We got to grab 'em all.
- Snader's mine.

124
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,810
No cuttin', Carnie. We're gonna
keep 'em alive. That's my plan.

125
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,876
Snader.

126
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,695
Open your trap,
and we'll cut you a new one.

127
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,572
- You're not supposed
to have this, Snader.

128
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,574
All right, drag him out.

129
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,207
Acton!

130
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,731
Sergeant!

Hey! Monroe! Snader!

132
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,452
Hey! Monroe!

133
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:29,078
Snader!

Go ahead.
You'll have your brains out!

135
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,127
Schuyler, keep that screw
away from the phone!

136
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,113
Come on, hurry up.
Come on! Let me free!

137
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,533
<i>- Hurry up!

138
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,495
<i>- I want out!
- Let me at the screws!</i>

139
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,123
- Open up the cells.
<i>- Hey, let me out, Dunn!</i>

140
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,667
<i>- Let me out of here!</i>

141
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:20,671
<i>I can't believe it's happening!</i>

142
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:25,009

- All right! Let's go!

143
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,514
Let's kill all screws!

144
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,142
- Where are the screws?
- Let's go!

145
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,052
Barrett speaking.

146
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:11,514
This is Dunn. We've got 11 block
and four of your guards.

147
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,685
- You've got what?
- Get the warden down here
or we're gonna kill every one of 'em.

148
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,438
Riot in cell block 11.

149
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,737
- What's up?
- What's the sirens for?

150
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:29,407
I don't know,
but I'll bet it's 11.

151
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,284
Sure, it's the guys in solitary.

152
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:32,952
It's a break!

153
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,663
Those guys have got
guts enough to try anything.

154
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,362
- Well, here we go again.
- Yeah, and all for 50 bucks a week.

155
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,119
Captain Barrett?

156
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:17,538
I've got your open line
to the governor's office.

157
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,665
Yes, sir.
I'll monitor all calls from 11.

158
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,792
Here's the armory, sir.

159
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:25,171
Armory, how many men
have checked in?

160
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:27,632
Second watch is coming in now.

161
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,927
Good. Speed 'em along.
Here's the way I want 'em dispersed -

162
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,180
<i>two in 1 block,
five in 3 block...</i>

163
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:36,057
<i>two unarmed in 4 block.</i>

164
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:40,353
Those to be armed
get rifles and tear gas.

165
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,939
And tell 'em
not to get itchy fingers.

166
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:46,192
All right, boys, come on.
Hurry up.

167
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:49,320
Watch those itchy fingers.
Captain's orders.

168
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,836
Hello.
Get me through to Barrett.

169
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:08,005
Well, cut in on him!

170
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:11,425
Hello? Hello, Barrett?
This is Ambrose. What's up?

171
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,470
A riot in 11 block.
The warden's on his way down.

172
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:18,599
- I'm at the gate. I'll wait for the warden.
- Right. I'll meet you in the yard.

173
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,694
Take it easy, fellas!

174
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:38,035
All right, take it easy!

175
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,624
That's enough!
That's enough!

176
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,337
Dummy up! Shut up!

177
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,714
<i>Knock it off!</i>

178
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,800
<i>All right, cut it out!</i>

179
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,927
<i>Quiet down!</i>

180
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:01,058
All right, pipe down!

181
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:07,273
If we're gonna win this,
we've gotta have discipline!

182
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,861
Now, Carnie here and me
are runnin' the show.

183
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,156
<i>We all know
what's wrong here.</i>

184
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:19,035
We're gonna ask for changes,
just like they did in the other prisons.

185
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,997
If they don't give it to us,
we'll make 'em a present
of one dead guard!

186
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,085
Or maybe four!

187
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,882
It may take all of 'em,
but they'll listen!

188
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,221
Me and some of my friends
are only in here...

189
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:41,599
because there ain't no room
on any other block.

190
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,768
We don't want no trouble.

191
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,273
Lay off!

192
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,236
You're either in or out, okay?

193
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,718
- You all covered?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,721
- All posts set?
- First thing I did.

195
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,891
- Doubled up in your building?
- Yes, sir.

196
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,935
Who did they grab in 11?

197
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,020
Snader, Acton, Monroe -

198
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,898
Monroe? Who assigned him
to that block?

199
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,150
- It was my suggestion.
- That was a mistake.

200
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,194
I figured him pretty green.

201
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,823
That block takes six guards.
It's tough enough to dig up four.

202
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:40,991
You know how short we are.

203
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:44,662
All right, Dunn, I'm here.

204
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,167
I want your word, Warden,
that I'll have safe-conduct.

205
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,505
I promise you no harm will come to you
during this conversation.

206
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:58,342
Guards, these are
my instructions:

207
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,595
Dunn is to be allowed
to come out into this yard...

208
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,224
and to return to 11
without interference.

209
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,185
- How about it, Dunn?
- Sure, Warden.

210
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:12,523
When he's ready, 16,
open the gate.

211
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,402
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

212
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,279
Just Snader.

213
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:31,625
I gave you my word, Dunn.
Hold that gate.

214
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,629
I believe you, Warden,
but I don't trust your screws.

215
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,299
You gonna open up?

216
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,898
<i>- What do you want?</i>
- I want the press here tonight.

217
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:56,358
Inmates never win a riot.
You know that.

218
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:58,235
That's my worry.

219
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:01,030
<i>Release the hostages.
I'll get the press.</i>

220
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:04,241
I can't bargain with you
as long as you're holding these men.

221
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,745
I wouldn't stand a chance
without hostages, and you know it.

222
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,748
Give me your word
you won't harm the hostages...

223
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,750
and I'll get the press.

224
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,086
- I can't hold my boys too long.
- Couple of hours.

225
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,798
Okay.

226
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:24,428
<i>- Attaboy, Dunn!
- That's tellin' him!</i>

227
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,641
- That's tellin' him.
- Good work.

228
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,240
- How's it goin', Carnie?
- We're waitin'...

229
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:46,325
but we ain't sleepin'.

230
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,995
- Tony, make a list of all this stuff.
<i>- I can use that wire.</i>

231
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,123
What do you want to do,
blow us through the roof?

232
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:59,463
Hey, I got something to show you
that's terrific. Come on.

233
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,132
Hey, what's that?

234
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,552
Learned how to mix
that cocktail in Normandy.

235
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:09,139
Now, watch this.
This is a real beauty.

236
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,312
Hey, that's all right.

237
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:20,067
Fasten that to the bars of the window,
you can knock their brains out.

238
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,569
Make some more.

239
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,906
There we are.
It's finished.

240
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:29,451
- How does that work?
- Here, lend me your neck a minute.

241
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,001
Slip it over a screw's neck -

242
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,629
How's it feel, screw?

243
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,299
<i>- That's all right!</i>

244
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:44,758
Holy smokes!

245
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,677
Right, Governor.
I've got to have authority...

246
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,555
to bargain with Dunn
and send for the state police.

247
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,974
I warned you
we were due for a riot.

248
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,727
I've even got 'em sleeping
in the corridors of block 4.

249
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:58,981
You're always talking about overcrowding,
old plant, insufficient personnel.

250
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,899
<i>I don't want to argue that now.</i>

251
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,319
Right now I've got
a riot on my hands.

252
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:06,155
Give me the authority to act
before this thing spreads.

253
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,116
Warden, I can't let convicts
dictate terms to the state.

254
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,035
I'll send Haskell right away.

255
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,205
Yes, sir. Haskell!

256
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:18,709
I don't know what that politician
will do here. These men can't vote.

257
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,544
Monroe's wife.

258
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,464
Yes, Mrs. Monroe?

259
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,966
<i>Is it true
my husband's in block 11?</i>

260
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,093
That's right.
He is in the block.

261
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,428
<i>He'll be killed!</i>

262
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:33,223
We're not going to let anything happen.
I promise he'll be all right.

263
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,392
Yes. Good-bye.

264
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,813
Tell the operators not to put
any more of the guards' wives through.

265
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,734
Just tell 'em they'll be okay.
That's all I can tell 'em anyway.

266
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:54,995
I got four guys on the front gate,
two on the roof.

267
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,872
Yard's all clear.

268
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,458
Captain Barrett's
got nothing on you, Gator.

269
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,878
- You working out demands?
- Well, we got a pretty good start.

270
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,255
Why don't we get
the Colonel in on this?

271
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,679
I've been thinking about that.
We could sure use him.

272
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,682
Well, then, use him.

273
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,187
Yeah.

274
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:27,945
Hey, Colonel...

275
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:33,492
you're the only guy here besides me
who could lead this riot.

276
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,536
You gonna help us?

277
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:41,792
I had to hit that boy to show
these gunsels who's boss.

278
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:45,045
In the street they think we're wild animals.
Tonight you proved it.

279
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,756
What chance do we have
if we don't stick together?

280
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,009
This place is bad enough.
Don't you make it worse.

281
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,013
We're trying to work up
some demands.

282
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:57,766
I'm asking everybody
for their beefs. What's yours?

283
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,269
The same as everyone else -
the whole setup.

284
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,646
The bloody cages,
the idleness.

285
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,982
- But this riot won't change it.
- What will?

286
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,650
Maybe nothing.

287
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,652
We're forgotten.

288
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,988
Colonel, you've got
education, medals.

289
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,782
You're used to handling men.
Help us with the demands.

290
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,909
Count me out.

291
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:19,288
- I don't get it.
- There are a lot of reasons.

292
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,082
For one thing,
I'm up for parole consideration.

293
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,003
You're strictly for you.

294
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,175
All right, you control the boys.
I'll help frame the demands.

295
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,593
<i>Hey, Carnie.</i>

296
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,598
- Monroe here wants a cigarette.
- No.

297
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,601
Sure.
What's the difference?

298
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,688
Sure.
Give him the lighted end.

299
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,282
Here.

300
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,493
Take it.
It's all right.

301
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,204
Thanks.

302
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,665
What are they doing out there?
They're not gonna kill us, are they?

303
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,250
You'll be all right for a while.

304
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,420
It's not me. It's my wife.
We're gonna have a baby.

305
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,340
How can you afford a kid
on your salary?

306
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,927
I got two jobs -
this one and one in town.

307
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,221
<i>If I could get in touch with her -</i>

308
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:20,307
Hmm. Now you know why the boys
fuss so much over letters.

309
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,644
- If I could let her know I'm all right -
- They've got wives too.

310
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,233
Y- You got a family?

311
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,236
Sure. Wife and a kid.

312
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,657
It's tough
any way you look at it.

313
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,082
I figure too good.

314
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,751
I figure all the time,
but it don't add up.

315
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:50,587
- I'm an accountant, a good one.
- Embezzlement?

316
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,548
Nah, robbery.

317
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,759
I'm out for a while,
then I take something I don't need.

318
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,054
Grocery, department store -
it doesn't matter.

319
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,390
- You mean you don't need the stuff?
- No.

320
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,768
Just got to take it.
Like some fellas have to take a drink.

321
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,863
You belong in a psycho ward.
You shouldn't be here.

322
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,614
You're - You're different.

323
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,617
"Different"?
Take Ray in 26.

324
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,370
Armed robbery.
Do you think all that happens...

325
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:27,291
is that he says to himself, "I want
something" and then goes and gets it?

326
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,501
Nah.
It's not as simple as that.

327
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,670
<i>There's something wrong
with him too.</i>

328
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:34,298
You - You mean
they're all nuts?

329
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,425
Including the guards.

330
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,723
- Whose side you on, Mac?
- Well, of course I, uh -

331
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:00,324
I need glasses to see...

332
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,743
but not to think.

333
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:06,496
I can't put you through to the warden,
Mrs. Snader. The press just arrived.

334
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,707
<i>Tell him I've got to talk to him.</i>

335
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,500
All right, Mrs. Snader.
I promise.

336
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,839
No, I'm sorry. The warden's
with the press. I can't cut in.

337
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,718
What's a rookie guard
doing in the hole?

338
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,387
We don't have enough men,
and they're not good enough.

339
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,265
Most have to have
other jobs to make a living.

340
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,977
- Any idea why this started?
- Who's this Dunn?

341
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,896
Here.

342
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,691
Armed robbery, third offense.
Murder, second degree.

343
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,445
Medical report says he's homicidal -
dangerous and unbalanced.

344
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,822
<i>He should be
under psychiatric care.</i>

345
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,117
- When do we get to see him?
- We're waiting for Commissioner Haskell.

346
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:47,412
He's on his way here.
Here's another one.

347
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,123
Crazy Mike Carnie.

348
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,084
In for life. Dunn's pal.

349
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,836
<i>Transferred to us
from the state mental hospital.</i>

350
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,881
<i>I've been trying to get him
transferred back - with Dunn.</i>

351
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,217
<i>- No luck.</i>
- Are they all psychopaths?

352
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,887
Oh, no.
We've got all kinds here.

353
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,848
Good and bad,
just like on the outside. Here.

354
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:10,143
Vetter, known around here
as the Colonel.

355
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:13,730
He <i>is</i> a colonel too.
Brilliant war record.

356
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:18,193
<i>Got drunk, fight in a bar,
manslaughter.</i>

357
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,195
<i>He's up for parole
consideration.</i>

358
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,114
<i>Should be out soon.</i>

359
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,243
<i>These men aren't here forever.</i>

360
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,912
<i>Ninety-five percent
of them will be released.</i>

361
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,998
Not men like Dunn.

362
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,625
<i>He'll be living around you
and your family.</i>

363
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,712
And 65 percent of them
will break the law again.

364
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,715
Sixty-five percent?
That's a pretty high figure.

365
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,175
A figure that proves
we're not doing the job.

366
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,929
Isn't that the same speech you gave
the state legislature last summer?

367
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:49,182
It's the same speech he's been giving
for the last nine years.

368
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:52,519
- Hello, Warden. Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Haskell.

369
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,938
Well, let's get going, boys.

370
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,109
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi, Commissioner.

371
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,778
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Commissioner.

372
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,948
- How are you?
- Nice seeing you, Bill.

373
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,200
- Barrett.
- Mr. Haskell.

374
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:12,873
It's a fine mess you've gotten us into, Reynolds.
Let's clean it up fast, huh?

375
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,829
All right, Dunn, here's the press.

376
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,175
Let me see your hands!

377
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,974
These are used on the inmates.

378
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,851
Drop 'em,
or you can't come out.

379
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,396
Come on, hold up that chain.
Now look fierce.

380
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,148
Show a screw with a chain.

381
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,609
<i>Come on,
show us how the chain works.</i>

382
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,444
Sure, on you!

383
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,864
I'm coming out.

384
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,910
All right, 16, open the gate.

385
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:48,510
You gonna give us a statement,
or do we ask questions?

386
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,847
We got beefs we want to bring
to the attention of the public.

387
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,391
There's no work program.

388
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:58,145
Most of the guys are just sitting,
waiting for their time to run out.

389
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,813
- You're asking for work?
- Yeah.

390
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:03,233
- You think the public cares?
- They ought to. It's costing them dough.

391
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:07,571
- Your paper gonna print this?
- You know what we're interested in.

392
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,742
Yeah.
Mad dogs running wild.

393
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,453
- This place is badly organized.

394
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,456
Everybody's
all jumbled up together-

395
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,250
mental cases with kids.

396
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,087
We understand you've threatened to kill
the guards if your demands are not met.

397
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,089
- Is that true?
- You heard right.

398
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,800
Isn't that murder-
in prison or out?

399
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:32,345
This state will be responsible
for their deaths.

400
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,057
We understand the guards are married.
Some have children.

401
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,685
- So have we.
<i>- You're not being killed.</i>

402
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,897
- We're rotting to death.

403
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,400
You know Mr. Haskell is here
as the governor's representative.

404
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:48,278
<i>If you can get together,
will you call off the riot?</i>

405
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,946
If we can get together.

406
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,950
You heard Dunn, Mr. Haskell.

407
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,786
<i>I'd appreciate reading
something like what I've said.</i>

408
00:33:56,953 --> 00:33:59,289
I heard. His charges
are without foundation.

409
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,791
Isn't it a fact that
the federal government says...

410
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,586
that prisons of over 1,500 men
are unmanageable?

411
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:08,673
This prison was built to house 4,000 men.
It cost the taxpayers $26 million.

412
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,384
You want us to tear it down?

413
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,970
What's the cause of the riots,
in your opinion?

414
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,848
I'll give you a full statement
after I've talked to Dunn.

415
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,809
In a case like this,
either the cons run the prison...

416
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:21,853
or the prison runs the cons.

417
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:25,273
- I wouldn't try to prove it tonight.
- You gonna get the state police?

418
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,816
<i>If I need them.</i>

419
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,236
We gotta feed
that Haskell a guard.

420
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,488
This is just the beginning.
Take it easy.

421
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,491
Reynolds, this thing can spread.
We can't let it.

422
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,743
We have to settle it tonight.

423
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:44,125
Okay, Haskell, what you got?

424
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,169
I want you
to release the guards.

425
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,505
I bet you do.

426
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,633
- What do you want?
- What are you gonna do for us?

427
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,303
If you don't give up,
I'll see that every one of you hang.

428
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,555
Haskell, get away from me.

429
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,481
- Dunn!
<i>- Haskell, come back!</i>

430
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,191
Dunn!

431
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,991
- There's our statement, boys.

432
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:18,827
Oh, that's real brilliant, Carnie!

433
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,288
You gave 'em
just what they wanted!

434
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,545
So far,
the guys are behind me...

435
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,213
but for how long?

436
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,466
Some look up to you,
and they'll follow you, not me.

437
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,094
Throw in with me,
and we sew up the block.

438
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:39,597
I told you I would help organize
the demands. That's what I'm doing.

439
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:42,267
I want you to do more
than fix the language.

440
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,478
Check with the men so they'll know
you're for the demands.

441
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,981
I'm for the demands
but against the riot.

442
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,567
Maybe that's because
you used to be brass.

443
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,944
Maybe.
I don't think so.

444
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,654
Look, Colonel...

445
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,907
every newspaper and radio
in the country is watching this riot.

446
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:00,577
<i>We'll never get a chance
like this again.</i>

447
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,412
Yeah, I know.

448
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:07,167
If we could just get across
that anyone could land in prison...

449
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,918
just like that!

450
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,591
I'm just gonna serve my time
and get out.

451
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,926
- And never come back?
- Yeah.

452
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,762
And never come back.

453
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,847
Still think you're different,
don't you?

454
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,932
No.

455
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,603
But once you put this uniform on,
you not only look like a con...

456
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,188
you feel like one.

457
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,232
Yeah.
Even if you don't come back...

458
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,486
you'll always be an ex-con,
so why not come the whole way?

459
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:38,156
I can't, Dunn. It's like mutiny.
I just couldn't go for that.

460
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:42,660
If you only had three years on the street
since you were 14, you'd know how I feel.

461
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,954
We're wasting time.

462
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:49,417
I'll do the best I can on the demands.
Let's hope we can win some.

463
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,961
"Some"?
We've got to win them all.

464
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,079
Jeff...

465
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,373
if 11 can make it, so can we.

466
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,500
Don't rush it.

467
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:52,772
<i>Yeah, I know. We're all tired.</i>

468
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,900
<i>But the guards have to stay
at their posts until further notice.</i>

469
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:00,321
This is Mr. Russell
of the <i>New York Sun.</i> He just flew in.

470
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,031
Hello, Warden.
How's Haskell doing?

471
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,783
Just a flesh wound.

472
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,952
Excuse me, Warden.
Kitchen crews have reported...

473
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,079
they're ready with breakfast,
no incidents.

474
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,207
Good. Feed the blocks one by one.
Start as usual.

475
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,627
Right now we're trying
to feed 4,000 men.

476
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,754
Pardon me.
I have to check the yard.

477
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,674
- Bring him up to date.
- Sure. How about some coffee first?

478
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,342
Fine.

479
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:24,471
Yeah, what about
the leg irons and chains?

480
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,139
- Yeah, what about 'em?

481
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,808
That's covered in number three.
You'll see when it's finished.

482
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:32,395
- Finished yet, Colonel?
- Almost.

483
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,230
That's another thing.

484
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,737
Kids should be separated
from guys like that.

485
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,615
Kids should be separated
from what?

486
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,409
You heard me.
From guys like you.

487
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,286
Rub your nose
out of my business!

488
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,455
Don't get too big
for your britches, sonny.

489
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:54,751
Mickey! Drop it.

490
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,961
- Commissioner, how do you feel?
- All right, thanks.

491
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,131
What's going on?

492
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,842
We've fed 1, 2, and 3.

493
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,262
- Let 4 go, Barrett.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,144
Delmar, Barrett speaking.
Send 4 through.

495
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,813
Yes.

496
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:14,664
Isn't it risky letting those men go past 11
on their way to the mess hall?

497
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:17,041
It is. The only other
way to do it...

498
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,003
is to try to feed
4,000 men in their cells.

499
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,005
That has dangers too.

500
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,967
Don't know if I could spare enough guards
for that and still maintain security.

501
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,094
Okay, keep moving.

502
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:41,733
Barrett, 18.

503
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,235
<i>It's Dunn.</i>

504
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,195
Yeah, Dunn?

505
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:49,240
Warden, we'll be ready
in about 15 minutes.

506
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,242
Hold the phone.

507
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:54,704
- Dunn is ready to bargain.
- Tell him you'll call him back.

508
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,831
I want to get
this thing over with.

509
00:40:56,956 --> 00:41:00,418
I'm not going to jump
the minute <i>he's</i> ready.

510
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,295
Let him stew a while.

511
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,881
Time is on their side.

512
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:08,384
The longer we let this go,
the more explosive it's going to get.

513
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,637
Tell him you'll call him back.

514
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,348
I'll call you back.

515
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,558
Just don't take too long,
Warden.

516
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,896
He'd better not take too long.

517
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,254
Seven's still in business.

518
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:48,675
Sure wish I was with 'em.

519
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:53,888
This slop is rotten!

520
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:29,340
Attention, all towers.
This is the warden.

521
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:31,092
Listen carefully.

522
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,803
Don't do any shooting
unless they hit the wall.

523
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:50,486
- Cell block 5.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

524
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,030
- Have they started yet?
- Yeah, they're on their way.

525
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:56,325
Get 'em back. Block 4
has broken out of the mess hall.

526
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,035
Get yours back,
whatever you do.

527
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,247
Yes, sir. We gotta get 'em
back in their cells.

528
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:04,167
- All right. Come on back.
- Hold it! Back in your cells!

529
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,461
Back in your cells.
Come on.

530
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:09,297
Come on, get a move on there.
Come on.

531
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:11,340
Come on.
Come on back.

532
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,228
Grab a cell. Into your holes!
Hit your drum!

533
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:27,565
If they lock you in, you're dead!
They'll shoot you in your cells!

534
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,192
<i>Let's go!</i>

535
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,710
<i>X-14 to 1734. Ready now.</i>

536
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:50,463
<i>Come in.
State police, come in.</i>

537
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:52,423
<i>This is Lansing.</i>

538
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:55,468
Hello, Captain.
This is Warden Reynolds.

539
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:58,429
<i>- Standing by, Warden.</i>
- We need you right now.

540
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:01,265
- As many men as you can spare.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

541
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,726
How soon can you get here,
Captain Lansing?

542
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:05,853
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>
- Good.

543
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,860
Barrett, can you put any guards
down in the yard?

544
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:16,364
I already have every man
placed on 24-hour duty.

545
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:02,535
They've gone crazy.
I'm getting scared.

546
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,287
Everybody's scared.

547
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:30,438
Toolhouse is on fire.

548
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,776
Fire Department.

549
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,820
Fire in the toolshed.

550
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:40,031
Fire in the toolshed!
Let's go!

551
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,752
It's Roberts in cell block 5.

552
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,420
Roberts?

553
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:38,381
- Lifer.
- Roberts?

554
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:41,509
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- You can get death in this state
for leading a riot.

555
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,053
I've done 20 years
of hard time, Warden.

556
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:48,224
Tell those guys in the gun walk to lay off
or we bring these guards through.

557
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:51,352
- Wait. You tell him.
- Warden...

558
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:54,397
<i>these men mean
to kill us!</i>

559
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:58,901
Gun walk.

560
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:02,238
Gun walk...

561
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:06,075
don't do any shooting
when the men come out of 5.

562
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,743
Nineteen.

563
00:47:09,787 --> 00:47:11,664
Nineteen tower.

564
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,874
The men are
coming out of 5.

565
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,419
They have hostages.
Let 'em go.

566
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:08,387
They want me to open up
and let 'em into 11.

567
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:10,973
Yes, sir.

568
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:20,858
Hey, the state police are coming!

569
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:30,159
<i>Why don't you bring
the army too, you bunch of freaks!</i>

570
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:32,328
Yellow-bellied rat!

571
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,539
Lousy dogs!

572
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,507
<i>Scram, you lousy cops!</i>

573
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:58,479
<i>Men, this is the warden speaking.</i>

574
00:48:58,604 --> 00:49:02,817
The state police have orders not to shoot
if you go back to your blocks.

575
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:05,194
<i>Go back to your blocks!</i>

576
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:08,072
- I appeal to you for your own sake -

577
00:49:08,197 --> 00:49:10,407
get back into your blocks, men.

578
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:12,535
Get back into your blocks!

579
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:24,255
Give me the okay, Warden,
and we'll break this up.

580
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,883
Take over, Captain.

581
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:31,887
Lieutenant Wilkinson,
proceed with plan B.

582
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:04,336
Dunn on the phone.

583
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,047
Yes, Dunn?

584
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:09,216
Warden, I'm giving you
fair warning.

585
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:13,429
If any inmate is killed,
one guard for each inmate.

586
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:53,969
Pick up the man
who was shot.

587
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:09,318
Break 'em up into two groups.

588
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,870
Damage estimated
at over a million dollars.

589
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:05,332
That includes the mess hall,
fire in the toolshed -

590
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:07,626
Once they arrived,
it didn't take long.

591
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,628
Nobody killed,
quite a few injuries.

592
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,630
State police
handled themselves well.

593
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:14,049
The warden's policy
is to avoid bloodshed.

594
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:17,136
No, it's far from over.
Eleven's still holding out.

595
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:20,973
Now they have nine hostages -
five guards from block 5.

596
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:23,726
No report on any of them.
Presume they're still alive.

597
00:52:23,851 --> 00:52:26,103
<i>Haskell seems to be
the boss around here.</i>

598
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,659
- Yard's clear, Warden.
- Good.

599
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:44,413
Barrett, 18.

600
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:49,543
Warden, Bacon's dead.

601
00:52:49,668 --> 00:52:52,379
Let's have the doctor
hold his report for 24 hours.

602
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,631
We won't release this
to the press, huh?

603
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:57,301
- There's 11 again.

604
00:52:58,635 --> 00:53:00,429
Yeah, what is it?

605
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,307
- I hear Bacon got it.
- It was an accident.

606
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:05,309
Give it to me straight.

607
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:07,853
<i>He's dead. Gunshot.</i>

608
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,773
Okay, it's like I said -

609
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:12,733
one for one.

610
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:15,611
Carnie, get one of the screws
and bring him here.

611
00:53:15,778 --> 00:53:17,738
- Snader?
- Snader.

612
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:21,658
- It's a pleasure.
<i>- Dunn? Listen, Dunn, are you there?</i>

613
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:23,327
It was an accident.

614
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:26,121
We didn't kill him.
One of the state policemen did.

615
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:28,290
<i>We're sticking to our end
of the bargain.</i>

616
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:31,627
Yeah, but Bacon's dead, isn't he?
Our deal was one for one.

617
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:34,254
They're going to kill Snader.

618
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,632
Hold it, Dunn.
I'm coming right down.

619
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:14,503
Dunn!

620
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:21,593
We're ready to listen
to the demands.

621
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:30,477
Okay, Warden, I'm ready.

622
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:32,729
<i>I want to talk
to the whole prison.</i>

623
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:34,815
First let me see Snader.

624
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,942
- Okay.

625
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,449
Have a good look.

626
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:21,195
We of 11 block...

627
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,572
know that we represent...

628
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:26,617
the entire inmate population
in these demands.

629
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:30,078
We are bargaining
for all of you.

630
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:31,872
Here goes.

631
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:39,046
Eleven block
must be remodeled.

632
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:41,173
Give us room to breathe...

633
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:43,300
and more light to see with.

634
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:47,721
<i>The nuts ought to be separated
from the rest of us...</i>

635
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:50,557
<i>and put some place where
you can do something for them.</i>

636
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:54,561
Get rid of the leg locks, chains...

637
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:57,272
<i>and brutal guards like Snader.</i>

638
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:59,816
<i>Teach us a trade...</i>

639
00:55:59,942 --> 00:56:02,110
<i>so that when
we get out of here...</i>

640
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:04,238
<i>we'll be able
to hold down a job.</i>

641
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:06,698
Are you sure you didn't write
these demands yourself?

642
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:09,993
The whole thing sounds
exactly like your yearly complaints.

643
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,787
"Remodel block 11, turn -"

644
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:15,207
Look, the state commission
condemned that block two years ago.

645
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,917
Inmates read too.

646
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,461
And last...

647
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:21,463
no reprisals...

648
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,840
against any ringleaders...

649
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:27,135
or participants of this revolt.

650
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:28,887
That is all.

651
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:33,642
Well, you may let them get away with it,
Reynolds, but I promise you...

652
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:36,395
I'll have these men
brought to trial.

653
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,190
If it weren't for these guards,
I wouldn't sign anything, and you know it.

654
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:44,486
- Warden, what do you think?
- Those demands are awfully sharp
for a bunch of cons.

655
00:56:44,653 --> 00:56:47,447
These are intelligent men,
Dunn in particular.

656
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,908
If he's so smart,
what's he doing in here?

657
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:53,537
He's also a psychopath,
like a lot of brilliant men on the outside.

658
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:55,956
Are you going to recommend
acceptance for the governor?

659
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:57,708
In the main. After all...

660
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,627
most of them have been
my demands for a long time.

661
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:03,005
- Looks like this time
you might get 'em.

662
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:10,304
I want you to sign,
and I want the governor to sign.

663
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,894
I'll sign, but I don't know
about the governor.

664
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,855
When will you know?

665
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:21,732
Give me six hours.

666
00:57:21,857 --> 00:57:24,067
Sure, Warden.

667
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:52,721
- Throw him in one of the cells.

668
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:58,143
Carnie! Carnie!

669
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:02,189
Carnie!

670
00:58:14,076 --> 00:58:16,370
No. No.

671
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,497
No. No.

672
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:25,587
Dunn! Carnie!

673
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:27,547
That's enough of that!

674
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,842
This punk tried to take over.

675
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,719
Throw him out.

676
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:37,307
Gator, get me Barrett
on the phone.

677
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:39,434
Take care of him.

678
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:41,645
Come on,
let's put him in a cell.

679
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,438
He's badly hurt.

680
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,612
- Easy with him, Al.
- I've got him.

681
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:55,367
Oh, leave me alone.

682
00:58:56,535 --> 00:58:59,579
- Far as I can tell, nothing broken.
- My neck's stiff.

683
00:58:59,705 --> 00:59:02,332
Lucky that pipe
just glanced off your shoulder.

684
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:07,379
You don't look so hot
yourself, Al.

685
00:59:07,504 --> 00:59:10,215
- I figured you on Mickey's side.
- You figured wrong.

686
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,385
Yeah, and you figured wrong
when you put Carnie in charge.

687
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,804
If you want the job,
it's yours.

688
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:17,889
Then shut up!

689
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:32,279
- Yes?
<i>- We're throwing Mickey
out the front gate.</i>

690
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:35,323
I'll right. I'll send a stretcher
for Mickey. Who's this?

691
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,200
<i>Mike Carnie.</i>

692
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:40,203
- Where's Dunn?
<i>- I'm in charge now.</i>

693
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:45,000
That was Crazy Mike Carnie.
He's taken over.

694
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,919
- They've almost killed one of the inmates.
- What happened to Dunn?

695
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:50,881
- He won't say.
- Crazy Mike - who's he?

696
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:53,884
"Crazy" is the nicest thing
you can say about him.

697
00:59:54,009 --> 00:59:55,886
- Dispensary.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

698
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:58,638
Send a stretcher
to 11 block gate.

699
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:10,692
What's the matter, Snader?

700
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:12,819
Don't think I like you, huh?

701
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:15,989
You're wrong.
I'm gonna do you a favor.

702
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:18,074
Wanna say good-bye
to your wife?

703
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,202
I'll let you write her
a farewell letter.

704
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:22,954
No.

705
01:00:24,206 --> 01:00:25,999
All the other screws
are writing letters.

706
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:28,877
How will your old lady feel
if she don't get one?

707
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:33,673
Of course,
if you don't wanna -

708
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:35,842
I'll just leave
the pencil and paper.

709
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,262
Change your mind, just rap on the door.
Schuyler will pick it up.

710
01:00:45,227 --> 01:00:48,897
Wait till the wives get those letters
and start to phone the warden.

711
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:51,066
You'll see some action.

712
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:00,742
What a lot of tripe.

713
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:02,911
"Good-bye forever."

714
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:04,871
Get me the operator.

715
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:14,714
This is Carnie.
I want to talk to Mrs. Monroe.

716
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,429
The operator says
Carnie's calling Mrs. Monroe.

717
01:01:21,555 --> 01:01:24,307
Tell 'em to put the call through.
I'll monitor it here.

718
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:26,601
Put the call through.
We'll cut in.

719
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:29,020
- Find out what this guy's up to.
<i>- Yes?</i>

720
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:32,357
- Mrs. Monroe, this is inmate Carnie.
<i>- Mike Carnie?</i>

721
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:34,776
I got a farewell letter here
from your husband.

722
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:38,655
<i>No! No, he's not dead!</i>

723
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,574
<i>Not yet.</i>

724
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:42,409
<i>"Dearest Sue...</i>

725
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:44,786
<i>I feel responsible
for everything."</i>

726
01:01:44,953 --> 01:01:46,830
- Get me the governor.

727
01:01:46,955 --> 01:01:48,748
Operator, get the governor.
Urgent.

728
01:01:48,874 --> 01:01:52,419
<i>"They tell me I gotta
say good-bye to you and the children.</i>

729
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:55,338
<i>I don't know how,
because I can't believe it."</i>

730
01:01:56,464 --> 01:01:57,966
Convinced?

731
01:01:58,091 --> 01:02:02,470
- Just a moment, sir. Ready.
- Governor, have you signed yet?

732
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:04,097
No, I haven't.

733
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:06,474
These men's lives
really depend on it.

734
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:08,268
We can't trust Carnie.

735
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:12,689
<i>Governor, if you're going to sign at all,
will you please do it right away?</i>

736
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:14,900
I must consider
very carefully.

737
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:19,321
If I sign, it'll be an open invitation
to the inmates of every prison in this state...

738
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:21,740
to grab guards
and dictate their own terms.

739
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:23,575
Governor...

740
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,704
I don't want you to take the responsibility
for the murder of nine men.

741
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:29,873
Every minute counts.

742
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,502
He hasn't signed?

743
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,713
<i>Not yet.</i>

744
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,840
What happens if we break
into 11 block?

745
01:02:39,007 --> 01:02:43,011
That block is as hard to break into
as it is to break out of. Harder.

746
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:45,013
<i>Some of my men will be killed.</i>

747
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:49,768
Well, suppose we blast a hole
in the block, only inmates get killed?

748
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:52,020
The casualties will be high.

749
01:02:52,187 --> 01:02:55,565
- Including the guards on the inside.
- Maybe.

750
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:58,818
Haskell, the moment
you give the order...

751
01:02:58,944 --> 01:03:02,030
to blow up that block,
you're in complete charge.

752
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:06,493
I'll have to take that risk.
All right, Captain, let's get started.

753
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:18,046
Hold your head up a little.

754
01:03:19,047 --> 01:03:22,175
Colonel, do you think
us guards should be killed?

755
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,095
- We haven't done anything.
- Hold quiet.

756
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,681
I never treated the men bad.

757
01:03:27,806 --> 01:03:29,933
No, you just
lock up the cages...

758
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:33,561
and help throw the food
to the wild animals.

759
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:36,731
I never hit nobody.
Didn't play no favorites.

760
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:39,651
Yeah, you treat us
all the same -

761
01:03:39,776 --> 01:03:42,404
like a bunch of cons.

762
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,864
Each man in here
feels different inside.

763
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:49,035
We all fight for our identity.
And you help destroy that.

764
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,204
That's the prison.
I'm just a guard here -

765
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:53,456
Yeah, I know.

766
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:56,418
That's what we got
against you.

767
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:03,008
<i>Schuyler.</i>

768
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:11,057
Get me Snader.
We'll start with him.

769
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:13,601
- I thought I told you -
- Take off.

770
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:16,438
And keep your eyes open.

771
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,941
I don't think
we should kill 'em.

772
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:21,985
I don't think
God would approve.

773
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,945
How's Al, Tony?

774
01:04:24,112 --> 01:04:25,822
Feeling better.

775
01:04:25,947 --> 01:04:29,617
Talk to him. See if he and his friends
will stand up against Carnie.

776
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:32,954
- I don't want trouble.
- You can't have it both ways.

777
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:37,083
If you don't want the guards killed,
you have to put up a fight.

778
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,877
Go on.

779
01:04:58,605 --> 01:05:00,940
Hand him over, Schuyler!

780
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:05,737
What do you guys
think you're doing?

781
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:10,825
I'm willing to let you
run this riot, Carnie...

782
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:15,663
- but you can't kill Snader.
- Gator, boys, come on!

783
01:05:24,631 --> 01:05:26,841
Now, wait a minute!

784
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:30,428
- Let's let Dunn decide this!

785
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:33,014
All right. Get him.

786
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:42,190
What's the matter?

787
01:05:42,315 --> 01:05:44,651
You guys goin' chicken?

788
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:53,076
- I want to see Dunn.
- Carnie said no.

789
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:55,912
I said I wanted to see Dunn!

790
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:58,373
Dunn. Dunn!

791
01:05:58,498 --> 01:06:00,792
- Hey, take it easy.
- Carnie's gonna kill Snader!

792
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:03,002
- What for? What happened?
- Nothing. He's crazy.

793
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:06,965
- If you don't stop it,
we'll all end up in a bucket.

794
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,384
I told him no cutting!

795
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:19,185
All right, break it up.
Break it up.

796
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,896
- Break it up. All right -
- Hold up.

797
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:23,857
Break it up, now.
Break it up.

798
01:06:23,982 --> 01:06:27,277
All right, break it up.
Break it up, now.

799
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:29,696
They're gonna
blow up the block!

800
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:32,115
What?

801
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,702
I been standing guard, and I seen
these cops coming across the yard.

802
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:37,579
- They're not planting flowers.
- Where?

803
01:06:37,745 --> 01:06:40,498
<i>- By the end of the block.</i>
- Lock Snader in a cell.

804
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:54,262
All right, dummy up.
Dummy up.

805
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,194
- It's a double-cross.

806
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:11,404
They're gonna blow
a hole in the block.

807
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:14,073
Carnie, get the screws.
We'll tie 'em up here.

808
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:16,618
Right.
Gator, you three, come on.

809
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:33,343
Will you wait
for the governor to sign?

810
01:07:33,468 --> 01:07:36,763
And if he won't sign?
We've tried your way. It's no good.

811
01:07:36,888 --> 01:07:40,016
It started with four hostages, now nine.
Tomorrow it may be 20.

812
01:07:40,141 --> 01:07:42,560
You've never tried it my way.

813
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:44,979
The legislature's never given me
the money I need.

814
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:48,107
If they had, maybe I wouldn't have
a riot on my hands.

815
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:51,152
I disagree.
I think this riot is a direct result...

816
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:53,488
of your policy of compromise
with the convicts.

817
01:07:53,613 --> 01:07:56,282
That's why I'm against signing.
I'd never sign.

818
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:59,744
Your way would only make
this place harder to handle.

819
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:03,039
You'd have thousands
of angry, desperate men...

820
01:08:03,164 --> 01:08:06,000
and they'd take it out on the public
when they're released.

821
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,628
They may be angry,
but they'll be scared too.

822
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:10,880
They'll know
we mean business.

823
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:13,132
They'll think twice
before they riot again.

824
01:08:13,258 --> 01:08:14,509
No.

825
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:18,096
You'll never stop riots
by treating the prisoners worse.

826
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:20,556
You stop them
by treating them better?

827
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,801
Line up! Line up!

828
01:08:56,926 --> 01:08:58,803
Get back in your cells!

829
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:00,930
Get back in your cell -

830
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:05,977
- Popped his buttons.
- Yeah.

831
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:12,442
- I'm calling the warden
to tell him we're giving up!
- I'm running this show, Colonel.

832
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:16,654
They blow this cell block, they'll not only
kill the guards, but we'll go with them!

833
01:09:20,283 --> 01:09:23,077
- All right, cut it out.
<i>- Put that bum in there.</i>

834
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:26,664
That's what anybody else gets
who tries to sell us out.

835
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,641
- You all set?
- Say the word.

836
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:10,143
- This is Dunn. What's up?
- The warden's on his way
down to the yard.

837
01:11:10,268 --> 01:11:12,145
Yeah, but what about
the dynamite?

838
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:15,273
<i>Nothing's going to happen
if you release the guards and come out.</i>

839
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:16,732
<i>The governor signed
the demands.</i>

840
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:18,985
Hey, the warden's in the yard.

841
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,362
They say the governor
signed the demands.

842
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:25,241
- It's a trick, Dunn.
- Well, I'm gonna find out.

843
01:11:40,965 --> 01:11:43,885
I've signed it.
So has the governor.

844
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,053
You wouldn't be
playing tricks, Warden?

845
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:48,014
Like maybe planting
a little dynamite?

846
01:11:50,308 --> 01:11:53,478
- All the reporters here?
- Yes.

847
01:11:59,859 --> 01:12:02,737
Okay, let's give them
their headlines.

848
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:17,960
All right, Dunn.
Start filing out, one by one.

849
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:20,087
After I see
the morning papers.

850
01:12:22,423 --> 01:12:24,342
They'll be here at 7:30.

851
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:25,927
Fine.

852
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:30,097
- We did it!

853
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:37,415
All right.
Let the guards out first.

854
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,848
I gather from what you say
you feel you've won a victory.

855
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:37,600
- That's right.
- Congratulations are in order.

856
01:14:37,725 --> 01:14:39,602
I'll say they are.

857
01:14:47,902 --> 01:14:50,029
- Tom! Tom!

858
01:14:53,491 --> 01:14:55,576
I never thought
I'd see you again!

859
01:15:16,514 --> 01:15:18,015
Hey, Colonel!

860
01:15:19,058 --> 01:15:20,726
Yeah, Dunn?

861
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:24,939
I can't understand
why we haven't heard anything.
What do you think they're doing?

862
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:29,902
- Well, it's only two weeks.
<i>- Yeah, but nothing's happened.</i>

863
01:15:30,027 --> 01:15:31,654
They're in no rush.

864
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:34,073
Sure, you forced them,
but they don't like it.

865
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:36,158
They signed.
It's still in the papers.

866
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:39,078
What's in the papers?
That you led a riot?

867
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:41,872
That you beat up the guards?
That you destroyed property?

868
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:43,874
Yeah,
and the headlines say I won!

869
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,628
Yeah. Well, don't expect
any medals.

870
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,133
All right, Dunn,
the warden wants to see you.

871
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:54,135
It's about time!

872
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:05,187
I hear the warden's got
the blueprints for the new 11 block.

873
01:16:06,188 --> 01:16:09,024
- Here he is now.

874
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:25,166
Wait outside.

875
01:16:34,759 --> 01:16:36,635
What's it all about, Warden?

876
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:39,430
Dunn, you're going
to stand trial...

877
01:16:39,555 --> 01:16:43,058
on charges of leading a riot
and kidnapping guards.

878
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:45,853
But I don't get it.

879
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,897
No reprisals - the agreement.

880
01:16:48,022 --> 01:16:50,024
There is no agreement.

881
01:16:50,191 --> 01:16:53,903
State legislature repudiated
the governor's signature and mine.

882
01:16:54,028 --> 01:16:57,656
- They what?
- Canceled it out.

883
01:16:57,782 --> 01:17:01,035
Said we had no right to make
an agreement with convicts.

884
01:17:02,453 --> 01:17:05,956
But Warden, you signed it.
You gave us your word.

885
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:09,376
I don't like it, Dunn...

886
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:11,670
but that's what happened.

887
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:22,056
What'll I get?

888
01:17:22,181 --> 01:17:24,767
If you're found guilty,
probably 30 years.

889
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:27,186
Thirty years?
And for what?

890
01:17:27,311 --> 01:17:29,146
For nothing!

891
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,745
What'll Carnie get,
and the colonel?

892
01:17:44,912 --> 01:17:47,414
Carnie is being sent
to the state mental institution...

893
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,792
where he should have been
a long time ago.

894
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:51,919
I'm signing
the colonel's parole.

895
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:56,924
And I get 30 years.

896
01:17:58,217 --> 01:18:01,220
Warden, you know I didn't do it
to bust over the walls.

897
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:05,975
I did it just so people would know
what it's like in here. But 30 years?

898
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:10,229
I was never able
to transfer Carnie before.

899
01:18:10,354 --> 01:18:14,567
The colonel may not have gotten his parole,
even though he deserved it.

900
01:18:14,692 --> 01:18:16,569
Try to realize, Dunn...

901
01:18:16,694 --> 01:18:20,656
<i>that good does
sometimes come out of evil.</i>

902
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:23,409
That's awful little good
for 30 years.

903
01:18:23,534 --> 01:18:25,494
Well, the public
has learned more...

904
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:28,414
about the inside of a prison
in the last few weeks...

905
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:31,166
than they did in my 15 years
of making speeches.

906
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:35,045
Why do you think that is?

907
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,631
Because we got
in the papers.

908
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:39,758
And you're still news...

909
01:18:39,884 --> 01:18:42,052
with or without
an agreement.

910
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:44,471
Haskell wants me to resign.

911
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:46,974
There's gonna be
an investigation.

912
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:51,186
But this time, the public
will listen to my side of it.

913
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:54,148
And they're your only hope.

914
01:18:54,315 --> 01:18:56,984
<i>They're the only ones
who can help.</i>

915
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:00,988
I sure hope so.

916
01:19:01,155 --> 01:19:03,949
I've been in and out
of these joints all my life.

917
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:07,328
And who cares?
That ain't right, Warden.

918
01:19:07,453 --> 01:19:10,873
In other states after their riots,
changes were made.

919
01:19:10,998 --> 01:19:12,666
The inmates won.

920
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:17,338
Yeah, I won - 30 years.
