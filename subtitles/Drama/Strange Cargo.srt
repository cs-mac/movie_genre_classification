1
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,597
All right, Verne.

2
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,608
Did you hear me? I said, come out.

3
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:11,675
GUARD 2: Thirty days in solitary
won't make him any easier to handle.

4
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,412
GUARD 1: Don't try anything, Verne,
or you'll go back in there.

5
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,329
GUARD 2:
Look him over. He may have a knife.

6
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:32,427
Yeah. Maybe one of them rats in there
slipped me one.

7
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,066
But I got a couple of hidden weapons
at that, here and here.

8
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:43,502
- Nobody can take them away from me.
- Come on.

9
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:57,854
Ninety lashes, 16 months in solitary,
seven months in the bear pit

10
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,919
and five attempts to escape in three years.

11
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,189
- Don't you like it here, Verne?
- No. Does that answer it?

12
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,758
You put things so clearly.

13
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,999
Maybe we ought to give you a chance
to make some new contacts,

14
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:11,563
outside the walls.

15
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,768
- Outside?
- Why not?

16
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:19,076
Nature surrounded us with something
stronger than walls, the jungle.

17
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,706
You know about that don't you, Verne?

18
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,752
So it's tough. You've plugged up
every hole I've ever made,

19
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,344
but you know
I'm going to make another one.

20
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,448
Yeah, I've heard men talk like that before.
Men like Moussenq.

21
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,590
Six times he got away.

22
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,961
Three times we caught him,
and three times the jungle got him for us.

23
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,398
You can't win, Verne.

24
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,732
And why try,
when you've only got three years left?

25
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,363
I'd try if I only had three minutes left.

26
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,465
I'm a thief by profession, Grideau,
not a convict.

27
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,238
There's nothing won'th stealing
around here except freedom,

28
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,610
and I'm after some of that.

29
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:56,015
Verne, I'm going to assign you
to the wharf detail outside the walls.

30
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:59,782
Frankly, it's an experiment.
I've tried everything else with you.

31
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:01,414
You'll be on your honor.

32
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,756
I haven't got any. Don't be a sucker.

33
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:09,093
Yes, well go and clean yourself up.
Report for work at the main gate.

34
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,093
Oh, Verne. I forgot to tell you,
there were three or four men,

35
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,697
big men like you,
who did make it through the jungle.

36
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:23,105
Except when they got through,
I was waiting for them to bring them back.

37
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:35,850
28, 30, 32, 34, 36. 36, right?

38
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:37,392
36, right.

39
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,411
Looks like you've had enough, Pop.

40
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,575
Twelve years seems like enough.
More than enough.

41
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,211
Get up, Moussenq. This is no picnic.

42
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,213
Did he call you Moussenq?

43
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,193
That's my name.
That's all Moussenq is now, a name.

44
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,857
You called me Pop.
How old do you think I am?

45
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,196
You look about 50.

46
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:22,669
I'm 36 years old, believe it if you can.

47
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,106
Twelve of them I spent in the bear pit
and solitary and under the lash.

48
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:28,405
You've made enough breaks.
Why didn't you get away?

49
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,139
No man can get through that jungle.

50
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,408
It tears you and breaks you
and makes you old before your time.

51
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,451
There's nothing a man can't get through
to be free. It's been done.

52
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:38,112
With help from the outside,
a boat waiting down the coast, maybe.

53
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,247
Who knows?
Some way they did it, but not alone.

54
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:47,218
No, monsieur, it can't be done.
But someday I'll try it again.

55
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,480
Verne. Drop it and get moving.

56
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,660
Hello, Georges. You've been
such a stranger at the café lately.

57
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,290
Well, you know how it is
with a newly married man.

58
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:26,494
- He feels kind of married, you know?
- Well, in a couple of months, then.

59
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,093
- May I go aboard?
- What for?

60
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:32,005
Let's say I'm a fool for boats,
and I only see one every three months.

61
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,804
Well, maybe you expect
something from home?

62
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,743
- In care of the captain.
- Well, I'll take you to him.

63
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,646
Coming, Julie? There might be some mail.

64
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,549
Mail for me?

65
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,393
- Hello, Julie.
- Go away, Pig.

66
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,662
Oh, Julie, you don't mean it
just like that, do you?

67
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:39,196
After all, there is no harm
in being friendly.

68
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:42,870
Men die all the time
and pigs live on and on,

69
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,846
when you'd think their own smell
would kill them.

70
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,280
Look, how many times
have I got to tell you?

71
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,113
You're a pig, a sneak
and a dirty stoolpigeon,

72
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,415
and I want you to leave me alone.

73
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,536
Watch yourself, baby.
Just act natural like you're alone.

74
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:18,208
- What do you want?
- Guess.

75
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:22,482
Why, you crummy convict.
Who do you think you're talking to?

76
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:26,818
Wait a minute, sweetheart.
Made a nice grab there, didn't I?

77
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,816
Let go, or I'll yell for the guard.

78
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,329
Be nice, or I'll give it a twist.
And they'll fish you out of the drink.

79
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,061
Don't you know what'll happen
if you're caught talking to me?

80
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:42,366
Sure. They'll throw me into solitary.
Can we fix it to be thrown in together?

81
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,669
You'd like to cut yourself
a piece of cake like that, wouldn't you?

82
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,106
Easy, baby.

83
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,412
Listen, if I'm caught talking to a convict,
they'll chase me off the island.

84
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:56,610
Swell. We'll meet on the mainland,
and hit Paris together.

85
00:08:56,686 --> 00:09:00,679
You're from Paris, ain't you?
I said, where you from, baby?

86
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,151
- Marseille.
- Marseille.

87
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:09,995
Hot blue nights,
the right kind of music, it's a date.

88
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,161
A romantic convict.
What are you in for, stealing doilies?

89
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,705
All right, I got no time to mess around.

90
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,172
You're one of the girls
at the café, ain't you?

91
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,972
- Ain't you?
- Well, what if I am?

92
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,270
I'll be there tonight.

93
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:27,043
Keep a light in the window,
and a couple more in your eyes.

94
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:30,347
Tonight you'll be in a cell
just where you belong.

95
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,080
And if the walls fall down or something,
and you should get out,

96
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,851
I'll turn you over to the guards
so quick it'll make you dizzy.

97
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:39,224
You hate hard, baby, so you love hard.

98
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:43,931
What's your name?
Yvonne, Missy, Julie, Fifi?

99
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
SUZANNE: Julie.

100
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,096
I'll see you tonight, Julie.

101
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,342
Don't tell me the heat's got you.
I'd swear I saw you talking to yourself.

102
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,175
You werert talking to a convict?

103
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,307
No. I know better than that.
I was just trying out some new answers.

104
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,749
I'd like to hear some new ones.

105
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:06,083
Why don't you drop up some night after
you've tucked the convicts in the cells?

106
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,179
You lock them up, don't you?

107
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,451
I mean, there's no way
they can get out at night, is there?

108
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,621
- No way that they know about. Why?
- Nothing. I was just wondering.

109
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:49,459
30, 32, 34, 35. Halt.

110
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,592
Louis, there should be 36. I count 35.

111
00:10:56,105 --> 00:11:00,439
Hurry up there,
get up here with the others.

112
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,775
I must have fallen behind.
There was so much to do out there.

113
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,782
Get in line and hurry up about it.

114
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,978
All right, Louis, 36 is right.
Take them away.

115
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,042
March.

116
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,441
- I said I'd be here, baby.
- Yes, so you did.

117
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,804
And here you are,
and you're quite a little man.

118
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,610
Now beat it
before you get yourself a lot of grief.

119
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,878
Grief ain't what I came after.

120
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,112
You got class, kid.

121
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,317
Or is it because
I haven't seen any women lately?

122
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,653
Don't try that again.

123
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,922
Because if you do,
I'll break a couple of your bones,

124
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,759
if you've got any.

125
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,629
Let's see if you have.

126
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,636
Now get smart.

127
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,763
Why don't you get smart?
You know what they'll do to you.

128
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,867
Sure I do, but I'll take all they've got
for a little of this.

129
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:16,434
I don't know
what you'll look like tomorrow,

130
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:19,743
but right now, baby, you're
the most beautiful dame in the world.

131
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,840
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Not a thing.

132
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,408
No? Supposing I wasrt a convict?

133
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,320
Supposing I was sailing through
on my yacht or a guy selling brushes...

134
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,880
Yeah, and suppose I was Snow White.

135
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,227
But even if I did think you werert
the worst-looking guy in the world,

136
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,792
supposing even I told you

137
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,767
you looked like someone
I was once dumb enough to go for,

138
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,302
what would it get me?

139
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,338
If you get caught here,
I get sent back to the mainland.

140
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,896
I can think of worse things than that.

141
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,671
Look, this isn't my idea of heaven, either.

142
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,878
Let's get back to supposing.

143
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:53,813
Supposing I was the guy
you were dumb enough to fall for.

144
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,943
- Then what?
- Here's what.

145
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,451
There, you see?

146
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:08,122
Maybe you wouldn't be so hard to like
if you went at things in a nicer way.

147
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,695
It'd be a nice gamble if a guy could win,
wouldn't it?

148
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:19,104
All right, we'll try things your way.
Where do we begin?

149
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,300
Well, I've got a number coming up,

150
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:21,843
and a date
with one of the prison directors.

151
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,572
And he should be downstairs now.

152
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,477
Yeah, but I'll tell him
I've got a headache or something.

153
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,948
Take off your beard, sweetheart.

154
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,285
Okay. If you want him to find you here,
it's no skin off my teeth.

155
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,820
That's right.

156
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:35,589
So when they start yelling for me
to come down and sing my song, I'll...

157
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,126
You'll stay here and sing it.

158
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:41,560
Sure, sure, what do we care?

159
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,526
We'll take what we've got right now.
Who cares about later?

160
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,034
Let them come and get you.
You're too tough

161
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,265
- and too smart for them all.
- I'm not exactly a cluck, baby.

162
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,002
No, you figure here we are,
this is the beginning and the end.

163
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:58,513
Only a cluck would think of tomorrow.
Well, I'm a cluck.

164
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,712
You're no good to me in a cell.

165
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,355
I'm going down to stall them off.
You wait here.

166
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:10,017
It's nice of you to try things my way.

167
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,494
- But, monsieur, I assure you...
- He's here some place.

168
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:21,730
There must be some mistake.
No prisoner would dare come in here.

169
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,567
He was seen climbing
in an upstairs window.

170
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,867
You. We're looking for...

171
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,171
If you're looking for a loose convict,
come and get him.

172
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,484
All right, Verne, we've got you.
Don't try anything.

173
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,021
So, you outsmarted me, huh?

174
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,189
That's what happens, they tell me,
when smart people get together.

175
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,697
One of them winds up ahead.

176
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:54,793
And I lose. Only what happens
when I catch up with you?

177
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,395
And I will catch up with you, baby.

178
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,639
The law here denies convicts
the privilege of associating with women.

179
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,808
The same law applies to women.
Women are not allowed to associate

180
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,012
with convicts, on the penalty
of expulsion from the colony.

181
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,419
Don't tell me I'm going to be kicked out
of this paradise of yours.

182
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,652
All right, come on, give me my ticket.
I'll be on my way.

183
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,696
GRIDEAU: Well, we don't give out tickets.

184
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,562
Oh, what do you expect me to do,
ride out of here on a cloud?

185
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,965
Make it a cloud for two, baby.

186
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,436
We didn't send for you.
You can get out the way you got in.

187
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,063
But, Grideau, it wasrt my fault.

188
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,631
He spoke to me on the dock,
and I warned him to keep away from me.

189
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,199
When he didn't,
I told him I'd call the guard,

190
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,438
and he said if I did,
he'd throw me overboard.

191
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,743
GRIDEAU: How about that, Verne?

192
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,682
Some women would rather drown
than talk to a guy like me.

193
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,687
- How did you come to be in her room?
- I told her I'd be there, didn't I?

194
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,416
Why didn't she turn me in
before I made good?

195
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,287
Because I didn't believe he would.

196
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,657
He broke into my room,
and as soon as I could, I called the guards.

197
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,593
They'll tell you. Go on, tell him.

198
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:57,154
So, she ran into the boys.
She was in a spot.

199
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,029
She turned me in to save her own hide.

200
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,262
You're a liar.
You're not going to take the word

201
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:04,533
- of a slimy convict against mine, are you?
- I might.

202
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,200
But the facts speak more convincingly
than either of you.

203
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,143
He was found in your room.
I've got to act accordingly.

204
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:14,672
Okay. So that's that, and I'm on my way.

205
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,945
But no matter where I go,
or no matter how low it is,

206
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,283
I'll know that you're no better than me,
Monsieur Grideau,

207
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,584
or any of the rats in your zoo.

208
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:25,119
You said you'd catch up with me someday.
Well, I just hope you do.

209
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:28,561
- And what's going to happen then, baby?
- Here's what.

210
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Take Verne to a dormitory.
I'll deal with him in the morning.

211
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,033
You've got 12 hours to leave the colony.

212
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,044
If you're not gone,
you'll be put under arrest.

213
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,511
I got an idea, Grideau.

214
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,912
Give me 12 hours to get out,
and put her in the dormitory.

215
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,109
That way everybody's happy.

216
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:56,320
Let go of me. You heard what he said.
I'm going out the way I came in.

217
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,854
- Send the Pig in.
- GUARD: Yes, sir.

218
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,071
Thank you, monsieur.
But I wonder whether this time

219
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,077
instead of paying me the reward,
you would grant me a small favor?

220
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,906
Well, what is it?

221
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,417
Well, Julie's not a bad girl.
This business was none of her fault.

222
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:25,214
And will I let her remain in the colony?

223
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:30,148
And what makes you think
I deal in women, you miserable...

224
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,861
Take your money and get out of here.

225
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:43,303
Wouldrt have to rely on vermin like him
if you men filled your uniforms.

226
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,707
Have you discovered how Verne
managed to remain outside the walls?

227
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,834
There's no way of explaining it, sir.

228
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,572
36 men were counted through the gate,

229
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,740
and 36 men were counted back,
and double counted, sir.

230
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,307
Well, if you're sure of that, then,

231
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,050
it certainly is odd.

232
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,665
Isn't that the Bible you're reading?

233
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:23,604
With the exception of me, this room
is filled with men who have forgotten God.

234
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,242
Blasphemers, infidels, atheists.
And God, too, has forgotten them all.

235
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:33,919
All except me.
I will be forgiven for my sins.

236
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,855
The rest will burn in hell,
but I will be forgiven.

237
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,452
- So, that's why you read the Bible?
- Why else?

238
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,492
- There might be many other reasons.
- And there might be none at all.

239
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,333
Look at this pathetic little worm,

240
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,897
lulling the ache of his conscience
with spiritual aspirin.

241
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:57,571
I can't think of anything more practical
than removing that particular ache.

242
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,342
I can. Removing the conscience.

243
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,474
And you have none, Hessler.

244
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,919
How do you know my name?
I've never seen you before.

245
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,117
That doesn't mean
I've never seen you before.

246
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:13,161
And to look at him
is to look at the devil's spawn, señor.

247
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:17,255
Then pray for me, Telez.
And pray for my father, the devil, too.

248
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,425
You'll burn in hell where you belong.

249
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:23,369
You'll burn for the evil that you've done,
for the lives you've taken.

250
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:27,397
He has poisoned women for their money.
He deserved the guillotine.

251
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,604
Though I had wretched wives,
I had an excellent lawyer.

252
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,513
You were never meant for the scaffold,
Hessler, nor for a jail.

253
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,483
Did you hear that, Telez?
I am to be immortal.

254
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:43,422
That is, if your friend here
knows what he's talking about.

255
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,289
He's not my friend.

256
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,824
Perhaps he's yours. Perhaps he's the devil.

257
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:57,497
Poor Telez. I pity him.

258
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,840
Pity? I don't understand you.

259
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,367
Never having received any pity
or pitied anyone, let me plead ignorance.

260
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:07,745
- I don't know what it is.
- Have you no feelings at all?

261
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:11,582
For these men?
How can one feel kinship with the dead?

262
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:16,283
Look at them. Rotting in their graves.
Waiting for their bodies to die.

263
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,586
Perhaps before that happens,
they'll get out of their graves.

264
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,061
Not these.

265
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:26,998
They've dug them too narrow
and too deep. They can never climb out.

266
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,100
- Too weak, perhaps?
- To be weak is to be dead.

267
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:33,733
- Then to be strong is to live.
- Hasrt it always been so?

268
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,437
It seems to me the mighty have fallen
from time to time.

269
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:47,046
We must talk again, monsieur.
You have a brain. That makes two of us.

270
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,122
Hi, Superman.
How's the poison holding out?

271
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,930
Always a little left for friends, Verne.

272
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,871
But he can't take that bunk.

273
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,108
Pardon me, but this bunk
belongs to someone else.

274
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:17,173
That so?

275
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,585
But you don't understand.
This bunk belongs to Moll.

276
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:22,755
Moll, huh?

277
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:27,656
And right here in the same dormitory.
That's going to be cozy.

278
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:30,694
What does that rat mean
by taking my bunk?

279
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,199
But he's always had this bunk.

280
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,168
Then he might've known
I'd be around for it.

281
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,103
Friend of his?

282
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:42,067
- Why, yes, we're friends. Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

283
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:45,979
Because he's a maggot, see.
Tell him that I said so.

284
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:48,709
Tell him that Verne says
he's a flatheaded maggot.

285
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,376
Go on, tell him.

286
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:55,289
Moll. Nice hero for the kid, ain't he?
A gorilla.

287
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,484
Looks from here
as if you couldn't use any part of him.

288
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,494
No, nor any of his friends
or monkey ancestors.

289
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:03,258
- Maybe you're a pal of his?
- Maybe.

290
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:06,459
Well, then stand up and cut loose,
and I'll pick it up from there.

291
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,867
And what could either of us win?

292
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,963
Oh, you're one of those guys
that play it safe, huh?

293
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,099
Safe, or maybe smart.

294
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,303
- You been here long? Do I know you?
- I've been around.

295
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,873
- Maybe we just never made connections.
- Maybe that's it.

296
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,143
What's that book you got there?
Let's see it.

297
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,947
The Bible?
Forget it, pal, you're wasting your time.

298
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,425
So? Maybe you've read it.

299
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,089
Read it? I know this book backwards.
Before I came here I laid in solitary

300
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,156
for six months at Saint Miguel's.
There was one in my cage.

301
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,895
Well, I didn't have nothing else to do,
I had to read it.

302
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,960
- Well?
- It don't make sense.

303
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,701
Here, this one
will start you talking to yourself. Listen.

304
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:51,443
"So God created man in his own image."

305
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,107
How do you like that?
Now take a look at me.

306
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,945
Do I look like a god to you?

307
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,611
This forsaken place is full of gods,
I suppose.

308
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,177
Only they're not working at it right now.

309
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,780
They're gods on a holiday.
Answer that one.

310
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:05,392
It sounds simple enough. I think it means

311
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,361
that each man has some of the qualities
of God inside him,

312
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,796
if he wants them,
and if he looks for them.

313
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,424
There's a couple here
won'th looking for, too.

314
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,298
You remember that one
about the Red Sea?

315
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,463
The waters parted
and they crossed on dry land?

316
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,939
Maybe I'll try it someday
on that jungle out there.

317
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,999
I'll just wave my hand,
and there'll be a path,

318
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,443
and I'll cross over to the mainland.

319
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,413
And if the path ain't there, I'll make one.

320
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,939
- You'll make what?
- Hello, Moll.

321
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,578
Get your filthy carcass off my bunk.

322
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,181
Sure, Moll. Where'll you have it?

323
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,056
Moll. We don't want trouble now.

324
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:43,223
- I'll murder the bleeding...
- They'll throw you in solitary, Moll.

325
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:46,559
Yeah, you're right, kid.

326
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,064
I'll move down to the other end
where the air's better.

327
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,510
You can have the bunk, Verne.

328
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,911
You'll need it,
kicking off the rest of them years.

329
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:09,355
That's not like Moll to back down
that way. He's not yellow.

330
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,861
- There's something in the wind.
- Maybe there is, Verne,

331
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,954
but maybe it isn't blowing your way.

332
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:22,099
Verne.

333
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,638
- Hello, Flaubert.
- You've got to help me, Verne.

334
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:27,800
Sure. What do you want me to do,
comb a couple of ghosts out of your hair?

335
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,868
Here's another one of your gods, pal,
only this one's haunted.

336
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,379
He thinks the people he's killed
are chasing him,

337
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,415
and the ones he hasn't killed
are going to kill him.

338
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:35,813
He gets it coming and going.

339
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:38,512
- Perhaps if he knew he had one friend.
- But I haven't, monsieur.

340
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:41,715
Not one, not one in the world.
Except you, Verne.

341
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,918
- I'm not your friend.
- But you've got to help me.

342
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:49,122
Moll is planning to escape.
He's taking six men with him.

343
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,288
- Yeah?
- He took my money.

344
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,231
A thousand francs
for my share of the expenses,

345
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,361
and I know he's going to leave me behind.
I'll get all the blame.

346
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:58,599
They'll beat me. They'll put me in solitary.

347
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:01,642
Please, you've got to get my money back
before it's too late.

348
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,201
Then I can tell Grideau that I'm innocent.

349
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,543
You know that he's against me,
he's got a grudge against me.

350
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,674
So has Moll.
Why do they pick on me all the time?

351
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,775
Why do they make me so miserable?

352
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:13,116
You're against me, too.
You're all against me.

353
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,782
How about it, Moll?
You're making a break, am I in?

354
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,916
You blasted loon.

355
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,928
- Give me my money, I'm afraid to go.
- Shut up, you weak swine.

356
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,092
- Am I in, Moll?
- Sure, you're in nothing.

357
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,132
If you think I've spent three years
figuring a way to kick out of this joint

358
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:31,069
for your benefit, think again.

359
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,801
You better start thinking, Moll,
or else I'm going to slug you.

360
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:37,174
And if I do,
they'll slap us into solitary together.

361
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,707
And how will you
get out then, sweetheart?

362
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:41,612
- You can't make it, Verne.
- Why not?

363
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,345
HESSLER: You'd have to put up money
like the rest of us. A thousand francs.

364
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,284
- I'll get it.
- Where?

365
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,046
There's a lot of men bunking in this room.

366
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,216
Maybe some of them
will lend me the money.

367
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,123
I'll lend it to you, Verne.

368
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:56,392
A thousand for Verne and a thousand
for me. I'll go along, too, if you don't mind.

369
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:58,557
- Who are you?
- My name's Cambreau.

370
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,601
I never heard of you.

371
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:04,366
You heard of 2,000 francs, didn't you?
He's got them.

372
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,867
All right, if you're in, listen.

373
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:12,012
Tomorrow they march us out
to work on the road.

374
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,049
When we get there,
I put this money in a certain place,

375
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:17,107
and a certain bloke'll come and get it.

376
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:19,050
It's to pay for a boat
that'll be hid along the beach,

377
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,419
- about three days through the jungle.
- How about maps?

378
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,261
Give the mining camp a wide berth.

379
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:30,321
They're always on the lookout
and they'll do you dirt.

380
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,491
The Indian village is worse.

381
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,798
They'll turn you in for 10 francs kicking
or five francs cold.

382
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,601
They don't like to take a chance
so they cash in for five.

383
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:44,502
That's the cat country. Keep a fire
burning at night and lie up close to it.

384
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,306
From here on,
look out for crocs and snakes.

385
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,286
And don't drink no water
while you're in the fever belt.

386
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:55,551
- You can't mistake it for the stink of it.
- How many maps you got? Give me one.

387
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:59,252
There are only two.
The kid has one and I'm keeping this.

388
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:03,019
He takes one mob with him
and you go along with me.

389
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,224
HESSLER: Look out, the guards.

390
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:15,333
But I've less than 12 hours.
Just lend me enough to get on the boat.

391
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,402
If I lent money to every girl
who was ordered out of the colony,

392
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,881
where would I be?
Out of business, cherie, believe me...

393
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,512
- Please, Renard. I promise you, I...
- There's nothing to worry about Julie.

394
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,682
It so happens that I'm making
a little trip myself to the mainland,

395
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,128
and it is as easy to arrange passage
for two as for one.

396
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:38,825
You'd like to buy in that way,
wouldn't you, Monsieur Pig.

397
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:45,468
Julie, if you only knew me better,
I'm not such a bad fellow.

398
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,204
Look. Look, Julie we'll go to the mainland,
and then when we get there,

399
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,112
and if you still don't think better of me,
then you may do as you please.

400
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:56,946
I'll do as I please right now.
And that doesn't include you.

401
00:28:57,018 --> 00:29:00,010
Can't you get that straight?
Remember this, Pig.

402
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:03,524
You're the one man in the world
I could never get low enough to touch.

403
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:06,958
- Now get out of here and leave me alone.
- MARFEU: Bravo, Julie.

404
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:17,068
I won't hurry, Julie, because, it looks like
you may have to adjust your standards.

405
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:18,730
Why will she, Monsieur Pig?

406
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:22,368
Oh, you have a better proposition,
Monsieur Marfeu?

407
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:24,969
Julie can return to the mining camp
with me,

408
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:29,449
and I'll have a couple of Indians
take her up the coast in a small boat.

409
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,517
And she'll owe me nothing.

410
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,817
And you believe that, Julie?

411
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:36,356
No, of course not.

412
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:38,491
Then if you go with him, you're a fool.

413
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,028
And if I go with you, what am I?

414
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:46,097
- When do we leave, Marfeu?
- In the morning.

415
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:30,936
You didn't see that, do you hear?
Unless you want me to give it to you, too.

416
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,946
Only one man can run a thing like this.

417
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,812
This is my show
and I'm running it my way.

418
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,236
Anybody know anything about this?

419
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,364
Of course not.

420
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,568
- Take him to the hospital.
- Right.

421
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,578
All right, hut.

422
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:29,694
Watch yourselves.

423
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:36,671
Come on.

424
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:37,766
The road gang just made a break.
Moll and a couple of guys got away.

425
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,738
Okay, Moll.
Only one of these days comes the payoff.

426
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,758
Yes, my dear brethren,
the day of salvation is at hand.

427
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,601
All right, back to your places.
All right, settle down there. And no talk.

428
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,843
He'll head for the mainland.

429
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,414
When he gets there, if he does,
I'll be waiting for him to bring him back.

430
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,546
We'll go this way, Moll.

431
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:19,299
Here, when Benet comes back,
we'll follow this trail to the beach.

432
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,165
He'll never come back. They'll kill him.

433
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:26,334
Moll warned us
to keep clear of that Indian village.

434
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:29,240
What have we got to lose?
If Benet gets back we eat.

435
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,143
They've got him, I tell you,
and they'll get us.

436
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,206
- We'll never get out of this alive.
- Maybe you won't, but I will.

437
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:38,946
Why you and not us?

438
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,753
Because I've prayed and I will be saved.

439
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:46,520
You might have prayed for me, too.

440
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:50,655
It's not his god he's counting on,
it's the food he has hidden.

441
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,895
And what if I have?
It's all mine, do you hear? It's mine.

442
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,109
Did you pray for that, Telez,
or did you steal it?

443
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,804
It makes no difference. It's God's will.

444
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:08,204
Benet.

445
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,147
- They got him.
- Quick.

446
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:37,764
- Where are you going?
- After food.

447
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,740
Didrt we decide not to take a chance
on that mining camp?

448
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,037
You decided that.

449
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,136
Well, who's running this, me or you?
Do you want to get caught?

450
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,272
No, but we'll need food.

451
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,681
Without it,
we couldn't all reach the boat alive.

452
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:54,278
What of it?
The best of us'll get through, won't they?

453
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,324
And that's us. All of us
aren't going to get through anyway.

454
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:58,688
You know that, don't you?

455
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,523
You picked the men who were to go
with you very carefully, Moll.

456
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:04,826
Sure I did. Do you know why?

457
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,367
Because we'll be at least
10 days in that boat,

458
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:11,667
and there are rations enough for six men.
Figure it out for yourself.

459
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:15,008
I've already figured it out, Moll.

460
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:18,807
And we'd better be careful
with those rations. I'll be back.

461
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,184
He's asking for trouble.

462
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:31,622
What with them murdering Indians
and jungle animals, he ain't got an earthly.

463
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:35,594
He'll be back. I'll bet on it.
Because he said he would.

464
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,597
Because he says something,
does that make it so?

465
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,724
It has so far.

466
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,394
He said we'd reach that mining camp
this afternoon, and we did.

467
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,199
According to the map,
we should have reached it.

468
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,297
Three times we were lost,
and each time he led us back to the trail.

469
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,603
He stumbled on it.

470
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:51,440
And when our tongues
were hanging out from thirst,

471
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:55,505
he stepped off the trail and found a brook.
What was that, Moll?

472
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,551
So he had a lucky day.

473
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,047
- Who is Cambreau?
- How do I know?

474
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:06,118
Oh, he's just another prison mug
like you and me.

475
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,759
Of course he is. He's got to be.

476
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:19,297
This jungle heat
does crazy things to your mind.

477
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,373
Rain again.

478
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,894
You're not leaving us, are you, Julie?

479
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:56,366
Now, is that nice? Havert I been
pretty decent about everything?

480
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:01,347
- Gave you a first class home, didn't I?
- Yeah, you're grand people.

481
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:04,778
You brought me here as a favor
to help me on my way to the mainland.

482
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:07,082
And it wasrt going to cost me a thing.

483
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,714
- Oh, now, Julie.
- Let me by.

484
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:15,862
So you think you're checking out, eh?
Well, what have I got to say about it?

485
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,195
- Go on, tell me. What?
- Put that down, you little...

486
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,699
CAMBREAU: Julie. Not that way, Julie.

487
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:37,542
The voice came from here. I heard it.

488
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:41,277
The sack of food's gone.

489
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:46,750
He paid for it, too, whoever it was.

490
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,467
Five hundred francs
would take you to the mainland.

491
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:58,397
But we can't have any of that, can we?

492
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:45,243
Look at him sleep.
He's got his belly full of food.

493
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:52,420
You're young and quick.
Look. There'd be only one blow.

494
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:54,418
He'd never know.

495
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,599
- Go on.
- I can't. I don't know how to kill.

496
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:43,406
Come on, let's get out of here.

497
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,409
Marfeu, maybe I've been a bad loser.

498
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:21,505
I've fought as hard as I could
and it got me nothing.

499
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:24,847
I don't know what I expected.
Maybe what I got.

500
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:29,689
- Maybe I figured you wrong from the start.
- You made a mistake.

501
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:31,647
We can assume it was not your first.

502
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:34,660
Look, I've been here now
for, well, for a while.

503
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,992
Shouldrt that be enough?
Give me a chance, Marfeu.

504
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:38,088
Let me go, will you?

505
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:40,827
There should be violins playing
when you talk that way, Julie.

506
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:42,968
You've got the money
that was left for the food.

507
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,198
It's enough to get me to the mainland.

508
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:48,571
I'll pay it back. I promise, every sou,
as soon as I can get it. I swear.

509
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:51,372
Yeah? And what do I win?

510
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:56,073
Why do you think I pulled you out
of a mess back there,

511
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,779
and brought you here?
To send you away in a golden carriage?

512
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:03,755
You're not going anyplace.
You're staying here until I throw you out.

513
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:07,316
Can you understand that?

514
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:08,951
Don't move, or I'll brain you.

515
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:12,192
I want grub and I want it quick.
Get over there.

516
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:18,435
Hello, baby.
Caught up with you like I said, didn't I?

517
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:21,406
So we'll pick up where we left off,
only first I'll have something to eat.

518
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:23,841
- Get it out here.
- Lf you want any food, get it yourself.

519
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:30,180
Open them cans. Hug that bed, you.
One funny move and I'll crack your leg.

520
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:32,314
Dump it in there.

521
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,682
Sit over there where I can watch you.

522
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,707
Garbage. But good enough
for a man when he's starving.

523
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,603
- So you'll do, too, baby.
- Thanks.

524
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:03,281
This is no time to be particular.

525
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:07,586
Funny a man should want something
he's got no use for,

526
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:09,588
and I got no use for you.
You know that, don't you?

527
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:11,180
And how much do you think I think of you?

528
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:12,691
How much?

529
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,729
So much that if you ever made
the mistake of turning your back on me,

530
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,356
- I'd...
- You'd run a knife into it?

531
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,730
You ain't got
that kind of stuff, sweetheart.

532
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,429
There they are, but you won't use them.

533
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:26,632
It takes something to gamble that way,
something a cheap dame hasn't got.

534
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:27,696
And you're cheap.

535
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:29,834
If you'd have waited back there,
and run the scissors into me

536
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,969
when I wasrt looking,
I'd have loved you for it,

537
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:36,607
but you sneaked out for the law.
That's what a cheap dame would do.

538
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:41,480
So tomorrow the Indians can have you.

539
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:57,832
Do I say thanks, baby,
or were you just waving at something?

540
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:01,036
Don't thank me. I didn't give you a thing.

541
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:04,373
All I want is to get out of here
and you happened to be going my way,

542
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,310
so I played you.

543
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,814
But the minute I find somebody
going faster than you, I'll...

544
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:10,850
You won't. Come on.

545
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:20,890
- What are you after?
- Something somebody left for me.

546
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,629
Never mind that. Come on.

547
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:55,214
"Behold, thou art fair, my love,
behold, thou art fair.

548
00:48:55,282 --> 00:48:58,046
"Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil.

549
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:03,016
"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet
and thy mouth is comely.

550
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:07,092
"Thy temples are like a piece of
pomegranate, behind thy veil.

551
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,722
"Thou art all fair, my love,
and there is no spot in thee."

552
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,600
How do you like that, baby?
Great stuff, huh?

553
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:19,402
I guess nobody ever said anything
like that to you before, did they?

554
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:22,670
Does that put me out in front or not?

555
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:27,578
Listen. "Thou hast ravished my heart,
my sister, my bride.

556
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:31,113
"Thou hast ravished my heart
with one of thine eyes.

557
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:34,415
"How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride.

558
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:37,218
"How much better is thy love than wine,

559
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,987
"and the smell of thine ointments
than all manner of spices.

560
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:44,163
"Thy lips, O my bride,
drop as the honeycomb.

561
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,055
"Honey and milk are under thy tongue

562
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:50,900
"and the smell of thy garments
is like the smell of Lebanon."

563
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,321
That's saltwater, Moll.
You can't drink it. You'll go mad.

564
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:49,485
Saltwater? It's this heat.

565
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,568
Where's the boat?
There's water in the boat and food.

566
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,536
- Where is it?
- Around that point of land.

567
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:00,732
I'll find it. You stay here.

568
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:10,316
We made it. The swine.
Thought they could lock me up forever.

569
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,080
CAMBREAU: Moll.

570
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:27,693
- Hello, kid. How are you?
- Cambreau gave us food and water.

571
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,797
- We'll be all right.
- Sure you will be. Where are the others?

572
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,940
Dunning was shot
as we were leaving the island.

573
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,569
At the Indian village,
Benet went after food. They got him.

574
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:43,842
What about Telez? Huh?
What about Telez?

575
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:46,545
He didn't have the strength.

576
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:50,855
There was nothing we could do.
He just died.

577
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:54,383
It's true, Moll, we tried to save him.
I swear it.

578
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:58,557
Who cares? So he died.
One less to go in the boat.

579
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:02,227
Five of us.
And more than enough room for seven.

580
00:52:03,136 --> 00:52:04,296
It's too bad Verne was hurt.

581
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,831
Maybe it's healthier where he is.
Maybe he wouldn't fit in my plans.

582
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:11,707
CAMBREAU:
Plans often have to be changed, Moll.

583
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:16,408
You're such a pessimist, Cambreau.
Has nothing ever turned out well for you?

584
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:18,110
Quite the contrary, Hessler.

585
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:21,552
Many things have happened
just as I planned them.

586
00:52:58,825 --> 00:53:00,053
Telez!

587
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,591
I'll kill them. They stole my crucifix.

588
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:06,461
A healthy-looking ghost, Monsieur Dufond.

589
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:12,633
He had food, he wouldn't give us any.
It was our lives or his.

590
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:14,807
What would you have done, Moll?
We were starving.

591
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,207
I'd have done the thing up right
and finished him.

592
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,644
They took my bread and my cross.
They left me to die.

593
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:25,484
Easy, you're hurt.
Let's have a look at that leg.

594
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:29,750
Dufond, tear away the trouser.
He's been bitten by a snake.

595
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:33,418
- Let us help you, Telez.
- No, not you. Don't you touch me.

596
00:53:33,827 --> 00:53:38,264
Don't let him touch me. He's the devil.
He's the devil, I tell you.

597
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,162
Do you suppose that's the answer, Moll?

598
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:49,199
Interesting idea there, anyway.
Cambreau, the devil.

599
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:53,969
This swelling will have
to be lanced, Cambreau.

600
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:58,950
- You seem to know what you're doing.
- I was a medical student, a lifetime ago.

601
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:00,350
Let's have your knife, Flaubert.

602
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,479
- I haven't got a knife.
- Moll, get his knife.

603
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:07,760
Moll, I...

604
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:28,906
Easy.

605
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,279
- It won't drain unless someone...
- Well?

606
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:41,989
I can't do it. My lips are chapped.
I'll get the poison in my system.

607
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:45,691
Then again, you might not.
The point is, it has to be done.

608
00:54:58,178 --> 00:55:00,476
I hope that'll help you, Telez.

609
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:18,196
That was a pretty gesture.

610
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:21,597
But lancing that wound
and drawing out the venom won't help.

611
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:24,000
- He'll be dead at dawn.
- Could we let him die believing

612
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,061
that none of us cared
whether he lived or not?

613
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:30,200
Why not? It's the truth, isn't it?
Why should he die believing a lie?

614
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:34,713
Maybe he won't. Maybe Telez
will know the truth when it's time.

615
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:42,720
Where are all the others?

616
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:46,281
They're getting the sloop.
They won't sail without me.

617
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:51,558
How little you know men.
How evil they are. Only God is good.

618
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,622
But the good in man is God, Telez.

619
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,158
Only God is good. Only God can forgive.

620
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:04,074
They stole my crucifix, Cambreau.
Without it, I'm lost. I'm afraid.

621
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:08,270
A crucifix is a piece of wood, Telez,
only a piece of wood.

622
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:11,044
The miracle is not in the wood,
but in the heart.

623
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:15,019
- But I've prayed, I've prayed.
- And your prayers were only words.

624
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:18,057
Like your crucifix,
they found no way to your heart.

625
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,616
Telez, the bread stood
between them and your heart.

626
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:25,596
But it wasrt enough.
I had to look out for myself.

627
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:29,567
And will you look out for yourself,
then, through all eternity?

628
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:40,135
- I know, God has forsaken me.
- You have forsaken him.

629
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:45,945
I'll die in darkness and be cursed.
I'll never find peace or forgiveness.

630
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:49,455
Cambreau, help me, help me to find God.

631
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:52,855
Then look for him, Telez.
Search your heart.

632
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,631
You drew the poison
from my body into your own.

633
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:09,701
I had bread and I would not share it.

634
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,570
"Or what man is there of you,

635
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:16,945
"whom, if his son ask bread,
will he give him a stone?"

636
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,015
It's not too late?

637
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:24,918
It's never too late.

638
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:34,131
A moment ago,
there was so much darkness. I was afraid.

639
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:39,929
It's lighter now. My fear is gone.

640
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:46,004
You brought me peace, Cambreau,
and rest.

641
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:52,950
And if, some time,
things are said against me,

642
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,919
you'll speak for me?

643
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,683
I'll speak for you, Telez.

644
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:44,497
What makes you think he'll like it better
under a lot of dirt

645
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,436
than in the belly of a shark?

646
00:58:46,506 --> 00:58:49,600
Well, maybe he rates a grave at that.
He paid for it.

647
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:53,442
- Here, here's your end.
- I'm afraid I can't use it, Verne.

648
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:58,006
Oh, so I'm a swine for robbing the dead?

649
00:58:58,084 --> 00:59:00,450
Maybe if I'd crack through with enough
for a boat to take us to the mainland

650
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,080
you wouldn't come along.

651
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:08,389
Here, here's your book of rules. Maybe
you can talk him into a set of wings.

652
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,553
I can try.

653
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,861
"Know ye not
that ye are the temple of God,

654
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:17,801
"and that the spirit of God
dwelleth in you?

655
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:22,534
"If any man defile the temple of God,
him shall God destroy

656
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:27,736
"for the temple of God is holy,
which temple ye are."

657
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,076
That's nice music,
only what does it mean?

658
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,881
You heard what he said, didn't you,
about the temple of God?

659
00:59:34,954 --> 00:59:38,788
You know who he's talking about,
don't you? About me.

660
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:42,225
All right, you don't have to believe it
if you don't want to, but I'm telling you.

661
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:46,026
Whenever you want, what's the word,
Cambreau, sanctuary.

662
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:49,967
Whenever you want sanctuary, babe,
here's where you'll find it.

663
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:51,367
Right here in the old temple.

664
00:59:51,437 --> 00:59:53,496
Don't tap your heart,
you'll break your finger.

665
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:57,134
And if you're sanctuary,
I'll take whatever else is lying around.

666
00:59:57,877 --> 01:00:02,712
Yeah? Well, you better get ready
to take it, babe, because here it comes.

667
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:21,823
So, Verne made it, did he?

668
01:00:24,504 --> 01:00:27,166
Give me that knife of yours, Flaubert.

669
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,008
And he brought a woman
along with him, too.

670
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:35,104
Now ain't that thoughtful?

671
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,551
Hello, Verne. You made it through, huh?

672
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:44,419
I'd have been here sooner if a shoe
hadrt slipped out of somebody's hand

673
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:45,718
and landed on my head.

674
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:50,351
You ought to fire your valet
for being so careless.

675
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,888
I see you brought a friend
along with you, too.

676
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:56,491
Always room for one more in the boat.

677
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,163
And if there isn't,
you can always stay behind.

678
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,969
We'll cut up our rations with you,
and our water. What do you say?

679
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:07,672
- Big-hearted, ain't you, Moll?
- Why not? We're all together, aren't we?

680
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,511
Everything is share
and share alike with us.

681
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,574
With all of us, ain't it, with everything?

682
01:01:12,652 --> 01:01:15,621
Sure it is, with everything
that's yours and not mine.

683
01:01:15,688 --> 01:01:18,851
Do you get that, Moll?
And do you get it, you mugs?

684
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,019
Take a good look, because
that's all any of you are going to get.

685
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,255
Anybody got any other ideas?

686
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:25,627
- I have some.
- Wait a minute.

687
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:28,462
Let's have your knife, Flaubert.
Where is it?

688
01:01:28,534 --> 01:01:31,799
I gave it to Moll.

689
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:33,771
Nothing like a little edge,
huh, sweetheart?

690
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,174
I don't need any with you, Verne.
I forgot I had it.

691
01:02:43,543 --> 01:02:45,636
Throw him in the boat
and let's get out of here.

692
01:02:45,711 --> 01:02:46,973
From now on, I'm in charge.

693
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:28,284
- Looking for something, Moll?
- Yeah, something I lost.

694
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,516
- Where'd you lose it?
- On the beach.

695
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:35,152
Somebody got lucky with a punch.

696
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:40,131
Well, maybe someday you'll get lucky, too.
When you stop leading with your chin.

697
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:45,062
How do you like being
the only woman in the world, Julie?

698
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:49,200
Well, I don't take
these shipboard romances seriously.

699
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:53,473
- Still it has its advantages.
- And perhaps its disadvantages, too.

700
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,307
We might decide we don't want
any women in this particular world.

701
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:03,616
And you're just the baby to take care
of that, aren't you, Hessler?

702
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:05,850
But then I figure I'm safe.

703
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,861
You always married your women
before you poisoned them, isn't that so?

704
01:04:10,329 --> 01:04:13,264
And I don't think the captain
would marry us.

705
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,697
Or why don't you start
reading out of that book,

706
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,832
and I'll jump off the boat.

707
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:27,102
Don't give me any of that "sister, come
to salvation" look. I'm not buying any.

708
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:30,080
I know the routine.
It starts out with a prayer,

709
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:33,016
and ends up with a Bible in one hand
and me in the other.

710
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,416
Hey, baby.

711
01:04:34,487 --> 01:04:37,752
Stop messing around with the crew
and get back here.

712
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:47,594
You belong at the captairs table,
don't ever forget that.

713
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,169
- What was that for, baby?
- For fun, that's what.

714
01:04:57,243 --> 01:05:02,476
So we're playing games, are we?
Okay. What'll we play, sweethearts?

715
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:05,346
Why not? It's a game
we're good at anyway.

716
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:09,614
Then get one up here fast.

717
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,153
Again.

718
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:20,759
Again?

719
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:29,505
Very pretty.
So sweet, so touching and sickening.

720
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:32,407
What good can ever come
from a man like that?

721
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:34,002
Or a woman like that?

722
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,880
I've heard of it happening before.
Why can't it happen again?

723
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:43,786
We ought to make the mainland in
a couple of days, kid, if the wind holds out.

724
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,654
- And what then?
- That's what I was wondering.

725
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:50,184
I thought maybe you and me
might string along together.

726
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:51,889
You wouldn't want me around, Moll.

727
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:55,365
I'd just get in your way.
I'm not a good thief.

728
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:57,425
Not that I have the conscience,

729
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,199
it just is I haven't got
what it takes to make a man steal.

730
01:06:00,272 --> 01:06:02,069
Oh, but you wouldn't have to.

731
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:04,939
You see, I've always dodged around alone,
because I figured

732
01:06:05,011 --> 01:06:08,674
a guy shaves a percentage against himself
if he plays it alone.

733
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:11,979
But I've gotten to like you
quite a bit, kid, you know?

734
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,919
Like a guy does his kid brother.
How does that strike you?

735
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:19,355
Well, why shouldn't I like you, Moll?
You have everything I haven't got.

736
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:22,883
Courage, for one thing.
And you've been decent to me.

737
01:06:22,962 --> 01:06:25,760
I'd never have made it alone
if it hadrt been for you.

738
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:28,698
And I'll see you through from here on in.

739
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,465
We'll travel far and we'll travel fast.
Does that make it a deal?

740
01:06:32,538 --> 01:06:36,440
- Who's your pal, kid?
- You are, Moll.

741
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:40,536
Right. Let's have some more
of that song you were singing, huh?

742
01:06:43,182 --> 01:06:47,141
Over the far horizon

743
01:06:48,054 --> 01:06:51,512
Riding the tides of night

744
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:57,227
Perhaps we should all sing.
But what have we got to sing about?

745
01:06:58,397 --> 01:07:01,127
Well, we're alive and the past is behind us.

746
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,966
And there's always a chance
of something better up ahead,

747
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:06,766
if the wind holds out.

748
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,404
Dreaming the whole night through

749
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:17,372
Hoping you'll shine on some...

750
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:30,427
One two, three, four, five.

751
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:33,362
Five days.

752
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:36,359
We'll die here. All of us.

753
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:41,273
Moll. I've got to have water.

754
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,773
Now hold onto yourself, kid.

755
01:07:42,842 --> 01:07:45,572
If you drink yours now,
you'll be thirsty by night.

756
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:48,169
The surll dry it out of you
just as fast as you pour it in.

757
01:07:48,247 --> 01:07:50,841
But it's so hot, it's so hot.

758
01:07:52,251 --> 01:07:54,310
Why doesn't the wind come?

759
01:07:55,855 --> 01:07:58,915
Cambreau, why doesn't the wind come?

760
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:04,258
The wind should come soon.
But before it comes, some of us may die.

761
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:08,599
Did you hear what he said, Verne?
Before the wind comes...

762
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:12,660
That's what he says, and I say he's wrong.
I know as much about it as he does.

763
01:08:12,738 --> 01:08:15,468
But he knew when the wind was dying.

764
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:19,807
He told us to be careful of the water
because there'd be days of calm.

765
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,509
- He does know, Verne.
- All right, he knows.

766
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:28,781
Any minute now, he'll pull a fast one out
of that little book of his and it'll rain milk.

767
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,822
Come on, Cambreau, go into your miracle.

768
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,485
Don't be a fool, Verne.
I'm no more religious than you are,

769
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,620
but does this look like a good time
for blasphemy?

770
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:41,291
That's not what you'd call
good politics, my friend.

771
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,835
How do you figure
some of us will die, Cambreau?

772
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,929
Possibly because
there's no sign of any wind yet,

773
01:08:47,006 --> 01:08:48,166
and if the wind doesn't come,

774
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,970
it becomes a matter of endurance,
doesn't it?

775
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:54,570
And some of us may not have
the strength to pull through.

776
01:08:56,615 --> 01:08:59,914
It's simple enough
when you reason it out, isn't it?

777
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:10,360
I'm sorry to disappoint all you big,
strong gorillas, but I feel fine.

778
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,465
You're the second best man
in the boat, baby.

779
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:19,270
I can't stand it any longer.
Moll, I've got to have water.

780
01:09:19,338 --> 01:09:21,568
- All right, kid.
- No, you can't have it.

781
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,198
- Get away from that keg.
- You can't give him any.

782
01:09:23,275 --> 01:09:25,243
- What about the rest of us?
- He can have my share, can't he?

783
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:27,370
Get away from that keg, Flaubert.
Get back where you were, Moll.

784
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:29,971
Get away from that keg
or I'll pitch you out of the boat.

785
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,642
Now.

786
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,744
- Let's see you get it now.
- You fool.

787
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:46,420
- Well, that's the end of the water.
- And the end of hope.

788
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:49,498
You're thinking it's my fault.
Why don't you say so?

789
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:52,560
Shut up. It's done and that's that.

790
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:59,033
Well, why doesn't somebody
do something about getting it back?

791
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,305
Sharks.

792
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,749
- Arert you going to do anything to me?
- Why should we?

793
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:07,615
But I threw away your water
and you'll die.

794
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:11,281
You'll die with us if we do.
We know that's not what you wanted.

795
01:10:11,357 --> 01:10:16,260
No. I thought they were trying
to take something away from me,

796
01:10:18,397 --> 01:10:20,126
but they werert, were they?

797
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:24,693
All these years, I've been afraid
of things that didn't exist.

798
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:30,067
I looked for enemies
where I might have found friends.

799
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:34,476
I tried to escape a life
that I might have been forgiven for.

800
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,144
Flaubert!

801
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,019
No, let him go, kid.

802
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:49,452
Moll thinks I'm afraid, but I'm not.

803
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,763
You know I'm not afraid,
don't you, Cambreau?

804
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,731
You're not afraid, Dufond.

805
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,331
Verne.

806
01:11:05,945 --> 01:11:07,105
Come back here.

807
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:14,548
- Come back here.
- Let me go.

808
01:11:20,259 --> 01:11:23,194
I didn't mean to hurt you, kid,
but it would have been suicide.

809
01:11:23,262 --> 01:11:26,754
- You wanted to save him, didn't you, Moll?
- Sure, that's all.

810
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:30,232
- He'll be all right in a jiffy.
- I'm afraid not, Moll.

811
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:35,236
- Why? What do you mean?
- He's dead.

812
01:11:47,286 --> 01:11:51,222
But he can't be. Why? Why should he be?

813
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,718
Kid.

814
01:12:03,202 --> 01:12:04,794
That's two dead.

815
01:12:07,806 --> 01:12:11,105
Don't let me be afraid, Verne.
Do you hear? Don't let me be afraid.

816
01:12:11,176 --> 01:12:13,838
Why should you be? Men die every day.

817
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:17,479
Hessler, come to life and haul in that keg.

818
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:42,766
The surs going down, Verne.

819
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:46,040
What about the water?

820
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:50,107
All right, Cambreau,
dish out what we got coming to us.

821
01:12:50,182 --> 01:12:52,844
The barrel might have leaked.
There may be saltwater in it.

822
01:12:52,918 --> 01:12:54,909
Well, give it here, then.
I'll take a swig of it.

823
01:12:54,987 --> 01:12:59,014
We'd better draw lots for that, Verne.
If you took one swallow of saltwater,

824
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:01,821
your thirst would increase
thousands of times over.

825
01:13:01,894 --> 01:13:04,328
And that would mean... Tell him, Hessler.

826
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:10,799
The tongue swells
until it protrudes from the mouth.

827
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:13,565
Not a very pleasant way to die.

828
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,630
Well, why swallow the water?
Why not taste it?

829
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:18,267
Our palates are in no condition
to taste anything, Verne.

830
01:13:18,343 --> 01:13:21,141
You couldn't tell freshwater
from salt until it was down.

831
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:24,410
That makes it one mars game.
How do we draw lots?

832
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:33,523
Here, here are four strips.

833
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:37,953
The one who draws
the longest drinks the water.

834
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,531
Why four strips
when I count five of us in the boat?

835
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,091
There are only four men, Julie.

836
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:48,230
But all five of us drink, don't we?
I don't want any free rides.

837
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,181
Here, add that to your collection.

838
01:14:07,392 --> 01:14:09,019
Take your choice.

839
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:34,945
Well, it leaves you and me, huh, baby?

840
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:38,715
And one of them is the long one, ain't it?

841
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:42,692
You're out of luck, Verne,
I always get the short end of the deal.

842
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:47,755
Here, in case I lose, this will get you
to Marseille. Give my regards to the girls.

843
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:53,265
So, a mars tongue swells
until it chokes him to death.

844
01:14:53,338 --> 01:14:56,671
- How does that sound to you, Moll?
- What are you waiting for?

845
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,974
- You aren't afraid, are you?
- Maybe I am. A man don't like to die.

846
01:15:03,048 --> 01:15:04,481
You don't want to die either,
do you baby?

847
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,812
Take one.

848
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:12,112
- All right, Moll, take the tiller.
- Wait a minute sweetheart, sit still.

849
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:14,591
You don't think we'd ask you
to get your own, do you?

850
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,720
Sit right where you are, I'll fetch it for you.

851
01:15:37,216 --> 01:15:41,812
A little cup of water.
Maybe it's good and maybe it's bad.

852
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:45,220
Up until now you've been pretty lucky,
what with one thing and another.

853
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,623
- How lucky do you feel now, Verne?
- Give it here.

854
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:52,323
What's your hurry?
Can't wait to feel it running down, huh?

855
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:57,258
Maybe it'll be nice and cool,
and maybe, if it's salty,

856
01:15:57,336 --> 01:16:01,602
it'll sting and burn,
and then you'll sit there staring,

857
01:16:01,673 --> 01:16:04,437
waiting for the old man
with the long whiskers.

858
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:07,842
You know about the old man
with the long whiskers, don't you, Verne?

859
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:10,848
He's been right here on this boat with us
all the time.

860
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:13,612
He got Flaubert and he took the kid.

861
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:20,290
Maybe he could have waited a little while
about the kid, though,

862
01:16:21,593 --> 01:16:24,391
but I guess it's all right.

863
01:16:24,463 --> 01:16:27,762
He didn't mean much to anybody,
except to me.

864
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:33,604
He didn't have what a man needs
in this world, what you've got, Verne.

865
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,802
He wasrt strong like you.
He didn't have your insides.

866
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:46,208
He didn't have much of anything.
He was just a nice kid, that's all.

867
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:52,051
And maybe he would have missed me
if I went first,

868
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:56,920
like the girl there will miss you
when you go.

869
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,124
So why should we let her in for that?

870
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,854
You won't be needing that anymore.

871
01:17:26,525 --> 01:17:30,052
Cambreau, I don't want
something for nothing,

872
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:33,222
but suppose I've been wrong all me life.

873
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:38,435
Would it do any good,
do you think, to admit it now?

874
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:44,271
If a man came to you and admitted
he was wrong and you felt he was sorry,

875
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:46,004
what would you do?

876
01:17:47,512 --> 01:17:49,537
That's good enough for me.

877
01:17:53,719 --> 01:18:00,648
I've been the world's biggest sucker,
ain't I, up to now?

878
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:34,387
How are you coming, Julie?

879
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:38,222
Nothing like an ocean trip
to put the old kink in your hair.

880
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:41,895
I'll bet it looks awful.

881
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:48,064
Cambreau, tell me.
What makes you guess right all the time?

882
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:53,639
It's like you got an old crystal ball
or something that you look into,

883
01:18:53,709 --> 01:19:00,171
and you know about things like
the wind and the water and the men.

884
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:05,643
And you got to every one of them,
too, before they went.

885
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:09,054
I didn't get to them, Julie,
they got to themselves.

886
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:12,186
And now maybe I'm going to die

887
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:15,822
and you're waiting for me to buy in, too,
is that it?

888
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:19,095
I don't think you're going to die
for a long time.

889
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:21,636
Then why buzz around me
if I'm not going to die?

890
01:19:21,704 --> 01:19:23,638
Well, you asked me to come over.

891
01:19:23,706 --> 01:19:26,869
And you jumped at the chance.

892
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:31,003
You thought maybe my black heart
had turned white overnight,

893
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,071
and I wanted forgiveness.

894
01:19:35,384 --> 01:19:38,717
Maybe I'd start telling you
about the years I spent

895
01:19:38,787 --> 01:19:42,416
kicking myself around
till I got good and lost,

896
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:46,359
and then say, "Cambreau, come find me

897
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:49,488
"and start me off
with a clean sheet of paper."

898
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,900
But I'm no sucker.

899
01:19:54,637 --> 01:19:56,935
Can you see me with a job, maybe,

900
01:19:57,873 --> 01:20:02,139
and a hall room somewhere,
a room of my own?

901
01:20:03,245 --> 01:20:09,184
Can you picture a man tipping his hat
to me because I look like he should?

902
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:15,385
I've lived my way, let me die my way.

903
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:19,757
Maybe if you'd told me all this, Julie,
you'd have told me where Verne fits in.

904
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:26,192
That crystal doesn't miss a thing, does it?

905
01:20:27,336 --> 01:20:32,569
So maybe I ought to lie to you and say,
"Who cares what happens to Verne?"

906
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:37,236
But you'd know the truth.

907
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:42,239
You'd know I could want a lot of things
if Verne were around.

908
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:45,719
But he'd have to want them, too.

909
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,221
I can't speak for him.

910
01:20:51,427 --> 01:20:55,955
Nobody can do anything for that guy
except pray,

911
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,827
and I don't know how to pray.

912
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:03,294
Strange you should say that, Julie.

913
01:21:03,372 --> 01:21:06,398
You've been doing nothing else
all this time.

914
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:35,668
Cambreau, why are you doing that?

915
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:42,039
Verne. Verne, he's dropping the sails.

916
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,947
Cambreau, put them sails up.
What are you trying to do?

917
01:21:48,017 --> 01:21:50,986
CAMBREAU: We're off the mainland.
They're probably waiting for us.

918
01:21:51,053 --> 01:21:53,851
We'd better heave to and slip in tonight.

919
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:55,482
What?

920
01:21:56,592 --> 01:22:00,050
We're off the mainland?

921
01:22:02,531 --> 01:22:08,834
Hey, hey, baby. Baby, we made it.

922
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:11,839
We beat them.

923
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:15,074
The dogs, we beat them.

924
01:22:40,202 --> 01:22:41,692
All right, turn her adrift.

925
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:43,533
What about Moll?
We can't leave him here.

926
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:44,629
Why not?

927
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:46,367
They'll pick up the boat and find him there.

928
01:22:46,442 --> 01:22:48,376
Which is exactly what Verne
wants them to do.

929
01:22:48,444 --> 01:22:51,038
- Right, Verne?
- Right.

930
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:18,064
- Who is it?
- CAMBREAU: A friend. Open the door.

931
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:33,384
I want some of that.

932
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:41,454
Here. Now, easy, kid.
Don't drink it all at once.

933
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,430
There. There, that's enough for right now.

934
01:23:43,499 --> 01:23:46,195
Hey, where do you think you're going?

935
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:48,498
- Why? I, I thought a...
- Yeah, well, think again.

936
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,663
Get some food on the table.

937
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,737
Did you hear that, babe?
All the food your little basket can hold.

938
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:58,177
We got through and we're here alive.

939
01:23:58,247 --> 01:23:59,714
We're here all right,

940
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:03,444
and then it's Marseille, Paris,
anywhere you say, babe.

941
01:24:03,519 --> 01:24:06,249
Because I got it all figured out for us.

942
01:24:22,304 --> 01:24:24,864
You cook up a pretty fancy stew.

943
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,636
What else can you do?
Can you navigate a boat?

944
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:31,008
Yes, monsieur,
but then I have no boat of my own.

945
01:24:32,147 --> 01:24:33,341
No?

946
01:24:36,985 --> 01:24:39,783
Hessler. Where did you put that razor?

947
01:24:41,857 --> 01:24:43,552
Right over there.

948
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:59,834
But my boat is a small one, only 60 feet.

949
01:25:03,045 --> 01:25:04,979
This wouldn't be Christmas, would it?

950
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:09,074
Food, clothes, a boat and a skipper.
What more could you want?

951
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:11,984
We'll pay for the use of your boat
and your services.

952
01:25:12,054 --> 01:25:15,046
Nothing like keeping it clean,
huh, Cambreau?

953
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:19,894
What sort of men are you, monsieur?
If you are in trouble, I...

954
01:25:19,962 --> 01:25:24,490
Like the lilies of the field, my friend.
We toil not, neither do we spin.

955
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:30,534
And this, gentlemen, seems to be as good
a time as any for me to be on my way.

956
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:34,841
Even in this benighted town
there must be a lady who awaits me,

957
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:37,310
a lonely lady with money.

958
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:40,348
Right back to your old tricks, huh, pal?

959
01:25:40,415 --> 01:25:44,852
"Love the little trade which thou
has learned, and be content therewith."

960
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:50,223
That's Marcus Aurelius, Verne,
and a wise man, too.

961
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:57,324
Well, Cambreau, I hope you have better
luck with Verne than you had with me.

962
01:25:57,966 --> 01:26:02,835
You know, of course, that your chances to
herd me into your little flock were limited,

963
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:05,429
because I'm not exactly sheep-like.

964
01:26:06,842 --> 01:26:10,039
And you deal mostly in sheep,
don't you, Cambreau?

965
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:15,006
Well, perhaps you and I will meet again.

966
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:18,883
No, Hessler.
I'm afraid we two will never meet again.

967
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:21,848
Be grateful, Cambreau.

968
01:26:21,923 --> 01:26:26,087
Without an occasional defeat,
your victories would be empty things.

969
01:26:30,799 --> 01:26:32,130
Gentlemen.

970
01:26:50,018 --> 01:26:51,007
No.

971
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:05,330
Better get that boat ready, gimpy.
We'll be sailing pretty soon.

972
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,699
As you say, monsieur, but you
should know there is a storm coming up.

973
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,204
What storm?
I call it a wind and a good one.

974
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,037
- And we're sailing with it. Now beat it.
- Yes, monsieur.

975
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:17,374
- What's the name of your crate?
- The Dolphin.

976
01:27:17,446 --> 01:27:20,142
She rides at anchor in the lower cove.

977
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:29,453
How do we know he won't turn us in?

978
01:27:29,524 --> 01:27:32,516
- Suppose I follow him.
- And who'll follow you?

979
01:27:34,563 --> 01:27:36,360
I'll be back, Verne.

980
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:53,275
- Come out here baby, I want to talk to you.
- I'm busy.

981
01:27:53,348 --> 01:27:55,179
I said, come out here.

982
01:28:01,223 --> 01:28:05,421
Looks like here's where we make up
our mind about things, huh, baby?

983
01:28:05,894 --> 01:28:09,295
Hey, makes a difference, don't it?

984
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:11,822
- It's divine.
- Come here.

985
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:15,969
- Who's a rat, baby?
- You are.

986
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:18,938
But I'll do just the same, huh? Right here.

987
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:29,113
A woman would be a chump
to go on with a guy like me, wouldn't she?

988
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,950
What could she win?
It's what you call making it the hard way.

989
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:36,154
You can't travel that way, can you, baby?

990
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:38,021
Maybe that's it.

991
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:40,994
But you'd do me a favor and drag me
along with you anyway, wouldn't you?

992
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:44,156
- From sewer to sewer.
- But on plush cushions.

993
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:51,101
If there's anything I want all I have to do
is ask for it, and you'd steal it for me.

994
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:54,142
Well, there's nothing I want
you could steal.

995
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,579
So that's it?

996
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,776
Suppose I said, "Listen, honey,
as soon as we get to Cuba,

997
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:07,117
"we're getting married and from there on
we're playing it according to the book?"

998
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:09,054
Maybe you could use a little of that, huh?

999
01:29:09,124 --> 01:29:11,615
Not if it came from you, Verne,
because you couldn't say it.

1000
01:29:11,693 --> 01:29:15,185
But suppose I did? Suppose I promoted
that little home by the side of the road,

1001
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:18,994
- with the kiddies playing in the sunshine?
- You're laughing.

1002
01:29:20,168 --> 01:29:23,604
And how I'm laughing. Where'd you
pick up that junk, from Cambreau?

1003
01:29:23,705 --> 01:29:25,570
Maybe I thought it out all by myself.

1004
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,471
Well, from now on
it's going to be different.

1005
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:29,271
Yeah. And do you know why?

1006
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:33,781
Because I've seen men die. They were
thieves like you and as rotten as me,

1007
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:38,577
but when their time came,
they suddenly got hold of something,

1008
01:29:38,687 --> 01:29:41,918
something they'd never had,
something won'th having.

1009
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:47,325
Well, whatever it is, I don't want
to wait that long for mine. I want it now.

1010
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:51,657
Great stuff, so long as it fits in
with what I got in mind.

1011
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,600
When we travel, we travel my way.

1012
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:59,435
What makes you think I'm going your way.

1013
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:06,177
Because you're stuck, kid, that's why.

1014
01:30:06,248 --> 01:30:10,776
You're a liar. I hate the sight of you.
I hate everything you stand for.

1015
01:30:12,053 --> 01:30:16,353
Even if I didn't, even if I loved you
so much it was killing me,

1016
01:30:16,424 --> 01:30:18,187
and I knew you'd haunt me
for the rest of my life,

1017
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:21,093
I still wouldn't have any part of you.

1018
01:30:21,162 --> 01:30:25,121
I only hope they take you back
to that prison you belong in.

1019
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,499
You'll be better off back there
than free to do the things you will do.

1020
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:31,630
The whole world will be better off
without you.

1021
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:54,354
And that's how it is, babe,
and what can we do about it?

1022
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,644
- Well, it's hard for me to believe.
- It's plain enough.

1023
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,212
This cask was full of saltwater,
so they must have died of thirst.

1024
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,986
And this man, Moll, was the last to go.

1025
01:31:26,428 --> 01:31:30,091
GRIDEAU: I'd have staked anything
that Verne would outlive them all.

1026
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:34,534
Unless, monsieur, he went first
with a knife in his back?

1027
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:37,766
Well, it's possible, and it's too bad.

1028
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:40,874
He was the only one of the pack
won'th saving.

1029
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:44,511
Well, may as well get back to the colony.

1030
01:31:57,525 --> 01:32:00,323
- That boat out there, do you belong on it?
- No.

1031
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:02,659
There's nobody coming ashore
from her tonight.

1032
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:05,199
Sails for America at dawn.

1033
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:08,030
Would they take a passenger,
do you think?

1034
01:32:08,103 --> 01:32:11,504
- Well, how do I get out to her?
- In a rising gale?

1035
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:15,407
Maybe you can hire someone
to take you out, but that ain't me.

1036
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:45,305
Good evening, Julie.

1037
01:32:45,373 --> 01:32:49,173
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same thing of you.

1038
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:51,336
Where else should I be?

1039
01:32:51,413 --> 01:32:55,349
I'm on my way to America.
I sail in the morning.

1040
01:32:55,717 --> 01:33:00,086
- America is so far away.
- Far away from what?

1041
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:02,384
Who knows?

1042
01:33:02,457 --> 01:33:06,120
Perhaps, Julie, if you were to go back
to the colony you might be very happy

1043
01:33:06,227 --> 01:33:08,718
if it could be arranged, and I think it can.

1044
01:33:08,797 --> 01:33:11,698
Since we talked,
things have happened that might...

1045
01:33:11,766 --> 01:33:15,099
That might increase my influence
with certain people.

1046
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:18,571
But no matter how you color it up, you
go with the proposition, don't you, Pig?

1047
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,939
You could do worse,
say with a man like Verne.

1048
01:33:26,915 --> 01:33:28,246
What about Verne?

1049
01:33:28,316 --> 01:33:32,047
He escaped with some others
and Grideau and I came to pick him up

1050
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,781
when he landed here.

1051
01:33:34,723 --> 01:33:38,625
- And have you got him?
- No. It seems he died at sea,

1052
01:33:39,761 --> 01:33:41,991
or that's what Grideau thinks.

1053
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:44,362
But you don't.

1054
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:47,334
Smart man, Verne.

1055
01:33:47,402 --> 01:33:51,236
He has something.
Something I'd like to have.

1056
01:33:56,778 --> 01:33:58,507
Lovely, aren't they, Julie?

1057
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:01,981
Yeah, lovely.
You'd look ducky in that black one.

1058
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:18,732
Any way out of this place
except this door?

1059
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,927
The alley around the corner.

1060
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:53,063
It's a small world, isn't it, Pig?
Just what is it you're after?

1061
01:34:53,134 --> 01:34:57,036
We both know what, Julie.
And it's time we talked about facts.

1062
01:34:59,073 --> 01:35:02,668
There are worse things, Julie,
than stringing with a pig like me.

1063
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:05,474
There is such a thing as watching
a man that means something to you

1064
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:08,375
hunted down and dragged back
on the end of a chain.

1065
01:35:08,449 --> 01:35:12,545
All right, so you've hunted him down.
Let's see you drag him back. Go on.

1066
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:18,490
I am no fool. There is a better way.
Grideau won't let him get away this time.

1067
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:23,293
But if I go back with you, you won't
tell Grideau? It's me for Verne, is that it?

1068
01:35:23,364 --> 01:35:26,390
Well, if it is, then take him.
Go tell Grideau.

1069
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:30,631
And as for my going anyplace
with you, I still pick my own gutters.

1070
01:35:38,213 --> 01:35:40,647
Wait a minute. Pig, wait a minute.

1071
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:46,383
Just give me five minutes, that's all.

1072
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:50,618
Five minutes to make sure he gets away
and after he's gone, I'll go with you.

1073
01:35:50,692 --> 01:35:54,355
It would be simpler
if we just went away together now.

1074
01:35:54,429 --> 01:35:57,398
No, I want to see him go,
I want to be sure.

1075
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:59,433
Don't you trust me, Julie?

1076
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:04,297
After you see him go, come in and get me.
I'll wait for you.

1077
01:36:29,597 --> 01:36:33,294
So, you're back, baby.
Nice to see you again.

1078
01:36:34,736 --> 01:36:36,636
I've come back to tell you
you got to get out.

1079
01:36:36,704 --> 01:36:40,868
- Grideau's in town.
- Grideau, eh? Nice fellow.

1080
01:36:41,643 --> 01:36:43,543
What'd he have to say for himself?

1081
01:36:45,713 --> 01:36:47,613
Well, I didn't talk to him.

1082
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,578
I didn't even see him.

1083
01:36:50,652 --> 01:36:55,817
No? Then how do you know he's here?
Or maybe you talked to somebody else.

1084
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,950
Don't ask so many questions.
Just get going.

1085
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:01,291
There's a storm coming up
and you never can tell.

1086
01:37:01,362 --> 01:37:03,956
You're right, kid, you never can tell.

1087
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:08,401
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm not going with you, Verne.

1088
01:37:08,503 --> 01:37:10,937
I told you that once before
and I meant what I said.

1089
01:37:11,005 --> 01:37:13,735
I thought maybe you'd changed your mind.

1090
01:37:15,009 --> 01:37:18,137
There's a freighter pulling out for America
in the morning and I'm going to be on it.

1091
01:37:18,212 --> 01:37:20,442
Okay, baby if that's what you want.

1092
01:37:20,515 --> 01:37:23,973
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I want.

1093
01:37:24,052 --> 01:37:27,647
Only, don't hang around here any longer.
Every minute counts. Get going.

1094
01:37:27,722 --> 01:37:30,589
Yes. Yes, you're right, kid.
I'd better hustle.

1095
01:37:30,658 --> 01:37:34,594
Grideau is a smart fellow.
He won't want to miss out on me again.

1096
01:37:34,662 --> 01:37:37,563
I wouldn't be surprised
if he'd offered a reward.

1097
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:39,463
A nice fat one.

1098
01:37:43,838 --> 01:37:47,274
Juicy enough to buy passage
to America on a freighter.

1099
01:37:49,177 --> 01:37:51,407
Good thing you can be trusted.

1100
01:37:52,146 --> 01:37:53,738
So long, babe.

1101
01:37:55,216 --> 01:37:57,548
- Verne.
- Yeah?

1102
01:38:00,755 --> 01:38:02,552
Plant one here.

1103
01:38:03,491 --> 01:38:05,891
It'll hold until we meet up again.

1104
01:38:32,653 --> 01:38:33,813
Julie.

1105
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:39,619
I'll buy you a new coat,
a nice one in the morning.

1106
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:44,998
Made out of pigskin.
So, Grideau's got himself two pigs now.

1107
01:38:45,066 --> 01:38:46,795
I didn't tell him. I swear I didn't, Verne.

1108
01:38:46,868 --> 01:38:48,699
You're a liar. You brought him here.

1109
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:51,170
You turned me over
just like you did back there on the island

1110
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:52,968
to keep your own hide out of trouble.

1111
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,441
If that's what you want to think, okay.
Only get out of here.

1112
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:57,774
Get out of here before it's too late.
I'm thinking of you, Verne.

1113
01:38:57,845 --> 01:39:00,746
Yeah, yeah, very cute.
You always could pour it on, couldn't you?

1114
01:39:00,815 --> 01:39:03,215
You had me winging, I'll say that for you,
right smack up to the minute

1115
01:39:03,284 --> 01:39:04,751
where I saw you through the window,
both of you.

1116
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:06,844
I wasrt going to turn you in, Verne.

1117
01:39:06,921 --> 01:39:09,549
It's a great spot for a dame
to bring a guy up to a point

1118
01:39:09,624 --> 01:39:11,922
where he can't see anything else
in the world except her.

1119
01:39:11,993 --> 01:39:14,154
You had me where there was nothing
I wouldn't have done for you.

1120
01:39:14,228 --> 01:39:16,128
I'd have gone on being a thief
or I'd have tried it the other way,

1121
01:39:16,197 --> 01:39:19,166
if that was what you wanted.
How does that sound?

1122
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:21,201
It's everything I've wanted to hear.

1123
01:39:21,269 --> 01:39:22,964
Only why did you have to wait
till now to tell me,

1124
01:39:23,037 --> 01:39:24,402
now that you've got to get out of here?

1125
01:39:24,472 --> 01:39:27,964
She's right.
And if you go now they'll never catch you.

1126
01:39:28,743 --> 01:39:30,335
Come on, Pig, where's Grideau?

1127
01:39:30,411 --> 01:39:32,675
Is he on his way here
or is he waiting to pick me up at the cove?

1128
01:39:32,747 --> 01:39:35,682
Verne, I haven't told a soul. Why should I?

1129
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:40,847
Verne, he's telling the truth.
He hasn't told anyone you're here.

1130
01:39:40,922 --> 01:39:43,254
And if I let him go
what do you think he'll do?

1131
01:39:43,324 --> 01:39:45,383
So, you made a mistake, Pig.

1132
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:48,827
This is one time in your life
you should've squealed.

1133
01:39:52,733 --> 01:39:55,224
If you ran away now, Julie,
you could get on that boat to America.

1134
01:39:55,303 --> 01:39:58,295
- That's just what I'm going to do.
- But if you stayed you could save him.

1135
01:39:58,372 --> 01:40:02,001
- Save the Pig for what?
- Not the Pig, Julie, Verne.

1136
01:40:07,849 --> 01:40:10,044
Verne, you fool. Let him go.

1137
01:40:11,619 --> 01:40:14,486
Did you hear me, Verne? I said let him go.

1138
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,593
Oh, so that's the way it is, huh?

1139
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:23,027
When a woman picks up a mars fight,
she's really on his side, ain't she?

1140
01:40:23,097 --> 01:40:24,621
Give me that.

1141
01:40:25,266 --> 01:40:28,463
All of a sudden, things look different,
don't they, baby?

1142
01:40:28,536 --> 01:40:31,004
Stand over there with him
and let's see what you look like.

1143
01:40:31,105 --> 01:40:35,701
Get over there. All right, there he is, Julie.
Take him. He's yours.

1144
01:40:36,544 --> 01:40:40,537
That's what you're asking for, isn't it?
Well, is it or isn't it?

1145
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:45,080
Yeah, that's it.

1146
01:40:45,153 --> 01:40:48,816
All right, you've got it.
Now get out of here both of you.

1147
01:40:49,457 --> 01:40:51,152
Come on, get moving.

1148
01:40:58,699 --> 01:41:02,032
- Goodbye, Cambreau.
- I'll see you again, Julie.

1149
01:41:10,978 --> 01:41:13,674
Of course, the facts are,
she's always hated the Pig.

1150
01:41:13,748 --> 01:41:15,909
She went to the jungle with Marfeu
rather than go with him.

1151
01:41:15,983 --> 01:41:18,474
And she'd rather go back
with the Pig than go on with me.

1152
01:41:18,553 --> 01:41:20,111
What's that look like
from where you stand?

1153
01:41:20,188 --> 01:41:22,122
It looks like something
a woman in love might think of.

1154
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:25,023
I get it. You've got it all figured out
according to the book.

1155
01:41:25,092 --> 01:41:26,992
Julie put on an act
with Cochon for my benefit,

1156
01:41:27,061 --> 01:41:28,858
so I wouldn't throw a slug into him.

1157
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:30,591
Now she's going back
to the island to marry him

1158
01:41:30,665 --> 01:41:34,032
so he won't turn me in to the law, huh?
Very nice.

1159
01:41:34,101 --> 01:41:35,693
Get some music, I'll sing it for you.

1160
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:38,261
It's just that it makes sense
to me that way.

1161
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:40,307
And what if you're right?
What am I supposed to do?

1162
01:41:40,374 --> 01:41:44,174
Turn noble and go back to a dozen
bear pits to get her out of hock?

1163
01:41:44,245 --> 01:41:47,646
I've come a long ways to get here.
I'm out and I'm on my way

1164
01:41:47,715 --> 01:41:50,081
and if you're coming, come on.

1165
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:03,555
- All right, get in the dinghy.
- But, monsieur, it will be a heavy storm.

1166
01:42:03,631 --> 01:42:05,826
Perhaps we should wait
until tomorrow morning.

1167
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,391
Get in that boat. Come on, Cambreau.

1168
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:54,241
Get below and start that engine.

1169
01:43:19,206 --> 01:43:22,073
Not bad. Good enough to take a man
anywhere he wants to go.

1170
01:43:22,143 --> 01:43:23,235
Any place in the world.

1171
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:26,371
- Sounds like you're a free man, Verne.
- As free as any man alive.

1172
01:43:26,447 --> 01:43:28,847
In three or four days,
maybe a week, I'll be in Cuba.

1173
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:31,050
I won't have to sneak in
the back way neither.

1174
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:33,211
So far as anybody knows, I'm dead.

1175
01:43:33,287 --> 01:43:34,811
The Pig knows you're alive,
so does Hessler.

1176
01:43:34,889 --> 01:43:37,722
Hessler won't talk. Neither will the Pig.
Julie won't let him.

1177
01:43:37,792 --> 01:43:38,781
How do you know?

1178
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:39,985
It won't be
the first time she turned you in.

1179
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:43,724
I know she won't. She's all right
about some things, things like that.

1180
01:43:43,798 --> 01:43:45,959
- Anyway, I'm not going to worry about it.
- But you are.

1181
01:43:46,033 --> 01:43:47,830
All your life you're going to worry about it.

1182
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:50,962
Until the day you die, you're going to
be sorry you turned her over to the Pig.

1183
01:43:51,038 --> 01:43:53,165
Another one of your
tinorn prophecies, huh?

1184
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,639
Well, keep them to yourself.

1185
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:57,803
I'm a free man, I tell you,
and no dame can cut into that.

1186
01:43:57,878 --> 01:44:00,005
I'm on my way to Cuba
and nothing can stop me.

1187
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:03,312
You're a strong man, Verne,
stronger than Moll was,

1188
01:44:03,384 --> 01:44:05,352
stronger than the prison you broke from,

1189
01:44:05,419 --> 01:44:08,320
stronger than the odds
that were against you.

1190
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:11,223
What are you getting around to?

1191
01:44:11,292 --> 01:44:13,317
You've got everything
you'll ever want, Verne.

1192
01:44:13,394 --> 01:44:15,521
You'll do what you want to do,
go where you want.

1193
01:44:15,596 --> 01:44:18,690
You're sufficient unto yourself.
You don't need a thing.

1194
01:44:18,766 --> 01:44:22,065
Certainly you don't need me.
I'm no good here.

1195
01:44:22,136 --> 01:44:25,697
And there may be something I can do
for someone else, if I stay behind.

1196
01:44:25,773 --> 01:44:28,742
You wouldn't do something
for yourself, would you, pal?

1197
01:44:28,809 --> 01:44:31,107
Something like talking to Grideau?

1198
01:44:31,178 --> 01:44:34,807
There's nothing I want from Grideau.
And there may be others to talk to,

1199
01:44:34,882 --> 01:44:37,908
as there was Telez, Flaubert and Dufond.

1200
01:44:38,085 --> 01:44:41,782
You sent them on their way
with a smile and a prayer.

1201
01:44:41,856 --> 01:44:44,450
Do you still think
that prayers pay off, Cambreau?

1202
01:44:44,525 --> 01:44:46,356
They may help a little.

1203
01:44:47,461 --> 01:44:49,691
Well then, you better
start saying them quick.

1204
01:44:49,764 --> 01:44:53,791
Lift up your hands, close your eyes
and give them all you got.

1205
01:44:53,868 --> 01:44:55,893
I don't have to make it any clearer, do I?

1206
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:58,063
There's only one other man
in the world that knows I'm alive

1207
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:00,334
and who'll say so outside of you.

1208
01:45:00,408 --> 01:45:02,933
I'm depending on a dame
to keep his mouth shut,

1209
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:06,776
- but who's going to shut yours?
- It looks like you will, Verne.

1210
01:45:06,847 --> 01:45:08,644
But what about you, when I'm gone?

1211
01:45:08,716 --> 01:45:10,843
You'll have thrown away
everything won'th having,

1212
01:45:10,918 --> 01:45:12,783
the chance to live like other men,

1213
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:15,549
a woman who loves you
and your last friend.

1214
01:45:15,623 --> 01:45:17,989
- What'll you have left?
- What I've always had.

1215
01:45:18,058 --> 01:45:20,993
Whatever it is that keeps a man on his
own feet without any help from anybody.

1216
01:45:21,061 --> 01:45:23,586
- What's it called, Verne?
- You name it, I've got it.

1217
01:45:23,664 --> 01:45:25,859
It's taking me on my way now.

1218
01:45:25,933 --> 01:45:28,766
You can come along,
or you can have it the other way.

1219
01:45:28,836 --> 01:45:32,567
It'll have to be the other way.
I can't go with you, Verne.

1220
01:45:33,974 --> 01:45:36,772
Well, what are you waiting for?
It shouldn't be hard.

1221
01:45:36,844 --> 01:45:39,074
Throw me into the sea and it's all over.

1222
01:45:39,146 --> 01:45:42,638
- It's simple enough, if you can do it.
- Lf I can do it?

1223
01:45:43,617 --> 01:45:46,586
- What would I be afraid of?
- Of yourself, perhaps,

1224
01:45:46,687 --> 01:45:50,123
or what happens to a man
after he's killed another man.

1225
01:45:57,131 --> 01:46:01,192
- You're asking for it, Cambreau.
- Then why don't you give it to me?

1226
01:46:01,268 --> 01:46:04,635
Or does it take something to kill me
you haven't got?

1227
01:46:37,738 --> 01:46:42,175
Now what do you think I got, Cambreau?
Remember, you asked for it!

1228
01:46:42,243 --> 01:46:45,212
You asked for it and you got it.

1229
01:46:45,312 --> 01:46:48,645
You can't let him drown.
You have to save him.

1230
01:46:48,716 --> 01:46:50,684
Why not?
Get forward and ship that anchor.

1231
01:46:50,751 --> 01:46:53,845
- Then get on the wheel and head north.
- CAMBREAU: Verne!

1232
01:46:54,889 --> 01:46:57,619
I can't hang on much longer!

1233
01:46:57,691 --> 01:47:00,489
I don't hear you begging me to help you.

1234
01:47:00,561 --> 01:47:04,998
Smart stuff, you're saving your breath.
You don't want anything from me.

1235
01:47:05,065 --> 01:47:08,557
What have I got to give?
Verne, the scum of the world.

1236
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:13,206
Up there, that's where
you're going to get your help from.

1237
01:47:13,474 --> 01:47:15,669
You got nothing to worry about.

1238
01:47:15,743 --> 01:47:20,112
Sing out some prayers, relax,
and wait for the water to dry up.

1239
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:22,478
Grab hold of a miracle, Cambreau.

1240
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:25,951
No one can save him but you, monsieur.

1241
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:27,214
Did you hear that?

1242
01:47:27,288 --> 01:47:31,156
Did you hear what he said, Cambreau?
In heaven and on Earth,

1243
01:47:31,225 --> 01:47:34,592
in all the world
there's nobody can save you but me.

1244
01:47:34,762 --> 01:47:38,198
So when you say your prayers,
say them to me, Cambreau.

1245
01:47:38,332 --> 01:47:43,463
I'm the only god you can call on now.
I'm the old temple remember?

1246
01:47:43,804 --> 01:47:48,036
You were right when you said
God was in me. God's in everybody.

1247
01:47:48,609 --> 01:47:52,443
Gimpy's God. I'm God. You're...

1248
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:57,176
You're...

1249
01:47:58,519 --> 01:47:59,781
Cambreau!

1250
01:48:03,958 --> 01:48:05,220
Cambreau!

1251
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:52,232
Cambreau. Cambreau.

1252
01:48:55,509 --> 01:48:58,069
It's no use, he's gone.

1253
01:49:00,547 --> 01:49:02,174
He figured it like that.

1254
01:49:02,316 --> 01:49:06,480
I can see it now all the way.
Everything he said, everything he did,

1255
01:49:07,121 --> 01:49:10,022
he had it all worked out to the end.

1256
01:49:12,426 --> 01:49:16,385
You're an awful sucker
to do things like that for rats like me.

1257
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:24,260
Monsieur.

1258
01:50:25,499 --> 01:50:28,127
Verne, are you crazy?
Grideau's on that boat. He'll see you.

1259
01:50:28,202 --> 01:50:30,261
And if he sees me, he'll take me,
won't he, baby?

1260
01:50:30,337 --> 01:50:32,305
I thought you'd be halfway
to Cuba by now.

1261
01:50:32,372 --> 01:50:35,136
Maybe I didn't like the idea
of you going with the Pig.

1262
01:50:35,209 --> 01:50:36,801
What do you care?

1263
01:50:36,877 --> 01:50:39,471
We're going to be married,
and I expect we'll be very happy.

1264
01:50:39,546 --> 01:50:41,673
Yeah, and maybe you won't.

1265
01:50:42,015 --> 01:50:44,609
Maybe you'll be taking
a lot of punishment for a guy like me.

1266
01:50:44,685 --> 01:50:48,177
- Cambreau told you.
- No, Cambreau doesn't work that way.

1267
01:50:48,255 --> 01:50:51,952
But I took a look at the figures
and they add up to one thing.

1268
01:50:52,025 --> 01:50:55,517
- Baby, it's me, ain't it?
- It's always been you.

1269
01:50:56,396 --> 01:50:57,556
That's what I figured.

1270
01:50:57,631 --> 01:51:01,260
Verne, are you sure?
Are you sure this is what you want?

1271
01:51:01,335 --> 01:51:04,361
- Don't you think it's the best way?
- I know it is.

1272
01:51:04,438 --> 01:51:07,771
Well, the best
will always be good enough for us.

1273
01:51:10,844 --> 01:51:12,277
Hello, Verne.

1274
01:51:13,647 --> 01:51:17,276
- When do we sail, Grideau?
- Any minute, now that you're here.

1275
01:51:17,384 --> 01:51:20,683
So you found something
stronger than you, after all.

1276
01:51:20,888 --> 01:51:25,621
Yeah, looks like it, don't it?
Where'd you get that dress?

1277
01:51:25,692 --> 01:51:27,751
Why, I bought it with the money
you gave me on the boat.

1278
01:51:27,828 --> 01:51:30,194
- And what's it to you?
- Okay, okay.

1279
01:51:30,531 --> 01:51:32,897
Now that's what you need
to keep a guy like me on the island.

1280
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,797
Not something easy
like a jungle, or an ocean,

1281
01:51:34,868 --> 01:51:39,032
- but something like her, tough.
- But won'th waiting for, maybe?

1282
01:51:39,106 --> 01:51:41,802
- As long as it takes.
- He wasrt talking to you.

1283
01:51:41,875 --> 01:51:44,935
Besides, I'm the one
that'll be doing the waiting, not you.

1284
01:51:45,012 --> 01:51:49,005
- Okay to move around?
- Okay, Verne. Or am I still a sucker?

1285
01:51:49,449 --> 01:51:51,110
What do you think?

1286
01:52:05,499 --> 01:52:08,627
- He won't be sorry?
- No, fisherman, he won't.

1287
01:52:09,203 --> 01:52:12,400
And everything will be all right
for them someday?

1288
01:52:12,539 --> 01:52:14,666
Everything is all right now.

1289
01:52:15,876 --> 01:52:17,537
Goodbye, my friend.

1290
01:52:21,081 --> 01:52:22,742
Goodbye, monsieur.
