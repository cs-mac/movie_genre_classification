Well, for one thing,
that's really what it's like.

I mean, kids do things that
parents don't have a clue about,

up in New York in the '90s.

Oink! Squeal!

937

Jesus, please protect me.
Jesus, please protect me.

938

Jesus, please protect me!

939
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:10,212
Not today.

940
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:15,595
I made damn sure to go in there and
kill more people than anybody else.

941
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:17,238
You want to know why, Lax?

942
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:20,154
Because I had to
reset the precedent.

943
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:24,282
I wasn't gonna settle for
some rinky-dinky shit, Lax.

944
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:31,711
But I was never going
to kill James Hankley.

945
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:36,051
I wanted him to live so he could write
about me in his precious school paper.

Stop, Herman, stop!

950
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:55,122
I shot Ms. Cribb in the mouth.
Have you seen her?

951
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:57,803
No, I haven't seen her.

952
00:58:57,804 --> 00:59:00,873
Yeah, but have you heard anything?

953
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:06,100
Well, I heard they had to amputate
her jaw... What's left of it.

954
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:10,133
She has to be fed intravenously.

955

These posters look
really good, Sean.

00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:45,436
You did a good job,
Vic. You're a good man.

959
00:59:45,437 --> 00:59:47,119
Come and take these files.

Vic, give me the files.
Give me the files!

- Put that gun down!

You don't know how this works, boy!
You don't know how this works!

970
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:12,634
I'm gonna see you again!

971
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:14,859
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about that.

972
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,983
- You're under arrest, Sean gall.
- Fuck you!

973
01:00:16,984 --> 01:00:18,818
You have the right
to remain silent.

974
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:22,482
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

975
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:24,609
You have the right to
speak to an attorney.

976
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:28,002
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

977
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,930
Do you understand the rights
as I have read them to you?

978
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:32,098
You're a dead man.

979
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,068
I tell you something, Vic... you got
the taste of blood in your mouth.

980
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:40,131
That ain't ever gonna go back
to what it was, brother.

[Wind howling]

982
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:03,545
Do you think I'm
afraid of dying, Lax?

983
01:01:03,546 --> 01:01:07,696
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Why do you say that?

984
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:12,045
'Cause you weren't man enough to
do yourself in, like all your heroes.

985
01:01:12,046 --> 01:01:14,073
Hey, I'm prepared to pay
the price for what I did.

986
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:16,909
I think that takes way more balls
than just offing yourself.

987
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,445
- What about karma?
- You know what I think?

988
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:24,869
I think when you die,
it's game over, nothing, blackness.

989
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,135
What about reset?

990
01:01:26,136 --> 01:01:28,587
When you hit the reset,
the game you've played before

991
01:01:28,588 --> 01:01:30,815
doesn't have shit to
do with the next one,

992
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:33,011
and all the characters
just come back to life.

993
01:01:33,012 --> 01:01:35,001
That's not how it works in reality.

994
01:01:35,002 --> 01:01:37,507
Once a kid dies,
he doesn't come back to life.

995
01:01:37,508 --> 01:01:39,352
Do you want to hear
what else happened or not?

996
01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:42,376
Sure. Sure.

997
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:45,652
Eh, where was I?

998
01:01:45,653 --> 01:01:50,242
- Right, so, I shot Susan, but...
- You said that already, Herman.

999
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:54,554
Fuck. What... I don't remember
what happened next.

1000
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:56,182
I think I started
firing into the cro...

1001
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:56,882
No, no.

1002
01:01:56,883 --> 01:01:59,885
That happened after the police
came through the door.

1003
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:01,934
Yeah, the police
came through the door,

1004
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:04,090
and everyone was screaming
because I threw a pipe bomb

1005
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:07,759
right in the middle of the crowd,
and everybody scattered.

[Screaming]

1007
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,290
And everyone was running
towards the door

1008
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,779
and the police came into the gym

1009
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,722
and I was just running around
shooting people left and right.

1010
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:26,867
There were only three cops at first,
and I was able to pick them off

1011
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:31,665
right when they stormed the gym.
They only got one door open.

[Screaming]

1013
01:02:33,127 --> 01:02:35,758
Everyone was trying to get out.
No cops could get in.

1014
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:37,912
It was anarchy.

1015
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:41,894
I ran up behind Marsha.
I put a .45 right to her back,

1016
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:44,497
and I said, "are you
ready to die, prom queen?"

1017
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:48,367
Then I shot someone who was
running towards the door.

1018
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:50,369
[Crying] No, no, no.

Please.

1021
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,509
Please don't do this to me, Herman.

1022
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,210
I'll do anything.

1023
01:02:58,211 --> 01:03:00,379
I'll do anything, Herman.

1024
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,380
Please.

1025
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:06,979
I want to see my mom again.
I want to see my little brother.

1026
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,374
Please, Herman, please.

1027
01:03:18,523 --> 01:03:20,490
Isn't that funny?

1028
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:25,177
She was ashamed to be
talking to me before that.

1029
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:30,313
Do you know what it's like to
have that kind of power, Lax?

1030
01:03:30,314 --> 01:03:31,944
We're not interviewing me, Herman.

1031
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:33,345
[Clears throat]

1032
01:03:33,346 --> 01:03:35,988
We have to take
him to his cell now.

1033
01:03:58,818 --> 01:04:03,262
- So, what'd you do next?
- I was out of control.

1034
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,963
I bashed her nose in
with the butt of my gun

1035
01:04:05,964 --> 01:04:07,574
and I left her there to bleed.

1036
01:04:07,575 --> 01:04:09,481
Why's that?

1037
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:11,052
Because I wanted her to learn

1038
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:13,584
what life's like when you're not
the prettiest girl at school.

1039
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:18,744
- So you're a teacher, is that it?
- People needed a fucking lesson.

[Indistinct shouting]

Hello, Herman.

1043
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:10,076
How can you be here?

1044
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,787
Why didn't you come
let him help me, Herman?

1045

I was scared.

You know where you're going,
Herman, don't you?

1047
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:23,756
Do you think I'm going to tell you?
You're going to hell.

Julia, I love you.

Honestly, I was so sad
when you died, I just...

I didn't have anyone I could show.

1051
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:34,704
I hurt, Herman.
I hurt all the time.

1052
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:37,269
Yeah, but that's not my fault.
I didn't kill you.

1053

- Why? Why did I do it, Julia? Tell me.

I'm in hell, Herman.

Yeah, but you never
did anything wrong.

- You did.
- What?

No. I'm sorry, Julia.

1058
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:54,156
I should have gone outside.
I really should have.

- Wait, Julia. Don't go.

Wait. Tell me why I did it.

01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:54,145
[Ticking continues]

1240
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:26,937
<i>- What's up, Herman?
- [Laughs]</i>

1241
01:21:26,938 --> 01:21:30,166
<i>See, when you're a kid,
you have to find that one thing</i>

1242
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:34,592
<i>that you care about and stick to it,
'cause that's all you got.</i>

1243
01:21:34,593 --> 01:21:36,961
<i>What's your one thing?</i>

1244
01:21:36,962 --> 01:21:38,029
<i>I don't know.</i>

1245
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:40,398
<i>I'll have to tell
you when I grow up.</i>

1246
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:42,267
<i>[Laughs]</i>

1247
01:21:46,795 --> 01:21:50,340
Some people seem to think
that the question is,

1248
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:52,713
"what the hell are we
gonna do with these kids?"

1249
01:21:52,714 --> 01:21:56,264
Well, they're wrong.
The real question is,

1250
01:21:56,265 --> 01:21:58,479
"what the hell are we gonna
do with us adults?"

1251
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,293
So, today, take your eyes off
the computer screen, log out,

1252
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:06,687
unplug, go outside, and exercise
your right to breathe.

1253
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,360
You're still allowed
to do that, you know.

1254
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:14,337
Take a momentary break from,
"buy this, sell that, feel this."

1255
01:22:14,338 --> 01:22:17,421
But do it after the show,
because today,

1256
01:22:17,422 --> 01:22:20,659
we're gonna talk about what happens
when you devalue human life.

1257
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,617
Okay, let's take some calls.
