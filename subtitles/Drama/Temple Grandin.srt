2
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:08,115
My name is Temple Grandin.

3
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:10,617
I'm not like other people.

4
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,913
I think in pictures
and I connect them.

5
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,537
There she is!
Temple!

6
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,040
It's hot!

7
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,005
Come on, dear. You're holding up
the other passengers!

8
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:20,362
I can see the heat!

9
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:34,092
Do people live here?

10
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,167
The wolf is growling

11
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:46,712
and the man with the shotgun
says to Illya Kuryakin,

12
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:48,719
"Would you like for me
to open the gate?"

13
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:52,870
I'm sorry, Temple, you lost me.

14
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:56,175
"The man from U.N.C.L.E."
"The gazebo in the maze."

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,691
The wolf is growling

16
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,569
and the man with the shotgun
says to Illya Kuryakin,

17
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,698
<i>Would you like for me
to open the gate?</i>

18
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:06,081
"Would you like for me
to open the gate?"

19
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:12,055
You okay?

20
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,320
Aunt Ann, what is this place?

21
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:17,321
Just holding pens.

22
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:19,765
You don't have those
on the east coast.

23
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,814
Is this where they slaughter them?

24
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,590
Yes, it is.

25
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,951
"Would you like for me
to open the gate?"

26
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,779
"Would you like for me
to open the gate?"

27
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:38,846
Yes. Yes, please.

28
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:42,040
Open the gate, please, Temple?

29
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:46,007
Would you like for me
to open that gate?

30
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,889
Come on, Temple.

31
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,275
Temple made it okay.

32
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:58,563
- Say hi to your uncle Mike.
- Hi, Temple.

33
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:02,126
I just been tellin' Billy here
all about our summer visitor.

34
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:06,591
Are you a cowboy?

35
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:08,135
Excuse my niece.

36
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,431
That's not how we greet people.
You know better than that.

37
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,413
Hello, I'm Temple.
It's very nice to meet you.

38
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:16,808
Hello, I'm Temple.
It's very nice to meet you.

39
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,993
Nice to meet you too.

40
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:22,976
Ma'am.

41
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:26,515
Thanks for this.
I'll replace it tomorrow.

42
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,991
No rush. I got spares.

43
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,797
Do you get
"the man from U.N.C.L.E."?

44
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,593
Let me show you your room.

45
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:46,524
These okay here?

46
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:51,908
All my science fiction books
are there.

47
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:54,992
- How do I know this is my room?
- Because we say so.

48
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:56,738
It's your room.

49
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,891
So, you excited about college?

50
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,394
That's something.

51
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,425
Thank you.

52
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:43,199
I can't eat that. I have colitis.
I get it from nervousness.

53
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,239
- I eat pudding and jell-o.
- I know.

54
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,064
Your mom said.

55
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,397
So you didn't answer
Mike's question.

56
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,382
Are you excited
about going to college?

57
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:58,569
I want to stay in high school.
I like my science teacher.

58
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,319
Dr. Carlock's very smart
and he's been to college.

59
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:04,984
So I don't understand why I have to move
to learn what he probably already knows.

60
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:14,959
The desert spoons and teaspoons
go in different sections.

61
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:16,220
I did that.

62
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,438
Your uncle can't tell them apart.

63
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:23,441
And sometimes I can't either.

64
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,500
They're different.

65
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,116
Yes, they are.

66
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,194
I think it's time for bed,
young lady.

67
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,329
We get up with the rooster
around here.

68
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,086
You got everything?

69
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:51,877
This is my room.

70
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,511
Yes, it is.

71
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,309
- So good night.
- I don't want you to do that.

72
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,794
I'm sorry. I forgot.
No hugs.

73
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:04,625
Good night then.

74
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:51,519
Hello?

75
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,990
- <i>Did I wake you?</i>
- Of course not.

76
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:55,513
- Who is it?
- It's Ann!

77
00:08:57,187 --> 00:09:00,438
Guess what I found balled up in
the bottom of Temple's closet?

78
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:02,894
A lovely summer frock
she didn't want?

79
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,674
It's taken me an age to iron it.

80
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,239
I'll mail it in the morning.

81
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,868
<i>You couldn't get her to pack it,
not sure I can get her to wear it.</i>

82
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,289
The other one came off
the minute she arrived.

83
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:13,497
How is she?

84
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,384
She's good.

85
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:18,027
Tell me.

86
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:20,161
She...

87
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:24,143
She got tense
when Mike mentioned college,

88
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,096
but then she calmed down

89
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:28,108
and she went off to bed just fine.

90
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,815
Stop worrying.

91
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,619
Temple's my job for the summer.

92
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:33,362
Worry about the others.

93
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:35,889
I'm sure
she's gonna have a great time.

94
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:37,801
You do remember, though,

95
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,522
something's gonna set her off.

96
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,181
I could really use a hand here!

97
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,636
So any idea
what your major might be?

98
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,408
Science. Probably psychology.

99
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:16,913
You don't have to decide just yet,
do you?

100
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:19,886
- It's better than boarding school.
- That's great.

101
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,476
- Lots of choices.
- Danny's looking at you.

102
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:25,269
He can see all around
without moving his head.

103
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,069
- So how do you know where he's looking?
- His ears.

104
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,227
He points his ears
where he's looking.

105
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,972
See?
He's lookin' at you, aunt.

106
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,243
And he's lookin' at those cowboys.

107
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,029
See? Now I got his attention.
Now he's looking at me.

108
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:41,845
You're right.

109
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:43,746
How'd you figure that out?

110
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,433
What are they doing?

111
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,407
What is this thing?

112
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,669
It holds her still
so Billy can inoculate her.

113
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:35,453
What happened to it?
It calmed down.

114
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:37,887
They just like it.

115
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:39,239
It gentles 'em.

116
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:37,928
Stand still and they'll come to you.

117
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,681
Won't harm you.
Just curious.

118
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,380
Can't help themselves.

119
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,546
Are you worried about
keeping up with the other students?

120
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:30,023
- I'm not stupid.
- I didn't say you were.

121
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:32,986
- Is it moving away from home?
- Hold it straighter.

122
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,853
Why don't you want to go to college?

123
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:40,741
People.

124
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,370
I don't understand people.

125
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,758
At least the people at school
know I don't understand them

126
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,617
and some of them
are my friends anyway.

127
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:49,454
What don't you understand?

128
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,967
Girls get all goofy over boys.

129
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,073
They talk about silly pop groups
and clothes and say things like,

130
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,085
"why are you so grumpy?"
When I'm happy.

131
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:01,980
And I say, "I'm happy". And they say,
"You don't look happy".

132
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,014
And I say,
"Can't you see I'm thinking?

133
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:05,938
And can't you see I'm sad?"

134
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:09,384
And I don't know
what they're talking about.

135
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:12,155
What do you look like
when you're happy?

136
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:14,142
Like this.

137
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,510
No, you didn't look like that
when you were telling me about

138
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,230
"the man from U.N.C.L.E."
You looked like this...

139
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,428
That's funny lookin'.

140
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:28,842
Happy.</i>

141
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,176
And that's you angry.

142
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:37,708
Angry.

143
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:41,565
Happy.

144
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,388
I'm happy in that one.

145
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,251
I'd say more satisfied.

146
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:48,975
Satisfied.

147
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:19,296
Maria, can you give me a hand here?

148
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:33,256
Close it on me.

149
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,295
- Let's get you out of...
- Close it on me!

150
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,654
- Don't be silly!
- Please!

151
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,768
Close the sides.
Close the sides.

152
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,727
Please!

153
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:03,609
Harder! More!

154
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,476
Did you see Temple's handiwork
at the gate?

155
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,602
Isn't that the darndest thing?

156
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,318
Hi, darlin'.

157
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,644
All these years Ann's been bugging me.
Like I could ever come up with that!

158
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,486
Is that it?

159
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,724
Is that what Temple's been using?

160
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,162
Yes, it is.

161
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,580
I know, it looks horrible,

162
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,392
but it helps her.

163
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,264
I'll go find Temple.

164
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,622
That's mine.
That's Temple's.

165
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,288
She's had a great summer.
You won't believe what she's fixed.

166
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,283
She's wonderful with the cattle.

167
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:08,718
I appreciate that.

168
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:11,256
I should warn you,
she has her mind set on staying.

169
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:13,515
That's not an option.

170
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,999
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to attack you,

171
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:26,742
especially when you've been
so generous all summer.

172
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,369
How was your trip, mother?
You made good time.

173
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,660
It was long.

174
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,245
Thank you for asking.

175
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,488
You ready for college?

176
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:09,744
I think I'd rather stay here.

177
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:12,812
We've talked about this.

178
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,528
Sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.

179
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,200
No one expected it.

180
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,366
It's nothin' short of a miracle.

181
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,391
It's a miracle!

182
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:33,542
{\Franklin Pierce College
1966}

183
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,161
This way.

184
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,599
- Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

185
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,230
224.
This is you.

186
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,768
I don't have a roommate.

187
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:38,341
Your roommate is coming
in another couple of weeks.

188
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:40,012
Remember?

189
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,073
Everyone else has a roommate!

190
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:47,239
Why don't you just think of it
as a chance to settle in, sweetheart?

191
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,958
Then I'll go back home!

192
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,670
I know that this
is strange and new,

193
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:57,050
- but you're going to be all right.
- I don't want to stay here!

194
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:58,914
Try and stay calm.

195
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:03,226
It's all right.
Try and calm down, all right?

196
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:06,209
I'm going to give you
a moment to yourself.

197
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,115
- What's wrong?
- Is she all right?

198
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,700
Interested in playing
with other children?

199
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:25,632
No, not really.

200
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,259
Plays with toys, dolls?

201
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,756
She loves to rip things.

202
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,527
And no speech yet at the age of?

203
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,921
Four.

204
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:36,191
She's four.

205
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:40,030
Not yet.

206
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,611
I'm sure it's just a phase, but...

207
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,955
Your child is clearly autistic.

208
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,230
Autistic.

209
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:54,683
- I'm not familiar...
- She's an infantile schizophrenic.

210
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:58,471
Infantile?

211
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,109
So when would she grow out of it?

212
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:05,782
I mean, what's the next step for...

213
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:08,512
We generally recommend
an institution.

214
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:10,442
For how long?

215
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:12,877
I'm not sure I would like that.
I really...

216
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:16,888
- I wouldn't wanna miss her first words.
- She probably will never speak.

217
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,593
And I'm afraid
there is no course of treatment.

218
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:23,559
I'm talking about
institutionalization.

219
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:27,946
But...

220
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:32,855
She was a perfectly normal baby

221
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,922
and then later she changed.

222
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:38,058
So I need to know how, why.

223
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,878
I'm not sure you'd... Perhaps
if you had your husband call me.

224
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,794
My husband is a very busy man
and I graduated from Harvard,

225
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,619
so why don't you try me?

226
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:49,814
I'm sorry.

227
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,781
It's been suggested that it may be

228
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:56,811
a lack of bonding with the mother...

229
00:23:57,363 --> 00:24:01,369
That at a crucial phase,
the mother was cold, aloof,

230
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:04,596
when the child most needed
physical affection.

231
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,408
But that is not what happened.

232
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,693
We have another child
and she is not like this

233
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:10,969
and I did not do anything different.

234
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,990
Temple rejects me.

235
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,547
I want to hug her
and she won't let me.

236
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,384
I'm supposed to have done this.
Then I can undo it.

237
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,328
- You just tell me what to do.
- As I said,

238
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,657
I recommend institutionalization.

239
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:26,563
Here is a list of facilities
that we recommend.

240
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:29,888
Dah-og.

241
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:33,893
Temple.

242
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,101
Dog.

243
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:44,107
Cah-at.

244
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:45,747
Cat.

245
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,188
Temple, try.

246
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:51,363
Mah...

247
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,941
... me.

248
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:56,464
Mom...

249
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:00,364
I know you can hear me.

250
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:05,730
All right.

251
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:09,539
I think mommy needs
a five-minute break.

252
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:53,204
<i>Avez-vous lu la page, Mlle Grandin?</i>

253
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,817
I don't want to study French.
I want to learn science.

254
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:03,340
Read the page, please.

255
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,499
Read it.

256
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:16,416
And what did it say?

257
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,195
<i>"Jean-Paul Sartre
naît le 21 juin 1905,</i>

258
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:24,390
<i>à Paris;</i>

259
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:27,367
<i>fils unique,

260
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,704
<i>- son père est polytechni..."</i>
- You...

261
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,075
You learned it?

262
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,710
I just looked at it.

263
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,591
Then I have the page in my mind
and can read off the page.

264
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,485
I see pictures and connect them.

265
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,823
I only eat jell-o and yogurt.

266
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:21,579
I only... I only eat
jell-o and yogurt!

267
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:43,116
Excuse me?

268
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,227
I'm your roommate.

269
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,423
What are you doing?

270
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,680
It's a machine I just made.
Feels like a hug.

271
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:54,134
Do you want a hug?
It feels really good.

272
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,641
So when you got in your machine,

273
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:06,354
did it make you feel like a cow?

274
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:10,924
No, I didn't feel like a cow.

275
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:13,072
But it gave you pleasure.

276
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:16,073
It made me feel good, gentle.

277
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:19,331
- The hug made you feel good.
- Yes.

278
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:23,204
But you don't like
to be touched by people.

279
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:28,698
Do you like to touch yourself?

280
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:33,625
Touchin' myself's okay.

281
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,322
But when the squeeze machine
touches you,

282
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,248
- it feels better?
- Yes.

283
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:40,947
It gives you release?

284
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:46,138
Yes, there is release.

285
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,311
But I need it!

286
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:57,069
- I built it! It's mine!
- What's all the noise?

287
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,944
- Wait! Stop it!
- Pervert.

288
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:02,561
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

289
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,456
23 hours,

290
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,902
59 minutes and four,

291
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:33,024
three, two, one,
zero hours, Mr. Solo!

292
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,159
What are you doing?

293
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:02,546
Stop!

294
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:04,571
I said stop!

295
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:40,137
She says she's not going back
after spring break

296
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:42,234
unless she can take it with her.

297
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,091
Are you still there?

298
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:49,285
Yes, and I really don't think
it's a good idea.

299
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,412
It works for her.

300
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:54,355
It's everything we've been
struggling to get away from.

301
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,531
They were perfectly clear.
No devices in her room.

302
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:01,989
Could there be a better way to mark her
as a weirdo and an oddball?

303
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,890
Just let us try, okay?

304
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:09,556
So that's it.

305
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:37,362
- It makes me gentle.
- She's different after just 15 minutes.

306
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:40,088
A different person?
How can you explain that?

307
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,677
I can't explain why the machine works,
but I know it's not sexual.

308
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,347
- As Temple says, it calms her.
- This does convince me

309
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:49,143
we're not equipped
to deal with Ms. Grandin's needs.

310
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:50,864
It makes her a better student.

311
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:53,262
She's able to concentrate,
to interact more easily.

312
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,943
This isn't very scientific.

313
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:57,680
- There is no empirical evidence...
- I can do an experiment.

314
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:00,583
I can see how it works
on other people, measure heart rates.

315
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,591
I think it'll work on everyone.

316
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,552
Let's talk frankly.

317
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:10,949
I'm not sure you can get anything
from being at Franklin Pierce.

318
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:14,181
Listen to what she's saying. She wants
to do her own science experiment,

319
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:16,684
something that you can evaluate
in her psychology course.

320
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,778
I have a pen and a clipboard.

321
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:28,619
Time.

322
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:32,866
Do you feel: A, claustrophobic;

323
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,090
b, constricted;

324
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:37,048
c, no different;

325
00:33:37,677 --> 00:33:39,533
d, comfortable;

326
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:41,282
e, relaxed?

327
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,865
What was the one before last?

328
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,241
D, comfortable.

329
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,939
Yes, I'm quite comfortable.

330
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:53,685
C, no different.

331
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,635
A, claustrophobic!

332
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,945
I guess I feel relaxed?

333
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,044
Very relaxed.

334
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:44,364
"F" for "freak".

335
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,644
Hello? Hampshire country school?

336
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,612
I need to speak to Dr. Carlock!

337
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,781
Dr. Carlock? Yes. Please hold.

338
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:22,432
Oh, please, I'll take these.
I'll take these. Welcome.

339
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,428
Excuse the mess.
We just had a staff meeting.

340
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,393
Oh, good. They're here.

341
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,841
Temple Grandin, I would
like you to meet Mr. Hodges.

342
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:33,638
He is our mathematics teacher.

343
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,076
I'm Temple.
It's very nice to meet you.

344
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,721
This is mademoiselle Davide.
She is our French teacher.

345
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,697
Hello, I'm Temple,
it's very nice to meet you.

346
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:45,113
Hi, I'm Dr. Carlock.
I teach science.

347
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:47,116
Are you a scientist?

348
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,884
I'm Temple,
it's very nice to meet you.

349
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:55,086
- Are you a scientist?
- I used to work for N.A.S.A.

350
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,843
Temple's very interested in science.

351
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:02,336
I'd like to meet Belka and Strelka.

352
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,490
The first dogs
to come back from space alive.

353
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:07,354
- That's right, in...
- Sputnik V, august 20th, 1960.

354
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:16,993
We're changing schools mid-term
because Temple's been expelled.

355
00:36:17,118 --> 00:36:19,559
I'm sorry,
why was she expelled, again?

356
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:22,376
Hitting another child with a book.

357
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:25,536
There's no excuse,
but I will say this in her defense,

358
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:29,572
I have never seen her strike
unless she's been provoked.

359
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:32,433
And other children have taunted

360
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,362
and bullied her constantly.

361
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:36,226
They make fun of her

362
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:38,830
because she doesn't
understand their jokes.

363
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,904
She spins to comfort herself.

364
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:43,524
She talks fast, often too fast,

365
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,591
and she talks repetitively

366
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:48,638
and then the children
called her a tape recorder.

367
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,992
She'll go into a panic attack

368
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:54,049
- and then they make fun of that too.
- Excuse me.

369
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,969
When was she diagnosed autistic?

370
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:58,926
She was four,

371
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:02,110
but I sometimes wonder
if that's correct.

372
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,980
Why do you say that?

373
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,233
You've seen her. She's bright.

374
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,970
We have a lot of experience

375
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:12,076
with children with special needs,
emotional problems,

376
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:16,123
neuro-behavioral issues
that we've made a number...

377
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,060
- I think that because...
- I'm so sorry.

378
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:23,092
I really have wasted your time.
I just can't do this to her.

379
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:25,737
Mrs. Grandin.

380
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,227
Mrs. Grandin, please! Can I
speak with you for a moment, please?

381
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,046
You don't strike me as a person
who would abuse their child,

382
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,280
or deny them love and care...

383
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,495
Now you wait.

384
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:45,739
I have done everything
that I can for Temple,

385
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,724
and if it isn't good enough,
then it just isn't good enough.

386
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,622
But you cannot to begin

387
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:55,640
to imagine the chaos,
the upheavals, the tantrums,

388
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:57,576
and the pain.

389
00:37:57,701 --> 00:37:58,894
Her pain.

390
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:01,495
You seem to be acting as if...

391
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,921
you have done something wrong,
when...

392
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:06,490
it's obvious
you've done everything right.

393
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:08,475
I think she's terrific.

394
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:12,535
I know it's difficult
when as parents,

395
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,289
we want our children to be everything
we hoped for them to be and,

396
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:18,924
if they're not,
we think it's our fault.

397
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:21,491
And there's never ever anybody

398
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,550
who understands
what we're going through.

399
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,867
That, it makes you feel alone,
right?

400
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:30,932
Mrs. Grandin,
I'm not an admissions person.

401
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:32,373
I just teach science,

402
00:38:33,484 --> 00:38:35,535
but I feel this school
might be the right place

403
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:36,920
for your daughter.

404
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:39,175
I'd love to have her here.

405
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,109
The doctors wanted me
to institutionalize her.

406
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:49,833
I don't know.

407
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,635
Dumping her at a boarding school
feels like another way to give her up.

408
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,804
But it's not.

409
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:59,111
It's just the first step
in getting her out into the world.

410
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:05,702
You saw the children making fun of her
and you want to protect her.

411
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:07,514
Of course I do.

412
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,390
What parent doesn't want to?

413
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,544
But at some point,
she's going to hit...

414
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:13,842
life head on.

415
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,936
And trust me,

416
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,089
we know how different she is.

417
00:39:22,632 --> 00:39:24,133
Different, not less.

418
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,185
Different, but not less.

419
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:32,842
You watch.

420
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:36,676
You'll make friends
and you're gonna ride horses.

421
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,265
What are you doing in with Chestnut?

422
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:42,018
No one is to go near that horse!

423
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:43,716
Can he be my horse?

424
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,278
He likes being hugged.

425
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,900
I want to ride him!

426
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:48,903
You'll ride.
Just not chestnut.

427
00:42:19,596 --> 00:42:22,063
<i>"Le pain est un aliment de base</i>

428

00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,448

<i>Il est...</i>

432
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:36,125
Why are so many fish in France?

433
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:40,063
French fish!

434
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:01,570
Excellent work.

435
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:03,163
Really excellent work.

436
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:10,065
French fish!

437
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:16,389
- What happened here?
- She hit him for no reason!

438
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:19,010
Come on, let's go.

439
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,335
- And he's done it before!
- Stop. Temple, stop.

440
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:26,131
Temple, Tim will be punished

441
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:28,950
for what he did,
but you cannot hit people.

442
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,720
You understand that?

443
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:32,724
Good.

444
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:35,813
To really get that through to you,
you'll not ride for two weeks.

445
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:37,440
But that's not fair!

446
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:38,984
Two weeks.

447
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:56,409
There's nothing there.

448
00:43:57,316 --> 00:43:59,724
And he's been like this
for three hours?

449
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:02,435
I don't think there's anything
anybody could have done.

450
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:07,291
I'll send the boy around with the truck.
Can you do that?

451
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,070
I'll take care of it, Dad.

452
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:44,847
Where do they go?

453
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,067
I don't know.

454
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,391
Heaven,

455
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:51,591
maybe, somewhere.

456
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:56,577
Temple, when...

457
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,030
animals and people die,

458
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,941
they stay with us in our minds.

459
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,134
We can still see them.

460
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:08,863
So I think it would best
not to remember Chestnut like this.

461
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:13,331
I see it the day I arrived.

462
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:15,795
I see grooming Chestnut.

463
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,465
I see a picture of a horse
just like Chestnut in a book.

464
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,510
We passed a Chestnut horse
on route 119 near a feed store.

465
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,379
On a calendar at Aunt Ann's,

466
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:26,943
there was one in <i>Life</i> magazine
opposite the page of Mr. Kennedy.

467
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:31,241
Can you bring everything
you've seen to your mind?

468
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:34,692
- Sure.
- Even if it were...

469
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:38,150
an everyday object like say shoes?

470
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:42,895
I see all the shoes I've worn,
my mother's and other people I've met.

471
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,975
You have three pairs,
one needs a new heel.

472
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,965
I see the newspaper ads,
TV ads and...

473
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:51,204
Can't you?

474
00:45:51,697 --> 00:45:53,563
This girl has an amazing mind.

475
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:55,816
Try teaching her math.
Her algebra's hopeless.

476
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:56,897
Or French.

477
00:45:57,065 --> 00:45:58,857
"Why are there so many fish
in France?"

478
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:00,615
I want to show you something.

479
00:46:01,456 --> 00:46:03,365
She thinks in pictures.

480
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:04,922
That's why she does so well

481
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:07,162
when she can see
that are being discussed.

482
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,124
Like...

483
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,332
biology?

484
00:46:12,387 --> 00:46:13,388
Or shop.

485
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:16,842
Those are concrete things.
But language or algebra?

486
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:18,762
It's just gibberish to her.

487
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:19,888
What's that?

488
00:46:20,515 --> 00:46:22,705
Do you want to see your French fish?

489
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,547
"The eels ate."

490
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:27,108
"<i>Il est.</i>"

491
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:28,933
"Eel ate."

492
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:31,573
<i>Ils sont, il danse, il pense.</i>

493
00:46:32,396 --> 00:46:33,898
French is full of "eels".

494
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:35,707
And this is what she sees.

495
00:46:35,982 --> 00:46:38,083
She's an amazing visual thinker.

496
00:46:44,462 --> 00:46:45,901
Let me work with her.

497
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:47,027
Fine.

498
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:51,477
We have five minutes left.

499
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:53,754
Who wants to see a movie?

500
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:02,243
JD, will you do the projector?

501
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,252
All right.
Now everybody watch very carefully

502
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:11,835
because this one
is all about optical illusions.

503
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:15,641
<i>It comes as a distinct shock
to most people</i>

504
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,119
<i>when they realised
how limited and how curated</i>

505
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:19,690
<i>the human senses really are.</i>

506
00:47:21,073 --> 00:47:24,974
<i>In this house, faces at the window
seem to come in assorted sizes.</i>

507
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,886
Looks like Mr. Povey, doesn't it?

508
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:30,205
<i>But there's nothing wrong
with the faces.</i>

509
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,164
<i>It's those windows
and what they're doing to your brain.</i>

510
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,208
All right, here we go.

511
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,561
<i>A small one and a tall one.</i>

512
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:42,887
<i>Let's see
if we can even things out a bit.</i>

513
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:49,903
- How do they do that?
- Sit down!

514
00:47:50,028 --> 00:47:51,566
Temple, sit down, please.

515
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:55,779
That is the question, isn't it?
"How did they do that?"

516
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:58,231
Well, that's this week's assignment.

517
00:47:58,356 --> 00:47:59,787
I want one page, at least.

518
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:02,241
- A full page?
- All right, two?

519
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:04,415
All right, one page.

520
00:48:05,379 --> 00:48:07,029
They mess with the perspective!

521
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:08,850
That's right, Temple.

522
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:11,429
And it was a room built
with distorted perspective.

523
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,598
But how?

524
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,477
Do you think
you could figure it out?

525
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,453
Maybe if you visualized it?

526
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,975
And if you build one,
I'll give you extra credit.

527
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:39,788
Weirdo!

528
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,842
Does she have to chalk the walls?

529
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:51,882
Look at her.

530
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:24,044
- I can't do it!
- I think you can.

531
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,269
But I can't!

532
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:27,170
I know.
I shouldn't shout.

533
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,876
But measuring perspective
didn't work!

534
00:49:54,113 --> 00:49:55,876
These are the specifications
you need.

535
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:01,143
Success, Temple?

536
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,150
Give me a clue, please!

537
00:50:06,512 --> 00:50:08,702
You have to think
of all the features in the room,

538
00:50:08,827 --> 00:50:11,190
The walls, the floors, the ceilings,

539
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:12,704
the doors.

540
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:13,696
Got it!

541
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,902
But as you can see,

542
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,818
the horses are the exact same size.

543
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:46,160
And here is the room!

544
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:52,503
Temple, congratulations.

545
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:56,514
I think this deserves
a round of applause.

546
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:02,876
I think it deserves...

547
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,352
a celebration.

548
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,491
Five,

549
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:09,694
four,

550
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:10,780
three

551
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:12,490
two, one.

552
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:36,324
Now here's a question:

553
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:38,753
if I wind this up,

554
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,068
and then let go,
why doesn't the propeller stay still,

555
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,757
and the body of the plane
spin around?

556
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:47,047
That's simple.
The resistance of the wings.

557
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,208
That's absolutely right.

558
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,584
And watch this.

559
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,731
With no wings,

560
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,391
and just one plane of resistance...

561
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:09,718
You have a helicopter!

562
00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:11,544
You're absolutely right.

563
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:16,376
You have a very special mind,

564
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:17,787
you know that?

565
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,842
You see the world in ways
that others can't,

566
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:23,012
that's quite an advantage.

567
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:26,417
And you know something?
If you weren't such a goof,

568
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,311
and you developed this talent,

569
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,295
you could easily go on to college.

570
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,919
What would I do at college?

571
00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:35,082
With your mind,
anything you wanted to.

572
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:36,707
Just pick a subject.

573
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:41,990
Cows.

574
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:44,235
- Do they have colleges with cows?
- They do.

575
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,340
And horses and pigs
and goats and sheep.

576
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,778
It's called "Animal Husbandry".

577
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:55,948
Animal husbandry.

578
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,161
It deals with the care of animals.

579
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:03,857
Really, anything you wanted.
You could study people, psychology.

580
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:06,259
I'd get to understand people?

581
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:08,250
Well, that's the idea.

582
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:12,816
I'll stay here.

583
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:18,177
Think of it as a door,

584
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:24,366
a door that's going to open up
onto a whole new world for you

585
00:53:24,491 --> 00:53:27,631
and all you need to do
is decide to go through it.

586
00:53:49,879 --> 00:53:50,914
{\- Miss grandin?
- }First off,

587
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,165
I talked to my old teacher Dr. Carlock.
He said I should stress that it wasn't

588
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,452
that I hadn't done the work
because I had,

589
00:53:56,577 --> 00:53:58,224
but I'd collected way too much data

590
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:00,615
and backed it up
with far too many citations,

591
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:03,512
that I needed extra time
to make it coherent.

592
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:06,067
Look at these results,
you'll see that it's not just me,

593
00:54:06,192 --> 00:54:09,420
but a majority of people
who become calmer when using my machine.

594
00:54:09,588 --> 00:54:12,446
And that really makes
a clear case for me keeping it.

595
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:14,302
And I should get a good grade.

596
00:54:14,703 --> 00:54:17,283
- Did your...
- Certainly more than a pass.

597
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:21,425
Did your previous teacher
suggest the good grade?

598
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:22,898
That's me.

599
00:54:23,642 --> 00:54:24,945
Leave it with me.

600
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,701
This is very important work!

601
00:54:43,993 --> 00:54:45,371
You used a control group?

602
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:48,719
They were tested resting, seating
most of them got bored.

603
00:54:48,844 --> 00:54:49,896
Page four.

604
00:54:57,325 --> 00:54:58,726
This is excellent.

605
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:00,579
I think it will be a good grade.

606
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:03,558
So I keep my machine.

607
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:06,933
In that case, I'll stay.

608
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:10,009
I would imagine your new roommate

609
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:12,613
will want a say in whether
you keep the machine.

610
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:24,931
That's my squeeze machine.

611
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,746
Do I have to move it?

612
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,789
Don't ever move it

613
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:32,223
and I'll always know where it is.

614
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,230
It's almost time
for <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>.

615
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:41,849
They play it in the rec room.
Do you want to watch it?

616
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,900
- You can't watch <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>
- I do.

617
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,384
I'd love to watch it.

618
00:55:50,053 --> 00:55:51,529
Will you show me where it is?

619
00:55:51,822 --> 00:55:52,872
Yeah, sure.

620
00:56:16,985 --> 00:56:19,347
Kuryakin's tryin' to open the door,
but it's locked.

621
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:24,579
And now the floor's sliding
under the room.

622
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,792
There's a big drop
to lots of spikes!

623
00:56:28,707 --> 00:56:30,509
The kids in the room hissing.

624
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:35,971
- Do you like <i>Star Trek</i> too?
- Yes.

625
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:38,099
Who's your favorite?

626
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,548
Mr. Spock.

627
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:42,181
We have a lot in common.

628
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:44,733
Maybe we can watch it on the radio.

629
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,363
- They broadcast it for the blind.
- They do?

630
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,315
Let's watch it on the radio.

631
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:55,273
You're quieter now.

632
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:59,477
Is that because you're
in your squeeze machine?

633
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:02,593
I was just getting out.

634
00:57:06,896 --> 00:57:08,588
Is my voice that different?

635
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:10,151
It is to me.

636
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:12,899
Remember, I see you
through your voice.

637
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:15,993
Do you remember a lot of voices?

638
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:17,727
Of course.

639
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:20,529
I remember the sounds of places too.

640
00:57:23,626 --> 00:57:24,801
We're the same,

641
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:27,874
only you have sounds
and I have pictures.

642
00:57:30,286 --> 00:57:31,542
I'm off to class.

643
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:35,442
I have French class.

644
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:37,015
I hate it.

645
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:39,899
It's why I'm in my squeeze machine.

646
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,590
Your squeeze machine
doesn't bother me.

647
00:57:43,947 --> 00:57:44,902
I know.

648
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,641
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

649
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:49,592
Good luck.

650
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:53,294
Thank you.

651
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:13,595
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

652
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:24,960
<i>I've always wanted to understand
the gentleness</i>

653
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,168
<i>that other people feel
by being hugged by their mothers.</i>

654
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,726
<i>Now I've made a machine
that lets me do that.</i>

655
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:35,025
<i>It feels like
a wire gets reconnected,</i>

656
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:37,580
<i>like something gets repaired.</i>

657
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:43,834
If it wasn't for my machine,
I wouldn't be standing here today.

658
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,139
Instead I'd be hiding in my room

659
00:58:46,264 --> 00:58:48,710
or spinning in circles
to calm myself

660
00:58:48,878 --> 00:58:50,234
or hitting someone.

661
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:54,765
When I was younger,
I closed myself off from people.

662
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:57,785
I didn't even speak
until I was four.

663
00:58:58,684 --> 00:59:00,811
There's a high falutin' name
for that condition:

664
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:02,319
autism.

665
00:59:10,307 --> 00:59:11,819
Because of my machine,

666
00:59:11,944 --> 00:59:14,164
I'm able to know
the kindness and love

667
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:17,544
that have been given to me
to reach this point in my life.

668
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:21,409
Today more than ever,
I realize I have not walked alone.

669
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,222
And I thank not only my teachers
but my friends and family as well.

670
00:59:26,302 --> 00:59:29,080
As in the words
of the song from <i>Carousel</i>.

671
01:01:43,684 --> 01:01:45,055
This is my door.

672
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:48,426
It opens to another world.

673
01:02:20,746 --> 01:02:22,944
Arizona state students,
gather around.

674
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:24,463
Come on, everybody.

675
01:02:24,588 --> 01:02:26,616
Come on down this way.
There we go.

676
01:02:32,793 --> 01:02:35,254
Come on in closer.
Gather around so you can hear.

677
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:37,007
All right, class, listen up.

678
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:39,540
This is Don Michaels.
He runs the feedlot.

679
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:40,799
Thanks.

680
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:43,287
What we got here at any one time

681
01:02:43,412 --> 01:02:45,528
is about 50, 52,000 head of cattle.

682
01:02:46,374 --> 01:02:48,932
They gotta weigh 650 lbs
to get in here.

683
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,472
During months they spend here,
they'll put on another 400 lbs

684
01:02:52,597 --> 01:02:55,367
before they move into the big house
for slaughterin'.

685
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:57,957
While they're fattenin' up,
we gotta keep 'em healthy.

686
01:02:58,082 --> 01:03:00,751
So the first thing we do
when they come in and off the range

687
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:03,296
is put 'em through a dip.
Get rid of any bugs.

688
01:03:04,691 --> 01:03:06,706
Excuse me there, buddy.
You okay?

689
01:03:07,095 --> 01:03:08,233
That's a girl.

690
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:11,558
Are you here?

691
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:14,212
I was listening to the cattle.

692
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:18,676
Why are some mooing
more loudly than others?

693
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:20,510
I never heard so much mooing!

694
01:03:21,074 --> 01:03:23,076
I've been around cattle
all my workin' life.

695
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:25,871
About all I can tell you is,
that just like females,

696
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:28,718
cattle love to yammer and gossip...

697
01:03:28,843 --> 01:03:30,086
or sulk.

698
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:32,589
It's always just one thing
or the other.

699
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:36,187
- Like I was sayin'...
- There must be a reason.

700
01:03:36,888 --> 01:03:39,475
I reckon' you could get
Dr. Doolittle on out here.

701
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:41,211
He probably could tell you.

702
01:03:42,015 --> 01:03:45,024
While missy here is listenin'
to what are sayin' to each other,

703
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:48,204
why don't you boys step over here
with me and see a dip in action?

704
01:03:58,937 --> 01:04:01,590
Now the biggest problem you got
with a dip vat

705
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:04,345
is that cattle can swim alright
unless they tip on over.

706
01:04:04,914 --> 01:04:06,924
Then them babies'll drown
real fast on ya

707
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:09,186
unless you get a hold of 'em
and haul 'em out.

708
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:27,963
There you go!
This is what I was tellin' ya.

709
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:29,132
Jesus!

710
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:35,808
Come on. Earn your money!

711
01:04:38,898 --> 01:04:40,023
Hold 'em up!

712
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,863
We're gonna lose that baby.

713
01:04:47,869 --> 01:04:50,239
Roy, get a rope on this heifer
and drag it out!

714
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:07,180
There you go. You'll see inside.

715
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:09,387
It'll take more than that
to kill a cow.

716
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:11,420
Do you lose many?

717
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,032
We got to run 300 of 'em in an hour.

718
01:05:14,548 --> 01:05:17,913
In a week, we'll lose one or two maybe.
We're doin' pretty good.

719
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:31,015
Dr. Doolittle,

720
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:33,384
how you holdin' up?
Too much for ya?

721
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,856
They like to walk in circles.

722
01:05:36,813 --> 01:05:39,820
What do you know, boys?
Cattle like to walk in circles!

723
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:42,128
Dang, give that girl a prize.

724
01:05:42,784 --> 01:05:45,579
It calms 'em down to walk in circles
away from the handlers.

725
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,793
Maybe you oughta wait out here
when we go inside.

726
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:08,654
Then when we have it in the cage,

727
01:06:08,779 --> 01:06:10,887
it just takes one knock to the head.

728
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:23,134
So, Doolittle,

729
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,829
what do you think?

730
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:29,114
Where does it go?

731
01:06:30,355 --> 01:06:31,579
Meat processing.

732
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:34,697
No, where does it go?

733
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:37,113
It was here, now it's meat.

734
01:06:38,867 --> 01:06:40,168
Where did it go?

735
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:42,153
Professor,

736
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,133
I think maybe your young lady
oughta consider another line of work.

737
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:29,202
Mooing?

738
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:32,154
You want to do research
and write your master's on mooing.

739
01:07:32,497 --> 01:07:34,356
Cattle like curves.
They don't moo at curves.

740
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:36,535
Miss Grandin,
when we accepted you,

741
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:39,473
we were impressed you had excelled
at your previous school.

742
01:07:40,116 --> 01:07:43,682
A master's thesis on mooing
strikes me as a lowering of the bar

743
01:07:43,807 --> 01:07:45,719
And I will not be the first person

744
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:48,197
to give you an easy ride
because of your autism.

745
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,680
- Come up...
- Cattle are prey animals.

746
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:53,962
My autism allows me
to understand prey animals well.

747
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:56,744
I can visualize
the flight zones of cattle.

748
01:07:57,166 --> 01:07:58,943
A handler outside the flight zone

749
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:01,763
can keep an animal circling
in a calm and orderly manner.

750
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:04,785
But stepping into the flight zone
panics the cattle.

751
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:06,496
And they change from soft moos

752
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:08,104
to loud mooing.

753
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:10,791
Prey animals don't make noises
that will draw attention to 'em

754
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,931
unless they're warning
other members of the herd.

755
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:15,582
They're warning each other
they're going to be slaughtered?

756
01:08:16,886 --> 01:08:18,408
The loud mooing is the same

757
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:21,857
whether they're gonna be dipped, driven
around a hard corner or taken to slaughter.

758
01:08:21,982 --> 01:08:23,980
They have no idea
what's gonna happen to 'em,

759
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:25,878
- We agree.
- but they're spooked.

760
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:28,571
Spooked cattle don't act straight.

761
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:32,117
They get bruised, scraped, drowned,

762
01:08:32,285 --> 01:08:33,751
that all costs money.

763
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,143
It takes a good half hour
to calm a herd,

764
01:08:36,268 --> 01:08:37,563
that costs money too.

765
01:08:37,688 --> 01:08:39,692
It's not a good way to run
a stockyard.

766
01:08:39,922 --> 01:08:43,468
I believe what's good for cattle
is also good for business.

767
01:08:49,812 --> 01:08:51,727
Get the yard to sign off on it.

768
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:53,934
You mean Don.

769
01:08:54,388 --> 01:08:56,039
That's who's in charge.

770
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:05,123
Sorry, ma'am.
No women on the lot.

771
01:09:05,696 --> 01:09:07,401
My name is Temple Grandin.

772
01:09:07,527 --> 01:09:10,216
- I'm a grad student at Arizona State.
- That's the rules.

773
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:14,304
I'm a grad student at Arizona State
and I was here last week.

774
01:09:14,473 --> 01:09:17,351
Complaints from cowboys' wives.
They don't want no women.

775
01:09:17,952 --> 01:09:19,271
I'm just doin' my job.

776
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,725
Ma'am, you're holdin' up the line.

777
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:28,368
You'll have to turn around
and take it on off the lot.

778
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:29,343
Please.

779
01:09:33,445 --> 01:09:34,761
Don't come back!

780
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,266
John Richmond, press,
<i>Ranchman Magazine</i>.

781
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:40,342
Go on in.

782
01:09:49,637 --> 01:09:50,738
<i>It's a door.</i>

783
01:09:51,904 --> 01:09:53,305
<i>It's another door.</i>

784
01:10:05,716 --> 01:10:06,883
Thanks, take care.

785
01:10:43,863 --> 01:10:45,764
- Good mornin'.
- Go on in.

786
01:10:53,566 --> 01:10:55,217
- Mornin'.
- Go on in.

787
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,199
Hi, Sanch.

788
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,435
Good to have you back.
A long time since you worked here.

789
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,601
Yeah, it does.

790
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,681
- What's this, Purple Heart?
- It is.

791
01:11:10,806 --> 01:11:12,311
We're real proud of ya.

792
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:15,015
Jeez, you didn't get all these
just diggin' latrines.

793
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,363
- No, sir. I was in Khe Sanh.
- Good for you.

794
01:11:17,531 --> 01:11:20,095
Excuse me, sir.
I need you to sign my master's thesis.

795
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:23,100
- How'd you get in here?
- They just waved me in.

796
01:11:23,774 --> 01:11:25,381
What are you gonna research?

797
01:11:25,506 --> 01:11:27,007
Agitation in cattle.

798
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,297
Would that be mooing?

799
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,635
You believe that crap?

800
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,137
Since cattle are prey animals,
loud mooing is a sign...

801
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:35,156
No way.

802
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,737
Come on, let's get some coffee.

803
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:41,146
Did you bring back
a little china gals with ya?

804
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:44,293
No, they wouldn't let me
bring back one on the airplane.

805
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:46,947
You girls
got the coffee ready in here?

806
01:11:47,117 --> 01:11:49,827
- We got a man that's thirsty.
- Come on in!

807
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,035
Do you have another entrance?

808
01:12:19,518 --> 01:12:20,369
Pardon?

809
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:22,846
Do you have another entrance?

810
01:12:23,337 --> 01:12:24,337
No, ma'am.

811
01:12:37,764 --> 01:12:39,569
Do you have any jell-o or yogurt?

812
01:12:39,737 --> 01:12:42,283
In the cooler.
Right behind you, darlin'.

813
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:16,332
<i>By eating weaker and slower ones,</i>

814
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:18,918
<i>lions keep antelope population</i>

815
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:21,643
<i>strong and in proper proportion</i>

816
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:23,448
<i>to all other animals.</i>

817
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:49,224
Light.
Shadow.

818
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:07,132
Reflections on puddle.

819
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:50,283
I've eaten bulls' testicles!

820
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:52,692
Ate 'em in my aunt's ranch...

821
01:14:52,817 --> 01:14:53,809
Regularly!

822
01:14:57,816 --> 01:14:59,167
This is a waste!

823
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:58,438
You gotta remember
to drink out here.

824
01:15:58,984 --> 01:16:01,042
I have data
on things that make 'em balk.

825
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:02,884
Shadows, reflections on water,

826
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:05,053
- chain glinting in the sun.
- Is that right?

827
01:16:05,178 --> 01:16:07,759
They won't walk in shaded areas.
They must see where they're goin'.

828
01:16:07,884 --> 01:16:11,487
I've lots of important information,
I need Mr. Michaels to sign off on it.

829
01:16:11,678 --> 01:16:13,474
Don?
Don don't sign nothin'.

830
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:16,217
- I need Mr. Michaels...
- You're not hearin' me.

831
01:16:16,342 --> 01:16:17,992
Don don't sign nothin'.

832
01:16:18,987 --> 01:16:20,988
I sign everything around here.

833
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,201
His signature...

834
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:25,320
but I do the signin'.

835
01:16:26,636 --> 01:16:28,887
I'm not even sure if Don can write.

836
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:32,598
Say...

837
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:35,425
you're interested in cattle
and how they act,

838
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,713
you shouldn't
just hang around feedlots.

839
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:41,029
You should be out on ranches,
auctions, rodeos...

840
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,131
that sort of thing.

841
01:16:48,689 --> 01:16:50,732
<i>Got the big steer here. 1,000 lbs.</i>

842
01:16:50,926 --> 01:16:53,905
<i>Let's go!
20. 25. 25 and a half.</i>

843
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:56,574
- <i>He's 25 and a half, 75.</i>
- He looks mean.

844
01:16:56,743 --> 01:16:58,953
<i>25, 75. 30. 30.</i>

845
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:01,373
<i>Sold him on pat 17.</i>

846
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:06,258
<i>Look at his mama here.
Now, 75, I got 25.</i>

847
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,176
<i>25. 25.
27 and a half.</i>

848
01:17:08,344 --> 01:17:10,404
<i>He's 27. 30.
32 and a half. 35.</i>

849
01:17:10,529 --> 01:17:12,626
<i>Sold 'em.
Pat 21. Pat 21.</i>

850
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,918
A good magazine.
Take a look.

851
01:17:31,086 --> 01:17:33,470
Help you out
with all kinds of cattle questions.

852
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:39,044
See you back here
in about 5 minutes, OK?

853
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:40,654
Excuse...

854
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:47,559
It's all doors to new worlds.

855
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:58,647
Excuse me, sir?
Sir?

856
01:17:59,128 --> 01:18:02,509
Very pleased to meet you.
Temple Grandin, bachelor of science,

857
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:04,301
doin' my masters at Arizona State,

858
01:18:04,469 --> 01:18:06,454
studying in Scottsdale feed yards.

859
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:09,945
I was wondering if I could interest
the <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman</i> periodical

860
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:12,741
on a thesis I'm writing
on control systems and cattle

861
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:16,169
and why some work better than others
and how they can tell the difference.

862
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:20,867
How'd you get on with old Don Michaels
over at Scottsdale?

863
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,289
I told him
I've eaten bull testicles, sir.

864
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,708
I will read anything
you send in, Miss Grandin.

865
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:31,175
In fact, here...
Take my card.

866
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,963
You address it directly to me.

867
01:18:41,732 --> 01:18:42,733
It's open.

868
01:18:43,777 --> 01:18:47,505
Sir, Scottsdale feedlot signed off
on my cattle agitation study.

869
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,910
Smells like half the herd
signed it first.

870
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:53,460
No, sir.
Cattle can't do that.

871
01:18:53,585 --> 01:18:56,255
And I don't need the magazine.
I'm a subscriber.

872
01:18:56,639 --> 01:18:58,750
I just wanna make sure
you saw my article

873
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:01,032
on mooing as a guide
to cattle agitation.

874
01:19:01,254 --> 01:19:04,814
Full thesis is still at the typist,
but you should have it by Friday.

875
01:19:17,354 --> 01:19:18,204
Well...

876
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,935
Master of science.

877
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,496
Master of science
and animal science.

878
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:25,463
Fantastic.
I bet you're glad to be back east.

879
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,467
- I like the west.
- Oh, so do I,

880
01:19:28,635 --> 01:19:30,095
but it isn't home, is it?

881
01:19:30,263 --> 01:19:33,869
What will you do with your masters?
Your mother mentioned teaching maybe.

882
01:19:33,994 --> 01:19:36,043
Great new school
over West Medford way.

883
01:19:36,168 --> 01:19:38,869
I have a lot of more research to do
and things to write.

884
01:19:38,994 --> 01:19:40,652
Right, you've been published.

885
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,271
You remember Scott?

886
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,159
Over here.

887
01:19:45,353 --> 01:19:47,152
- Be right back.
- Our oldest boy.

888
01:19:47,277 --> 01:19:49,958
New York Magazine's
taken a piece of his.

889
01:19:50,427 --> 01:19:51,878
You remember Scott?

890
01:19:52,338 --> 01:19:54,298
He used to spit in my jell-o.

891
01:19:54,466 --> 01:19:55,917
I'm sure he didn't.

892
01:19:57,678 --> 01:19:59,415
Tell Scott about your writing.

893
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:03,841
I published two articles
in the <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman</i>.

894
01:20:04,348 --> 01:20:06,274
- The Ariz...
- <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman</i>.

895
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:09,445
One was on good moos and bad moos.

896
01:20:09,613 --> 01:20:13,074
The other was on head restraints
and cattle chutes and killing pens.

897
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:15,501
Really badly designed.
Just terrible systems.

898
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:16,559
Just...

899
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:20,295
It's lovely to see you, Temple.

900
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:21,933
Bye.

901
01:20:22,836 --> 01:20:24,136
Merry Christmas.

902
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:26,956
Merry Christmas!

903
01:20:29,059 --> 01:20:30,860
I need my squeeze machine!

904
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:37,630
I hate parties!

905
01:20:38,428 --> 01:20:41,368
There are too many people
and no one listens to me.

906
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:44,585
They keep giving each other looks
and I don't know what they mean.

907
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:46,495
They're just uncomfortable.

908
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:49,630
People don't wanna hear all those...

909
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:52,092
- details about cattle.
- Well, I do.

910
01:20:52,418 --> 01:20:54,069
I wanna be with cattle.

911
01:20:54,194 --> 01:20:55,305
Sweetheart...

912
01:20:55,473 --> 01:20:57,624
I don't want you to avoid people.

913
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:01,544
- They make me feel bad.
- Then ignore them!

914
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:07,649
You are the only
Master of science in the room.

915
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:11,439
And I am so proud of you.

916
01:21:13,357 --> 01:21:14,417
Look at me.

917
01:21:14,585 --> 01:21:15,635
Look at me.

918
01:21:15,919 --> 01:21:17,339
Do you know if people...

919
01:21:17,464 --> 01:21:19,916
tell each other things
with their eyes,

920
01:21:21,701 --> 01:21:23,799
this is me telling you...

921
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,483
that I love you...

922
01:21:25,608 --> 01:21:27,009
and I respect you.

923
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:38,393
I will never learn how to do that.

924
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:41,817
I know.

925
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:09,632
Damn it!

926
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,674
You are not allowed in here.

927
01:22:13,004 --> 01:22:15,758
- I'm doin' research for article.
- We put up with you sneakin' in

928
01:22:15,926 --> 01:22:18,512
when you was at Arizona State,
but you're done.

929
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,121
No college,
no insurance coverage, no access.

930
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,988
There are many articles
I'd like to write for you.

931
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:41,327
Firstly, how cattle can be introduced
into dip vats on their own accord.

932
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:43,883
- Secondly...
- Hold on, Miss Grandin.

933
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:46,901
Firstly, your articles
have been greatly appreciated.

934
01:22:47,026 --> 01:22:48,306
I got a lot of calls.

935
01:22:48,474 --> 01:22:50,184
Folks think you talk sense.

936
01:22:50,309 --> 01:22:53,760
Secondly, I told you
I would read anything that you write.

937
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:57,695
Thirdly, young lady,
you need another set of clothes

938
01:22:57,863 --> 01:23:00,783
- when you come in town on business.
- I need to be a press person.

939
01:23:00,951 --> 01:23:02,307
Can I get a press pass?

940
01:23:02,432 --> 01:23:04,282
You askin' for a staff job?

941
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:07,116
I ain't got but four staff,

942
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:09,629
and two of them
are bookkeeping and distribution.

943
01:23:09,797 --> 01:23:13,279
No, I don't wanna work here.
I wanna be with cattle, I need a pass.

944
01:23:13,926 --> 01:23:15,579
Well, we can do that.

945
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,105
But like I said...

946
01:23:18,406 --> 01:23:20,467
Mary-Anne?
Get in here.

947
01:23:23,443 --> 01:23:24,243
Sir?

948
01:23:25,243 --> 01:23:27,425
How's that workin'
for ya, Miss Grandin?

949
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,751
It doesn't itch.
I like it a lot.

950
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:36,961
That's my rank.

951
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:39,507
They'll be able to see that.

952
01:23:43,082 --> 01:23:43,983
Damn it!

953
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:01,874
Use it, Temple.
You stink.

954
01:24:01,999 --> 01:24:02,999
Thank you.

955
01:24:04,788 --> 01:24:06,289
Miss Temple Grandin?

956
01:24:06,992 --> 01:24:09,854
I'm Ted Gilbert,
from John Wayne's red river feedlot.

957
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:12,723
- Hello, very pleased to meet you.
- I've been reading your stuff.

958
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:15,227
How'd you like
to put it into practice?

959
01:24:15,579 --> 01:24:18,731
See, I lost my designer
and I need a new cattle dip.

960
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:20,889
Can you do it?

961
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:22,518
It's pretty simple,

962
01:24:22,643 --> 01:24:25,305
but, I gotta present plans
in five days.

963
01:24:26,223 --> 01:24:27,024
Sure!

964
01:25:09,197 --> 01:25:12,770
- Very clever. How did you find this?
- I see things and put 'em together.

965
01:25:13,128 --> 01:25:14,279
And all this?

966
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:16,935
To lead the cattle in.
Happy to follow a curve

967
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,955
thinking goin' back
where they came from.

968
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,584
- If you say so.
- I do.

969
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:24,625
- How long will it take you to do it?
- I have two or three more before this.

970
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:28,112
- But I need it by tomorrow!
- Everybody needs it tomorrow.

971
01:25:33,049 --> 01:25:36,056
- I won't work quicker if you watch.
- I wanna watch.

972
01:26:24,253 --> 01:26:26,880
This here is Red Harris
from <i>Cattle Magazine</i>.

973
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,582
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Harris.

974
01:26:28,707 --> 01:26:32,355
He can't make the grand opening,
so we could give him a sneak preview.

975
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,592
So, Temple, will you put some cattle
through your dip while I'm here?

976
01:26:38,396 --> 01:26:39,847
Hey, open the gate!

977
01:26:45,946 --> 01:26:49,747
So if the handlers walk slowly clockwise
outside the chute,

978
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:54,249
then the cow will walk counterclockwise
through the chute.

979
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:58,426
See? They'll just follow that curve.

980
01:27:02,142 --> 01:27:04,562
The cattle just keep calmly walking

981
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:07,640
thinking they're goin' in circles
and followin' their buddies.

982
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:10,913
And they're happy to follow a curve

983
01:27:11,038 --> 01:27:14,065
because they think they're going'back
to where they came from.

984
01:27:15,329 --> 01:27:18,089
They're okay because it's grooved
and they know they won't slip.

985
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:20,684
So when they take the next step,
their center of gravity

986
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,644
makes them drop calmly into the dip

987
01:27:22,769 --> 01:27:24,843
and they just walk
through the water.

988
01:27:38,061 --> 01:27:40,289
I don't usually tell people
what I'm gonna write,

989
01:27:40,414 --> 01:27:43,662
but, Miss Grandin,
this is a masterpiece.

990
01:27:49,839 --> 01:27:52,528
- I don't want you to do that.
- I'm sorry there, Temple.

991
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:56,264
Now, look, I want you to be dressed in
your best outfit tomorrow mornin', okay?

992
01:28:12,622 --> 01:28:14,207
Just look at this thing.

993
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,977
It'll take us forever
to get them through here.

994
01:28:17,102 --> 01:28:19,014
J.D., I want you
to get the torch and red,

995
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:21,907
and I want this out, this out,
I want those panels lined up

996
01:28:22,032 --> 01:28:24,021
and we're gonna run 'em straight in.
Come on.

997
01:28:24,146 --> 01:28:25,356
You two come with me.

998
01:28:25,481 --> 01:28:27,592
- Grab the other end of this.
- Now hold on!

999
01:28:28,902 --> 01:28:32,033
Look at this! I mean, look at that!
Who'd build somethin' like that?

1000
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:35,833
Jess, get me some sheet steel.
We're gonna slide these puppies in here.

1001
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,284
- Where's that sheet steel?
- Hurry up!

1002
01:28:48,442 --> 01:28:49,785
Let's go.
Get up.

1003
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:52,463
- Put 'em over and get 'em out of here.
- She's here.

1004
01:28:52,588 --> 01:28:56,144
Don't keep worried, boys.
I'll take care of her. Pick it up.

1005
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:04,448
Some dip you got here.

1006
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:11,889
Who put steel on that slope?

1007
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:13,828
Cattle can't walk on steel!

1008
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,632
That's designed
so they'll walk slowly!

1009
01:29:16,757 --> 01:29:19,968
'Scuse me, little miss.
We just had three head drown in here.

1010
01:29:20,265 --> 01:29:24,034
That's your fault! You killed 'em
'cause of your stupidity!

1011
01:29:27,608 --> 01:29:29,819
And why ain't they comin'
through the curved chute?

1012
01:29:29,988 --> 01:29:32,047
That'd take us all day little lady!

1013
01:29:33,029 --> 01:29:34,910
Hey, that's my shirt!

1014
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,279
If it's smooth, they'll follow it!

1015
01:29:37,404 --> 01:29:39,635
If there's stuff on it,
they'll get scared!

1016
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,361
You can't hang things!

1017
01:29:41,997 --> 01:29:44,841
- You wacko!
- Put it all back the way it was!

1018
01:29:45,137 --> 01:29:47,088
Temple, what's goin' on here?

1019
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:50,816
They killed three cattle
because of their stupidity!

1020
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:52,941
They ruined it!

1021
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:57,318
Just a minute!

1022
01:29:59,614 --> 01:30:02,617
Cattle aren't dangerous!
And they're predictable.

1023
01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:05,272
- it's not hard to design...
- What are you doing in California?

1024
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:08,260
But the cowboys
would rather prod 'em and scare 'em.

1025
01:30:08,385 --> 01:30:09,811
Did you drive all night?

1026
01:30:09,936 --> 01:30:12,282
I designed a dip vat
at John Red River feedlot

1027
01:30:12,592 --> 01:30:14,485
based on the way cattle
see and behave

1028
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:17,054
and the editor of <i>Cattle Magazine</i>
said it was a masterpiece

1029
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,477
but the cowboys
killed three cows in it. Three...

1030
01:30:21,021 --> 01:30:22,272
in five minutes

1031
01:30:22,397 --> 01:30:24,650
because they wouldn't
follow my design!

1032
01:30:24,818 --> 01:30:27,697
- Would you like to sit down, or...
- I can't protect the cattle...

1033
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:29,299
Would you like a cup of tea?

1034
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,454
... system from the moment they enter
to the moment they get slaughtered.

1035
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:37,152
- You're talking about a slaughterhouse?
- Of course they'll be slaughtered.

1036
01:30:37,277 --> 01:30:40,365
Do you think we'd have cattle
if people didn't eat 'em every day?

1037
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:42,827
They'd just be funny-lookin' animals
in zoos.

1038
01:30:42,952 --> 01:30:45,244
No, we raise them for us.

1039
01:30:45,975 --> 01:30:48,125
That means we owe them some respect.

1040
01:30:49,729 --> 01:30:53,109
Nature is cruel,
but we don't have to be.

1041
01:30:54,089 --> 01:30:57,716
I wouldn't want to have my guts
ripped out by a lion.

1042
01:30:58,026 --> 01:31:01,412
I'd much rather die in a slaughterhouse
if it was done right!

1043
01:31:01,537 --> 01:31:04,813
- It seems to me that you should be...
- We can easily do it in a way

1044
01:31:04,938 --> 01:31:08,413
where they don't feel pain
and they don't get scared.

1045
01:31:08,538 --> 01:31:11,409
- And their cortisol levels...
- Did you hear what I said?

1046
01:31:11,534 --> 01:31:14,011
I think you're the one
who should design the slaughterhouse.

1047
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:17,771
I know a slaughterhouse that's a mess
and I know exactly how to fix it.

1048
01:31:52,992 --> 01:31:54,093
It's a door.

1049
01:31:54,751 --> 01:31:56,152
It's another door.

1050
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:06,051
Can I help you?

1051
01:32:06,276 --> 01:32:09,556
Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I'd like to tour your slaughterhouse.

1052
01:32:09,786 --> 01:32:10,850
Excuse me?

1053
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:15,197
Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I'd like to tour your slaughterhouse.

1054
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,121
We don't do tours, ma'am.

1055
01:32:17,361 --> 01:32:19,709
I designed a drip vat
at John Wayne's red river feedlot

1056
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:23,802
- that the editor of <i>Cattle Magazine</i>...
- Security? Can I get security?

1057
01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:54,225
<i>I'm so sorry to leave this message
on your answering machine,</i>

1058
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:56,325
but I thought you'd want to know

1059
01:32:56,502 --> 01:32:59,381
that your friend
Dr. Carlock has died.

1060
01:32:59,913 --> 01:33:01,005
I just saw him!

1061
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:03,345
Apparently, he'd been sick
for some time.

1062
01:33:03,562 --> 01:33:05,262
You can call me anytime.

1063
01:33:06,308 --> 01:33:07,609
Bye, sweetheart.

1064
01:33:09,247 --> 01:33:10,498
I just saw him.

1065
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:20,718
What are they doing?

1066
01:33:21,957 --> 01:33:23,632
They're paying their respects.

1067
01:33:23,757 --> 01:33:27,338
It's a way of saying
thank you and goodbye.

1068
01:33:28,045 --> 01:33:30,142
I said goodbye when I saw him.

1069
01:33:30,683 --> 01:33:33,472
This is a final chance
to say goodbye.

1070
01:34:49,326 --> 01:34:51,672
- Are you all right?
- I'm leaving now.

1071
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:54,982
- It isn't over yet.
- I said goodbye when I saw him.

1072
01:34:55,107 --> 01:34:56,358
He's not there.

1073
01:34:59,017 --> 01:35:00,718
I've got him in my mind.

1074
01:35:04,248 --> 01:35:06,049
Do you know where they go?

1075
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:10,012
No, I don't.

1076
01:35:14,327 --> 01:35:16,028
Okay.
I'm gonna go now.

1077
01:35:27,742 --> 01:35:28,893
Drive safely.

1078
01:35:58,135 --> 01:35:59,686
There you are, ma'am.

1079
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:17,203
My, that's a pretty blouse.

1080
01:36:18,666 --> 01:36:20,963
I hope you don't mind me sayin' so.

1081
01:36:21,088 --> 01:36:23,552
Some people think I'm forward,
but, if I like somethin',

1082
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:26,529
I just come right out
and just compliment 'em.

1083
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,974
It's nice to get a compliment,
don't you think?

1084
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:33,422
Thank you. It's very nice to meet you.
I'm Temple Grandin.

1085
01:36:33,547 --> 01:36:36,248
Well, it's nice to meet you too.
I'm Betty.

1086
01:36:37,883 --> 01:36:39,584
Well then, there we are.

1087
01:36:41,551 --> 01:36:43,437
Are you waitin' to meet somebody?

1088
01:36:43,729 --> 01:36:46,756
No, I have trouble with automatic doors
sometimes when I'm nervous.

1089
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:48,032
I'm autistic.

1090
01:36:50,198 --> 01:36:54,045
My son is artistic and he's got
the same thing with airplanes.

1091
01:36:54,462 --> 01:36:56,829
Come on.
You just come along with me.

1092
01:36:58,568 --> 01:36:59,979
All right.
Come on.

1093
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:03,086
And I'll make sure
that they stay open.

1094
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:09,058
All right? You are safe now.
You're safe.

1095
01:37:17,556 --> 01:37:18,599
My pleasure.

1096
01:37:19,664 --> 01:37:22,527
Are you a horsewoman?
I mean, you know, your shirt?

1097
01:37:22,652 --> 01:37:25,258
I like horses,
but I work with cattle.

1098
01:37:25,703 --> 01:37:28,897
I designed a dip
that <i>Cattle Magazine</i> called brilliant.

1099
01:37:29,022 --> 01:37:32,036
Oh my golly,
my husband read about you.

1100
01:37:32,161 --> 01:37:33,811
He works over at Abbot.

1101
01:37:34,147 --> 01:37:36,477
- Abbot slaughterhouse?
- Yeah. You heard of it?

1102
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:39,326
I wanna redesign it. I went there,
but they wouldn't let me meet with them.

1103
01:37:39,451 --> 01:37:41,684
But I have several ideas
about how to make a new facility

1104
01:37:41,809 --> 01:37:44,373
that will be much more
humane and efficient.

1105
01:37:44,843 --> 01:37:47,694
I guess you just have
to meet my husband then.

1106
01:37:48,122 --> 01:37:50,563
How wonderful
that we bumped into each other.

1107
01:37:53,862 --> 01:37:56,537
A door opened and I went through it.

1108
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:57,990
Yes, you did.

1109
01:37:58,772 --> 01:37:59,972
And I held it.

1110
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,621
This looks like an airport for cows.

1111
01:38:11,415 --> 01:38:13,666
I didn't mean that as a compliment.

1112
01:38:14,015 --> 01:38:16,016
And conveyor belts for cattle?

1113
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:20,381
Do you have any idea
what the cost is on this?

1114
01:38:21,112 --> 01:38:23,987
And you've got
solid walls and floors.

1115
01:38:24,885 --> 01:38:27,283
We have those slatted for a reason.

1116
01:38:27,806 --> 01:38:29,286
- It's cheaper.
- I'm sorry.

1117
01:38:29,455 --> 01:38:32,500
It's clear you don't have the experience
to design something like this.

1118
01:38:32,767 --> 01:38:34,520
The walls are solid so the cattle

1119
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:37,528
won't be distracted
by light or movement outside.

1120
01:38:37,654 --> 01:38:39,062
They balk at unexpected things.

1121
01:38:39,187 --> 01:38:41,697
I'm sure that's nice for the cattle,
but the cost, miss...

1122
01:38:41,822 --> 01:38:45,812
How much money does it cost you
to pay handlers to prod the cattle along

1123
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:48,378
and then hold 'em back
when they stampede?

1124
01:38:48,503 --> 01:38:51,695
How many times a day do your chutes stop
because of pile-ups?

1125
01:38:52,182 --> 01:38:55,756
How many cows break a leg
and bring everything to a halt?

1126
01:38:55,881 --> 01:38:58,189
With my system,
there'd be none of that.

1127
01:38:58,314 --> 01:39:00,929
There'd be a steady calm flow.

1128
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:04,903
That sounds great, but you don't have
any idea of whether it'll work.

1129
01:39:05,028 --> 01:39:06,028
But I do.

1130
01:39:06,552 --> 01:39:09,807
I'm like Nikola Tesla or Thomas Edison,
I know it will work

1131
01:39:09,932 --> 01:39:12,689
'cause I've been through it
a thousand times in my head.

1132
01:39:12,814 --> 01:39:14,980
I can see a chute
just as the cattle will

1133
01:39:15,148 --> 01:39:16,816
because my autism lets me do it.

1134
01:39:17,432 --> 01:39:19,612
I can walk through a plan
in my mind,

1135
01:39:19,883 --> 01:39:22,797
examining every beam
and every rivet.

1136
01:39:23,112 --> 01:39:26,763
You just see a plan,
but I'm walkin' through the whole plant.

1137
01:39:28,523 --> 01:39:32,043
Okay, the cattle go
through series of solid curves.

1138
01:39:32,168 --> 01:39:35,014
The floor is solid too... grooved.

1139
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:37,775
The chute gets smaller,
but the cattle won't mind.

1140
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,368
They don't see any danger.

1141
01:39:39,493 --> 01:39:42,058
They think
they're just gettin' into another truck.

1142
01:39:42,569 --> 01:39:45,062
The stairway leads
them gently upwards.

1143
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:48,000
The floor becomes a conveyor.

1144
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:50,720
A rest rises up to meet their chest

1145
01:39:50,845 --> 01:39:52,896
so they're comfortably carried.

1146
01:39:54,259 --> 01:39:56,180
They'll be very calm.

1147
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:10,813
<i>Nature is cruel,
but we don't have to be.</i>

1148
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:14,116
We owe them some respect.

1149
01:40:18,052 --> 01:40:20,536
I touched the first cow
as it was being stunned.

1150
01:40:21,617 --> 01:40:24,187
In a few seconds, it was gonna be
just another piece of beef, but...

1151
01:40:24,313 --> 01:40:27,179
In that moment,
it was still an individual.

1152
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:29,560
It was calm

1153
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,375
and then it was gone.

1154
01:40:36,228 --> 01:40:39,236
I became aware
of how precious life was.

1155
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:43,267
And I thought about death
and I felt close to God.

1156
01:40:47,869 --> 01:40:50,326
I don't want my thoughts
to die with me.

1157
01:40:50,451 --> 01:40:52,452
I want to have done something.

1158
01:40:54,279 --> 01:40:56,380
Thank you for inviting me.

1159
01:40:57,059 --> 01:40:59,606
You were the one person
I wanted here.

1160
01:41:00,061 --> 01:41:02,883
Other people would have been overwhelmed
by what they were seeing.

1161
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:04,416
It would have confused them.

1162
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:07,814
I knew you would be the only one
able to sense what was really going on,

1163
01:41:07,982 --> 01:41:11,027
who could feel
what I was trying to accomplish.

1164
01:41:11,195 --> 01:41:13,198
There are a lot of things
I can't understand,

1165
01:41:13,323 --> 01:41:15,925
but I still want my life
to have meaning.

1166
01:41:25,285 --> 01:41:28,516
I don't know that I want to hear
from any more experts.

1167
01:41:30,823 --> 01:41:33,966
<i>If you will please let me finish.
Will you please let me finish?</i>

1168
01:41:34,092 --> 01:41:37,529
<i>With intensive psychotherapy,
an autistic child can be treated...</i>

1169
01:41:37,776 --> 01:41:41,198
But the Rimland report plainly shows
autism isn't a psychological problem.

1170
01:41:41,716 --> 01:41:44,244
Calm down.
Calm done, sweetie.

1171
01:41:44,874 --> 01:41:47,414
<i>It would be better
if you could get her to sit calmly.</i>

1172
01:41:47,582 --> 01:41:48,753
<i>Try to control her.</i>

1173
01:41:49,419 --> 01:41:52,506
<i>But we were told self-stimming is good.
It eventually calms them.</i>

1174
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:54,717
<i>Self-stimming is self-comforting.</i>

1175
01:41:54,947 --> 01:41:57,221
<i>Self-stimulation...
Rocking, spinning, rolling...</i>

1176
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,641
Well, I think spinning is good.

1177
01:42:00,112 --> 01:42:01,413
And rolling too.

1178
01:42:02,055 --> 01:42:05,972
Self-stimulation does seem
to eventually calm the nervous system.

1179
01:42:06,152 --> 01:42:09,210
It can be a way to compensate
for not being held.

1180
01:42:09,335 --> 01:42:11,442
And being held
by another person is scary,

1181
01:42:11,567 --> 01:42:14,741
but rolling
or being held by surfaces

1182
01:42:14,866 --> 01:42:17,991
produces the calming effect
that ordinary children get from a hug.

1183
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:19,808
How old's your child?

1184
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:23,328
Well, I don't have children.

1185
01:42:24,576 --> 01:42:25,927
No, I'm autistic.

1186
01:42:27,121 --> 01:42:29,723
And I need the sensation
of being hugged.

1187
01:42:30,521 --> 01:42:32,640
And I've developed a machine
that I get into

1188
01:42:32,765 --> 01:42:35,115
and hugs me
and I'm different afterwards.

1189
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,541
I'm more social.

1190
01:42:37,176 --> 01:42:39,488
Well, I didn't speak
until I was four

1191
01:42:39,613 --> 01:42:43,619
and now I have a B.A. and a masters
and I'm studying for my doctorate.

1192
01:42:46,754 --> 01:42:48,589
Please don't shout!
Please!

1193
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:52,678
Most autistic people
are very sensitive

1194
01:42:52,846 --> 01:42:54,397
to sounds and colors.

1195
01:42:55,716 --> 01:42:58,478
Over-stimulation hurts.

1196
01:42:59,668 --> 01:43:03,473
People talkin' too much at once,
you know, can cause us to panic.

1197
01:43:03,598 --> 01:43:05,199
How did you get cured?

1198
01:43:06,218 --> 01:43:09,828
Well, I'm not cured.
I'll always be autistic.

1199
01:43:10,192 --> 01:43:14,140
My mother refused to believe
that I wouldn't speak.

1200
01:43:14,378 --> 01:43:18,112
And when I learned to speak,
she made me go to school.

1201
01:43:18,365 --> 01:43:20,492
And in school and at home,

1202
01:43:21,013 --> 01:43:23,564
manners and rules
were really important.

1203
01:43:23,689 --> 01:43:25,490
They were pounded into me.

1204
01:43:25,718 --> 01:43:26,819
I was lucky.

1205
01:43:26,944 --> 01:43:28,815
All these things worked for me.

1206
01:43:29,221 --> 01:43:32,237
Everyone worked hard
to make sure that I was engaged.

1207
01:43:32,362 --> 01:43:35,672
I mean, they knew I was different,
but not less.

1208
01:43:35,797 --> 01:43:37,245
You know, I had a gift.

1209
01:43:37,413 --> 01:43:39,078
I could see the world in a new way.

1210
01:43:39,204 --> 01:43:42,806
I could see details
that other people were blind to.

1211
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,590
My mother pushed me
to become self-sufficient.

1212
01:43:47,715 --> 01:43:50,430
I worked summers at my aunt's ranch.

1213
01:43:50,635 --> 01:43:53,226
I went to boarding school
and college

1214
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:56,314
and those things
were uncomfortable for me at first,

1215
01:43:56,661 --> 01:43:59,562
but they helped me
to open doors to new worlds.

1216
01:43:59,899 --> 01:44:01,299
Excuse me, please,

1217
01:44:02,035 --> 01:44:03,951
but we want to hear everything.

1218
01:44:28,906 --> 01:44:30,407
<i>Are you a scientist?</i>

1219
01:44:30,965 --> 01:44:33,991
- <i>You cannot hit people.</i>
- <i>Think you can figure it out?</i>

1220
01:44:34,187 --> 01:44:36,497
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

1221
01:44:36,623 --> 01:44:38,687
<i>I have a pen and a clipboard.</i>

1222
01:44:38,812 --> 01:44:41,435
- <i>Think of it as a door.</i>
- <i>Just take one knock to the head.</i>

1223
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,464
<i>I don't understand
why people are cruel for no reason!</i>

1224
01:44:44,589 --> 01:44:46,489
<i>You have a very special mind.</i>

1225
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:48,735
<i>You see the world
in ways that others can't.</i>

1226
01:44:48,861 --> 01:44:51,016
<i>Miss Grandin, this is a masterpiece.</i>

1227
01:44:51,141 --> 01:44:53,549
<i>A door opened and I went through it.</i>

1228
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:56,459
<i>Yes, you did, and I held it.</i>

1229
01:45:01,067 --> 01:45:02,518
I'm Temple Grandin.
