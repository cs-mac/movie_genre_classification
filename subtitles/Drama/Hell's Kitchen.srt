00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,151
Tonight on a very special

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,503
<i>Kitchen Nightmares,</i>
<i>Chef Ramsay</i>

3
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:07,430
is in Eagle Rock, California,
where twins Jim and Jeff

4
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:10,016
are fighting to keep
their restaurant alive.

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,003
Right from the very beginning,

6
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,623
Gordon finds out he has
double trouble on his hands.

7
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:19,042
Oh, my God.

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,427
They're messy...
Make sure they say a prayer

9
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:23,679
before they start eating that.
They're lazy...

10
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,981
When's the last time this place
was cleaned? What a mess.

11
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,551
I hate cleaning. To me,
that's a 4-letter word.

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,471
They're loud...
You sure you don't
like raw chicken?

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,339
And they're emotional.
I didn't think it was that bad.

14
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:36,793
And this all adds up
to a recipe for disaster.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,178
Will you stop acting
like a baby?

16
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:41,781
Oh, blow it out your .
Excuse me?

17
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,450
You heard it.
Hey, need diaper changing?

18
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:45,585
Shut up!

19
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,170
Will Chef Ramsay

20
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,105
be able to get through
to Jim and Jeff?

21
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,557
Right now you're making
yourself look stupid.

22
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:53,843
Or is this set of twins
the beyond saving?

23
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:56,279
It's a mistake.
It's a lethal mistake.

24
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:58,598
We can't serve them.
You'll kill somebody.

25
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:00,183
I screwed up.

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,135
What do you want me
to say now?

Nestled in the middle of

30
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,583
the up-and-coming neighborhood
of Eagle Rock, California,

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,834
is Capri,

32
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:30,167
an Italian restaurant which
is owned by the Thiel twins.

33
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,902
Hi, I'm Jeff.
Hi--Jeff.

34
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,772
I'm Jeff.
No, I'm Jeff.
You're Jim.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,357
I'm Jim.
And...

36
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,043
We're the owners
of the Capri Italian restaurant.

37
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:41,328
Good evening, Capri,
Jim speaking.

38
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:43,230
<i>How we got into</i>
<i>the restaurant business is</i>

39
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,182
<i>we used to come here</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

40
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,952
and we loved the place,
so we said, "we'll buy it."

41
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,037
<i>The feeling was,</i>
<i>it's like, dude, free pizza?</i>

42
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,856
All right.
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:54,375
Word, word,
uh-huh. Team Capri.

44
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:58,379
The twins are like two
overgrown boys.

45
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,016
Jeffy's getting larger.

46
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:04,135
Let's play cymbals.

47
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,570
They're just kind of
immature.

48
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:09,540
Oh, I shouldn't have you
do the chicken fillets.

49
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,175
Excuse me.

50
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:13,094
<i>They're just doing</i>
<i>what they know,</i>

51
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,129
and it's not working.

52
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:18,733
Ta-da! Sorry.
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

53
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:20,117
<i>It's okay.</i>

54
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,020
Yes, everybody is entertained
by their childishness...

55
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:27,575
But it is a restaurant,
and we're here to serve food.

56
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:29,844
That looks good.

57
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:32,947
Oops.

58
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,716
You know what?
These guys can't cook!

59
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:37,434
Hmm.

60
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:39,353
<i>We gotta figure a better way</i>
<i>to do the lasagna.</i>

61
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,889
We got too many people
saying it's overcooked.

62
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,091
You think we should
cook it less?

63
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:47,010
The food that comes out from
the kitchen looks terrible.

64
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:48,979
What'd he say?
It wasn't cooked. It's raw.

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,748
Can't win 'em all.

66
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:53,300
It's embarrassing.
It looks like nobody cares.

67
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:55,519
You sure you don't
like raw chicken?

68
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,006
Here is their issue--
Jim and Jeff are lazy.

69
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,610
All right, I'm going to the car.
Wake me up when it's over.

70
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:06,080
Lazy is an understatement.
The twins' highest priority

71
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:08,115
is doing as little work
as possible.

72
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:11,051
<i>There's something</i>
<i>that we're doing wrong,</i>

73
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,220
and I'm not sure
what it is,

74
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,156
<i>but the financial situation</i>
<i>hit the pooper--</i>

75
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,408
we're broke.

76
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:20,060
Oops. Uh, pink
is never a good color.

77
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:22,179
I haven't paid them
for a few months.

78
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:25,232
We need help.
If things don't change,

79
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,018
I would say the doors
will close quickly.

80
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:29,870
<i>Hello?</i>

81
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:33,023
No, the phone's
not working again.

82
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,609
Fingers crossed that
Chef Ramsay's gonna help us.

83
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:47,338
"Capri, Italian dining
since 1963."

84
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,307
Closed since 1963?

85
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,927
My God.

86
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:55,796
Hideous.

87
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,781
What am I doing?

88
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,267
Hello?

89
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,236
Hi there.

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,889
How are you?
Pretty good. I'm Jeff.

91
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,024
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

92
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,293
Likewise. Uh, it looks shut
from outside.

93
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,312
Uh, yeah,
we're not open yet.

94
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:12,546
Oh, you're not open yet?
<i>No.</i>

95
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:14,248
When do you open?
Uh, 4:00.

96
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,333
Dinner only?
Yeah.

97
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:19,019
And you're the owner?
Yeah, my brother and I are.

98
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:21,689
Okay, great.
Would you like to meet my brother?

99
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,674
Uh, yes, please.
What's his name?
Jim.

100
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:25,943
Jim. And you're Jeff.
Yep.

101
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:28,312
My God, look at this place.

102
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,584
Okay...

103
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,252
Okay.

104
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,670
<i>It's fun to play</i>
<i>jokes on people.</i>

105
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,706
In the twin union book,
you gotta mess with people.

106
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,142
Hey, how's it going?
Jeff, is your brother
not available?

107
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,178
No, I'm Jim.
No, come on.

108
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:46,964
No, I'm his brother.
You're kidding me.

109
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:48,465
No, I am.
Seriously.

110
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:50,084
I am serious.
Jeff, go get Jim.

111
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,070
Come on, don't--listen,
I've got work to do. Please.
Hold on.

112
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,005
Hold on. Hold on,
I'll get him.

113
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:57,057
What is this,
the comedy store?

114
00:04:57,142 --> 00:05:00,094
Bloody hell,
look at them.

115
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:02,563
Are you kidding me?
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

116
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,865
Jeff and Jim.
Yes.

117
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,302
Correct.
Jeez. Look at you two.

118
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,287
You are identical.

119
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:13,240
And you're not dressing
like this especially today--
no, no, we--

120
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:15,242
we wear this as--
for the restaurant.
This is--

121
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,345
you've even got the same
<i>sneakers on.</i>

122
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,798
Pen there, pen there.
I didn't even notice that.

123
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:22,850
T-shirt there,
t-shirt there.
I didn't notice that.

124
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,085
Bit of flour there,
bit of flour there.
Yep.

125
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:27,321
It's quite scary.

126
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,472
Jim...
Yep.

127
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:29,690
And Jeff.
Yep.

128
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:33,077
So who's in charge?
He is.

129
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,712
No, uh,
basically, I am.

130
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:38,282
I've worked here
longer than he has.
Okay.

131
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,050
Uh, but since 1963,
come on.

132
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,719
Oh, no, no, we bought it
about 14 years ago.

133
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:46,440
Okay. So why aren't you
open for lunch?

134
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:49,293
The Capri's never open
for lunch, which is good.

135
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,395
I'd rather go on the computer,

136
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,831
watch TV, play poker...

137
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:56,700
Problem is, for lunch, we'd have
to get another whole staff.

138
00:05:56,768 --> 00:06:01,038
Goof off, sit in the sun.

139
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,791
You haven't even tried it?
No, I haven't.

140
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,693
No, I'm not ready
to jump into the lunch yet.

141
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,462
Okay, but you're open
every day for dinner?

142
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,781
Wednesday through Sunday.
Say that again?

143
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:14,051
Wednesday through Sunday.
What's wrong with
Monday, Tuesday?

144
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:19,206
So help me understand this.
Okay, right.

145
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,108
So you're actually closed
longer than you're open.
Yeah.

146
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:23,610
Really?
Mm-hmm.

147
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,414
Okay, well,
thanks for updating me.

148
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:29,266
I'm gonna sit down and, uh, eat.
Please, right over here.

149
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,301
Thank you.
Let me get you some water.

150
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,253
I'll get the water.

151
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,055
No, I'll get the water.

152
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,226
Jeez. Seriously?

153
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,178
Are these menus
from 1963 as well?

154
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:43,814
No, they're
getting old.

155
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,750
I know, we have to get--
you're kidding me.
But look at that.

156
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,902
Is this a joke?
That's not.

157
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,005
You're kidding me.
I can't believe they're--
they're falling apart.

158
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,575
You can't even read that,
<i>it's so dirty.</i>

159
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,460
First impressions.
Wow.

160
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,962
Okay, give me five minutes
to have a read of the menu...

161
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,781
Okay.
Go ahead.

162
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:03,333
And I'll--I'll catch up
with you guys later, yeah?
Okay.

163
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:05,235
Holy crap.

164
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,004
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>Chef Ramsay expected,</i>

165
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,423
but it's not a chichi place.
I'm not a chichi kind of guy.

166
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,309
I'm more down to earth.

167
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,994
Hello.
Oh, hello.

168
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,381
I'm Colleen.
I'm your server today.
Okay. Nice to see you.

169
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:20,050
Colleen, how long
have you been here?
Nine and a half years.

170
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,686
a decade?
Yeah.

171
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,839
Seriously, what was the last
thing that got changed in here?
Oh...

172
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:28,809
This is still the same way
the original owners had it.

173
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,378
Really?
Wallpaper's been up there
for 35 years.

174
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:33,080
Oh, God.

175
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:35,249
<i>Let's, uh, let's get</i>
<i>through the menu, yeah?</i>

176
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,402
Let's start off with, uh,
meatball sandwich.

177
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,020
I love meatballs.
Who makes them?

178
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:42,539
They come from a company
that we order from.

179
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:45,192
You're kidding me.
No.

180
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,544
You can't even make
a meatball?

181
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,346
I can.

182
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:51,915
Okay, let's go for
the meatball sandwich,

183
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,350
and let's go with
the chicken scarpello.

184
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,218
Okay, pizza.

185
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,854
Ooh.
Let's go for
the Capri colossal.

186
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:00,457
You want the big one?
Yeah, why not?

187
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,643
Okay.
Okay, I'll let you
put that order in.

188
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,528
Okay.
Thank you.

189
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,229
You're welcome.

190
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:07,948
<i>Okay, what do we</i>
<i>have to make?</i>

191
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:09,950
Chicken scarpello,
meatball sandwich,

192
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,136
extra large colossal.
He wants an extra large?

193
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,455
<i>Jim, get me</i>
<i>an extra large dough.</i>

194
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,406
What does he want?
The colossal.

195
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,826
All righty.

196
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,896
<i>So it's not just the menus.</i>

197
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:24,714
Oh, dear.

198
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,167
Bits of sauce
down there. Crap.

199
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,503
<i>Ugh.</i>
<i>Just disgusting.</i>

200
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:32,923
Bits of everywhere.
There's tape on the carpet.

201
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,709
Look at this place.

202
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:38,128
When was the last time
the place was cleaned?
Not lately.

203
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:42,833
<i>How long has this stuff</i>
<i>been here?</i>

204
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:46,503
20 years.
20 years.
Bloody hell.

205
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:47,788
Oh.

206
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,257
It's like it's snowing.

207
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,276
Oh, oh, my God.

208
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,211
That's gross, no?

209
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:55,913
Yes.
That's above people's--

210
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:57,547
<i>that's very--yes.</i>
<i>Jim,</i>

211
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,200
two seconds, please?

212
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:03,137
When was the last time
this place was cleaned?
Uh...

213
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:05,939
Have you seen this?
No, I did not.

214
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:07,991
My goodness, me.

215
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:09,993
Who's responsible
for cleaning here?

216
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:12,179
I'm responsible.
I didn't do it.

217
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,398
<i>Have you seen the fans?</i>

218
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:16,483
<i>I do not like to clean.</i>
<i>I hate cleaning.</i>

219
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,735
To me, that's a 4-letter word.

220
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,155
So I'm about to start eating,
I give that a little shake,

221
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,258
and all of a sudden,
the dust just runs down.

222
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:27,144
Let me wash my hands
before I start eating.

223
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:29,163
<i>What a mess.</i>

224
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:32,132
You want to microwave
these meatballs, please?
Okay.

225
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,454
Oh, come on.

226
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,706
Work with me.

227
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,892
Cheese.

228
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:47,331
Sandwich is ready.

229
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:49,366
Okay, a meatball sandwich.

230
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,418
Meatball sandwich.
Um...

231
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:56,573
Okay, and so they buy the
meatballs, they defrost them,

232
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:59,242
and then, has that been
<i>microwaved, or...</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

233
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,461
Thank you.

234
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,697
Oh.

235
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:08,635
Okay, what else
do we have to make?
A scarpello.

236
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,307
That's nasty.

237
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,309
<i>When a restaurant can't even</i>
<i>bother to make a meatball,</i>

238
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:19,129
that's not a good sign,
let me tell you that.

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,538
Someone should tell him
the chicken's definitely dead.

240
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:30,857
Not again.

241
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,697
What's the matter
with these guys?

242
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,741
Okay.

243
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:51,178
Oh, my God.

244
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:53,814
What in the hell is that?
The colossal pizza.

245
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,349
Wow.

246
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,050
I mean, it's someone's
cleared out the fridge.

247
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,386
Look at it.
It's endless.

248
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:02,239
It has a little bit
of everything,

249
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:05,375
<i>except for anchovies.</i>

250
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,611
Ugh, that's dreadful.

251
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,947
Okay, thank you.
Okay.

252
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,017
The crap and the gunk
on top of it is just hideous.

253
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,053
He didn't like
the pizza?

254
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,639
He's not liking
anything.

255
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,507
<i>Oops.</i>

256
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,197
Okay, now we have
the chicken scarpello.

257
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,182
Oh, wow.

258
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,951
It looks dull.

259
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,377
That's not right.
Ooh.

260
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:42,412
It smells.
Is that fresh?

261
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,631
Um...

262
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:48,285
Can you ask him how old
the chicken is, please?

263
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:50,971
Oh, that was nasty.

264
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:52,889
How old is the chicken?
I don't know.

265
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,958
When did we get it?

266
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:57,010
Uh, I don't know.

267
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,429
We took it out
of the freezer yesterday.
Tell him
it's 14 years old.

268
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:02,466
We took it out
of the freezer yesterday.

269
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,117
It's frozen,
it is not fresh,

270
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:07,204
'cause we can't afford to keep
fresh meat here all the time,

271
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:09,089
because we don't serve
that much.

272
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:12,159
<i>If he wants to donate money</i>
<i>so I can make it fresh,</i>

273
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,761
no problem, but otherwise,
tough .

274
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:16,646
They're not open for lunch,
but so far,

275
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,482
what I've just experienced,

276
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,450
they shouldn't be open
for dinner either,

277
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,436
he took it out of
the freezer yesterday,

278
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,806
and doesn't remember
when the delivery was.

279
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,525
Excuse me.

280
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:30,594
Oh, dear. Excuse me.

281
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:40,554
Ugh.

282
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,924
Under the tables,
it's littered with gum.

283
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:46,276
Colleen?
Yes?

284
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:47,961
Look at that.

285
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:50,247
<i>It's everywhere. Ugh.</i>

286
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,683
<i>Absolutely disgusting</i>

287
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:56,803
how lazy some people can be.

288
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,106
Let's go on a gum ball rally.

289
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,341
Ugh.

290
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:02,876
<i>Oh, God,</i>
<i>under there.</i>

291
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:04,761
Look at the size of the gum
under that one.

292
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,313
Oh, look at one
at the end.
And the corner.

293
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:08,315
Oh, my God,
look at that one there.

294
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,234
When was the last time
the tables were cleaned?

295
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:12,903
Not ever, that I've known of,
underneath.

296
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,655
They've never been
cleaned underneath?
No.

297
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,274
Oh, my God. One, two,
three, four, five.

298
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:20,010
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

299
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,079
Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

300
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:26,049
18, 19, 20 bits of gum.

301
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,952
Every frickin' table...
Has gum underneath of it.

302
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:31,605
Has gum underneath.
Mm.

303
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,994
No. Don't say that.

304
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:41,031
Come on, stop crying.

305
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:43,483
grow up,
you .

306
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,870
you.

307
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,573
Uh, Jim, Jeff.
Comin'.

308
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,908
<i>I'm really nervous.</i>
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

309
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,343
Dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear.

310
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:55,495
I'm afraid of what
Chef Ramsay has to say.

311
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,330
<i>Honestly,</i>

312
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,283
you seem like nice guys,
but that was painful.

313
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:03,186
<i>The general feel of the place</i>
<i>is disgusting.</i>

314
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:05,522
I can tell how much
you don't care,

315
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,258
<i>you just stand there</i>
<i>with your foot on the booth.</i>

316
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:12,112
Can you get your dirty feet
off your own booths?

317
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:14,631
Have a look at this.

318
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:17,584
<i>Every table is littered</i>

319
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:20,170
with stale disgusting gum.

320
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:23,140
We just--we never looked
underneath the table.

321
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:25,909
Didn't have the time?
Busy for lunch?

322
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:28,295
No.
Open seven days a week?
Not.

323
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,081
The meatball sandwich--
disgusting.

324
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,533
The chicken
was turning,

325
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,569
<i>and then the colossal,</i>

326
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,488
caked with crap. Were they
canned mushrooms on top?
Yeah.

327
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:40,774
Canned olives?
Mm-hmm.

328
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,476
<i>Soggy and tasteless.</i>

329
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,027
Where's the pride?

330
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:46,997
I don't know.
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

331
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,615
It's like a joke.

332
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,501
<i>Find a pulse,</i>
<i>and get real.</i>

333
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:53,436
Before we open
for dinner tonight,

334
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:54,771
<i>would you mind wiping</i>
<i>the lampshades,</i>

335
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:57,207
and can somebody
get under the tables

336
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,576
<i>and get rid</i>
<i>of that gum?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

337
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:01,127
<i>I'm going for lunch.</i>
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

338
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:04,130
I'm starving.

339
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,833
<i>Capri classic Italian.</i>
<i>What a joke.</i>

340
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:12,839
He said our food sucked.

341
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:14,908
And, uh, that, uh,

342
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,277
our restaurant's
really filthy.

343
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:23,667
I didn't think it was that bad.

344
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,835
After sampling
the horrendous food...

345
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,320
That's not right.

346
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,589
And discovering a dining room
that hasn't been cleaned

347
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,291
in quite some time...

348
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,826
<i>Oh, God, under there.</i>
<i>Look.</i>

349
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:44,395
Chef Ramsay
has instructed the twins

350
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,897
to clean up their restaurant
before dinner service.

351
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,833
You do the fans. I don't
want to get on a ladder.

352
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:50,318
Let's get Darian
in here.

353
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:52,136
I have a staff
to do the cleaning.

354
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,822
<i>That's why I'm considered</i>
<i>the boss,</i>

355
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,658
and they are someone
that works with me--for me.

356
00:15:57,743 --> 00:16:00,695
Get in here, now.

357
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:03,681
We don't have a lot of time.
We have to turn everything over.

358
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:07,084
<i>We got an hour before</i>
<i>we're supposed to open.</i>

359
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:13,791
After the staff
takes over the cleaning

360
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:16,127
of the dining room,
Capri opens for dinner...

361
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:19,263
<i>Hello.</i>

362
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:21,482
And Chef Ramsay arrives...
The door shakes.

363
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,667
To see the twins
in action.

364
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,687
I've never seen a kitchen
like this before.

365
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,106
<i>I mean, this place</i>
<i>is littered with crap.</i>

366
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,308
What's that there?
Co2 for the beer.

367
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:33,277
<i>Look at those shelves.</i>

368
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,313
I mean, that's grime.
That's like

369
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,049
<i>14 years of grime there.</i>

370
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,435
<i>Chef Ramsay was, uh,</i>

371
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,554
<i>"oh, there's dust here,</i>
<i>there's this."</i>

372
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:46,557
It's just like,
it's not that bad.

373
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:48,759
What's in here?
Dare I?

374
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:51,462
Vegetables.
That's the vegetables?

375
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,931
<i>What's this</i>
<i>at the bottom?</i>

376
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,933
Uh, that's supposed
to be eggplant.
<i>It's what?</i>

377
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,886
Eggplant parmesan.
When were they cooked?

378
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,739
Last Thursday.
Last Thursday?
God almighty.

379
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,457
<i>Look at that.</i>

380
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,709
Oh, feel that.

381
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:07,478
That's tomato sauce.
Yeah, but feel it.

382
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,463
I know it's--
we just made it today.

383
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:13,100
Just made it today.
So what's it doing
in the fridge?

384
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:15,486
Hold that.
I know it's hot.

385
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:17,738
<i>Hold it. What does</i>
<i>hot things do,</i>

386
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:20,558
that are sealed,

387
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,777
<i>that goes inside</i>
<i>a cold fridge?</i>

388
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:24,412
The sauce goes sour.

389
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,330
I didn't know that.

390
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:28,966
You didn't know that.

391
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:30,885
I suggest you spend
five minutes

392
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:34,321
sorting out your first
before you start cooking, yeah?
Okay.

393
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,476
<i>I should've known better.</i>

394
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:41,545
He's right, but he's just
a pain in the ass about it.

395
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,682
Darian.
Want to go through it
real quick?

396
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,301
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Trash.</i>

397
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:49,603
With the rotten vegetables
thrown away...

398
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:51,272
I need an order
of wings, please.

399
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:54,658
And the orders pouring in, Jim
and Jeff get back to cooking...

400
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:57,545
Darian, order
of green beans, please.
Got it.

401
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,163
And begin to send food
out of the kitchen.

402
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:01,699
Make sure they say a prayer
before they start eating that.

403
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,284
Okay, the chicken.

404
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:06,904
But the diners
are less than impressed.

405
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,809
Okay. They sent this back.

406
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,377
<i>They didn't like it?</i>

407
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:15,646
They said that
he can't eat it.

408
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:18,632
What was this?

409
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:20,885
Okay.

410
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:25,022
And a pile of mush.

411
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:27,725
Big pile of mush.

412
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,561
Is anyone tasting anything,
seasoning, tasting?

413
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:33,697
<i>Every time a dish came back,</i>
<i>it was like losing a customer,</i>

414
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:36,333
and, uh, it hurts.
What was wrong with it?

415
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:39,436
It's too floury
and not enough sauce.

416
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:42,206
<i>It makes me feel</i>
<i>like a loser.</i>

417
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:45,793
I do really feel
like a loser right now.

418
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:48,479
<i>Jeff,</i>

419
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,380
you okay?
What's wrong?

420
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:52,733
I'm just frustrated.

421
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,957
I'm--I'm working on it.
Just...

422
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:03,010
Get outside,
get some fresh air.

423
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,481
<i>What's the matter?</i>

424
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,367
Just...
It was a failure.

425
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:15,422
Just...
You can't give up
like that.

426
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:18,042
I'm not trying to,
just...

427
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,394
It's not going right.

428
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:23,397
I need to see what
I've got to work with

429
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,617
before I can start looking
at any form of change.

430
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,569
You have to
bounce back, huh?

431
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,538
I'm working on it,
I really am.

432
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:32,439
Jeff, you've got to.
Okay.

433
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:35,125
Come on.
Okay.

434
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,828
Let's go, come on.
Let's go.
Okay, okay.

435
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,297
Chef Ramsay's, like, "you gotta
pull yourself together,

436
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,650
get back in there
and get through the night."

437
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:44,702
How we doing?
We're doing well, sir.

438
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:46,837
Thanks to Chef Ramsay's
encouragement,

439
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,073
Jeff jumps back
into dinner service...
Okay, here we go.

440
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,659
And tries to help his brother
Jim get the kitchen

441
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:53,644
back on track...
Keep it up, Jim.
You're doing a good job.

442
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:56,297
But unfortunately,
he only makes matters worse.

443
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:58,699
Jim, what have you
done to those?

444
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,167
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what happened to those.</i>

445
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:03,003
I-I really don't.
You defrosted them
in the bag?

446
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:05,239
I think they were defrosted
in the bag, and I--
Jeff?

447
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:08,392
Yeah.
The chicken tenders,

448
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,344
what did you do to them
to defrost them?

449
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:12,429
I put it, uh,
on the steam table.

450
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,432
You defrosted them
in the steam table from frozen?

451
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,601
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

452
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,587
Not what you're
supposed to do?

453
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,271
<i>No.</i>

454
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:24,708
Frozen food needs to be
defrosted naturally.
Right.

455
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,827
Give me the bag.
Where's the bag?

456
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:30,297
Pass the--

457
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:33,150
<i>Oh, God almighty.</i>

458
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,752
<i>We can't serve them.</i>

459
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,737
You'll
Kill somebody.

460
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:39,056
Jim, talk to me.

461
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:41,241
What am I supposed to say?
It's a mistake.

462
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,844
It's a lethal mistake.

463
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,032
<i>It's really bad.</i>

464
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,517
It that what I ate
at lunchtime?

465
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,969
Yeah.
Oh, .

466
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:56,640
This is gross.
That's horrible.
It's disgusting.

467
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:59,143
I've been feeling a little bit
crap all afternoon.

468
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,629
What are you two doing?
I up.

469
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,882
"I up."
Well, what do you
want me to say?

470
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:07,201
I want you to step up
to the plate and be a man.

471
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:09,420
I screwed up.

472
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,171
You haven't told
anyone yet.

473
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:13,340
<i>He was just being a jerk.</i>
<i>He was an ass.</i>

474
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:17,544
I am so tired of him
just pushing and pushing.

475
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:19,446
Grow some balls
and take it off the menu.

476
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:21,765
<i>I've had enough.</i>

477
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm so pissed!

478
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:26,236
I can only take so much
before I fight back.

479
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,822
<i>Jim, Jim, Jim!</i>
<i>Out of the way.</i>

480
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,704
It's an hour
into dinner service...

481
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:38,290
<i>Oh, God almighty.</i>

482
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,276
And Chef Ramsay has just
discovered a lethal mistake--

483
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,278
spoiled chicken at Capri.

484
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,164
You'll
kill somebody.

485
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:48,484
What am I supposed to say?
Take it off  the menu.

486
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,085
<i>Jim, Jim.</i>

487
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:51,320
Out of the way.

488
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:54,306
Ladies and gentlemen,

489
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:58,160
due to certain circumstance,
we have no chicken tonight.

490
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,414
Oh...
My apology
to everyone here.

491
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:04,850
If you just want to have

492
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:07,236
what you're eating now
and leave,

493
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,888
I understand fully,
and I apologize.

494
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,679
Hey, there may have been a more
subtle way of doing that.

495
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:19,915
Get out of my way.
is the matter with you?

496
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:24,086
When we canceled all our chicken
orders, we got screwed.

497
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,939
Will you stop acting like a baby?
Oh, blow it out your .

498
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:28,907
Excuse me?
You heard it.

499
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:31,626
Hey, need diaper
changing?

500
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,212
I'll give you something--
<i>is it that time of night?</i>

501
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,814
Is there a little
poo-poo in your pants?

502
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:38,851
He's the baby. He's the one
that's whining over everything.

503
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:40,535
I don't need
to hear this crap.

504
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:42,805
<i>Jim, why do you have</i>
<i>to behave like this?</i>

505
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,324
I'm not gonna get yelled at.
You're walking around like a big baby,

506
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:47,810
and I'm just asking you
to grow up a little bit,

507
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:50,329
show a little bit of respect
for what you're trying to cook.
off.

508
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:54,149
Oh, my God.
You big, wet noodle.

509
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,717
Do you want a blanket
and a bottle?

510
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,587
Do you need one?
Upside the head?

511
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,288
Jim, stop it, please.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

512
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,742
What a spoiled brat.
you.

513
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,861
Jim, shut up, please.

514
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:08,997
<i>You're not helping the cause.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

515
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:12,534
Now you're setting
yourself on fire.
I hope so.

516
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:19,491
Oh, yeah. They don't
get their way, they cry,

517
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:21,376
or throw a temper tantrum.
Oh, my God.

518
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:24,046
To walk into the dining room
like that and scream...

519
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,331
That's what I said--
temper tantrum.

520
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,901
<i>There's a part of me</i>
<i>that is very satisfied</i>

521
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:32,688
to see the boys finally get
what they deserve--

522
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,625
a lesson in humility.

523
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:39,495
Okay, where are you at now?
I don't know!

524
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:44,766
Let me go check
on that for you.

525
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:47,052
Can I pass you this? They've
been here since we opened,

526
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:49,855
and they haven't
got their food yet.

527
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:52,841
Jim, some of the tables
have been waiting

528
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:55,227
<i>two hours out there.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

529
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:58,380
Well, you don't even
seem to be bothered.
I am bothered.

530
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,199
You know, there's only three
tables you served entrees.

531
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:01,850
<i>Come on, guys,</i>

532
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,269
just show a little bit
more enthusiasm, surely.

533
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:07,206
No, it doesn't look good.
Damn it.

534
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:10,092
This can't be happening.
It's just like a bad nightmare.

535
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,778
Let's drink our wine
and go.

536
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,113
Window wants to walk.
Cancel window.

537
00:24:15,198 --> 00:24:17,065
<i>Customers were not happy.</i>

538
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,801
Some got tired of waiting and
left. It was very disappointing.

539
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:24,839
<i>It was a bad night.</i>

540
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:27,609
<i>Our dishes took longer</i>
<i>than usual.</i>

541
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:30,579
It was just
an embarrassing night.

542
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:37,870
Okay, today could be
summed up in one

543
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,771
<i>4-letter word.</i>

544
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:41,240
Lazy.

545
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:43,675
<i>I can't even start</i>

546
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,695
to help both of you when
you're not helping yourselves.

547
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:48,997
I really need you
to do something.

548
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:51,967
<i>Both of you go through</i>
<i>your kitchen,</i>

549
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:55,087
and clean it.
Not your staff.

550
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:57,356
You. Both of you.

551
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,141
Got it?
Yep.

552
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:01,159
Good night.
Night.

553
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:03,278
<i>Get to work.</i>

554
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,980
<i>We were lazy.</i>
<i>Now we're paying for it.</i>

555
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:06,882
We're failures.

556
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:10,369
Yay.

557
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,826
What's wrong, Jim?

558
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:24,533
I feel bad.

559
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:27,569
<i>We are in trouble. I really</i>
<i>don't know if we can fix it.</i>

560
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,471
That's the problem.

561
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:35,110
Go take a break, Jim.

562
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:47,706
I gotta clean this.

563
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,180
After the twins spend

564
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,714
most of the night cleaning,

565
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:57,949
Chef Ramsay arrives early,

566
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:01,002
and with the help
of longtime waitress Colleen

567
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,971
and pizza maker Darian,
he does something

568
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:06,291
the twins have never done--
open for lunch.
Okay, Darian...

569
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,609
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

570
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,211
It's gonna be fast,
and it's gonna be furious,

571
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,680
<i>but you can do it, okay?</i>
<i>I'm game for this.</i>

572
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,465
<i>How you doin'?</i>

573
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:15,367
Come in and have
some lunch.
Thank you.

574
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:21,656
I would like
the lasagna, please.

575
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:23,892
Pizza, up.

576
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,343
Lasagna up.

577
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:27,195
Lasagna. Enjoy.

578
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:28,447
This is delicious.

579
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:31,116
Mmm, this is really good.
Yeah?

580
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:36,655
Look at that.
We got a sign twirler.

581
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,174
"Now open for lunch."

582
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:42,594
Oh, cool.

583
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:45,464
What's going on here?

584
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:48,016
Oh, cool. Oh, wow.

585
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,968
I can't believe
this is happening.

586
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:52,220
Wow. This is our place?

587
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:54,389
All right, welcome.
<i>Hi.</i>

588
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,608
Thanks for making it today.
Thank you.

589
00:26:56,692 --> 00:26:58,643
All right, take a seat.
Feeling a bit peckish?

590
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,164
Yeah.
Yeah? Let me get you a nice
little chopped salad.

591
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:04,866
This is different.

592
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,952
Let's start off with
a little chopped salad.

593
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,571
Thank you.
And make sure you save
some room

594
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,639
for an Italian sausage
lasagna

595
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:13,508
and a very simple,
um, margherita pizza.

596
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,510
Thank you.

597
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:19,013
It's a good pizza.
I like it.

598
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:21,733
Thank you.

599
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:23,869
<i>Okay,</i>

600
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:26,605
whilst you two were at home
nice and cozy,

601
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,674
I got here early this morning
with Darian and Colleen.

602
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:33,428
I think today we put over $300
in the cash register.

603
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,647
Wow.
Yeah.

604
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:38,316
$300--if you do that
5 times a week,

605
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,886
that's $1,500.
That's almost our rent,

606
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,071
so it's a lot of money.
Talk to me.

607
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:46,074
I'm just...

608
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,809
Very happy.

609
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,363
Jeff, I had my eyes shut,
and that was wrong.

610
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,182
I sat on my butt,
being lazy.

611
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,319
You can't have your butt stuck
to your bed every morning.

612
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:00,071
You've gotta get out
and--and break the mold.

613
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:01,940
Message understood,
loud and clear?

614
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:04,125
Yep.
Loud and clear.

615
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:09,297
After finally getting through

616
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,483
to the twins
about their laziness,

617
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,385
Chef Ramsay wants to dig
a little deeper.

618
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:15,387
He has an unorthodox plan

619
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:17,422
that will allow the brothers
to work out their issues

620
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,241
and their frustrations.

621
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,359
Time to let go
of the past,

622
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:24,095
<i>and to embrace</i>
<i>the future.</i>

623
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,981
Gloves on.

624
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:29,067
I'm not gonna be fighting
Chef Ramsay, am I?

625
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:31,403
I want to know

626
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,921
what's holding you back.

627
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:35,690
One, two.

628
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,810
Oh, for God's sake.
What is that?

629
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:41,663
Two--what is that?
I don't work out.

630
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:44,282
<i>This is like starting</i>
<i>an old car</i>

631
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,251
after a year sitting there,
it's gonna go...

632
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,253
Fart out a little bit.

633
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:50,589
Come on.

634
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:52,791
What pisses you off the most?
What is it?

635
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,410
Myself.

636
00:28:55,478 --> 00:28:57,846
Why?

637
00:28:57,897 --> 00:29:01,166
<i>Huh?</i>
<i>'Cause I'm lazy.</i>

638
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,768
When was the last time
you did something

639
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:05,954
100%?

640
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,306
I can't remember.

641
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:11,159
What are you afraid of?
Tell me.

642
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:13,361
Screwing up.

643
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:16,281
Damn it.
It's just screwing up.

644
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:18,817
I've done it
all my life.

645
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,403
I'm a failure.
You're not a failure.

646
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,371
Yes, I am.
You are not.

647
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,957
<i>We all make mistakes</i>
<i>in life.</i>

648
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,960
<i>Embrace change.</i>

649
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,932
Are you keen
to make this business work?
Yeah.

650
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,900
It's time.
I'm ready to move on,

651
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:38,069
to make a success
out of this.

652
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:39,904
Okay, last ten.
Let's go.

653
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:47,262
And again. And again.
Come on, come on.

654
00:29:47,313 --> 00:29:50,565
Hit it.
Stop kissing it, come on.

655
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:53,201
Come on.
And again.

656
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,586
Ready to change?
Yes.

657
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,904
Good man.
Yeah.

658
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,340
Get the
out of here.

659
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:01,075
I know I'm gonna put behind me
all the laziness,

660
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:03,411
and look towards the future and
the successes that are coming.

661
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:06,064
Jeff, let's go.

662
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:10,752
Good, good, nice.

663
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:13,104
<i>It feels good</i>
<i>to just let out</i>

664
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,273
a whole bunch of
that I've been hanging on to.

665
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:17,092
Nice, nice, nice.
Take a breather.

666
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,011
Good, wow. What does this
restaurant mean for you?

667
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,647
A life, a career.

668
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:25,032
And you think that by sitting
on your lazy ass all day long

669
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:26,985
<i>and turning up halfway through</i>
<i>the day is gonna make it work?</i>

670
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,521
You need to commit.

671
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:31,906
Good. You, in here.

672
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,591
<i>Let's go.</i>

673
00:30:33,676 --> 00:30:37,162
I don't want any head shots,
just one round,

674
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:40,749
and tell each other
it's time to work.

675
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,284
Let's go.

676
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,055
We can work together.
We can work together.

677
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:50,041
And we can be successful. We
just gotta talk to each other,

678
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:52,327
not keep anything inside.
Yeah.

679
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:01,286
Five, four, three,

680
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,705
<i>two, one.</i>

681
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:07,692
And stop. Well done.
Give him a hug.

682
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:10,678
<i>Boxing each other,</i>
<i>uh, was a good exercise,</i>

683
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,513
<i>'cause it--</i>
<i>it cleared the air,</i>

684
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,666
<i>and it showed me that</i>
<i>it's time for me</i>

685
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,935
to work hard for the business
for both of us.

686
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:19,437
<i>Okay, good.</i>

687
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:22,423
It's time for change.
Got it?
Got it.

688
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:24,459
Are you ready?
Ready.

689
00:31:24,526 --> 00:31:26,911
Good.
Get cleaned up,

690
00:31:26,996 --> 00:31:30,348
and meet me back
at the restaurant.

691
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,784
Satisfied that the twins

692
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:35,470
are ready to make some changes
within themselves...

693
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,872
Okay, how are you
feeling?
Good.

694
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,041
Chef Ramsay now wants
to focus on something else

695
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,378
that needs a major change--
the food.

696
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,697
When was the last time
you made a meatball?
Probably five years ago.

697
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,583
Okay, and why did you stop?
It was easier.

698
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:51,169
Lazy!

699
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:52,520
Oops.

700
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,689
Let's make a meatball together.
Okay.

701
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,876
It's been a long time
since we've made meatballs,

702
00:31:57,943 --> 00:32:00,261
but I'm ready to do this.
I am a professional.

703
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:02,263
Right.
Ground beef,

704
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:04,399
season, yeah,
salt and pepper, garlic,

705
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:07,068
handful of chili flakes.

706
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,636
<i>Chef Ramsay is a magician</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

707
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,707
Oh, you just add this and this
and this, and it's just like...

708
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:14,275
Jeff...
Yes?

709
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:17,128
How big do you like your balls?
<i>Uh,</i>

710
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:20,548
pretty good size,
I mean, you know...

711
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,549
Golf ball size?

712
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:24,602
What?

713
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:28,206
All right,
have a little taste.

714
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:31,359
What did you think?
It's good. I like it a lot.

715
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,144
Can you do that?
Yes.

716
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:35,063
Can you do that
if he needs help?
Yes.

717
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:36,831
Homemade meatballs.
Homemade meatballs.

718
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,716
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>The difference</i>
<i>is night and day.</i>

719
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,335
Homemade!
Homemade.

720
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:41,519
Can't hear you.
Homemade!

721
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,805
Can't hear you.
It's homemade meatballs!

722
00:32:43,856 --> 00:32:46,357
Get outside and shout it
in the street.

723
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,961
Homemade meatballs!
Tell them in the neighborhood.

724
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,047
We have
homemade meatballs!
I can't hear you.

725
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,433
We have
homemade meatballs!

726
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:56,918
<i>Finally.</i>

727
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:59,687
Stop, we have
homemade meatballs!

728
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,207
We have homemade
meatballs!

729
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:06,644
Everybody, we have
homemade meatballs!

730
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,541
Faced with a restaurant

731
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:28,141
that hasn't been touched
since 1963,

732
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,243
Chef Ramsay and his team
work overnight

733
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,679
to give this restaurant
one of the biggest makeovers

734
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:35,882
in <i>Kitchen Nightmare's</i>
<i>history.</i>

735
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:38,951
Right, good morning.
Good morning.

736
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,554
You are in for a big shock.
Are you ready

737
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,990
to see the new Capri?
Yes.

738
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:46,409
Good. On the count
of three--

739
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:49,245
one,

740
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:51,681
two--don't peek...

741
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:58,838
Three.

742
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,757
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

743
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,492
Oh, my God.
<i>Wow.</i>

744
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,044
<i>This is nice.</i>

745
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,180
Just have a look.

746
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:10,233
We have brought the Capri
<i>from 1963,</i>

747
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,486
<i>fast forward it,</i>
<i>transformed it to 2011.</i>

748
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,688
That's beautiful.
Look at it.

749
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,223
Cool, hip.
<i>Oh, man.</i>

750
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:19,375
This place
is gonna be hoppin'.
This is nice.

751
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,694
Oh, wow.
Gone is the carpet

752
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:23,646
<i>that was stuck</i>
<i>together with tape.</i>

753
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:25,198
You have the most amazing

754
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,467
<i>reclaimed woods</i>
<i>lining the walls.</i>

755
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:29,619
Look it.
Yeah, that's right.

756
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:31,621
<i>We had to put you</i>
<i>on the wall as well.</i>

757
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,272
Colleen, what do you think?
It's...

758
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,974
Isn't it amazing?
It's amazing.

759
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:37,543
<i>We got rid of those</i>
<i>hideous green booths.</i>

760
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,146
You have the most amazing
<i>tailor-made,</i>

761
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:41,948
cut pews as benches

762
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:45,151
from your local church.
Oh, wow.

763
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:48,054
Sit down in the pew.
Are you happy?

764
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:50,389
Yeah.
Like a pig in .

765
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:53,526
Yeah! Whoo-hoo.
It's great.

766
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:55,645
<i>Colleen.</i>
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

767
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,597
Come forward, darling,
and bring those menus

768
00:34:57,648 --> 00:34:59,966
from the pocket there.
Oh, my goodness.

769
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,802
Gone are the dirty
plastic menus.
Look it.

770
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,754
Designed on what your kitchen
is capable of producing.

771
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:06,789
So now it's time to stop
ignoring the business,

772
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:09,158
and run the business.
Okay.

773
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:12,144
Yeah? I get nervous
when you don't talk.

774
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,146
Huh?
He's--
he's totally stunned.

775
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:17,166
Come on.
Just amazing.

776
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:19,652
It really is.
I've never heard you
this quiet.

777
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,621
I don't have
anything--
what's the matter?

778
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:24,524
Just amazing.
<i>I'm in shock.</i>

779
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:26,509
I never thought it could
look so different.

780
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:29,929
This is beyond what I could
ever think could happen.

781
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,231
It's amazing.

782
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,535
Wow. We're moving up,
and it's exciting.

783
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:38,888
It's a second chance
on life.

784
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:42,074
This is gonna be the coolest
place in Eagle Rock now.
Exactly that.

785
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,931
<i>Right. Come through, please.</i>

786
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,149
Look at this stuff.
Oh, my God.

787
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:53,786
Let's start off with
meatballs al forno, yes?

788
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,705
What are they?
Homemade
meatballs!

789
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,307
Homemade meatballs.
Okay, sellers for the table,

790
00:35:58,392 --> 00:35:59,859
welcome an Italian
<i>chopped salad.</i>
<i>Yay.</i>

791
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,329
For me, the hallmark--
the pizza. The margherita.

792
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,848
Classic eggplant parm pie.
<i>Delicious,</i>

793
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,167
and just gives
a completely different twist.

794
00:36:08,218 --> 00:36:09,969
Now entrees--

795
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,805
<i>baked meat lasagna.</i>
<i>One of my favorites, yeah.</i>
<i>Mmm.</i>

796
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:15,174
<i>Baked herb chicken</i>
<i>with fingerling potatoes</i>

797
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:17,042
and a white wine sauce.
Jim?

798
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,228
I like it, a lot.
That's Jeff.

799
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:22,214
It's cool. I'm Jeff.
That's Jim.

800
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,584
Right, a little taste?
Yes.

801
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:27,220
Jump in.
<i>All right.</i>

802
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:30,489
Oh, the broccoli
is so good.

803
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:33,676
The food looks unbelievable,
and it even tastes better.

804
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,263
<i>It's excellent.</i>
<i>The eggplant</i>
<i>is amazing.</i>

805
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,598
<i>I'm starting</i>
<i>to get full already,</i>

806
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:41,200
and I haven't tasted
half the stuff.

807
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,170
Excuse me.

808
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:46,205
<i>Welcome!</i>

809
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:47,690
Put you right
over here, please.

810
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,258
Word of Capri's relaunch

811
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,709
has spread through
Eagle Rock...

812
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:51,928
<i>We have a new menu.</i>

813
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,246
We have great salads
and appetizers to start with.

814
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,882
And the dining room
fills up quickly

815
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,967
with customers eager to try
the new menu.

816
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,719
You wanna do
the Mac and cheese?

817
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,604
Boneless chicken wings.

818
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:03,256
I'll go grab that
and come back.
<i>Thank you.</i>

819
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,458
All right, let's go.
Here you go, Jim.

820
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,493
Medium margherita pizza
and a baked chicken.

821
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,863
Okay.
And I want you to call it out
like a chef/owner.

822
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:12,915
Okay, I got two--

823
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,768
what is that?
Pot-potato skins,

824
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,037
two wings.
Yes, sir.

825
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:20,273
How you doin', Jim?

826
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,709
I'm nervous, but I have
to believe that I am in charge,

827
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,444
<i>and I know what I'm doing.</i>

828
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,334
Own it, own it,
own it, own it, yeah?
Yeah.

829
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,751
<i>Gonna leak from the top,</i>
<i>buddy.</i>

830
00:37:32,803 --> 00:37:35,087
In spite of Jim's nerves...

831
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:36,973
Table five is ready.
Pick it up, please!

832
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:39,959
Food is quickly making its way
out to the diners.
Not hot enough.

833
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:43,495
Perhaps a little
too quickly.
me.

834
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:46,198
Listen, guys. Guys,
the chicken's not hot enough,

835
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,434
especially inside there.

836
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:50,169
Get it in the oven,
get the pan hot first.

837
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,990
Jim I think was starting
to really get a little panicky.

838
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:55,741
Jim, give me a time
on the chicken, please.

839
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:58,077
I-I-I got the chicken
in--in the--

840
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,513
what's in the pan and stuff,
it's heating up.

841
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,198
Jim, bounce back.
Yep.

842
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,550
<i>It's not a race. Customers</i>
<i>will wait for good food.</i>

843
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,752
Hot food in the window.
I'm dragging
the meatballs.

844
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,554
Here's spaghetti
meatball.

845
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:12,058
Yeah. Is that how
I showed you

846
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,477
to plate a
spaghetti meatball?
No.

847
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:16,696
It looks like someone
on my plate.

848
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:19,131
Damn it, Jim.
It's like, come on.

849
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:21,567
It's so easy.
Just on.

850
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,769
And you're more than capable
of doing that, I'm telling you.

851
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,988
It's not rocket science.

852
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,140
you can't even
grate cheese.

853
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:31,010
No, no. Stop panicking,
and focus!

854
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,913
I'm panicking right now, 'cause
we want to get food out quick.

855
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:38,367
But it's like,
hey, don't screw this up.

856
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:41,320
Uh...

857
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:45,290
It's an hour into service...

858
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:47,510
And Jim is struggling
to keep up with the orders.

859
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:50,112
Jim, how much longer
on my table four?
It's coming up right now.

860
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:53,532
Unfortunately, a relaunch
that had such promise...

861
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,802
They--did you really?
I did not see them.
Yes.

862
00:38:56,853 --> 00:39:00,022
Looks like it's slipping away.
Your chicken's coming also.

863
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,824
Jim, look at me. What table
number is that for?

864
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:04,427
16 is--Darian,
you cutting it right now?

865
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,845
I got a mushroom
and a meat lover.

866
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:07,830
Put it right up.
Okay.

867
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:09,715
This is going to 16.

868
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,217
They haven't even
got their appetizers.

869
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:15,087
Oh, for sake.
God darn it.

870
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:18,457
Oh, come on. Come in, you.
Come here, both of you.

871
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:20,993
I need you for 30 seconds,
out of all this .

872
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:23,312
<i>Oh, . Oh, man,</i>
<i>we're doing this again.</i>

873
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,197
I thought we got through this.

874
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:27,066
<i>Please don't let this</i>
<i>be the end.</i>

875
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:30,119
No, no, no,
no, no, no. that.

876
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:38,445
It's relaunch night at Capri,

877
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,785
and with the kitchen
backed up...

878
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,620
Jim, give me a time
on the chicken, please.
The chicken in--in the--

879
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,739
what's in the pan and stuff,
it's heating up.

880
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,664
And diners waiting
over an hour for food...

881
00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:49,643
Come here, both of you.
Chef Ramsay  has seen enough.

882
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,679
No, no, no, no. that.
Look at me. Look at me.

883
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:54,482
Right now you're making
yourselves look stupid.
Right.

884
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,350
It's a big night tonight.
Yes.

885
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:58,085
And you're pissing it up.
Yes.

886
00:39:58,186 --> 00:39:59,887
So please listen to me,

887
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,856
you have to command
your kitchen.
Yes.

888
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,774
You have to work together.
But it's not a race.

889
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:05,609
The customers are gonna
wait for good food.

890
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,362
Stop panicking,
and focus, okay?
Yes.

891
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,048
Come on!

892
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,884
Chef Ramsay is like,
"what the is this?

893
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:15,619
How could"...

894
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,489
And I go, ugh.

895
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,491
<i>We slip back into our old ways</i>
<i>of doing it,</i>

896
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,109
<i>and it's like,</i>
<i>you gotta change.</i>

897
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:23,661
This is a new Capri.

898
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:27,331
I need an order of garlic knots
and pepperoni and cheese.

899
00:40:27,382 --> 00:40:29,300
Yes, sir!
Go help him.
I'll take care of this.

900
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,153
Got it.
<i>It's time that I grew up.</i>

901
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,022
It's time that I start working
as a man and not as a butthead.

902
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:37,558
Sausage and bean.
Put some cheese on it.
I put beans on this, right?

903
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:39,894
Yeah--oregano.
Oregano.

904
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:42,496
Okay, Jim, now we're
getting a system.

905
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:43,731
Conviction, yes?
Yep.

906
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,583
What's next?
16.

907
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,151
<i>Good.</i>
<i>I got hot food up here.</i>
<i>Please serve it.</i>

908
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,520
Once we started hitting
our rhythm, it was great.

909
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:51,489
<i>'Cause things</i>
<i>were going out.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

910
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:53,624
We settled down,
and we got it zooming along.

911
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,392
How we doing?
So good.

912
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,711
The meatballs
are our favorite thing.

913
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:00,481
This is really good, though.
It's delicious.

914
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:02,516
This is made from scratch,
you can tell.

915
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:04,335
<i>This is so amazing.</i>

916
00:41:04,402 --> 00:41:06,437
It's been one hell
of a roller coaster ride,

917
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:08,839
<i>but we've learned a lot</i>
<i>from Chef Ramsay,</i>

918
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,659
<i>and he's left us with a lot</i>
<i>of inspiration and hope.</i>

919
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:13,944
I can see that we will make it

920
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:17,815
<i>if we keep doing</i>
<i>what we're doing.</i>

921
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:20,117
<i>Jim,</i>

922
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:21,502
<i>Jeff,</i>

923
00:41:21,586 --> 00:41:23,954
you've come a long way.
It's been a tough journey.

924
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:27,641
Yes.
And in order for this place
to continue functioning,

925
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,494
you both must
work at it.

926
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:31,962
Yes.
Don't clutter.

927
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:33,814
Yes.
Show up early.

928
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:36,333
Yes.
Lazy is a 4-letter word.

929
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:39,103
Yes.
Good.

930
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,356
God bless you both.

931
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,141
Thank you so much.
Okay?

932
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,394
Yeah, thank you very much.
Good luck.

933
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,980
We've went through a lot
to get--

934
00:41:50,048 --> 00:41:53,050
you know, to get the nightmare
into a-a dream.

935
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:55,019
<i>It's still</i>
<i>a learning process,</i>

936
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,554
<i>but the future</i>
<i>looks really good.</i>

937
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:58,789
The Capri is gonna work.

938
00:41:58,857 --> 00:42:01,091
Good luck.

939
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,394
God, honestly,
I'm never gonna forget

940
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:05,496
the twins in Eagle Rock,
let me tell you that.

941
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:07,932
Thank you.
<i>Good night.</i>

942
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,667
Thank you very much.
Jeez.

943
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:12,319
Yes.

944
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,371
Wow. That was hard.

945
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:16,373
I mean, really hard,

946
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:18,876
but I now really believe
that both Jim and Jeff

947
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:21,879
and their little restaurant can
become a huge tourist attraction

948
00:42:21,946 --> 00:42:23,881
here in Eagle Rock.

949
00:42:23,948 --> 00:42:25,949
Now come on--

950
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,886
who doesn't love a pizza
and a show?

951
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:30,804
Oh...

952
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:32,890
That was hard.

953
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:35,893
Man.

954
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:39,196
Just one month after
Chef Ramsay's departure...

955
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:42,867
Can I take a picture
of you two with Jen?
You sure can.

956
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:46,003
The twins kept their promise,
and opened for lunch.

957
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:47,972
It's excellent.
It's really good.

958
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,974
The new food and décor
have made Capri

959
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,825
a hot spot
in Eagle Rock.

960
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:53,844
Come back again, we're gonna
keep this going now.

961
00:42:53,912 --> 00:42:56,397
This has been
a life-changing experience.

962
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:57,681
Thank you very much,
Chef Ramsay,

963
00:42:57,782 --> 00:43:00,167
for what you did for us.

964
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:02,169
<i>I think</i>
<i>it's gonna work.</i>
<i>It's gonna work.</i>

965
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:05,122
By the way, we have
homemade meatballs! Yeah!

966

Next time on <i>kitchen</i>
<i>nightmares...</i>

968
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,281
Chef Ramsay
heads across the bayou

969
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:16,250
where the current owners
have alienated the community.

970
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,918
That's just terrible.

971
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:19,970
This husband and wife team
seems to be

972
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:21,355
only focused
on the bottom line.

973
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,473
We're looking for financial
rewards in this business.

974
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:25,726
Chef Ramsay faces
the most deluded owners

975
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:27,511
he's ever yet.

976
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,347
Restaurants don't run
like this.

977
00:43:29,415 --> 00:43:30,949
Disagree.
I disagree
with that also.

978
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:32,383
will they change their ways?

979
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,686
We are talked down to.

980
00:43:34,753 --> 00:43:36,354
You are not
a restaurateur.
