1
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,938
Let's go! Move it!

2
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,305
50 more yards!

3
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,781
All right, let's go! Pick it up!

4
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,283
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

5
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,048
You're running out of time, Bryant!

6
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,918
Make it all the way around the track!
Come on!

7
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,855
You want to be troopers?
You better move it!

8
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,449
All right, next, get up here!

9
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,960
Let's hit it now.

10
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,188
Dean, come on!

11
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,425
All right.
You've all completed the written exam.

12
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,094
However, you must now pass
the obstacle course

13
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,729
to be admitted into the training program.

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,673
And remember, survive this,

15
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,745
and you're on the front lines
of keeping New Jersey safe.

16
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,873
Yeah.

17
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,029
Sorry about the test, Dad.

18
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,202
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.

19
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,506
Mine is named hypoglycemia.

20
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,014
Well, that's why you always have to have
sugar nearby.

21
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,016
Are you gonna have pie?

22
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,688
Not tonight, Ma.

23
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,021
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.

24
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,422
You...

25
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,432
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

26
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,660
- Okay.
- You said it,

27
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,229
and I just kind of got that
stuck in my head now,

28
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,401
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.

29
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,739
It really helps heal.

30
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,748
And, you know, not always, but sometimes,

31
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,377
you gotta do like the kids say,
and just say, "Whatever."

32
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,613
Kids don't talk like that.

33
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,952
Some do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?

34
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,458
I hear them in the mall. You know?

35
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,552
Peanut butter.

36
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,226
It just fills the cracks of the heart.

37
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,201
Go away, pain.

38
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,701
- What?
- Paulie.

39
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,836
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

40
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,675
I'm not ready for this right now.

41
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,009
- Dad.
- Please.

42
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:14,052
We just don't want to see you go through
another holiday alone.

43
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,780
But I'm not alone.

44
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,753
I've got you two. You know?

45
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,485
And besides, Black Friday's coming,

46
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,084
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.

47
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,994
What?
Lt's the busiest shopping day of the year.

48
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,533
Yeah, I should have known better
than to try to explain it to civilians.

49
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,695
I wish I had a coworker here, like, "Tyler,
hey. You know, Black Friday's coming."

50
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,567
"Gee, Paul, you don't have to tell me
Black Friday's coming.

51
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,697
"Why do you think
I've been walking around here

52
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,001
"with the eyes of an eagle?"

53
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,543
- We prepare.
- Dad, what does all that have to do

54
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,738
with being happy for the rest of your life?

55
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:45,511
You said, and I quote,
"lf I don't have a girlfriend by November,

56
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,883
"l'll let you sign me up
for perfectmatch. Com."

57
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,684
That was last year.

58
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,456
Okay.

59
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,228
- Here we are.
- Okay.

60
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,896
"What are you looking for in a woman?"

61
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,065
Well, your mother certainly
had something special.

62
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,776
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.

63
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,440
She married you, got citizenship,
and then she left us.

64
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,483
That's not entirely true.

65
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,577
We did have some good times
back when she was still trying to trick me.

66
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,919
- Well, I hate her.
- Well, you shouldn't.

67
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,616
She gave me you.

68
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,955
- I am pretty great.
- You are. You are.

69
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,124
Okay, next question.
"Tell us about yourself."

70
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,698
Let's see.

71
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,168
I know a lot about sharks.

72
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,398
Let me stop you right there.

73
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:47,104
Well-built and a great hugger.

74
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,680
Awesome, Grandma.

75
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,942
Not as awesome as this.

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,312
What are you doing?

77
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,752
Beefing up your profile with that
nifty video that you made a few years back.

78
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,187
Ma, no.

79
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,069
I don't know. Don't you think
it's a little too, "Hey, look at me"?

80
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,647
Well, that is exactly what we want.

81
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,216
Eyes on the prize.

82
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,480
And don't worry,
I will edit out the sweaty parts.

83
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,542
Dear God!

84
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,281
Hey! Back away from the vehicle.

85
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,718
Oh, dear God. Please.

86
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,819
Chompers, get down!

87
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,643
Hey, you know where a men's room is?

88
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,649
I do.
You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.

89
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,685
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.

90
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,324
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!

91
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,490
Okay, my lip is numb.

92
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,232
All righty.

93
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,170
- There you go.
- Thank you.

94
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,861
Hey.

95
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,973
Yeah, I know.

96
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,239
That's not supposed to be here.
It's a minivan.

97
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,146
...he can't handle it.
The puck travels to the far board...

98
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,888
He keeps the play alive.

99
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,245
- Paul!
- Hey.

100
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,644
What is this?

101
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,047
That's my report on how to ease
traffic flow from Macy's

102
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,709
down through the specialty shops.

103
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,879
- How's that working out for you?
- Actually, it's for all of us.

104
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,389
You see, if we could reroute the customers
away from the food court,

105
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,461
it's gonna help the kiosks
and cut down on shopper frustration.

106
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,588
It's your classic two-bird,
one-stone scenario.

107
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,661
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

108
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,069
Why can't you just punch in, shut up
and punch out like the rest of us?

109
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,166
Safety never takes a holiday.

110
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,369
Did your mom crochet that on a pillow?

111
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,604
Blart.

112
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,250
This is Sims. He's a new trainee.
Let him trail you today.

113
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,616
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten-year veteran.

114
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,951
Wow. Veck Sims.

115
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,551
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Let's mount up.

116
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,329
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

117
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,704
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.

118
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,071
Slap it, honor it.

119
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,579
So what made you want to pursue security?

120
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,515
I never finished high school.
This is all I could get.

121
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,115
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming
a state trooper, myself.

122
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,354
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight.
Hypoglycemia.

123
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,837
Confusing, right? Cut yourself some slack.

124
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,339
My first week riding on the job,
I got lost behind the Sears.

125
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,377
They found me later in the fetal position,
sporting a full beard.

126
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,037
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.

127
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,081
My uncle can. Stay snug.

128
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,742
Now, in the event
that you approach an assailant,

129
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,686
here's what I want you to do.
You're gonna pull up,

130
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:01,453
left hip forward, placing your right hand
on your away hip thusly,

131
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,656
giving the illusion that you have a gun.
Which, of course, we both know

132
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,062
you don't.

133
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,424
Okay? But you know what we do have?

134
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,067
Our voices! We have our voices.

135
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,501
If you remember one thing
from today, it's this.

136
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,205
The mind is the only weapon
that doesn't need a holster.

137
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,642
Right. Awesome.
How long do we get for lunch?

138
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,913
Half hour. But I eat in 20, which leaves me
five minutes for social time,

139
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,215
five minutes to get refocused.

140
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,660
We got a high roller.

141
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,303
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull to the right.

142
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,839
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.

143
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:53,071
Tan jacket, red scooter,
please pull to the right, out of traffic.

144
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,237
Sir.

145
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,480
Thank you.

146
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,694
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.

147
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,232
You're kidding.

148
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,996
I don't joke about shopper safety.

149
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,696
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue you a citation.

150
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,774
Gonna need your first and last. Last first.

151
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,868
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.

152
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,307
Please don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?

153
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,907
Are you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning you, sir.

154
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,051
You're pushing it.

155
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,154
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.

156
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,657
Sir. Sir. Sir.

157
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,227
Okay.

158
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,739
This is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

159
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,502
- Hey.
- Hi. Do you need something?

160
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,073
Yes. I'd like to welcome you to our mall.

161
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,403
Well, thank you.

162
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,256
Is there something else?

163
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,448
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

164
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,620
Just looking for some hair extensions.

165
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,823
Need a little more volume up top.
Do you do men?

166
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,103
Do you do men hair? Do you do men hair?
On the men?

167
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,173
Are you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?

168
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,535
I don't think so. Which one?

169
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,305
Well, that one. That one right there.

170
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,676
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

171
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,979
- Oh, wow. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. Never better.

172
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,849
Although they're docking the paycheck
pretty good.

173
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,320
Yeah.

174
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,687
You know what you should do?
You should get the security tape,

175
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,319
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,
you know, where people crash into stuff.

176
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,193
- Hello, early retirement.
- Yeah, right?

177
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,291
Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.

178
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,739
Yeah, this is Blart.
If you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.

179
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,945
Who is this?

180
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,677
Lt's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.

181
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,380
What the hell are you bothering me for?

182
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,649
- Just a Code B check.
- What a moron.

183
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,622
You know, l'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.

184
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,563
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

185
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,761
- What, what?
- No, it's just that you said security guard,

186
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,270
and it's perfectly acceptable...

187
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,068
I'm so sorry if I called you the wrong thing.

188
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,835
No, no, no, no. You did fine, you know?

189
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,173
Lt's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy

190
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,506
brewing in the industry right now,

191
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,138
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.

192
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,376
I'm sure you heard about it.

193
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,749
- I didn't.
- You will. You're gonna.

194
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,584
- But I'm sure I will.
- It's out there.

195
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,127
So, you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?

196
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:33,255
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.

197
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,823
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which
means I probably won't even get a card.

198
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,097
Everyone's too busy shopping.

199
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,398
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

200
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,805
- Yeah.
- I think that's your color.

201
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,503
- I think this'll work.
- It's a winner.

202
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,042
- So that's $9.95.
- $9.95?

203
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,673
- Yeah.
- Wow.

204
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,981
At those prices,
now you got me thinking ponytail.

205
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,785
All right. Thank you.

206
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,788
Thank you.

207
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,420
- Right. So there you go.
- Okay.

208
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,621
And, there you go.

209
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,161
Thank you, Amy.

210
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,132
Thank you, Officer Blart.

211
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,862
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice shirt.

212
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,874
You went with a medium?

213
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,033
Lt's a bit formfitting,

214
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,612
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...

215
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,341
No. Not buying it. No.

216
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,474
'Cause I don't see any vest
underneath here, so...

217
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,109
No, but it's a thick T-shirt.
Basically like a thermal they have you wear.

218
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,450
Nope. Nope. No.

219
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,552
I don't understand why you're laughing.
I just called you fat.

220
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,252
I'm not laughing.

221
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,165
Yeah, whatever. Amy.

222
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,327
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see you there.

223
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,632
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.

224
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,605
Wow. Wow.

225
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,367
Good.

226
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,775
Good hang.

227
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,475
Wow, yeah. That's great.

228
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,351
Hey, Blart, they need you
at Victoria's Secret.

229
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,547
Okay, roger that.

230
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,184
Okay, I gotta go.

231
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,819
Okay. Bye.

232
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,801
- I found it first.
- No, you didn't.

233
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,173
Ladies. Problem.

234
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,905
What's the genesis?

235
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,176
She's trying to take
the last push-up bra in this size.

236
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,013
There's gonna be a new shipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.

237
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,950
Well, I need this one now.
I have a date tonight.

238
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,046
Really? Ls he blind?

239
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,957
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.

240
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,289
Not my first rodeo.

241
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,886
Okay, ladies, need to see some ID.

242
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,465
No, you don't.

243
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,296
Ma'am, I should warn you, I do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.

244
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,339
So does anyone.
I could arrest you right now.

245
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,002
- That's true. She could.
- Hey, not talking to you. Okay?

246
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,376
Can I see you for a second, please, ma'am?

247
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,660
Look, I understand your sensitivity.

248
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,697
I've had some issues with weight myself.

249
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,964
- Are you calling me fat?
- No. No, no, no, no.

250
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,661
I'm just saying I've been down that road.

251
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,105
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both are, you know? Stranded.

252
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,736
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?

253
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,179
But as soon as I started eating healthier,

254
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,477
I noticed I wasn't so moody.

255
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,145
And PS, your skin's gonna clear up.

256
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,748
- Can you hold onto these?
- Sure.

257
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,987
Ma'am.

258
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,567
You...

259
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,942
She's got tremendous upper body strength.

260
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,612
Backup! Backup!

261
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,153
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.

262
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,382
Backup!

263
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,861
Backup! Backup!

264
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,199
Look, I know you're new here and all,

265
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,864
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.

266
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,713
Hey. Can I give you a lift?

267
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,147
What, on that?

268
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,446
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,

269
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,613
but with me,
you'll be as safe as the President.

270
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,583
I don't know. Couldn't that get you fired?

271
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,218
Yes, it could.

272
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,723
Okay.

273
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,242
- Is this all right?
- Absolutely.

274
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:28,278
And here you go. Safe and sound.

275
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,340
- '65 Mustang.
- Yeah.

276
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:37,354
Fun fact for you, a lot of people think
the Mustang was named after the horse.

277
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,118
It was actually named after
the P-51 Mustang.

278
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,055
- That's a plane.
- I didn't know that.

279
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,756
Well, thank you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.

280
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,199
No problem.

281
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,501
Listen,

282
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,602
if you ever, you know, need rides anywhere,

283
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,138
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

284
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,979
- Or we could just text each other.
- Yeah.

285
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,277
- Yeah, give me your cell phone.
- My cell?

286
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,789
Yeah, and l'll punch my number in.

287
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,392
Left it in the casuals. You know what?

288
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,522
Just give me your number
and l'll remember it.

289
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,998
- Okay. Ready?
- Yep.

290
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,569
- All right. 555...
- Not yet. Just...

291
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,296
Now I'm ready.

292
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,930
- 555...
- 555...

293
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,234
...01...
...01...

294
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,809
...78.
- Eight. Got it.

295
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,036
That's it. It's locked.

296
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,410
Great, so l'll see you tonight
at American Joe's, right?

297
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,381
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

298
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,281
- Yeah.
...why not me, too? L'll be...

299
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,478
Yeah, I'm there.

300
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,851
- Great. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

301
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,714
- Hey.
- Hey! Hey. Glad you made it, Paul.

302
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,381
Good to be here.

303
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,959
- Fun fact for you...
- This place sucks.

304
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,825
- You want to get out of here?
- No.

305
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,591
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

306
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,564
No, I was just saying that

307
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,036
the first American Joe's actually opened
its doors in 1972.

308
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,471
And most people,
because of its service and theme,

309
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,636
think that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.

310
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,577
It's its own thing.

311
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,745
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.

312
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,686
Hey, Blart, I heard you got your ass handed
to you by a fat chick at Victoria's Secret.

313
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,654
Well, I don't hit women,

314
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,216
- so I don't even know what...
- Yeah. Just minivans, right?

315
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:35,932
Hey, why don't you go over to the bar
and grab yourself one of those girly drinks?

316
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,561
- L'll meet you over there.
- Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?

317
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,969
- 'Cause Stuart's buying.
- No, no, no. They're good. They're good.

318
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,008
- So... They're good.
- Okay.

319
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:54,184
Hey, listen, I...
We're basically already together, so...

320
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,151
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

321
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,448
- And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anything.
- Yeah.

322
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,921
I just want you to grab a hold of it, tight.

323
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,082
- Okay?
- I got it.

324
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,388
I mean,
it's not like you really had a chance, okay?

325
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,362
Security guard? Really.

326
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,398
But you're a pen salesman, dude.

327
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,731
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so you can eat me.

328
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,199
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.

329
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,672
Okay, bro.

330
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:20,970
What?

331
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,580
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.

332
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,882
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

333
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,987
- Round six.
- Let's do this thing.

334
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,390
- Gentlemen ready?
- No.

335
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,121
Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.

336
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,890
And, go!

337
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,465
Leon, I can't give you the Heimlich,
so you better chew.

338
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,732
I know.

339
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,941
Told you, boy. You better hurry up.

340
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,476
There you go. Nachos in my face.

341
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,638
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers are hot.

342
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,841
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.

343
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,483
Nachos are good, man.

344
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,389
Better inform all your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.

345
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,628
You're lagging behind.

346
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,198
Come on, Paul. Playing games.

347
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,860
I love these nachos, l'll tell you that much.

348
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,831
- That lemonade is insane.
- Yeah, Paul.

349
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,400
- That's because it's a margarita.
- No. I don't drink.

350
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,973
Twist it.

351
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,549
Feel the nub.

352
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,880
- Hey, you want some? Here.
- Yeah.

353
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,347
You want fruit?

354
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,871
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.

355
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,671
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.

356
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:41,516
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.

357
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,250
Coming on the left.

358
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,491
False alarm.

359
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,966
Told my mom everything about us.

360
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,097
What are you talking about?

361
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,444
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.

362
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,547
You know. You so know.

363
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,242
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I don't know.

364
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,421
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.

365
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,689
So happy!

366
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,986
Yeah!

367
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,646
Yeah!

368
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,993
I believe in magic!

369
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,122
No way!

370
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,664
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.

371
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,334
It's fine, Ma.

372
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,470
- Hey, Dad, why don't we check for matches?
- Yes.

373
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,711
Yeah, I don't think so, sweetheart.
I think I'm just gonna turn in.

374
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:26,189
Well, how about something special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer you up?

375
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,124
I don't think so, Ma. It's fine.

376
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,034
If something's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.

377
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,196
But that would probably... You know.

378
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,569
You know, if you're doing the sloppy joe,
do the sweet potato fries.

379
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,648
But it... Whatever, you know.
Well done. Yeah.

380
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,804
Maya. Hey.

381
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,180
Dad. I'm so sorry.

382
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,382
It's okay.

383
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,052
There are other fish in the sea.

384
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,682
You just gotta keep looking.

385
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,023
And it doesn't matter what you do.

386
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:48,064
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real you,

387
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,758
all bets are off.

388
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,309
If it doesn't work out, you'll always have us.

389
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:04,509
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word you were saying.

390
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,583
You just have to...

391
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,276
Is that a tattoo?

392
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,514
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.

393
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,551
When did you get it?

394
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,185
- I got it last night.
- What is it?

395
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,297
Lt's the Loch Ness monster.

396
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,867
I don't drink.

397
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,666
- Hey.
- Hi.

398
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,270
That was

399
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,438
a little weird the other night, huh?

400
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,174
Yeah, you know, it had its moments. Yeah.

401
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,945
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with your purse?

402
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,715
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.

403
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,416
And what happens is the capillaries...

404
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:28,062
Yeah, look. A lot of people...

405
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,962
Pretty much everybody, you know, tends
to write me off.

406
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,673
And if you did, too, believe me, I get it.

407
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,306
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that you don't.

408
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,276
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...

409
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,252
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...

410
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,720
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or something?

411
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,519
- Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
- Okay.

412
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,116
- Yeah.
- I can do that. I can do that.

413
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,625
You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.

414
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,860
I can't believe you don't have a cell phone.

415
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,994
I'm not about all this technology, Vijay.

416
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,201
I prefer face-to-face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.

417
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,608
300 bucks?

418
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:18,410
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with this girl, you gotta help me. Please.

419
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,154
Paul, you've always been a straight shooter,
so l'll tell you what.

420
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,019
Why don't you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

421
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,423
- No, I can't do that.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

422
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,687
I'm punishing her.

423
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,390
No. What with all the parties
and that ex-boyfriend Pahud,

424
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,262
she went over her minutes.

425
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,996
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, l'll simply take it back.

426
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,969
Until then, you use it.

427
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,565
- Thanks.
- Sure.

428
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,110
- Stay within the minutes.
- Of course.

429
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,848
Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

430
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,748
- No one's going in there.
- Yeah. I think we are.

431
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,590
Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.

432
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,662
Look, I know you been feeling down,
so I got this for you.

433
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,936
"The Devil's Crotch."

434
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,076
Feel the burn, baby.

435
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,669
- Thanks, Leon.
- Get back at me, man.

436
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,180
- Loading dock's ready.
- Got it.

437
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,453
Yeah.

438
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,831
You need a pen, don't you?

439
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,999
You know what? No, I'm good.

440
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,837
- L'll just use one of their pens.
- Yeah, you do.

441
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,414
Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

442
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,710
- That's stunning.
- Yeah, I know.

443
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,253
How would you like to sign your name
with this panther?

444
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,651
You know what? More than anything.

445
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,552
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Here. Yeah.

446
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,522
It's yours. I insist.

447
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,085
Oh, hey, guys.

448
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,253
- Hey.
- Hey.

449
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,297
- Hey.
- Don't you just love Fridays?

450
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,025
- Yeah.
- Best night of the week.

451
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,157
Yeah.

452
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,297
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Hey.

453
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,770
Paul. Paul, can you help me out?

454
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,568
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.

455
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,506
There's a few kids inside,
just finishing up their games.

456
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,136
Could you close up the arcade for me?

457
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,340
- Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
- Okay.

458
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,917
- You okay? You seem a little down.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

459
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,918
You know, video game might
cheer you right up.

460
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,578
Nah, I'm on duty.

461
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,580
Welcome to the games!

462
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,386
Get set.

463
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,463
Go.

464
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,860
Foul. Foul.

465
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,494
Foul. Foul.

466
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,335
Foul. Foul.

467
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,872
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.

468
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,037
Game over.

469
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,451
We are ready.

470
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,715
Let's do this.

471
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,826
Attention shoppers.

472
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,623
Please make your way to the nearest exits.

473
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,891
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

474
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,127
- Everybody out!
- Everybody out!

475
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,633
Everybody out, now!

476
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,672
You, too!

477
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,058
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...

478
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,108
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

479
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,780
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy-ass people
trying to take over the mall.

480
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,581
- I'm out of here.
- Everybody on the floor!

481
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,359
Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.

482
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,505
What are you doing? Get down.

483
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,675
Oh, my God.

484
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,523
Surprised? I know.

485
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,788
But here's the craziest part.

486
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,055
I'm the leader.

487
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,936
Reports are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.

488
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,412
This is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.

489
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,348
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.

490
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,748
Let's get all these civilians out of here.

491
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,650
See if we can gain access
into the loading dock.

492
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,483
- Go.
- I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

493
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,237
Hello?

494
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,704
Feeling alive?

495
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,700
I'm sorry?

496
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,638
Parisa.

497
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,678
She makes you feel alive, doesn't she?

498
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,188
This must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.

499
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,386
My name's Paul Blart.

500
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,025
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.

501
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,225
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.

502
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,268
You are probably
sweating over her right now.

503
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,803
I'm not lying.

504
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,735
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.

505
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:29,508
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to this world.

506
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,146
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.

507
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:45,553
Paul, the pain of this breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.

508
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,325
Pahud, no one can blame you
for being upset.

509
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,868
I mean, the holidays are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.

510
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,569
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.

511
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,640
Hey, life is heavy.

512
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:04,976
Indeed. Now, you are at the mall, huh?

513
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,347
So why do you not head over
to Orange Julius,

514
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,784
call up my friend Sameer Oh?

515
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,255
Tell him you are now my homeboy.
He will hook you up.

516
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,427
Wait a second.
How'd you know I was at the mall?

517
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,193
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't you judge me.

518
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,334
Closing time already.

519
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:36,369
Okay, there are 223 stores in this mall.

520
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,576
Here is a list of the 15 that I need you to hit.

521
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,242
And 15 for you.

522
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,081
Okay.

523
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,286
Now this is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit-card machine.

524
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,385
They change every day, so make sure

525
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:56,432
that you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.

526
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,324
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like you said.

527
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,414
Perfect.

528
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,362
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

529
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,627
And these little piggies went
all the way home.

530
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:32,726
Do it.

531
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:46,645
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.

532
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,580
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.

533
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,157
Kindly tie up the person beside you,
keep your mouths shut,

534
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:59,195
give up your cell phones,
and as a general rule, do as I say.

535
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,890
You do all these things...
Well, you'll be back at home in no time.

536
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,058
Back to your mediocre lives.

537
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,528
- I don't have one.
- Amy.

538
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:17,808
I was hoping that you and I could have
a whole Bonnie-and-Clyde thing going on.

539
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,646
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.

540
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,479
What do you say?

541
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,755
Go to hell.

542
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,618
Ouch.

543
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,656
Hey, Stewie, you don't mind
that I'm hitting on your girlfriend, do you?

544
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,064
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.

545
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:42,502
But I specifically heard you say
that you two were "basically together."

546
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:47,908
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.

547
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,381
Have at it. If you...

548
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,547
God, you're an idiot.

549
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,012
Hello?

550
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,348
This is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

551
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,824
- Who am I speaking with?
- Hi.

552
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,724
Yeah, well, so here's the deal.

553
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:10,025
As you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the doors,

554
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,465
so if you wanna enter my mall,

555
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:16,028
you might as well bring
at least six body bags.

556
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,869
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.

557
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,841
See if we can tap into the security cameras.

558
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,174
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.

559
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,805
Is there anything you need? Do you need
any food? Do you need any water?

560
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:32,083
Oh, man. This dude
doesn't deviate from the book at all.

561
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,517
You know, since you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,

562
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,221
you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,

563
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,591
'cause I already have the dragon.

564
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,564
Okay, okay, now what is it you really want?

565
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,062
Silence.

566
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,636
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,

567
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:58,841
but I can help you find the nearest exit
if you just tell me where you parked.

568
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,747
Sweet mercy.

569
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,147
This is not happening,
this is not happening, this is...

570
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,386
Oh, God. All right, think, Paul, think.

571
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,360
Now what are you trained to do?

572
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,563
Nothing.

573
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:26,270
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.

574
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,943
Yo, we got a straggler.

575
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,813
- It's a security guard.
- What should we do?

576
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,410
I don't know. Give up, I guess.

577
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,515
Guys, what is wrong with you?
We stick to the plan.

578
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,561
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.

579
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,687
He says he's a security officer in the mall.

580
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,131
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.

581
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,726
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.

582
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,397
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.

583
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,497
I need you to exit the building immediately.

584
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,308
We don't need any wild cards
in this situation.

585
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,073
Copy that. Never been a wild card.

586
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,945
Unless you consider the game of Uno wild.

587
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:12,417
- Blart! Can we focus here, please?
- Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

588
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,923
Okay, okay. Come on, don't die. Don't die.

589
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,593
Blart.

590
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,159
Don't pee. Don't pee.

591
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,435
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.

592
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,173
Amy.

593
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,548
What the hell is he doing? Come on!

594
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,814
- Paul, come on!
- Paulie, come on!

595
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,048
- What's he doing?
- Come on, Blart!

596
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,180
Blart, come on!

597
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,054
- Let's go! Move it!
- Come on! Come on!

598
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,649
- Get out of there!
- Come on!

599
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,687
Ls he crying?

600
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,856
- I can't leave her.
- Where's he going?

601
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,058
- Blart!
- Where's he going?

602
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,193
Blart, get back! Will you talk to him, please?

603
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,000
Blart, this is Brooks. What's going on?

604
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:08,475
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect this mall
and all inside it.

605
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,011
What oath? We don't have an oath.

606
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,278
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.

607
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,880
Listen, I think you're making a big mistake.

608
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,580
SWAT's on the way.

609
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,820
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
you're untrained, you're unarmed,

610
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,828
and let's face it, son,
you present a huge target.

611
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,730
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.

612
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:31,823
Over.

613
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,564
Well, Sergeant,
looks like you got your eyes on the inside.

614
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:40,805
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are you still in the mall?

615
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,412
Send.

616
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,753
Got him.

617
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,110
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

618
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,121
Think. Think. Think, think, think,
think, think, think, think! Think!

619
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,004
Hold it together.

620
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,777
Heart of a warrior.

621
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,353
I missed lunch.

622
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,703
Thank you.

623
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,643
This isn't happening, this is not happening.

624
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,692
Hey! Don't make this hard.

625
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,503
You like that?

626
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,897
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

627
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,129
- Wow, Paul, you got one.
- Yes.

628
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:24,730
But let the record show,
I did not hit a woman. I just...

629
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,706
I put all my weight on her.

630
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,572
Oh, Paul.

631
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,680
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.

632
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,806
Well, good, let's get you out of there.

633
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,681
No can do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.

634
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,416
What the heck is this?

635
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,957
Give me that.

636
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,384
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard again.

637
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,361
Since you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need you to go into the bank

638
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,261
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.

639
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,559
With honor, sir.

640
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,705
Good to know.

641
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,168
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.

642
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:33,208
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.

643
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:37,804
And I need to get this mall locked down
from the inside immediately.

644
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,549
Why don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.

645
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:46,020
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages
are the only thing keeping the cops outside.

646
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,663
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need this location secured.

647
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,331
- We got a three-block perimeter...
- Establish a perimeter

648
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,409
and get all these people out of here.

649
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,737
Whoa, whoa, this is all done already.

650
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,812
My men are gonna do it again, the right way.

651
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,279
Have your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

652
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:15,943
- A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
- Well, let's make some noise.

653
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,351
I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.

654
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:21,390
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.

655
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,890
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.

656
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:28,954
L'll be ready to take on-scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.

657
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,663
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.

658
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,833
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.

659
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,801
There she is.

660
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,137
My, God. You are my angel pie.

661
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,274
Here come the love sweats.

662
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,275
Paul, your radio's still on.

663
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:24,776
Roger that.

664
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:29,157
- What's going on? Who is that?
- We got a guy on the inside.

665
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,591
Don't tell me one of your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.

666
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:36,155
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

667
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,530
- Wait a minute. Blart?
- Yeah.

668
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,966
- Paul Blart?
- Yeah.

669
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,836
Are you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in high school. Give me that.

670
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,634
Blart.

671
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,973
This is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.

672
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,173
We went to high school together.
Remember?

673
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,080
I set you on fire at the pancake festival?

674
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,686
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.

675
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,414
Go Green Hawks.

676
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,283
Yeah, listen. I've got 50 highly trained,
armed professionals out here.

677
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,453
At my command,
we are retaking this location,

678
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,623
and there's no way I'm compromising
this mission so that some mall monitor

679
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,896
who used to eat lunch
with his imaginary friend can screw it up.

680
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:17,496
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."

681
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,802
Could you do me a favor
and put Chief Brooks back on?

682
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,035
Listen to me, Blart,

683
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:25,103
you are no longer communicating
with Chief Brooks. Is that clear?

684
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,376
Hello?

685
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,581
Hello?

686
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,748
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how you doing?

687
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,017
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller area.

688
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,426
I'm gonna get a closer look.

689
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,096
Veck.

690
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,104
There he is!

691
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,443
- Everyone in the back room, now!
- Come on, move, move!

692
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,640
Let's get in the back, huh?

693
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:38,513
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.

694
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,715
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.

695
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,055
Veck? The trainee?

696
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,596
- No. The brainee.
- I don't believe this.

697
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,592
L'll pass it on to Howard.

698
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:06,909
Oh, God.

699
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,915
Trapped is fine by me.

700
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,714
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.

701
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:38,805
Yeah!

702
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,715
Yes!

703
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,938
Time for some big-game hunting.

704
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,193
Open, open, open! Thank God.

705
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,569
Oh, no.

706
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:47,876
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!

707
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,814
Get him! Get him! Get him!

708
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,089
You better run.

709
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,406
- Rudolph, where are you?
- I'm about to end this.

710
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,313
Amy, huh? What a coincidence.

711
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,118
We got a cute little redhead
down at the bank named Amy.

712
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,557
- Strawberry blonde, actually.
- Yeah?

713
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,323
Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

714
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,990
- Catch you later!
- Yeah?

715
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,330
Well, it looks like you just ran out of mall.

716
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,370
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a thing.

717
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,244
You aren't gonna touch her,
but you are gonna feel this.

718
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,320
Nobody wins with a head butt.

719
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,174
- Give me your cell phone.
- I don't have one.

720
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:04,378
What are you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.

721
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,785
I prefer handwritten sentiments.

722
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:12,760
Who are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave you this?

723
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:16,093
They're mine.
I'm late for my shift at Foot Locker.

724
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:24,366
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to you.

725
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,032
Silence, my ass.

726
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,076
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs your way,

727
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,942
you curl up in a corner, suck your thumb?

728
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,610
Lf you don't go toe-to-toe
with that scumbag,

729
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,912
he's gonna roll over on you all night long.

730
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,078
It's all right. That's not my style.

731
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:45,320
Well, just in case, I wrote down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...

732
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,486
Here.

733
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:48,857
This is what you been doing?

734
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,760
"Yeah, you and what army?"

735
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,265
- What's wrong with that?
- He has an army.

736
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,180
Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.

737
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,967
So when you and Rudolph
were laughing it up back at the crib

738
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,509
about how easy all this was gonna be,
were you guys like,

739
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,910
"Man, any brain-dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?

740
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,677
And then... And then what?
You guys all high-fived?

741
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:46,278
- Veck, this guard is...
- Winning! I know this, because I am all set!

742
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,654
But sadly, no codes!

743
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:54,093
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up

744
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:59,829
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!

745
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,927
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.

746
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,139
Give me a gun.

747
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,377
Put it down. Put it down.

748
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,635
What are you nodding about?

749
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:14,512
I was just wondering,
were you serious about that Happy Meal?

750
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,950
Lt isn't coming, is it?

751
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,616
What?

752
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,887
This is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.

753
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,223
You wanted to speak to me?

754
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,356
I just wanna make sure
that no one does anything stupid.

755
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,492
You should know my men are deployed
and ready to bring this thing to a resolution.

756
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,764
The easy way or the hard way.

757
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,931
That is such a tough call, but...

758
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,635
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!

759
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,581
I'm Amy, by the way.

760
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:49,082
- Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
- Yeah.

761
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,746
I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about you.

762
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:57,391
And I gotta say, he really does like you.

763
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,188
I'm gonna throw up.

764
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,477
Oh, that's not so bad.

765
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,463
Oh, my God.

766
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,103
They've got his daughter.

767
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,899
- Dad?
- Maya.

768
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,336
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- How's your blood sugar?

769
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,503
Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about you.

770
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,743
I love you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get you all out.

771
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,580
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?

772
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,451
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?

773
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,490
Yeah. L'll see you soon.

774
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,695
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman lslands with the hostages.

775
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,289
And where the hell is Rudolph?
He should be back by now.

776
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,493
"Lf Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman lslands"?

777
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,765
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.

778
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,989
Come and get me, Veck.

779
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,228
I got your codes
for the credit-card machines.

780
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:58,204
- Yo, you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
- Blart?

781
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,710
That's who's been screwing all this up?
You have got to be kidding me.

782
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,177
Give me a radio.

783
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,941
Let me tell you something.

784
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:10,644
You take hostages in my mall,
you are making a big mistake.

785
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,744
You seriously undermissed...

786
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,059
And you seriously...

787
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,488
Oh, no!

788
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,202
Blart?

789
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,046
Sugar. Sugar.

790
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,814
Blart? You there, Blart?

791
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,062
Hello, Blart. You there?

792
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,618
Hey, Blart!

793
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:23,482
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when you're gonna give up.

794
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,921
How about now?

795
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:30,487
L'll meet you on the corner of Ne and Ver.

796
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,399
Yeah, you heard me. Never!

797
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,993
All right, Dad.

798
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,737
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?

799
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,153
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

800
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,420
Follow me.

801
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,926
There he is.

802
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,363
We got him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.

803
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:08,436
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,

804
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,767
"lf you want something done right,
waste the guy yourself."

805
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,740
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.

806
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,017
Prancer, take the back.

807
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:36,120
Hey, you. Scuba Dooby-Doo.

808
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:01,914
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now, please?

809
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,281
Why? No codes, no Cayman lslands?

810
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,251
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.

811
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,947
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

812
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:11,250
No.

813
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,053
One thing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.

814
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:42,718
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!

815
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:50,490
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.

816
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,397
Okay, who's talking to Blart?

817
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,503
Was it you, sugar mouth?

818
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,167
All right. Let's try this again.

819
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,834
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

820
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,470
Lt's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to him.

821
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:09,608
She's talking to him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.

822
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,915
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.

823
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,214
Okay.

824
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,351
That was close.

825
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,223
He is a pro.

826
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,062
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.

827
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,966
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit-card codes, and I got them.

828
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,629
Just give me a few minutes.

829
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,763
No problem.

830
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,554
Isn't that cute?

831
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:19,080
- Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
- Oh, hey, Blart.

832
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,950
Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to your profile

833
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,992
on lonelyloser. Com.

834
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,594
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."

835
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:32,195
Who are you, Olivia Newton-John?

836
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,031
I was just speaking from the heart.

837
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:39,733
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that you love peanut brittle.

838
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:40,866
You're so pathetic.

839
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:46,674
Trippy.

840
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,344
This I can use.

841
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,118
What do you want, Veck?

842
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,489
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.

843
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:03,258
But, you know, I would settle offing
your dream girl, or maybe your daughter.

844
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,758
You touch them, I swear l'll end you.

845
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,302
What're you gonna do, Paul?

846
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,736
You gonna pull up with your left hip forward
giving the illusion that you have a gun,

847
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,138
which you and I both know you don't?

848
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:18,640
- I could.
- You're not gonna do squat.

849
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:21,978
The next time I see you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

850
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:25,645
I don't think so. I'm taking you down.

851
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,065
Blart!

852
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,876
Oh, Blart.

853
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,985
Sweet mercy.

854
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,296
I wish I had a bat. I would bust you open,
see how much candy fell out.

855
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,233
- Too tight!
- This is not happening.

856
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,498
- It's not happening.
- Come on.

857
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,801
Bravo. That was awesome.

858
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,937
And you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

859
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:56,010
- It's not over yet.
- Yeah, I think it is.

860
01:16:56,111 --> 01:17:01,310
Now the only thing I need are my codes,
which, judging from your text messages,

861
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:05,580
you have been so sweet as to enter them
into your phone just for me.

862
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,888
You think I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

863
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,534
- Yello?
- Peanut Blart and Jelly.

864
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:27,075
What's up, man?
So good to hear your voice.

865
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,437
Yeah, it's good to hear
your voice, too, Pahud.

866
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,033
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

867
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,909
- What? When?
- I don't know when. L'll talk to you later.

868
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,916
Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!

869
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,982
I mean,
this just keeps getting better and better.

870
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:44,024
I mean, you are impossible
to underestimate.

871
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,957
I mean, you can't pass the trooper exam,

872
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:50,020
you black out if you don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,

873
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,795
you had the chance to be the MVP,
and you blew it.

874
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:57,065
Again, like you always do.
Ain't that right, Maya?

875
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,975
What do you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.

876
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,885
You're good on computers,
you kept your weight under control.

877
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,688
I mean, people,
they look at me and you, and...

878
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,659
Yeah, it's a landslide.

879
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,654
It's no contest.

880
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,592
Sorry.

881
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:29,230
Right now, you're the man with the gun.

882
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,030
So here you go.

883
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,293
Come on!

884
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,827
Go get him!

885
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:55,157
Go, Dad.

886
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,325
What...

887
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,268
Probably should have capitalized on that.

888
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,134
Dad!

889
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,272
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.

890
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,690
Hey, we're on the move.

891
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,020
Let's go.

892
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,499
Come on, come on, come on.

893
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:48,475
Paul. Think, Paul. Think!

894
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:55,378
Let's go, men. Take it down.
Secure the suspects.

895
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,661
Get down!

896
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,000
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

897
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,706
Down. The other one. That's the back one.

898
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:20,213
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!

899
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,977
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.

900
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,885
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.

901
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,549
Light.

902
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:32,660
Open the door.

903
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,998
Let's do this.

904
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,101
Jimmy, give me your cell phone.

905
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:50,071
Gotta hand it to you, Blart.
You're really taking care of business.

906
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,172
What up?

907
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,909
Pahud, do you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?

908
01:20:56,017 --> 01:21:00,317
You know I do, Paul. You know I do.
What can I do for you?

909
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,083
I need to know where it's headed.

910
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:08,293
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.

911
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,557
I know where that is. Thanks.

912
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:12,961
Hang on.

913
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,165
My God. There they are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.

914
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:19,331
What?

915
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,974
Here we go! Here we go!

916
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:25,345
That was me. I can't...

917
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,193
Here I go! No!

918
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:52,999
Blart!

919
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,274
Don't do it! Blart!

920
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:17,389
Oh, God. Oh, God.

921
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,012
Maya! Maya, get inside.

922
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,040
- Oh, God!
- Dad!

923
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,209
Paul?

924
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,060
I really don't drink.

925
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,171
Come on. Oh, yeah?

926
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,731
- Dad!
- Come on.

927
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:07,305
Dad!

928
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,510
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.

929
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,652
I told you I'd take you down.

930
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,157
Blart!

931
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,669
Very impressive,
taking down an assailant without a gun.

932
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,238
I hope you don't mind if I use one.

933
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:32,631
What?

934
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,942
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

935
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,805
I guess
it's off to the Cayman lslands then, huh?

936
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,349
Soon as I get my money.

937
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:47,080
Yeah, well, you'll be needing this.

938
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,156
Just give it to him, Dad.

939
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:53,422
Oh, I will. Suck on that!

940
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,792
Okay. Situation update?

941
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,594
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

942
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:05,263
- Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,603
You see, jackass? I don't need the phone.

944
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,734
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.

945
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:11,971
Now, I kill you three,
there'll be no witnesses.

946
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,640
And since everybody thinks
this was a bank...

947
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:33,600
I got a newsflash for you.
Your flight's been canceled.

948
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:38,070
That's better than anything I got.

949
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:47,441
You did good, Dad.

950
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,884
Yeah, I am pretty great.

951
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,558
You know, she doesn't need a green card.

952
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,902
I don't know what to say.

953
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,064
I have something I want to say to you.

954
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,439
Happy birthday, Amy.

955
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,532
I heard you applied to be a state trooper.

956
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:19,300
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have you.

957
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,777
Thank you, sir. But I think
I'm gonna stick with what I do best.

958
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,209
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

959
01:26:45,505 --> 01:29:55,679
THE END
