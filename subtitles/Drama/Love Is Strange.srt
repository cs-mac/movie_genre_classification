1
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,465
Glasses. I can't find my glasses.

2
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,845
Not today. Please, God, not today.

3
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,479
Has anybody seen my glasses?

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,482
Right here, Mr. Ben.

5
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,859
Do you have the list?

6
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,530
No, it's in the kitchen.

7
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,206
I think 40 will cover it.

8
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,500
Maybe you can send Eugenia
to the market.

9
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,918
Okay.

10
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,088
-How's the lasagna?
-Oh, I just put it in.

11
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,631
It looks delicious.

12
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,300
-Let me see.
-Sweetie, do you have any cash?

13
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,178
-Not too early to put it in?
-I know what I'm doing.

14
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,889
-Close the door and go.
-So how do l look?

15
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,475
You look fantastic.

16
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,436
-Both of you.
-It's almost 1 1 . George, we have to go.

17
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,064
-I'm waiting for you.
-I need cash for Eugenia.

18
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,191
-You smell good too.
-Thank you.

19
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,194
-Let's go. Thank you, Zlata.
-We'll be back about 1 :30.

20
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,323
-You got the papers?
-Yes, l've got them, Vera Vague. Let's go.

21
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,541
They're all full, George.

22
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,669
Don't worry. We'll still be okay.
Don't worry.

23
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,224
We might have better luck on 6th.
Come on.

24
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,484
Wait. George?

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,238
-You all right?
-I don't want to get all sweaty.

26
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,284
You look fine. You look fine.

27
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,539
But we can't just wander.
We can't just wander.

28
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,708
We should have hired a car service.

29
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,085
Yes, you keep saying that.

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,880
We are gathered here today...

31
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,257
...in the presence of these witnesses...

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,594
...with the purpose of uniting
in matrimony...

33
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,472
...George Esteban Garea...

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,141
...Benjamin Arthur Hull.

35
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,644
Everybody who's here,
I'd like to ask you...

36
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,565
...to try to stop thinking about your jobs,
your marriage, your schoolwork...

37
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,777
...what you have to do tomorrow,
what you forgot today...

38
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,239
...and let us focus all of our energies...

39
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,074
...and all of our love...

40
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,409
...on these two men here:
George and Ben.

41
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,870
So I'd like to ask of you...

42
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,374
...if you would commit
to honor and support...

43
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,751
...these two individuals...

44
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,922
...and their love and their life
and in their marriage together.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,591
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Yes!

46
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,093
Yes!

47
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,055
There is a question l have to ask
and it may seem obvious, the answer...

48
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,891
...but it's still a very important question.

49
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,228
Are you both making this decision
of your own free will?

50
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,191
Yes.

51
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,111
He's already weighing at me,
I only know.

52
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,073
-What do you think? No, no.
-Come on, come on.

53
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,577
Away.

54
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,454
Would you like a cookie?

55
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,040
Excuse me for interrupting you.
I made them.

56
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,917
You made them for real? Sure.

57
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,673
Excuse me. Roberto, would you like--?

58
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,091
No, thank you.

59
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,387
Thattaboy, Georgie.

60
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,238
That's me he's talking about.

61
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,580
Your part, Ted.
This is the sexy part.

62
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,253
Oh, yeah.

63
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,869
Okay, here we-- Take it home now.

64
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,085
Not just in the kitchen.

65
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,232
Georgie, I love you!

66
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,319
Guys, guys, guys. Quiet, quiet.

67
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,488
I just wanna say something.

68
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,616
When I met my husband--
My husband.

69
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,661
Elliot here. --he was walking around
with a camera...

70
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,956
...making amazing videos
with people he met on the street...

71
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,584
...creating scenes
out of ordinary situations.

72
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,212
I was just finishing my first novel...

73
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,590
...and I immediately thought,
"We make a great pair."

74
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,970
Two independent spirits
committed to our art.

75
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,513
So we started to go out...

76
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,684
...and he said that he wanted me
to meet his Uncle Ben.

77
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:20,021
I said, "Well, why your uncle?" Elliot said
that since his mother had passed...

78
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,858
...his uncle was his favorite person
in his family.

79
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,401
Thank you, Elliot.

80
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,570
Not including siblings, Mindy.

81
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,907
So we came here one night.

82
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,660
You guys had just moved
into this apartment...

83
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:38,248
...and George had prepared us
a delicious spaghetti Bolognese.

84
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,376
We drank wine and we sang...

85
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,503
...and we drank some more...

86
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,841
...and it was just wonderful.

87
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,718
And when we left...

88
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,472
...Elliot said to me,
"l wanted you to meet the two of them...

89
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,892
...because they have been together
for more than 20 years."

90
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,060
So I understood....

91
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,022
Oh, my, I'm going to cry.

92
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,941
I understood that--

93
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,446
That he was proposing to me
because you guys--

94
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,866
Your love, your dedication,
your commitment to each other.

95
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,076
--are an example to be followed.

96
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,537
May this love, may this marriage...

97
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,956
...last forever and beyond.

98
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,584
-To Ben and George.
-Thank you, Kate.

99
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,420
-And to Petra!
-Petra!

100
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,924
-Petra Von Kant!
-Petra, Petra! Petra, Petra!

101
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,682
"All who serve in the archdiocese
should believe in God...

102
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,434
...support belief in Jesus Christ...

103
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,270


...engage in prayer...

104
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,981
...respect ecclesiastical authority...

105
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,901
...not take a public position
contrary to the Catholic Church--"

106
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,821
Are you going to read me
the whole Witness Statement?

107
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,156
The Christian Witness Statement,
George.

108
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,118
You signed it when you took this job.

109
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,331
How long have we known each other?

110
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,213
Twelve years.

111
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,924
-You have to understand that--
-Understand what?

112
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,969
That day when you announced
you were getting married...

113
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,971
...at the spring semester meeting--

114
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,141
You've all known
that Ben and l have been living together.

115
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,852
Word got out to the archdiocese.

116
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,438
Then someone showed pictures
to the bishop...

117
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,065
...of you and Ben in Petra.

118
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,818
On Facebook, of all places.

119
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,362
I wouldn't have done anything
any differently.

120
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,115
I'm not saying you should have, George.

121
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,200
But the bishop wasn't happy.

122
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,328
And what about the students?

123
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,707
I've known them since they were kids.
And their parents.

124
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,084
They've been to my house,
played my piano.

125
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,420
They've sung with Ben and me.

126
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,715
The decision is effective immediately.

127
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,155
George, let's pray.

128
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,205
It's important
that you don't question your faith.

129
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,916
Thank you very much, Father.

130
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,921
I still believe in Jesus Christ as my savior
and that won't change...

131
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,883
...but at this moment,
I think I'd like to pray on my own.

132
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,564
Well, let's not forget
that the real estate agent...

133
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,733
...gets a first-month commission.

134
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,652
The co-op board gets a month...

135
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,488
...plus they charge
a 5 percent administration fee.

136
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,575
A month? That's ridiculous. Why do
they charge an administration fee?

137
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,204
-To discourage rentals in the building.
-I hate co-ops.

138
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,207
-Hard to find a condo in Manhattan.
-Not true anymore.

139
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,044
Anyway, we're trying to explain why
renting doesn't help us because--

140
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,879
You've been to my house, right?

141
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,340
You know how much
my real-estate taxes are?

142
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,551
Three thousand. For the whole year.

143
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,219
It's Poughkeepsie, Mindy.

144
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,390
Renting would leave us owing
about a thousand a month.

145
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,227
If we find a studio for, say, 1 500....

146
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,895
And that's very hard.

147
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,773
I mean,
we're starting each month at 3000.

148
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,692
And you can't afford that?

149
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,070
Well, with my private lessons
and Ben's pension....

150
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,198
Why did you guys go
on such a fancy honeymoon?

151
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,159
Mindy! It's none of your business.

152
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,995
Of course it is.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

153
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,457
I'm just saying. There's nothing wrong
with Provincetown.

154
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,418
-Have a seat.
-Everything okay?

155
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,545
Yeah. Just wanted to talk to you.

156
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,552
Now, we invited you all here today
because, well, you're family.

157
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,013
Are you telling us
you're getting divorced?

158
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,056
-That's what I thought too.
-No.

159
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,771
We....

160
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,608
We have to sell the apartment.

161
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,110
And we found a buyer already...

162
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,447
...so pretty soon
we're gonna have to move out.

163
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,492
Now, it won't be long
before I get another job...

164
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,204
...and it shouldn't be long
before we find another apartment...

165
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,372
...but in the meantime--

166
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,919
It's just a transition phase.
Probably just a week or two.

167
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,802
We need a place to stay.

168
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,514
Wait a minute.
Did I miss something here?

169
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,267
These last weeks
have been tough on us, Elliot.

170
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,270
Losing the job,
looking for health insurance.

171
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,022
-We need a breather.
-Yeah.

172
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,858
Moving out of here
is the last thing we want to do.

173
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,069
It's only temporary.

174
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,948
We'll find a new place. Very soon.

175
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,664
Uncle, l'm sorry
I was a little bit rough in there.

176
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,999
-Let's go. Elliot.
-Think positive, Ben.

177
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,668
Thanks for the beer.

178
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,506
I love you guys.
I'll call you during the week.

179
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,637
We're right here.

180
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,141
-Good night. Bye-bye.
-Bye, Mama.

181
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,687
I feel bad that I can't help out,
but you've seen my apartment.

182
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,981
It's okay. They can stay with me.

183
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,235
I had a feeling that they were hoping
to stay with one of us here in the city.

184
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,281
-Didn't you see the look on their faces?
-What are you talking about?

185
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,158
I'm saying
they don't want to go live upstate.

186
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,828
Country boys all of a sudden.
I can't see that.

187
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,206
-It's temporary.
-Honey's right.

188
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,375
Maybe there's something
that we can do.

189
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,254
-I thought we figured it all out already.
-Mindy.

190
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,257
I'm the only one
with the extra bedroom.

191
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,343
No, it's not about that, Mindy.
It's Poughkeepsie.

192
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,179
-When were you there last?
-That doesn't matter.

193
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,600
George has his private students here.
Ben has his galleries.

194
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,560
They need to look
for an apartment.

195
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,479
Doesn't make sense
to live two and a half hours away.

196
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,107
-It's an hour and a half.
-Not by bus.

197
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,359
-By car.
-They don't drive.

198
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,695
They can very well learn how to.

199
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,824
-Are you really serious, Mindy?
-Shut the fuck up, Honey.

200
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,202
You're not even family,
so you don't get to decide anything.

201
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,121
They're right upstairs, you guys.

202
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,249
Since we're here, why don't we step
inside my apartment.

203
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,085
Elliot, let's go.
I still have some work to do.

204
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,088
-Can we just figure this out?
-It's almost 7:00.

205
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,382
-Please.
-We'll miss supper.

206
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,661
So why don't you tell me
how and where...

207
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,707
...we can accommodate a crowd this size
if we can't close the street at 7.

208
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,208
Dad.

209
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,170
No, that's because you told me
we had a permit.

210
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,380
Dad, can we just talk for a second?

211
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,965
James, hold on.

212
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,760
So the geography project
that I have to do?

213
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,219
No, help me out.

214
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,013
-Sustainable development.
-Yes.

215
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,183
They're painting Vlad's house,
so I told him to come here.

216
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,894
No, 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.
That's what I requested.

217
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,645
-Dad.
-Please, hold on.

218
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,690
They're painting Vlad's house.
I told him to come here.

219
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,151
Are you gonna be
in the living room all day?

220
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,154
-Joey, this is important.
-It's quick. He's on his way.

221
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:58,117
Sorry, son. James, you know two hours
can make all the difference in the world.

222
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,535
Close the street....

223
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,162
-Who is this?
-Vlad.

224
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,498
He can come in.
It's my friend. Thanks.

225
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,922
-What's up?
-I found a book on the Amazon.

226
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,092
Some really cool pictures
of naked natives and everything.

227
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,510
Nice.

228
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,387
-Your dad is home?
-Yeah.

229
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,932
-Do you not understand?
-Go to your room?

230
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,727
-I gotta talk to my mom first, but....
-Okay.

231
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,815
-Can l get some water?
-Yeah, sure.

232
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,195
I'll tell you what I don't understand.
This has been on the schedule....

233
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,072
Oh, hello.

234
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,615
I'm Vlad.

235
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,742
My name is Eugenia.

236
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,120
I work for Joey's parents.

237
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,581
-Are you Russian?
-Yes.

238
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,880
We might go to the library.

239
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,217
But isn't Vlad here?

240
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,844
Yeah. I told you.

241
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,221
So then why don't you just work here?

242
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,646
Why? What?

243
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,572
Well, just wake him gently, then.

244
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,657
You do it. l'm not....

245
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,079
Joey.

246
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,043
Uncle Ben?

247
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,089
Uncle Ben, l'm so sorry to wake you.

248
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,343
Hi. Joey has something
that he needs to ask you.

249
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,970
Mom....

250
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,016
-Hi, Uncle Ben.
-Hey.

251
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,517
Hi.

252
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,645
My friend Vlad is here...

253
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,232
...and we need to work
on a school presentation...

254
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,819
...and there's nowhere else
for us to study.

255
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,487
Who?

256
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,575
Oh, Vlad.

257
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,870
Good to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

258
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,872
Hi, Uncle Ben.

259
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,084
Sorry, l--
I guess l'd fallen asleep.

260
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,878
What time is it?

261
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,505
It's 2.

262
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,344
2:05.

263
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,557
So what's this presentation
you're working on?

264
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,687
This little box connects directly
to our Netflix account...

265
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,731
...our iTunes, our YouTube.

266
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,150
Here. Hang on. Watch.
Let me show you.

267
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,404
-Oh, have you seen this?
-No, what is that?

268
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,740
You have never seen this?

269
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,117
It's Game of Thrones.

270
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,163
Oh, look.

271
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,749
Daenerys Targaryen.

272
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,751
I love her.

273
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,544
She's so regal.

274
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,713
Yeah, I can see that.

275
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,299
She's shopping for an army
in Slaver's Bay.

276
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,928
It's quite sexy, isn't it, the whole thing?

277
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,014
I could do with one
of those slaves myself.

278
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,433
Why does she need
a whole army of them?

279
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,187
She's a princess in exile who's coming
back to the Seven Kingdoms.

280
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,565
She needs an army.
And her brother was....

281
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,112
No, I'm not even gonna tell you because
you are going to watch it with me.

282
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,822
We are?

283
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,532
Hey, guys.

284
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,826
George, you met my friend Doreen, right?

285
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,995
-Doreen.
-Hey.

286
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,251
-Hi, George.
-I need your help in the kitchen.

287
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,169
Just two minutes, babe.

288
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:42,049
-How are your new daddies treating you?
-Oh, I can't complain.

289
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,386
I've always liked this couch.
I've taken good naps here.

290
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,929
It's a good bed too.

291
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,224
If I drink too much,
maybe I'll sleep here with you tonight.

292
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,770
Ours is on mixed farming,
which is when a farmer manages...

293
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,565
...a mix of different crops and animals.

294
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,608
So why is that eco-friendly?

295
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,986
Well, nobody says "eco-friendly" anymore.

296
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,614
-Isn't it "eco-efficient" now?
-It's "sustainable."

297
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,492
Sustainable agriculture.

298
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,372
So how is mixed farming
sustainable, then?

299
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,543
Well, the crop residues
are used as food for the animals...

300
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:22,048
...and the excrements
from the animals...

301
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,134
...is used as a nutrient for the crop.

302
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,179
Joey. Your uncle's still eating.

303
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,014
Oh, sorry.

304
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,269
Yeah, well, they're only just now
deciding to have dinner.

305
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,938
No, I can't.
I've got a student in the morning.

306
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,648
Anybody in?

307
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,109
Hello.

308
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,115
-Linda, hey!
-I can't believe it.

309
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,618
Someone's just turned up
with a bloody baby.

310
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,121
Look at me. See? See?
Doreen, Doreen.

311
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,625
No, I went to the diner,
got some matzo ball soup.

312
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,004
I made my beef stew tonight.

313
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,509
Yeah, I think they did.
They ate the whole thing.

314
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,928
But they didn't say anything.

315
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,431
No. No, they're very nice.

316
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,850
But sometimes...

317
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,187
...when you live with people...

318
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,024
...you know them better
than you care to, and so....

319
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,821
I miss you too.

320
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,325
Yeah, well, this is what....

321
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,411
What l don't quite understand.

322
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,289
Why is it that we're only seeing...

323
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,626
...$1 7,535 in profit?

324
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:45,131
To start, you have to take into account
the 1 percent New York City transfer tax...

325
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,384
...the 4 percent New York State tax,
plus 6 percent to me.

326
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,136
That's 60,000 right there.

327
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,389
I understand that,
but according to my calculations...

328
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:57,143
-...that should still leave--
-Don't forget your co-op also has...

329
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,896
...a flip tax of 25 percent
on whatever profit you make...

330
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,023
...if you sell before five years.

331
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,859
It is five years.

332
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,777
I mean, it's been five years.

333
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,488
We bought in 2007.
It's now 201 3.

334
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,660
But, Mr. Garea, you didn't actually close
until January, if you remember.

335
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,872
So that's 2008,
and they go by the calendar year.

336
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,460
So you would actually have to sell
in 2014 to avoid the flip tax.

337
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,087
This is really like something out of Kafka.

338
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:30,384
Look at it this way. You've lived
in a nice apartment for 20 years.

339
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,805
Five of that-- Well, nearly five of that.
--as an owner.

340
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,016
And you sold it at a profit.

341
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:43,898
You're getting $1 7,535,
which is all yours.

342
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,984
Thank you.

343
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,867
Did I tell you my gallerist friend
is a big fan of yours?

344
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,537
What? Who?

345
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,666
-A fan of mine?
-Yeah, she loves your book.

346
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,254
I need some tea.

347
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,507
You want some?

348
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,386
I would love some. Thank you.

349
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,223
You remember her, right?

350
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,392
-Who?
-Aida.

351
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,102
My gallerist friend.

352
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,731
On the Lower East Side, yes.
I think that l met her.

353
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,275
Tall blond.

354
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,778
Swedish.

355
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,905
Yes, l met her.

356
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,450
Last week I stopped by the gallery
and she was reading your book.

357
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,827
I screamed.
I absolutely screamed.

358
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,083
She had no idea
that you were my niece.

359
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,936
You know my favorite story of yours?

360
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,731
The one about the old high-school friend
who shows up at the diner.

361
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,276
She sees him....

362
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,657
But l can't remember
why she can't be sure it's her friend.

363
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,745
The worst part of getting old is memory.

364
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,541
It only gets worse with time,
let me tell you.

365
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,423
She can't see him
because he's outside and it's snowing.

366
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,967
Oh, right, he's in the car, right?

367
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,137
She's not really sure that it's him.

368
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,848
Because of the blizzard.

369
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,600
Right.

370
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:48,063
So beautiful, Kate. Really.
Just wonderful writing.

371
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,817
It's hot.

372
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,074
Which one is your favorite?

373
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,494
I don't have a favorite.

374
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:06,248
It's like me with my painting.
I don't have a favorite either.

375
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,125
George does.

376
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,712
He loves those two nudes
that hang in the bedroom.

377
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,006
That used to hang in the bedroom.

378
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,427
-I gave those to him for his 40th.
-Fortieth. Yes.

379
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,137
I remember.
I love those too.

380
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,974
You know, maybe you could start
a new painting soon.

381
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,227
It's the hardest thing, Kate,
to be honest with you.

382
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,564
I brought all my stuff here, but....

383
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,609
-What?
-Well...

384
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,613
...it's just that l can't really work
if there's someone else around.

385
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,949
I can't concentrate, you know?

386
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,851
How did it go?

387
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,361
Better than we could have ever expected.

388
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,154
I knew it.

389
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,041
I called you to see if you were
coming home for dinner.

390
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,336
-You did?
-Yes. l left a message.

391
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,588
Sorry, baby.

392
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,425
I didn't even have a moment
to check my messages.

393
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,429
That busy?

394
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,975
Yeah. We got it all in the can.

395
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,603
That's great.

396
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,941
I'm exhausted.

397
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,031
I wanna sleep, baby.

398
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,869
Sleep.

399
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,919
What is it, Kate?

400
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,468
Unlike you,
I didn't have a very productive day.

401
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,182
Was it Joey?

402
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,684
Joey? No.

403
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,061
Joey hardly said two words
to me today...

404
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,315
...but if you were around more,
you'd see that's the norm.

405
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,778
Was it the neighbors again?

406
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,282
No. Elliot, it's your uncle.

407
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:51,538
When they're playing loud music,
it's easy to tell them to turn it down.

408
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:57,586
But when it's Uncle Ben chatting away,
it's a lot harder to tell him to shut up.

409
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,059
Mr. Garea?

410
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,771
Yes, that's me. This is Mr. Hull.
I'd like him to come with me.

411
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,023
Okay. Right this way.

412
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,613
These apartments are city-sponsored
and are currently accepting applications.

413
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,157
The tenants are selected by a lottery...

414
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,578
...but first you need to meet the criteria
for the specific development...

415
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,705
...and each one has its own.

416
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,625
-Sorry, l only have one.
-We can share.

417
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,253
The city itself does not rent
the apartments...

418
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,589
...so if you are selected,
this is a private transaction...

419
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,842
...between yourselves
and the developer.

420
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,385
You understand?

421
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,180
You need to contact the developer
or the marketing agent directly.

422
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,059
You'll see phone numbers
and other info in this list I just gave you.

423
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,894
I have a question.

424
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,355
We're married.

425
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,859
-So we'll be applying together.
-Okay.

426
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,990
For example, this one-bedroom property
in Fort Greene-Wallabout.

427
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,701
Five hundred and eleven dollars
monthly rental...

428
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,664
...$1 9,509 minimum earnings figure...

429
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,501
...maximum is 23,240.

430
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,964
The minimum-earning figure,
would that be for both of us?

431
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,799
Yes, both together.

432
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,385
Good. l wasn't sure about that.

433
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,888
Anything you find there
that's interesting...

434
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,974
...you need to check to see
that you meet the criteria.

435
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,144
Well, that's all I have for now.

436
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,188
Well, sounds like a good start.

437
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,361
Thanks very much.

438
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,992
-Sir, can I ask you a question?
-Yes.

439
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,411
-How old are you?
-Seventy-one.

440
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,663
You might want to try the DFTA as well.

441
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,583
-DFTA?
-Department for the Aging.

442
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,211
They have a whole department
just for us.

443
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,339
Isn't that encouraging.

444
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:09,051
They keep a list of affordable housing
for senior citizens.

445
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,137
There's usually a waiting list,
but it's worth a try.

446
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,764
Oh, thank you.

447
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,891
Thanks very much.

448
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,673
What the fuck, Vlad?

449
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,676
I'm posing for your uncle's
new masterpiece.

450
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,012
That's so gay.

451
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:59,226
People have been modeling for painters
for centuries now, Joe.

452
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,686
All kinds of people.

453
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,896
He doesn't mean "homosexual,"
Uncle Ben.

454
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,482
-He just means "stupid."
-Don't worry, Vlad.

455
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,442
Joey and l understand each other.

456
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,695
You're not even a good artist anyway.

457
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,824
-Joey.
-What?

458
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,243
I know you don't mean that.

459
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,120
Yeah, I do.

460
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:22,833
If you were, you wouldn't be sleeping
on a bunk bed in your nephew's house.

461
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,091
Did you find him?

462
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,177
He's on the fucking rooftop
with Uncle Ben.

463
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,722
-Watch the language.
-I'm going out.

464
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,182
And Vlad?

465
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,270
Uncle Ben is making him pose
for a painting.

466
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,480
-He's what?
-You heard me.

467
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,984
Joey, it was my idea for Ben
to take the painting to the roof...

468
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,611
-...because l needed to work here.
-I gotta go.

469
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,458
-You okay there?
-Yeah, we're good.

470
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,221
Vlad.

471
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,768
What were you doing up there?

472
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,645
I was helping Uncle Ben
with his painting.

473
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,274
Aren't you supposed
to be studying biology?

474
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,444
It's gonna be about this book
on seasons and migrations...

475
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,030
...and I know the book pretty well.

476
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,741
If you flunk that test
and your mother calls...

477
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,119
...I'm going to tell her
that you're studying or playing?

478
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,957
I don't flunk.
Uncle Ben, where should I leave this?

479
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,835
Put it on the table.
I'll take care of it.

480
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,338
When you're here,
you're my responsibility...

481
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,342
...so if you're supposed to be studying,
then you should be doing that...

482
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,512
...and not posing on the roof.

483
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,265
-Where is Joey?
-He went to the library.

484
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,559
-I'll go meet him there.
-Good idea.

485
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,270
-Do you want to take anything?
-No, it's okay.

486
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,940
-An apple? No?
-Thank you, Mrs. Kate.

487
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,068
I'll see you later, Uncle Ben.

488
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,612
-Goodbye, Vlad.
-Goodbye.

489
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,615
Bye, Vlad.

490
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,162
Joey got very upset.

491
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,707
He called Vlad gay...

492
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,335
...in quite an offensive fashion.

493
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,382
Kids have expanded the meaning of gay
beyond sexual orientation, so...

494
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,301
-...don't get offended.
-I didn't.

495
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,972
I guess it just means "stupid" now.

496
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:48,770
Yes, yes, I think
that you are right about that.

497
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,024
I don't know if Joey felt left out or....

498
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,112
I don't know what in the world
was going through his mind.

499
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,447
Well, you know...

500
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,286
...he's a teenager and...

501
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:10,417
...is it really appropriate
to be using Joey's friend as a model?

502
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,386
Mindy, it's Kate.

503
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,222
Hi, Kate. How are you doing?

504
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,183
I'm okay.

505
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,601
How's Joey?

506
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,228
Oh, he's fine. How are you?

507
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,731
Everything's great.
Amazing, actually.

508
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,610
Yes. l went to see
this chromotherapist up in Kingston.

509
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,236
What?

510
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,697
Chromotherapy.

511
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,782
-You're kidding.
-No.

512
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,910
The guy talks to you
for 1 5 minutes...

513
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,829
...and then floats his hand
over your body to feel...

514
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,457
...energy you're missing: physical...

515
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,958
...emotional, spiritual.

516
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,711
Hard to explain,
but he feels the energy levels...

517
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,131
...and then prescribes colored lights
to restore your balance.

518
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,927
I was just taking a nap
under a greenish light he gave me.

519
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:06,640
You wouldn't believe it,
but I feel like l am a different person.

520
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,309
That's great. Good for you.

521
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,062
I am trying to work
with a house full of people...

522
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,107
-...and, believe me, it hasn't been easy.
-Kate, I said I would take them.

523
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,778
l just wanted to be sure if....

524
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,533
In case they don't find a place.

525
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,702
lt's so sad.

526
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,829
I really feel terrible about it.

527
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,875
The problem is Elliot
is never around, so...

528
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,712
...I wind up having to take care
of all of his problems.

529
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,507
Yes?

530
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,135
Hold on a second, Min. Hi, Ben.

531
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,680
I didn't want to interrupt.

532
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,390
No.

533
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,559
I wanted to talk to you about earlier.

534
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,979
-It's not-- No, it's fine.
-You sure?

535
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,772
Yes.

536
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,857
I'm talking to Mindy.

537
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,320
She wants to know
when you'll visit her in Poughkeepsie.

538
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,284
Well, send her my love.

539
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,869
We can talk tomorrow.

540
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,937
Wait. Where am I flying?

541
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,859
Explain the plot to him, okay?

542
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,945
-You're in a big spherical room.
-Yeah.

543
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,031
There's a big opening at the top.

544
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,158
You're just gonna go:

545
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,035
And see what's up there.

546
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,995
-All right.
-Are you into that?

547
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,580
-Plus 1 8?
-Yeah.

548
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,165
You can't have plus 1 8.

549
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,334
-No fucking way.
-Why you cheating?

550
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,712
No, I'm sorry.
It's down here. lt's down here.

551
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,551
If there's a fiery pit,
that's the first thing we'll look at.

552
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,013
Where you are perpendicular,
there are two doors.

553
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,431
Are there exits?

554
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,850
-I will describe it to you.
-Okay.

555
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,896
As your eyes begin to get used to--

556
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,982
What's that word?
Get used to....

557
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,527
-Luminosity.
-No, but, like, when you go outside and....

558
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,782
No, and you get used to--
You acclimate or-- Yeah, yeah.

559
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,202
So you start to acclimate.
Actually, you can start to see.

560
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:37,165
And what you see
is this ginormous tree.

561
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,876
-Underground?
-Yes.

562
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,505
You've never seen an underground tree?
Well, you're about to.

563
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,423
Okay, so this tree comes up...

564
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,844
...and out from behind this tree
is this giant clown.

565
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,057
-Tree clown.
-This is where it gets freakish.

566
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,892
-Yeah.
-No, I like it.

567
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,728
You do not want to go out there.
It's coming down.

568
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,563
I'll be fine.

569
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,193
Is he old enough to enjoy the Louvre?

570
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,904
He's obsessed
with the French Revolution.

571
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:12,033
I know, but you don't have to go
to Paris to learn about the guillotine.

572
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:17,038
There's a group of eight, and they need
two more in order to get the discount.

573
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,624
Is Vlad going?

574
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,460
-Yes.
-Of course.

575
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,421
Of course.

576
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,841
How much is it gonna cost?

577
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,135
It's 1 800.

578
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,886
Hotel included.

579
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,638
Oh, damn.

580
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,017
-Speak of the devil.
-Who is that?

581
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,645
Well, it's 1 0:00. It must be Vlad.

582
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,691
-Who is it?
-George.

583
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,019
I'm sorry.

584
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,817
-Sorry.
-Don't be silly.

585
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,111
Now stop this.

586
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,433
Why can't he sleep on the couch?

587
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,019
Because, Joey....

588
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,022
Please, son.

589
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,238
I talked to the principal there
at PS-21 6.

590
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,490
Very nice, smart guy.

591
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,536
I think he really wants
to bring back the music program.

592
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,748
-Do they have the budget for it?
-Well, not right now.

593
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,626
But he seems capable
of raising the money.

594
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,170
He's got a very nice,
attractive personality.

595
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,382
That doesn't really help us
that much right now, does it?

596
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,884
Well, let me finish.
You never let me finish.

597
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,220
No job for you.
Isn't that the end of it?

598
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,515
No, it's--
You're such a pessimist.

599
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,851
I'm just being realistic.

600
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,686
Can l finish?

601
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,397
-Okay, go ahead.
-Thank you.

602
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,692
Anyway, they got lots
of different kids there.

603
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,779
White kids, black kids, Latinos.
A few Asian kids.

604
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,283
There was this really cute little girl.

605
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,535
I think she's from the Philippines.

606
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,371
She played "Frere Jacques" for me
on her flute.

607
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,417
George, why don't you come down here
where I can hear you better?

608
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,085
It's a bunk bed.

609
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,587
So?

610
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,174
You told me Joey's losing
his patience with you.

611
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,719
Can you imagine if you broke his bed
trying to shag your husband?

612
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,557
I have missed having your body
next to mine...

613
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,811
...too much to have it denied to me
for reasons of bad engineering.

614
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,992
Well, don't blame me
if this whole thing falls apart.

615
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,089
Come in here.

616
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,660
Ben...

617
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,958
...do you ever blame me for all of this?

618
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,627
Why would I?

619
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,630
We did this together.

620
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,303
But l knew what might happen.

621
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,225
I knew more than you
what we were risking.

622
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:37,442
All l know is that after 39 years,
it's hard to fall asleep without you.

623
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,112
This situation we've got ourselves in...

624
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,532
...is really fucking
with my sleeping patterns.

625
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,216
What happened?

626
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,804
I mean, what was that? That's not
what we talked about last week.

627
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,139
Interpretation.

628
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,852
Yes, well, I usually insist that you let
the music take you somewhere.

629
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,188
Let it surprise you.

630
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,524
Even, on occasion, let it overwhelm you.

631
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,985
It's important as knowing the difference
between a half step...

632
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,072
...and a semi-tone, but always,
always you must focus...

633
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,574
...on the instrument you're playing.

634
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,619
And listen. Always listen.

635
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,996
Listen to what
the metronome's telling you.

636
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,751
Tick tock, tick tock.

637
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,171
Follow the rhythm. Follow the rhythm.

638
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,925
You can't just create
your own rhythm to Chopin.

639
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,137
All right, do it again.

640
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,887
Dear parents:

641
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,059
By now you've all heard
of my joyful news and of my sad news.

642
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,062
To be able to finally marry
Benjamin Hull...

643
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:05,483
...my partner of almost 40 years,
in a small ceremony here in New York...

644
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,444
...was one of the happiest moments
of my life.

645
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,282
Unfortunately, later l found out
that l could no longer continue...

646
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,660
...to teach music at St. Grace's.

647
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,458
Everyone at the school knew
that I was gay...

648
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,670
...and that Ben was my lifelong partner.

649
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,965
l've always had nothing but support
from all of you...

650
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,884
...so I would like to thank you
and to emphasize...

651
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:36,138
...that what happened is not the fault
of St. Grace's and its leadership.

652
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:43,562
Above all, I urge you to have
a conversation with your children...

653
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,857
...about whether or not
justice was served here.

654
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,236
The last thing l want them
to take from this...

655
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,406
...is they should hide who they are
or what they think...

656
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,200
...if they believe
it will get them into trouble.

657
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,005
Life has its obstacles,
but I learned early on...

658
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,800
...that they will always be lessened
if faced with honesty.

659
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:17,555
l believe the world is a better place
if people aren't lying.

660
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,683
ln the words of the apostle Paul
to the Corinthians:

661
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,644
"Love does not delight in injustice...

662
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,188
...but rejoices with the truth."

663
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,067
Yours sincerely, George Garea.

664
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:40,161
Very good.

665
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,798
I don't have time to read it.
I want to.

666
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,717
But you don't.

667
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:03,559
Hey! Can I have some private time,
please?

668
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,698
It didn't make a big difference.

669
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,328
I'm sorry. I don't want to intrude.

670
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:28,000
No. Why don't you grab a glass
and join us for some wine.

671
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,127
Thanks.

672
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,341
-How was your day?
-Nice.

673
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,054
Yeah, George went to church...

674
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,848
...and I went to see a wonderful movie.

675
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,433
What did you see?

676
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,602
The Gang's All Here.

677
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,064
-You did not. How could I forget?
-You remember that?

678
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,865
-What is that?
-A Busby Berkeley musical.

679
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,827
They have this wonderful new print...

680
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:06,539
...and I have to say, Elliot,
I was so happy...

681
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:10,876
...when they came out with VHS
and we could see old movies again.

682
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,712
And I'm glad I showed them all to you.

683
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,172
But--

684
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,926
But this, seeing it up on the big screen,
it's something else.

685
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,053
It's not even the same movie.

686
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,764
-I'd love to see that.
-Let's go tomorrow?

687
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,891
Yes.

688
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,103
No. Shit. I can't tomorrow.

689
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,730
I'll go on my own.

690
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,948
Joey asleep?

691
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,785
I think he and Vlad are still studying.

692
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,662
Vlad?

693
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,622
What's Vlad doing here?

694
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,457
Not studying.

695
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,503
Well, I think I'll take a look.

696
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,380
Don't go.

697
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,300
Why not?

698
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:04,638
Last year, you two were complaining
that Joey didn't have any friends.

699
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,684
You were so worried
that he was too antisocial...

700
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,395
...you even sent him to see a therapist.

701
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,607
-So?
-So now he has a friend.

702
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,735
Well, it's a little strange.

703
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,820
There's nothing strange.

704
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:25,117
It's his only friend,
and the guy's a lot older than him.

705
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,994
He's 1 6.

706
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,079
He just looks older.

707
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,833
They're like Yogi Bear and Boo Boo.

708
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,721
Good night, Mr. Hull.

709
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,660
Joey?

710
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,372
Yeah?

711
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,082
You awake?

712
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,507
Could I ask you a question?

713
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,055
Yeah.

714
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,224
Have you ever been in love?

715
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,312
I'm not gay.

716
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,897
No.

717
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,650
I didn't mean to imply that, Joey.

718
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,240
-So, what do you mean?
-Love. You know what love is.

719
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,582
Well, there was this girl once.

720
00:54:56,418 --> 00:55:00,129
We were on vacation in Saint Croix.
It's in the Virgin lslands.

721
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,881
Yeah, I remember
when you guys went there.

722
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,220
There was another family who....

723
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,266
They were renting a house
on the same beach as us.

724
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,976
And they had a daughter.

725
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:18,856
And every morning,
I would watch her go windsurfing.

726
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,025
Did you go windsurfing too?

727
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,528
No. We had Jet Skis.

728
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,991
But l'd watch her from the beach.

729
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,495
So one day I saw her watching me too.

730
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,457
-On the Jet Skis.
-Yeah.

731
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,251
Yeah, I saw her looking at me.

732
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,253
Do you know her name?

733
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,172
No.

734
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,299
We never even said hello.

735
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,805
I think I might see her again though...

736
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,516
...because her family,
they live in the city too.

737
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,811
If you do, will you say hello?

738
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,527
I don't know.

739
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,162
I think you should.

740
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,507
The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint.

741
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:17,052
The ball of the arm fits
into the socket at the shoulder blade...

742
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,513
...and it's kept there by the rotator cuff.

743
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,016
He had what we call a full thickness tear
or a complete tear.

744
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,018
-Can he paint?
-No.

745
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,896
I don't even want him
to comb his hair for a while.

746
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,815
Poor Ben.

747
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,569
-His legs are okay?
-Yeah, legs are fine.

748
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:37,364
It was so hard to get him to stand up.
I thought his leg was broken.

749
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,991
He was in a lot of pain.

750
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,035
When was the last time
he had a full cardiac checkup?

751
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,121
We have regular checkups every year.

752
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,540
You need to have him see a cardiologist.

753
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,127
-I thought he'd just fallen down the stairs.
-No, he fainted.

754
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,213
Anyway, I don't want to speculate here.

755
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,799
I am an orthopedist.
I'm not a cardiologist.

756
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,969
All right?

757
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,432
Here.

758
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,935
You should take these now.

759
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,313
Oh, thank you.

760
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,821
I have to leave...

761
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,326
...but there's a plate of pasta for you
in the microwave.

762
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,078
Thank you, Kate.

763
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,791
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

764
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,919
-I'll be fine.
-Okay, then.

765
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,853
l don't want you to worry too much.

766
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:54,232
It's not a very big deal. We deal
with similar problems every day here.

767
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,985
But it is serious.

768
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,655
No, I'm just shocked.

769
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:03,283
Joey's such a serious kid,
and he's such a good student.

770
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,202
And so is Vlad.

771
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,205
Have you noticed
any new books in the house?

772
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,040
I haven't been paying attention.

773
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,584
I'm trying to finish my own new book...

774
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,087
...and Elliot's Uncle Ben
is staying with us.

775
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,507
He's sleeping in Joey's room,
so it's a bit of a--

776
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,676
Yeah, complicated situation.

777
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:25,305
Vlad has confessed that he took
the books out and gave them to Joey...

778
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,349
...but your son denies having them.

779
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,394
Vlad seems to have a great influence
over my son.

780
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,355
I don't understand
why they would steal these books.

781
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,524
They're all French literature books.

782
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,318
I have no idea.

783
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,405
-George.
-Are you all right?

784
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,824
No, no, no, I'm fine.

785
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,743
But after the operation...

786
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:49,871
...I think it's better
if I go stay with Mindy.

787
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,667
-But then when will l see you?
-You'll come on the weekends.

788
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,597
Ben, are you there?

789
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,435
You're not a boy anymore, son.
You're a young man.

790
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:15,605
Do you know how lucky you are
this happened to you in high school?

791
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:20,068
-Because in the real world, you're in jail.
-I didn't steal anything.

792
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:26,491
-Hello?
-Ben, would you like some more water?

793
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,745
-Yes, please.
-No, let's leave it the way it is.

794
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,913
I don't want to change anything now.

795
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,291
Can we do this later, please?

796
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,920
Yeah, I can't talk right now.
I'll call you back in half an hour.

797
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,925
Thank you. Thank you.

798
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,056
Where were we?

799
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,892
Jail.

800
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,813
All right, look. There has
to be consequences with this here, so...

801
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:02,194
...you know that trip to Paris
you wanted to go on so bad this fall?

802
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,822
-You can forget about that.
-No, I didn't steal anything!

803
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,742
The principal's lying
and you didn't steal the books.

804
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,746
If that's true, you can let this be
for other times I didn't catch you.

805
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,040
-Elliot.
-What?

806
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,043
-Something else you want to tell me?
-What do you mean?

807
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,420
If there's something else
going on, Joey...

808
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,508
...I would rather hear it from you now
than later from someone else.

809
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,928
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-When kids steal...

810
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,263
...there's often drugs involved.

811
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,390
No.

812
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,811
-Is Vlad involved with drugs?
-Dad, no.

813
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,814
-Can l help you, Ben?
-No, I'm fine.

814
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,359
It's just a bit challenging
maneuvering the silverware...

815
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,528
...but l'm fine.

816
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,239
You don't sound very sure, Joey. ls he?

817
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:50,367
-Not that I know of.
-Not that you know of?

818
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,203
You spend every minute together.
And you know what?

819
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,997
The only way my mind
can understand how a boy...

820
01:03:56,165 --> 01:04:00,335
...like Vlad is stealing books
in the French language is if he was high.

821
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,255
Okay, I'm done.
Can l get up, please?

822
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:08,426
-Answer me, son.
-I don't know! I'm not Vlad!

823
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,429
Can l go to my room, please?
I still have work to do.

824
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,223
Actually, we're still eating.

825
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,891
It's okay. l'm almost done.

826
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,227
-I'm sorry.
-Yes.

827
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,777
Unbelievable.

828
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,991
You're too nice to him.

829
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,330
You don't even know.

830
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,676
I know where the books are.

831
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,558
I said, I know where the books are.

832
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,397
I've been in the house by myself.

833
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,566
I was looking
for something to read...

834
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,986
...and I found these old books
under my bed.

835
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,740
-Ben, why didn't you say something?
-They were just books.

836
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,450
Are those the books?

837
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,828
The one I picked out
was Cyrano de Bergerac.

838
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:21,374
My French is a little rusty,
but I got most of it.

839
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,711
-I know the play--
-Frankly, who cares, Ben?

840
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,714
-Those are the books.
-You listened the whole time.

841
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,634
-You should've said something.
-Kate, he didn't know.

842
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,432
-You think I'm too nice to Joey?
-Please.

843
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,186
Let me tell you, Elliot.
You are too nice to your uncle.

844
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,980
It's very easy being nice...

845
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:48,860
...when you are not the one
who's around all day.

846
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:58,203
Your uncle told us that the books
are in here. So where are they?

847
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:01,206
Joey, I wanna know
where those books are right now.

848
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,458
Why did you do this?

849
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,211
We're the only ones
in that whole stupid school...

850
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,589
-...that'll learn French!
-It's arrogant!

851
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,033
You're the one who was working.
I didn't want to get into it.

852
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,327
You're the one
who's gotten into it.

853
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,665
Bullshit.

854
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,122
-Do you want a beer?
-No. No, thank you.

855
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,501
I got one for my friend,
and now I can't find him.

856
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,712
I think he left.

857
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,839
We had an argument.

858
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,301
-I'm Ian, by the way.
-George.

859
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,386
I'm a friend of Roberto's.

860
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,973
-Who's Roberto?
-Well, this is his party, l think.

861
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,475
Oh, right.

862
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,811
I don't know anybody here.

863
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:50,398
Well, that's Roberto over there.
He's the one dancing.

864
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,859
And the tall, cute one
serving the drinks...

865
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,779
...that's Ted, his boyfriend.

866
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:59,074
They're both cops.
Can you believe that?

867
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,410
-Really? Gay cops.
-Yeah, we call them the policewomen.

868
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,123
No, it's terrible, really.
But actually, they're very, very nice guys.

869
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,584
So where are you from?

870
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,128
Corsham originally. Sussex.

871
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,297
I'm a South London boy.

872
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,591
I came here when I was very young.

873
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:21,679
On my way to dinner, my friend said,
"Let's stop by this party first."

874
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,973
And I said, "Sure,"
and now he's gone...

875
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:27,102
...and, well, here l am.

876
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,187
You must be hungry.

877
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,857
You were going out to dinner,
then you came here and now he's gone.

878
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,443
-You must be hungry.
-I'm starving. You?

879
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,696
Should we go eat?

880
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,949
-Right now?
-Yeah.

881
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,451
I don't have to stay here. Do you?

882
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,495
Well, I....

883
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,582
I'm sorry. You don't even know me.

884
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,127
It's just that I hate to eat alone.
Don't you?

885
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,714
Well, no. On the contrary,
I'm never bored with my own company.

886
01:08:56,882 --> 01:09:00,343
It's other people
who drive me crazy sometimes.

887
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,887
Oh, no, no, don't get me wrong.
I love people.

888
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,265
It's just I'm not very good with crowds.

889
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:09,102
I'd rather meet people one on one
than stand around...

890
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,980
...with a glass of wine
and a silly grin on my face.

891
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,898
I know what you mean.

892
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,486
Are you waiting
for someone in particular?

893
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:22,490
Well, it's not that kind
of romantic situation.

894
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,034
So, what are you waiting for?

895
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,539
I'm waiting for the orchestra
to stop playing...

896
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,666
...and for the curtain to fall.

897
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,045
-Are you high?
-No.

898
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:40,550
No, actually, before I started talking
to you, I was about to fall asleep.

899
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,219
This is not the best place to sleep.

900
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,805
And yet you're sitting on my bed.

901
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,726
You're homeless?

902
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,770
Yes.

903
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,692
It's a long story.

904
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,865
It starts with me marrying
my partner of 39 years...

905
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,617
...and then...

906
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,621
...getting fired from my job,
and now...

907
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:14,375
...looking for an apartment
that we can afford.

908
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,004
I won't bore you with all the details.

909
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,299
Well, I happen to have in my pocket...

910
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,844
...the key to a rent-controlled apartment
in the West Village...

911
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,138
...soon to be vacated.

912
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,227
It's a long story.

913
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,189
Shall we go eat?

914
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,151
My uncle moved in here in the '70s.

915
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,739
So after he went back to England,
I got the lease from him.

916
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,994
That was about eight years ago.

917
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,538
I've been very happy here.
I love this place.

918
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:55,541
-So why are you moving?
-Because of work.

919
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:56,960
I got offered a job...

920
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,462
...at the Anthropology Museum
in Mexico City.

921
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,507
-Oh, that's an amazing place. Yeah.
-You've been there?

922
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:07,303
So you know it doesn't get much better
than that for an archeologist.

923
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,056
Would you like something to drink?

924
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:12,600
Some water. Thank you.

925
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,064
Is that the guy?

926
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,109
Yeah. John.

927
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,737
We've been going out for about a year.

928
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:27,699
I told him about Mexico tonight
and he wasn't happy.

929
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,701
You're a heartbreaker.

930
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,036
On the contrary.

931
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,955
When I first met him...

932
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,667
...I was so in love,
I didn't want to leave his side.

933
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,795
So I think I scared him off a little.

934
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,172
He never wanted to commit, really.

935
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,550
Kept pushing me away.

936
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:49,012
It's no coincidence that I interviewed
for this job in Mexico.

937
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:54,851
Now he finds out that l'm leaving and
decides that I'm the man of his dreams.

938
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:00,148
It's so typical
and so disappointing, frankly.

939
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:05,820
-Do you know how much I pay here?
-No idea.

940
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,780
I'm even embarrassed to say.

941
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:09,782
Fourteen hundred.

942
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:14,329
They can't raise the rent too much.
It's controlled by the city.

943
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,874
Bless this city.

944
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,153
-What did you think of the Wieniawski?
-Not bad.

945
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,697
-I thought she milked it a bit.
-You think so?

946
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,617
Well, when the piece is that romantic,
there's no need to embellish.

947
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,163
I don't know. I loved it.

948
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,999
I kept thinking about him
and his beloved lsabella.

949
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,625
But that's not true.

950
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:28,671
That whole, "He composed it to convince
her parents to let him marry her."

951
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,674
-It's a myth.
-I'm not like you.

952
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,635
I prefer a little embellishment.

953
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,518
-Finally.
-I'm sorry. Sorry.

954
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:45,146
You guys look very thirsty.
What can l get you?

955
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,731
Scotch on the rocks for me.

956
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:51,027
Vodka and tonic, half a lime, no ice,
for the gentleman here.

957
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,029
Busy tonight?

958
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,822
It's Friday night.

959
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,409
-The kids have taken our spot.
-Good for them.

960
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,954
-You guys new in the neighborhood?
-Are you kidding?

961
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,874
There was a famous "sip in"
right here in this bar...

962
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,543
...to challenge
the New York State regulation...

963
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:11,297
...that prohibited bars
from serving homosexuals.

964
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,799
We have a clipping
from The New York Times.

965
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,593
1 966.

966
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,639
Me and four other guys, we came in here
accompanied by five reporters.

967
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:23,059
When denied service,
we denounced the state liquor authority.

968
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,144
Oh, my God. You're that guy?

969
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,897
Yeah, I was one of the guys.

970
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,483
Well, this round's on me, fellas.

971
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,405
-You are such a liar.
-What?

972
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:40,326
-Anything for a free drink.
-Well, I knew the real guy.

973
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,954
-Who, Frank?
-Yeah. That was his claim to fame.

974
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:46,332
-I thought it was something different.
-Well, that too.

975
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,173
Yeah, God bless him.

976
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:58,469
-Here's to Frank's memory.
-Frank.

977
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,472
-And to lvan.
-Who's Ivan?

978
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,183
The angel from Sussex
who got our apartment.

979
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,643
-Ian.
-Yeah.

980
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,230
Ivan, Ian. lt doesn't matter.
I drink to him.

981
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,608
A handsome stranger.

982
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:17,071
Do l detect a note ofjealousy
in your voice?

983
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:21,450
I have wondered what you've been doing
with your free nights without me.

984
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:23,786
That's not for me, Ben.

985
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:25,913
You know that.

986
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,291
For all these years?

987
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,959
For all these years.

988
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,919
Amazing.

989
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,717
I'm sorry I can't say
the same to you, George.

990
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,596
But at least
I've always been honest with you.

991
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,434
Sometimes I think ignorance
might be a little better.

992
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,729
I'm sorry, George.

993
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,565
Mind you, come to think of it...

994
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:55,860
...there are things that you couldn't
have hidden anyway.

995
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,321
-Like what?
-Like when you got crabs.

996
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,739
Thanks for reminding me.

997
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:02,283
Or that guy in Rio
who gave you the black eye.

998
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,910
That crazy motherfucker
was trying to rob me!

999
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,374
To all the crazy motherfuckers.

1000
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,501
All the crazy motherfuckers.

1001
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,065
-George.
-What?

1002
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:41,572
Remember we used to go
to Castelli and Mary Boone...

1003
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,367
...and you would say...

1004
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:48,454
...one day we'll go there
to see my one-man show?

1005
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:50,122
And we will.

1006
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,874
No, we won't, George.

1007
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,751
How do you know?

1008
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:58,464
Nowadays there's a new hot painter
discovered every week.

1009
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,927
Okay, maybe it'll happen,
but not in my lifetime.

1010
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:06,931
How do you know?
It's all a matter of trends and tastes.

1011
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,184
A curator will come along,
look at one of your paintings...

1012
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,645
...and think this is the greatest thing.

1013
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:17,024
But if it doesn't happen,
I just would like to know...

1014
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:22,196
-...is that disappointing to you?
-Not at all.

1015
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:26,492
And I say it because
I think it's a real possibility.

1016
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,746
I love your paintings, and frankly,
I don't care what anybody else thinks.

1017
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,836
I guess l did make
a couple of good ones, didn't l?

1018
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,852
-Oh, that hurts.
-Are you all right?

1019
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:56,063
-Careful of my arm.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1020
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,191
I had a wonderful time.

1021
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,693
Me too.

1022
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:14,039
-Good night.
-Good night, Georgie.

1023
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,491
George.

1024
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,409
-Joey.
-Hi.

1025
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,287
-I didn't see you there.
-I was just waiting.

1026
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,833
-Do you wanna come up?
-Yeah, sure.

1027
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,469
-Here.
-Thank you.

1028
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,227
-This place is so nice.
-Yes, thanks.

1029
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,604
I got lucky.

1030
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,370
Uncle George, l'm....

1031
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:21,041
I'm sorry that I didn't go
to the service.

1032
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,710
The service?

1033
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,421
Uncle Ben's service.

1034
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:30,050
You know, funerals can be strange.

1035
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:33,429
Especially for people your age.

1036
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:41,061
I wanted to remember Uncle Ben
how l remember him now.

1037
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,772
And I'd never been
to a funeral before...

1038
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,233
...and I was afraid
that if I went to his...

1039
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:50,321
...that's how l would remember him
whenever I thought about him.

1040
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,408
That makes a lot of sense to me, Joey.

1041
01:21:56,786 --> 01:22:01,123
But l hope you didn't come all this way
just because you felt guilty about it.

1042
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,918
Oh, no, actually, no. l...

1043
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:09,006
...actually came to give you something.

1044
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,614
That's nice.

1045
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,494
That's very nice.

1046
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,748
I picked it up
from the top of the stairs...

1047
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:46,293
...the day that Uncle Ben
had his accident.

1048
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,545
Everything came down...

1049
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:52,341
...including Uncle Ben, as you know.

1050
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,595
But the painting was okay.

1051
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,139
Yeah.

1052
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,475
You know, I think he....

1053
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:07,940
I think he saved it mid-fall somehow.

1054
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,319
His paintings meant everything to him.

1055
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:27,001
Is this--? Is this the view from your roof?

1056
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,253
Yeah, that's west.

1057
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,841
-Is this you in it? I didn't think so.
-No.

1058
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,843
That's my friend Vlad.

1059
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,555
He used to come over a lot
when Uncle Ben was living with us.

1060
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,308
Are you sure you don't want this?
It'd be a great memento.

1061
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:45,936
Oh, no. No, you keep it.

1062
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,439
It's his last painting.

1063
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,315
And it's unfinished.

1064
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:52,735
If you look over here...

1065
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:56,447
...you can always imagine
what he would have done with the colors.

1066
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,325
It's very nice.

1067
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:06,123
I'm.... I'm gonna find a hammer...

1068
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,209
...and you can help me
hang it up on the wall.

1069
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,045
Yeah, sure.

1070
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,147
You can go.
