1
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:26,519
-Where've you been keeping yourself?
-Here and there. Here and there.

2
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:32,365
So it's not because our service
is bad, huh?

3
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:34,481
What a day!

4
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,281
You ever see such a glorious day?

5
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,046
Come on, say hello to Helen.

6
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:54,448
You old son of a gun. It's wonderful
to see you again. You look great.

7
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,486
Well, so do you.

8
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:01,484
-Well, a little green around the edges.
-I drank too much last night.

9
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,049
I don't believe it. Neddy!

10
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,164
I don't believe it. Neddy!

11
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:15,527
How beautiful are thy feet in sandals,
O princess daughter.

12
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,802
I bet you drank too much last night.

13
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:31,407
-Isn't he a sight f or sore eyes?
-Oh, Neddy, we missed you.

14
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,679
Sit down and tell us everything.

15
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,409
-Where are you coming f rom?
-I was around.

16
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,165
I thought I'd come over and have a
swim with you. Look at that water.

17
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,244
-And look at that sky.
-You look at it.

18
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,843
I think everybody drank too much
last night.

19
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,842
It was that rum,
I drank too much of that.

20
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,647
-Whose party?
-Our own.

21
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:55,324
-You didn't miss a thing.
-Usual Saturday night blowout.

22
00:04:55,489 --> 00:05:00,483
Same jokes, same f aces, we've known
each other so long there's no flirting.

23
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,523
-I'd have flirted with you.
-You're practically a new f ace.

24
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:08,523
-How are things? Have a good summer?
-Sure, just great.

25
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,600
Come on, how about a swim?

26
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,760
Good f or your hangover.

27
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,284
What makes you think I'm hung-over?

28
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,957
-Come on, I'll race you.
-Please, no.

29
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,006
-How about you?
-You kidding?

30
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,007
Relax, Neddy. Have a drink. Come on.

31
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,967
-Sit and tell us what you've learned.
-Ned!

32
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,609
Stu Forsburgh!

33
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,405
Stu Forsburgh!

34
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,165
-Ned Merrill! How are you, sport?
-Okay, never better.

35
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:37,157
-God, I'm glad to see you.
-What are you doing here?

36
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:39,968
We stopped over.
We've been in the Cape.

37
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:42,120
-How's Lucinda?
-She's great.

38
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,688
And the girls?

39
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,762
All grown up. And beautiful, Stu.
Just beautiful.

40
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:51,444
I don't know how you do it!
You haven't changed a bit.

41
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,847
Where did you get this?
Why do you got all these clothes on?

42
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:58,284
We have to go catch a plane.

43
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,567
-You're gonna catch a plane?
-Gotta get back to the shop.

44
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,444
You know how long it's been since
we had a swim together?

45
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:11,681
-Please don't remind me.
-What'll you have, Stu?

46
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:16,559
We're all old bunkmates. We went to
the same camp when we were kids.

47
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,608
Gee, I don't know.
I drank too much last night.

48
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,203
-A diluted martini?
-I'm out of practice...

49
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,559
...with your kind of parties.

50
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,721
We don't do that in Columbus,
unless it's New Year's Eve.

51
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,848
-I told you not to accept the transfer.
-What else could I do?

52
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:36,439
I'd have quit bef ore I let them
send me to the provinces.

53
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,440
Well, it's healthy.

54
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,847
Stu, did you pack...?

55
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:44,041
Don't tell me that's Ned Merrill
down there.

56
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,003
-Hi, honeybunch, come join the party.
-Half a minute.

57
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:52,600
Stu, I didn't realize how much
I missed that ugly old mug of yours.

58
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,205
Get out of those clothes
and we'll have one quick swim.

59
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:01,841
-I'm not up to it. I'm feeling my age.
-You're a year younger than I am.

60
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,719
Yeah, you were always
pulling seniority on me at camp.

61
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:10,319
Remember how we'd take off
our suits and swim f or miles?

62
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,639
-We just never got tired.
-Yeah.

63
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:15,607
We had nice,
new, pink lungs in those days.

64
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,763
And the water up there, remember?
That transparent light-green water.

65
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:26,162
It felt different. A beautiful feeling.
We could've swum around the world.

66
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:29,725
That was bef ore we ever touched
a drink or a cigarette.

67
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,527
-Or a girl!
-Or a girl.

68
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,765
That doesn't sap a man's strength.

69
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,966
-Or I'd be in a wheelchair today.
-Ned Merrill!

70
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,439
-Peggy.
-Ned Merrill, still bragging.

71
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:44,158
I've heard those old schoolboy stories.
You all made them up.

72
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:48,117
So you figured that one out,
have you? Let me look at you.

73
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,083
Let's settle this nonsense
about taking a plane.

74
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,879
-Settle it with him. I like it here.
-Lucinda'll be disappointed as hell.

75
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,358
I don't think that's exactly true.

76
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,322
I could run you to our house.
To say hello.

77
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:04,799
-Don, how about using your car?
-Well, sure, but...

78
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,759
They haven't time. We promised to
stop at the Grahams' f or a quick drink.

79
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,238
-Will you come?
-Of course he will.

80
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,883
-You haven't seen their pool, have you?
-Whose?

81
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:17,722
-The Grahams.
-The Grahams put in a pool?

82
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,642
Oh, yeah. They nurse it like a baby.

83
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,598
-When did they put in a pool?
-June.

84
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,168
-June?
-Did you get the suits off the line?

85
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:29,887
I f orgot about them.

86
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,768
If they're damp, I have
some plastic bags.

87
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,885
Do the Biswangers have a pool?

88
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,128
-Biswangers?
-Those awful people on Red Coat Road.

89
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,805
Always talking about their Caribbean
cruises and electric toothbrushes.

90
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,920
Sure, they have a big pool.

91
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,401
-Go on, honey, finish packing.
-I will, in a minute.

92
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:55,723
-Listen, if we miss that plane...
-Don't worry, I'll get you to the airport.

93
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,648
My God, I f orgot all about them.

94
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,687
Go on, honey, finish packing.

95
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,281
-lf we miss that plane...
-I will, in a minute.

96
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:12,799
I could do it. I could really do it!

97
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,362
Do what, Neddy?

98
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,488
Now with the Grahams'...

99
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,244
...there's a string of pools that curves
clear across the county to our house.

100
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:25,802
Well, look, the Grahams', the Lears',
the Bunkers'. Then over the ridge.

101
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:31,720
A portage through the riding ring,
to the Hallorans' and the Gilmartins'.

102
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,765
Then down the lane
to the Biswangers' and then...

103
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:42,609
Wait, who's next? I can't think.
I had it a minute ago. Who is it?

104
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,089
Who is it?
Who's next to the Biswangers'?

105
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:51,123
-Shirley Abbott.
-Shirley Abbott.

106
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:58,004
Across Route 424 to the recreation
centre pool, up the hill and I'm home.

107
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:10,247
Don't you see? I just figured it out.
If I take a dogleg to the southwest...

108
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,924
...I can swim home.

109
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,762
Come on, Ned.

110
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:20,918
-Why would you want to swim home?
-I don't get it.

111
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,605
Pool by pool, they f orm a river
all the way to our house.

112
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:32,044
I suppose you could put it that way.
Now, Neddy, why don't you sit down...

113
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,407
...and have a drink
and then we'll all go to the Grahams'?

114
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,005
I'll call it the Lucinda River,
after my wife.

115
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,080
That's quite a tribute.

116
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:46,401
This is the day Ned Merrill
swims across the county.

117
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:55,242
Always threw himself in the water
like that. God, what energy!

118
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,161
He keeps himself in shape.

119
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,685
Come on. He always ate like a horse,
never put on an ounce.

120
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:07,562
-Look at that. Wouldn't use the ladder.
-Hey, Ned! Where are you going?

121
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,799
Where'd he get that nutty idea?

122
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,284
-He's just joking.
-You sure?

123
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,998
Sure. We'll find him waiting f or us
at the Grahams'.

124
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,205
God, I hate Columbus.

125
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:22,408
Swim to his house.
Why would he wanna do that?

126
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,560
Neddy, Neddy! It's been so long.

127
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:31,799
-You look wonderful.
-So do you.

128
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:34,608
I'm going on a diet
a week f rom Thursday.

129
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,999
-Where were you?
-Don and Helen's.

130
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:41,401
Where are they all?
They're all coming over, aren't they?

131
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:45,198
-Why didn't they come with you?
-They're driving down.

132
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,525
-What do you think?
-Terrific. Absolutely terrific.

133
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:55,922
It cost a bundle,
but Howie's had a marvellous year.

134
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,999
-Look how clear the water is.
-Wow!

135
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,127
We got the best filter money can buy.

136
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:08,602
It filters 99.99.99 percent
of all solid matter out of the water.

137
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,523
-Really?
-We put a 6-inch lint filter in too.

138
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:17,120
The way we take care of this pool,
the water's purer than drinking water.

139
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:20,766
-What'll you have?
-Scoop me a glass of that.

140
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:24,325
-Don't be silly. Want a martini?
-No, nothing, thanks.

141
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:28,562
-I'll swim and be on my way.
-You will not. You just got here.

142
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,488
I can't stay.
I want to try out your pool.

143
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:36,843
-That's unf riendly. What's the rush?
-Okay, but make it a little one.

144
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,961
Next summer
we're gonna build a pool house.

145
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:46,602
With dressing rooms and showers
and a little playroom and a big bar.

146
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,045
Make a swell layout. Cheers.

147
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,842
You never thought he'd make it,
did you?

148
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:01,802
Who?

149
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:06,801
When we were kids and
I first started dating Howard...

150
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:10,848
-...you weren't very nice to him.
-I wasn't, why?

151
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:17,158
Remember he kept track of every penny
he saved and spent in a notebook.

152
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,923
You thought that was very amusing.

153
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,886
I was jealous.

154
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,480
Of Howard?

155
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,958
I was crazy about you.

156
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,559
Well, you never said anything.

157
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:40,569
-You were having an aff air with Lucinda.
-Why'd I get smashed at your wedding?

158
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:44,278
Because Lucinda was dancing
with Roger Bunker.

159
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,845
What a long memory you got,
grandma.

160
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,963
No kidding though.
You've got a gorgeous pool.

161
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,166
I've got everything I ever wanted.

162
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,678
Funny how things turn out,
isn't it?

163
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,522
-Hey, Ned!
-Howard.

164
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,645
-How are you, Ned?
-Fine, fine.

165
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,720
Of all people.

166
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,928
-How do you like my new toy?
-Next year we're getting all the optionals.

167
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,047
Like a padded seat, a canopy.

168
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,006
She's idling a bit slow.

169
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,807
Idling?

170
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,769
It's not supposed to be
a racing engine.

171
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,682
-What's he doing?
-He's fixing it.

172
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:28,524
-lt's okay now.
-I'll get you a drink.

173
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,721
-lt's a great pool.
-Yeah.

174
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,005
Ned's just crazy about our pool.

175
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,761
I didn't skimp on it.

176
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,841
-I got a diatomaceous earth filter.
-Betty told me.

177
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,888
Filters out 99.99.99 percent...

178
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,200
-...of all solid matter.
-That's what Betty said.

179
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:49,088
She tell you about
the swing joints I got in there?

180
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:53,800
Spingon's pool split down the middle
three months after the guarantee.

181
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:57,006
-No swing joints.
-Ned doesn't know the Spingons.

182
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,125
Let me tell you about them.

183
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:04,204
-They're the kind of people who skimp.
-Just look at the colour of that sky.

184
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,560
I don't like the look of that cloud.

185
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,640
It's beautiful.

186
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:17,282
Like a dream city f rom the bow
of a ship. Lisbon, Naples, Istanbul.

187
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,644
Hackensack.

188
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,968
I'd like to see all those glistening
white domes and minarets.

189
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:30,044
First chance I get to get away,
I'll go sailing around the Golden Horn.

190
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,683
Why can't we travel more?

191
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,647
What f or? We've got everything
we want right here.

192
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:40,641
-How come you never put a pool in?
-Never got around to it.

193
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,528
That's too bad.
Helps the resale value.

194
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:46,647
I don't have to worry about
the resale value.

195
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:52,042
With a tennis court and the planting,
you'll get a lot more than you paid.

196
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,608
If I ever sell it.

197
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,399
-Right buyer has to come along.
-I want my girls to be married there.

198
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,765
Won't be long now. Our driveway
looked like a parking lot today.

199
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,318
Boys all over the place.

200
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:11,563
Hey, anybody home?

201
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:16,565
That must be Don and Helen with
the Forsburghs. Neddy, don't go away.

202
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,208
-Hi, Betty.
-So long, Ned.

203
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:19,848
Is Ned here?

204
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:36,526
-Mrs. Hammar, how are you?
-May I ask what you're doing here?

205
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,809
On my way home,
I thought I'd cool off.

206
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,041
Who gave you permission
to use the pool?

207
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm Ned Merrill. Beautiful flowers.

208
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,807
I see Eric's put in the rock garden.

209
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:54,925
-You're not welcome here.
-You know me, don't you?

210
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:58,161
-I'm a f riend of your son.
-A f riend.

211
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:02,880
How dare you use that word!
You never came to see him.

212
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:06,007
You never even called him
at the hospital.

213
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:11,723
Well, how is he? Is he better?

214
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,007
Just one minute, Mr. Merrill.

215
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,637
This is my house now.

216
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:31,842
Don't you ever come here again.

217
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,081
Don't you ever set f oot
on my property again!

218
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,642
Hi, Mr. Merrill.

219
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,040
-Hi, Muffie.
-Mommy and Daddy are at the club.

220
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:25,088
-Think they'd mind if I swim?
-Of course not, help yourself.

221
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,566
-lt isn't Julie Ann Hooper?
-Yes, it is.

222
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:44,047
I can't believe it.
You're all grown up.

223
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:48,407
-How come we never see you?
-I guess you don't need me anymore.

224
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,561
We're always looking f or a babysitter.

225
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:54,245
Oh, Mr. Merrill!

226
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:00,529
-How about Sunday night? You busy?
-No.

227
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,919
Hired. You live in the same place?

228
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,807
-Yes, but...
-I'll pick you up at 7.

229
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,483
-You're putting me on.
-No, I'm not.

230
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:12,882
A babysitter! Ellen and Aggie
would have a fit if they heard you.

231
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,959
Mr. Merrill,
this is my brother, Vernon.

232
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:22,563
Your brother? But your brother was...

233
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,527
I sure liked that little red Jaguar
you used to have.

234
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:27,486
-Want a Coke?
-Sure.

235
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:31,887
Thanks. I can't get over you, Julie.
How old are you now?

236
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,200
-Twenty last month.
-You still going to school?

237
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:38,122
-I've got a job.
-I miss Ellen and Aggie.

238
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,201
-Where are they?
-They're home.

239
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,279
-Playing tennis.
-They are? But when did they...?

240
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:47,360
Why didn't they call me?

241
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:50,720
I'd just love to see them.
Let's drive over.

242
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,278
Well, I've got to be on my way.

243
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:56,168
-I'm swimming home.
-You're swimming home?

244
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:59,042
There's a river of pools
all the way to my house.

245
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,804
-That's more hiking than swimming.
-Not hiking. Portaging.

246
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:06,405
-lt's okay, if you like ex ercise.
-What a crazy idea.

247
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:10,084
-I think it's brilliant.
-From here I go to the Bunkers'.

248
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:13,161
I'll portage through the riding ring
to the Hallorans'.

249
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,963
-Got it all mapped out.
-What are you doing it f or?

250
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,127
-Why do you want to?
-I think it's original.

251
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,527
As if he's an explorer
or something.

252
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,242
I mean, I think it's an adventure.

253
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:30,801
Come with me.

254
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:35,082
-Well, gee, l...
-Come on, live a little.

255
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:36,602
I don't know if...

256
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,444
We'll explore the torrential
headwaters of the Lucinda River.

257
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,398
All right, I will.

258
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,563
Ready! Go!

259
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,960
-lt's funny.
-What?

260
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:29,917
-Marigolds. This time of the year.
-They're all over.

261
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:35,209
-Well, they usually bloom later.
-They're lovely. I love the colours.

262
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:39,407
Mr. Merrill?

263
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,367
What did you mean bef ore?
All that about my coming to babysit.

264
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:49,842
Coming over to babysit?
I was just joking. I was teasing you.

265
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,727
Gee, I wondered.

266
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:54,609
You used to be such a shy little kid.

267
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,206
You always brought schoolbooks.
You always dropped pencils and things.

268
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,599
And you never had a word to say.

269
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:04,761
-I thought plenty, though.
-About what?

270
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:08,604
-Oh, daydreamed.
-What about?

271
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:11,602
-Lots of things.
-What sort of things?

272
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:17,048
-lt's so silly, it was such kid stuff.
-Come on, tell me.

273
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:21,324
I bet you never knew
I had a big crush on you.

274
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,002
You did?

275
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:28,124
-I was mad about you, out of my head!
-You were?

276
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:32,647
If Mrs. Merrill called me to babysit,
even at the last minute...

277
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,404
...l'd cancel out whoever I promised
and come to your house instead.

278
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:38,844
You must have lost
a lot of customers.

279
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:44,641
I'd spend an hour getting myself fix ed
up. My mother thought I was nuts.

280
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:48,848
I mean, I was just a kid to you,
but you were a god to me.

281
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:53,400
-Now you're putting me on.
-Know what I'd do as the girls slept?

282
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:57,881
I'd go up to your room and open
your closet and touch your suits.

283
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:03,328
Then I'd go into your bathroom and
smell your shaving lotion. One time...

284
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:06,003
-This is a terrible thing to admit.
-Tell me.

285
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,319
I stole one of your shirts.

286
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:12,880
Then when I was doing my homework
up in my room, I'd put it on.

287
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,961
It made me feel as if
you were all around me.

288
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:18,848
Julie, I didn't know.

289
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,002
And when you'd drive me home
at night, I'd pretend like mad.

290
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:26,559
Pretend what?
What was it you used to pretend?

291
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:31,245
l... After all,
I was just a child in those days.

292
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,967
I want to know.

293
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:39,677
That you were desperately
in love with me.

294
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:43,842
You were too honourable to say so,
because you were married.

295
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:48,406
So I had to go to Paris.
You know, put an ocean between us.

296
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:53,359
And no matter how many divine
Frenchmen begged me, I'd never marry.

297
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:59,843
I'd just live there, all pale
and mysterious, huge tragic artist.

298
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:05,045
And then one night,
I'd be in some club.

299
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:09,487
A f abulous Paris gown.
I'd see you at the door.

300
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:14,643
Tall, distinguished,
a little grey at the temples.

301
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:19,007
I pretended your eyes would burn
into me across this room.

302
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,846
Suddenly, there'd be a hush.
And everyone would look at me.

303
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:30,606
And then I'd just stand up
and float towards you.

304
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:34,962
-And then what?
-That's all.

305
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:43,562
-Julie, I don't know what to say.
-I told you. I was a real spooky kid.

306
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:56,923
The Bunkers must be having a party.

307
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,200
How bonny are the banks
of the Lucinda River.

308
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,247
I knew we'd find f riends
all along the way.

309
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:20,928
Neddy!

310
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:25,245
Enid. This is Julie Ann Hooper,
our babysitter.

311
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,367
I lost her f or a while.
But I f ound her again.

312
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,645
How f ortunate f or you, darling.

313
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:33,881
What a lovely dress.
You look ravishing.

314
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,086
Ned, what a treat to have you here.

315
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:40,161
I see Roger's the life of the party
as usual.

316
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:44,686
He started all by himself at brunch.
I guess it caught up with him.

317
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:48,928
Neddy, tell me everything.
I want to know all about you.

318
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:50,408
Enid.

319
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:54,886
Look who's there!
Get yourself a drink.

320
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:58,320
We'll have one quick one
to appease the natives.

321
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,959
-Neddy!
-Hi, honeybunch.

322
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:05,008
-To think I nearly didn't get here.
-Ned, you old f ossil. How are you?

323
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,602
Great. Just great.

324
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:09,647
-Ned! My God, it's been a dog's age.
-Rusty.

325
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:12,528
-Let's have a game of golf. Soon.
-Darling!

326
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:18,567
-Is it undiplomatic to ask of Lucinda?
-She's great. And bring your money.

327
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:23,122
-Neddy! Neddy, darling.
-I'm John.

328
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:26,599
We want to see you.
Lucinda will call. How you doing?

329
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,407
Great, great.

330
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,323
-My God, Neddy Merrill.
-Freddy Preston.

331
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:37,438
Marvellous to see you. We missed
you. I expected you'd be on Xanadu.

332
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:39,884
-I'll have to call Willie.
-Good show.

333
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,523
-Mr. Merrill.
-Hi, Stanley. How's Inez?

334
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,442
-She'll be glad to see you.
-She's my girl.

335
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:49,761
-Yes, sir. What may I get you?
-Dom Perignon. That's f or us.

336
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,408
Yes, sir.

337
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:55,520
-Ever drink champagne?
-Once at a birthday party.

338
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:02,641
A boy drank it out of my slipper.

339
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:07,768
Here's to sugar on our strawberries.

340
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,368
-Ned, my God.
-Brian. How are you, Brian?

341
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,440
I feel rotten I didn't call.

342
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:32,363
I've been so damn busy.
I don't know where the time goes.

343
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:34,724
-Let's have lunch this week.
-Okay.

344
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:38,598
I wanted to tell you.
That was a stinking thing to do.

345
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,886
-What they pulled at your place.
-What's that?

346
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:46,679
Well, now I don't care how big
a firecracker this new guy was.

347
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,080
Well, brother,
that story really jolted me.

348
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:55,607
I thought, what if a young smart-ass
comes to our shop and does that?

349
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:59,045
Let's hear f rom you, huh?
Ring me at the office.

350
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:03,081
Beautiful Cynthia.

351
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:07,037
-Neddy. Darling!
-Hi, where's Carter?

352
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,882
Well, haven't you heard?
We've separated.

353
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,802
This is Julie Ann Hooper,
our babysitter.

354
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:17,008
-Run along to your babies, dear.
-She's with me.

355
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:22,197
-We're swimming across the county.
-How healthy and young of you.

356
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,962
Now, who else could wear
a dress like this?

357
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:30,407
Why don't you come over
tonight f or dinner?

358
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,122
I'd love to.

359
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,079
If Lucinda hasn't made a date.

360
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:39,037
Lucinda! Well, congratulations.

361
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,442
-Ned.
-Denny boy!

362
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:45,646
Why not leave some phone numbers?
I've tried to reach you.

363
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,441
I've heard of an opening.

364
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,839
Perfect f or you. Your experience.

365
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:53,240
Small place,
but these two guys are creative.

366
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,400
-Say hello to Julie Ann.
-Hello.

367
00:30:55,569 --> 00:31:01,565
They have a reputation f or originality.
Approach them right, take a cut.

368
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,401
Take a cut?

369
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,597
Now, look here, Ned.
You don't have to pretend with me.

370
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,123
Set! Go!

371
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:28,484
Did you hurt yourself?

372
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,766
It's nothing. Bad takeoff.

373
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,238
Let's go and sit down somewhere.

374
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,047
-Does it hurt?
-No, it's all right.

375
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,881
What sort of a job do you have?

376
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:51,405
Secretary. We're the largest office
supply company in New York.

377
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:55,164
-I've never run into you on the train.
-I take the 7:22.

378
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:59,083
-I'm first in, so I make the coffee.
-A f riendly office?

379
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:02,605
Two girls want to get an apartment
after our raises.

380
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,524
-Watch out, it's a big wicked city.
-I know. I've had some experiences.

381
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,281
-Like what?
-Well...

382
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:13,237
...one morning I was making coffee
and looked out the window.

383
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,446
There's an apartment building
across the court.

384
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:22,798
This man was standing in his window,
looking at me. He was stark naked.

385
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:26,797
-That's terrible.
-I just stood there looking at him.

386
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:29,608
You ought to report that
to somebody.

387
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,159
He's never been there again.
I check every morning.

388
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:35,639
There's a lot of nuts around.

389
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:39,888
Another time, my boss sent me
to deliver some record books.

390
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:45,487
I got into an elevator and pressed 26.
Then a man got in and he pressed 27.

391
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:48,402
The door closed and
the elevator started up.

392
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,084
This man came right over
and kissed me on the mouth.

393
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,763
-What'd you do?
-I dropped the books.

394
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:56,203
Then what happened?

395
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,047
He picked them up,
gave them to me.

396
00:35:58,209 --> 00:36:01,758
The door opened
on the 26th floor, and I got out.

397
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:06,362
Can you imagine?
A building on Park A venue?

398
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:14,323
That belly is like a heap of wheat.

399
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:17,322
Fenced about with lilies.

400
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:21,844
That's f rom the Bible, isn't it?

401
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:23,806
Song of Solomon.

402
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:28,918
As a little girl in Sunday school,
they never mentioned that part.

403
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,807
You still are a little girl
in Sunday school.

404
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:39,124
You know, Julie,
I've been thinking.

405
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,920
I could...

406
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:45,401
I could meet you in the morning
and take you to your office.

407
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:49,881
If you had to go out on an errand,
call me and I'd go with you.

408
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,286
I'd pick you up every day
at noon and we'd have lunch.

409
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:57,725
That's what I'll do, Julie.
I'll take care of you.

410
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,199
Well, gee, Mr. Merrill, I...

411
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:05,361
I don't think that would
work out too well.

412
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:08,999
I have a boyf riend.
He's a very jealous type.

413
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,763
If I just look at anybody else,
he has a fit.

414
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,365
He's a very high-strung person.
He has so many problems!

415
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,326
What sort of problems?

416
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:21,846
His mother. He says
she's a very sensuous woman.

417
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,522
He says she has lovers.

418
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,487
He's not even 100-percent sure
he's legitimate.

419
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,482
He's taking it out
on the whole United States.

420
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:33,244
-Where did you meet this boy?
-Through a computer.

421
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:35,684
-A computer?
-Yeah, it's a joke.

422
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:39,842
All the kids are doing it. You fill out
this questionnaire, send in $3...

423
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:43,888
...and they send you the phone
numbers of three ideal mates.

424
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:46,563
He was the first one I called.

425
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:49,599
How'd you meet Mrs. Merrill?

426
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,078
I...

427
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,158
On a boat,
going to Europe one summer.

428
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:00,800
I was with a bunch of students
down in steerage.

429
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:04,803
I sneaked up to the first-class
salon, and there she was.

430
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,437
How romantic and old-f ashioned.

431
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:10,646
Now, wait a minute.
It wasn't that long ago.

432
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:16,679
Well, it sounds so much more
passionate than a computer.

433
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:26,998
That shirt of mine, Julie.
Do you still have it?

434
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:29,080
No.

435
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:31,922
Well, after a while, I...

436
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,321
I decided it was just a shirt.

437
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:43,646
You had so many shirts, I didn't
think you'd miss it or anything.

438
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,482
Do you mind?

439
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,238
No, but I wish...

440
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,999
I wish you'd told me how you felt.

441
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:53,046
I couldn't.

442
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:56,169
I would have died.

443
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,604
There's so little love
in the world.

444
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,488
When it's kept a secret,
it's wasted, see?

445
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:07,325
You're very precious to me.

446
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,927
I won't let you
ever get scared or hurt.

447
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,887
If there's anything you want,
come to me.

448
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:17,839
-I'll be your guardian angel.
-Mr. Merrill, I...

449
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,517
Julie.

450
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:23,721
Julie! Julie!

451
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:56,401
Hi, Steve.

452
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,880
-Well, you're not Steve.
-No.

453
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,721
How are you, Mr. Merrill?

454
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,959
-I'm a f riend of the Hallorans.
-I know.

455
00:40:06,129 --> 00:40:08,324
-Mind if I ride up with you?
-Not at all.

456
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,081
Don't bother.

457
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,206
Thank you.

458
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:27,206
How long you been driving
f or the Hallorans?

459
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:29,929
Going on a couple of years now.

460
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:36,763
-What happened to Steve?
-I'm af raid I don't know.

461
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:43,048
Man, what a character.
Did he mangle the English language!

462
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:46,007
We told him he should be
on television.

463
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:52,797
Big bass voice,
you should've heard that guy sing.

464
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,679
-And a natural sense of rhythm?
-Yeah, that's right.

465
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:06,839
-I'll take them the paper.
-Thank you.

466
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,681
Thank you f or the lift.

467
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,125
And my apologies. I don't know
why I thought you were Steve.

468
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:14,166
That's okay.

469
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:35,249
Hello? Oh, hello, honey.

470
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,639
Tell her to hurry.
They'll miss the sun.

471
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:42,997
She refuses to bring the children
unless we put on our suits.

472
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:46,639
After the way we raised her?
What's the matter with her?

473
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:51,439
After the way we raised you?
What's the matter with you, honey?

474
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:55,239
She says they're her children,
and she'll raise them her way.

475
00:41:55,409 --> 00:42:00,199
-They'll end up repressed.
-Mummy says they'll end up repressed.

476
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,719
She's not going to bring the children.

477
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:13,683
Good heavens! It's Neddy Merrill.

478
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:21,120
-I wonder if he's come to ask us again.
-He'll get the same answer.

479
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,646
-Oh, dear. It seems a little mean.
-He's not going to get a penny.

480
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,606
Couldn't we help him a little?

481
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:30,237
For old times' sake?
After all, he's a f riend.

482
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,718
Friends are not deductible.

483
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:35,084
-Hello, Neddy dear!
-How are you, my boy?

484
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:38,924
-I'm swimming across the county.
-I didn't know one could.

485
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,128
-I met your new chauffeur.
-Nice boy. Sense of personal worth.

486
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:48,363
-I got a lot of laughs out of Steve.
-Steve had no sense of personal worth.

487
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:49,598
What does it say?

488
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:53,284
"At the zoning board meeting,
local property owners objected...

489
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:57,522
...to the Halloran proposal on the basis
it would overcrowd public schools."

490
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:02,046
We petitioned to cut the Driscoll estate
into two-acre lots, instead of five.

491
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:04,598
They're practically
calling us communists.

492
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:09,445
-Sticks and stones, sticks and stones.
-lt'll be a tough fight, Chester.

493
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:14,046
-Why is that tree bare?
-Oh, that's an ash.

494
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:15,927
Well, it must be blighted.

495
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:20,879
No. Ashes are the last to get their
leaves and the first to lose them.

496
00:43:21,169 --> 00:43:24,002
Overcrowding
the public schools, indeed.

497
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:28,560
As though people with two acres
propagate more than people with five.

498
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:31,243
That's not even a biological f act.

499
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:36,199
-Saf ari Ball. Put me down f or a table.
-Oh, Neddy.

500
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,282
What's the matter?
Don't I always support your benefits?

501
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:45,318
-A table costs $1000.
-Okay, put me down.

502
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:01,529
By the way, my boy, I was awfully
sorry that we couldn't be of help.

503
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:04,157
I don't recall asking you f or help.

504
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:06,638
How are Lucinda and the girls?

505
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:10,404
Lucinda's fine and the girls are
home playing tennis.

506
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:16,320
Now, if you don't mind,
I think I'll get wet.

507
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:26,723
-Didn't ask f or any money after all.
-Just wait.

508
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:39,678
He must be back on his feet.

509
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:44,323
He bought a whole table, didn't he?

510
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:15,129
-Hi.
-Hi.

511
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:20,283
-I bet your name's Gilmartin.
-Kevin Gilmartin Jr., after my f ather.

512
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:23,839
My mother says I've got
a lot to live down.

513
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:26,326
How about giving me a cup?

514
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:29,845
-lt's 10 cents.
-I'll owe it to you.

515
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:34,446
-How do I know I'll collect?
-I'll drop around tomorrow and pay you.

516
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,443
Scout's honour.
Well, I look honest, don't I?

517
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:43,886
Thanks.

518
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:49,647
You're shivering.

519
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,527
Is your mother home?

520
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:56,479
She's in Europe. It's a honeymoon,
so she couldn't take me.

521
00:45:56,649 --> 00:46:00,039
-How's your f ather?
-He's in love with a manicurist.

522
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:05,203
That's what Mother says. I have to
depend on her f or inf ormation.

523
00:46:10,929 --> 00:46:13,682
-You alone here?
-There's a maid.

524
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:19,048
I'm gonna invite you over to our house.
I've got two girls you can play with.

525
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,643
-How big?
-Not much bigger than you.

526
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:23,606
-Do you play with them?
-Sure.

527
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:26,602
We play tennis
and we go bike riding together.

528
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:31,524
-I have an English racing bike.
-Fine, bring it over. We'll race you.

529
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:34,764
-Do you want another?
-No, thanks.

530
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:36,442
You'll owe me 20 cents.

531
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:40,158
I haven't time.
I'm swimming home.

532
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:45,404
-Do you mind if I use your pool?
-Not at all, but...

533
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,717
Well, that does it.
That really does it.

534
00:47:39,249 --> 00:47:41,046
My whole project is ruined.

535
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:44,281
They emptied the pool
because I'm not a good swimmer.

536
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:48,362
I'm bad at sports. At school,
nobody wants me on their team.

537
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:51,248
It's a lot better that way.
You take it f rom me.

538
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:55,197
At first, it's the end of the world
because you're not on the team.

539
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:57,644
-Till you realize.
-Realize what?

540
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,245
You realize that you're f ree.
You're your own man.

541
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:05,243
No need to worry about being captain
and all that status stuff.

542
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:09,163
They'd never elect me captain
in a million years.

543
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:13,880
You're the captain of your soul.
That's what counts. Know what I mean?

544
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:17,600
There's one thing I could do.

545
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:21,762
I could get in and make believe
I'm swimming across the pool.

546
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:23,920
But that's kind of cheating, isn't it?

547
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,399
Not if I did all the strokes exactly
as if I were in the water.

548
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:30,561
-Hey, that's a good idea!
-Let's do it.

549
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,598
Now, there are three things
to remember:

550
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:38,725
Relax...

551
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:43,402
...reach and f ollow through.
That's it.

552
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:46,129
Okay, let's start with the crawl.

553
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,362
Hey, you got pretty good f orm.

554
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:59,639
I've had lots of lessons.
It's just that I'm af raid of the water.

555
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:04,485
Okay, over on your back. That's it.

556
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:06,958
You know what we do
in the winter?

557
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:09,802
We flood our tennis courts
and ice-skate on them.

558
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:15,362
Those kids of mine look so damn cute.
Like elves in their red stocking caps.

559
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:19,158
-I don't know how to skate.
-You come over, we'll teach you.

560
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:22,446
-Then we'll have a game of hockey.
-Okay.

561
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:28,009
Breaststroke. Yes, sir, those kids
of mine think I got all the answers.

562
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:31,605
Those kids of mine
think I'm just about it.

563
00:49:36,729 --> 00:49:40,927
I've done it! It's the first time
I've ever swum a whole lane!

564
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:43,045
Congratulations.

565
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:53,205
I suppose it doesn't count, though,
because there's no water.

566
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:56,406
-For us there was.
-But that's a lie, isn't it?

567
00:49:56,569 --> 00:50:01,438
No. You see, if you make believe
hard enough that something is true...

568
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,486
...then it is true f or you.

569
00:50:03,649 --> 00:50:07,483
-Let's do it again.
-I gotta be going.

570
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:11,964
-Oh, come on, please?
-lt's getting late.

571
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:17,324
-I'm sorry, I'd like to, but...
-lf you're gonna leave, then leave.

572
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:24,839
I'll give you a ring tomorrow.
About coming over.

573
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:57,007
-What's the matter?
-I thought you were gonna dive.

574
00:50:57,209 --> 00:51:01,725
You thought I was gonna dive?
There's no water in the pool.

575
00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:04,687
Well, so long again.

576
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:17,446
Ain't it a bitch, huh?
You ever seen anything like it?

577
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:22,364
Fifteen tons, 30, 000 pounds of
structured aluminium and clear plastic.

578
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:47,408
So there we are, bare-assed,
and we jump in the pool.

579
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:52,643
It's all steamy and warm, and the
snowflakes are floating down...

580
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:57,758
...and the hi-fi system is playing
and Grace and I are on our backs...

581
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:01,604
...just bobbing along
and I says to Grace:

582
00:53:01,769 --> 00:53:05,762
Well, this party has everything,
including a gatecrasher.

583
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:09,043
I was hoping
you'd be glad to see me.

584
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:12,804
You never came when I invited you.
Why should I be glad now?

585
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:18,089
-Well, I thought, better late than never.
-You thought wrong, buster.

586
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:21,924
As one of your more
distinguished gatecrashers...

587
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:23,807
...do I rate a drink?

588
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,687
Suit yourself.

589
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:41,005
-You're new around here, aren't you?
-What do you mean, new?

590
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:45,765
-lt's just I haven't seen you at parties.
-I haven't seen you neither.

591
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,279
I'll have a gin on the rocks, please.
When you have a chance.

592
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:56,838
Here I am again, Leroy.
Fill 'er up.

593
00:53:57,689 --> 00:54:00,044
Some big deal, huh?

594
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:05,085
Boy, you sure gotta like swimming
to go in f or this expenditure.

595
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:09,444
You look like the type
that goes in f or swimming, huh?

596
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:13,522
Why not? When the world is
so generously supplied with water.

597
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:17,887
I'm not a maniac about it. Tell you
the truth, it's murder on my hair.

598
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:19,926
Lovely hair.

599
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:23,846
Thank you.

600
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:28,882
You a neighbour f rom around here?

601
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:32,360
No.

602
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:35,327
You a f riend of the Biswangers?

603
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:39,525
They're not even
on our Christmas card list.

604
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:42,885
Then what are you?

605
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,685
I'm an explorer.

606
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:52,082
-No, I mean, what are you doing here?
-I'm swimming home.

607
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:58,527
You married?

608
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:02,967
-What's that got to do with it?
-You're divorced? What?

609
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:07,879
Do you want to come with me?

610
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:12,884
-Where?
-Along a river of sapphire pools.

611
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:18,521
-I never heard anyone talk like you.
-Come with me, be my love.

612
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:21,157
-That I've heard bef ore.
-Not f rom me.

613
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:24,844
-You're no different than any other guy.
-But I am.

614
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:29,844
I'm a very special human being.
Noble and splendid.

615
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,678
Come on, Joan.

616
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:23,441
Hey, wait a minute.

617
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,719
This looks like my wagon.

618
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:32,362
I'm sure this is my wagon.

619
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,360
This is my wagon.

620
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:39,997
I wheel my kids around in it.
You see that?

621
00:56:40,169 --> 00:56:44,401
That's where Ella put her f oot through,
and I mended it with plywood.

622
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:47,402
This is my wagon, man.

623
00:56:47,649 --> 00:56:50,721
-What's the trouble here?
-This is my hot dog wagon.

624
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:52,959
-We bought it.
-You bought it?

625
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:56,485
-At a white elephant sale.
-What the hell was it doing there?

626
00:56:56,649 --> 00:56:59,766
-Your wife must have donated it.
-She had no right.

627
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:03,285
-She knows I'm crazy about this thing.
-Take it up with her.

628
00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:05,724
-I'll buy it back f rom you.
-Not interested.

629
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:09,165
I'll give you twice what you paid f or it.
I'll give you $100.

630
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:11,923
A hundred dollars?
For that piece of junk?

631
00:57:12,089 --> 00:57:15,718
I wanna buy this wagon back.
Name a price, I'll send you a check.

632
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:18,403
He'll send me a check.

633
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:21,846
-I'm taking this thing home with me.
-Hands off, you.

634
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:25,604
You crashed in,
now crash the hell out.

635
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:27,403
Go on, beat it!

636
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:41,597
I'll have my lawyers
get in touch with you.

637
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:43,043
Yeah, you do that.

638
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:18,679
What are you doing here?

639
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:22,159
-What a great suit. New?
-Last year's.

640
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,006
-I don't remember that suit.
-You weren't around last year.

641
00:59:26,169 --> 00:59:28,319
God, you look sensational.

642
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:33,281
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I'm swimming home.

643
00:59:33,449 --> 00:59:36,441
-You're what?
-Pool by pool, across the county.

644
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:39,203
Good Christ, Ned,
will you ever grow up?

645
00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:42,685
-Let me try.
-No.

646
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:45,844
Please, let me.

647
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:54,159
When I was a Boy Scout,
I passed the first-aid test...

648
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:57,446
...but there wasn't much
in it about splinters.

649
00:59:57,609 --> 01:00:02,160
Now, if you broke something,
I could make you a beautiful splint.

650
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:08,720
I'm sorry.

651
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:17,007
There we are.
A regular redwood.

652
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:20,525
Cut a hole in it,
you could drive a car through.

653
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:30,438
-What did you do that f or?
-Keep away f rom me, will you, please?

654
01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:35,046
You must be crazy.
Everybody's gone crazy today.

655
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:40,078
I just came f rom the Biswangers'.
They snubbed me.

656
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:42,683
Everybody at their party
snubbed me.

657
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:47,127
They've even got my hot dog wagon.

658
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:48,728
Your wagon?

659
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:52,040
I painted it myself
and put the little umbrella up.

660
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:55,087
I always kept it in the playroom,
remember?

661
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:58,047
I've never been to your house,
remember?

662
01:01:00,169 --> 01:01:03,718
God, I'm tired.
You mind if I have a drink?

663
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:05,800
All right.

664
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:14,241
-How about you, you want a bullshot?
-No, thank you.

665
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:19,399
Oh, come on, now.
You love the way I make them.

666
01:01:22,009 --> 01:01:24,762
We are running out of Tabasco.

667
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:27,480
"We"?

668
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:31,524
Aren't you a little confused
this afternoon?

669
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:38,962
-How goes it in Never Never Land?
-What?

670
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:43,281
Has the ideal all-American f amily
f ound happiness on the hill?

671
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,438
The hill?

672
01:01:44,609 --> 01:01:48,124
I heard a rumour that you'd
changed your place of residence.

673
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:50,644
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

674
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:55,000
Well, how is the president
of the League of Women Voters?

675
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,921
-Who?
-How is your wife?

676
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:59,284
Oh, she's fine.

677
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,521
I've been away so long
I haven't kept up with the news.

678
01:02:02,689 --> 01:02:07,126
I suppose by now all waitresses in
town must be certified nonvenereal.

679
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,486
Last I heard that was
your wife's latest project:

680
01:02:10,649 --> 01:02:14,437
Physical checkups
f or f ood handlers.

681
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:18,122
Lucinda's always done
a lot of good in this town.

682
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:21,964
She just didn't do
so good at home, did she?

683
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:37,046
Here's to sugar on our strawberries.

684
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,045
Cheers.

685
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:51,399
Remember last winter in Toronto?

686
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:54,242
We called room service
and ordered bullshots.

687
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:57,003
I wasn't in Toronto last winter.

688
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:03,205
I came up f or the opening of your show.
Remember how it snowed?

689
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:07,647
I ordered a horse and sleigh to take
us f rom the hotel to the theatre.

690
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:11,245
I haven't been in Toronto
in three years now.

691
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:16,720
Was it Boston? What was
the name of that play in Boston?

692
01:03:16,889 --> 01:03:20,245
I came up on a Saturday, remember?
You f aked a slipped disk.

693
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:24,687
Your standby went on f or the matinee.
I cured your aching back, didn't I?

694
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:26,726
You bastard.

695
01:03:28,649 --> 01:03:32,642
Listen, Ned, I want you to get out
of here now, I mean it!

696
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:37,082
-Why?
-I'm expecting someone.

697
01:03:37,409 --> 01:03:40,082
-Who?
-None of your business who.

698
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:45,367
A man?

699
01:03:45,529 --> 01:03:49,044
Do you think I've been in a deep
f reeze while you've played house?

700
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,006
Yes, a man.

701
01:04:01,649 --> 01:04:03,765
I'm cold.

702
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:10,079
What's the matter with that sun?
There's no heat in it.

703
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:19,887
Shirley...

704
01:04:21,249 --> 01:04:23,240
...what happened?

705
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:26,489
What happened to what?

706
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:30,324
Nothing's turned out...

707
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:35,838
Nothing's turned out
the way I thought it would.

708
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:41,527
When I was a kid,
I used to believe in things.

709
01:04:42,089 --> 01:04:44,444
People seemed happier
when I was a kid.

710
01:04:44,609 --> 01:04:47,043
People used to love each other.
What happened?

711
01:04:47,209 --> 01:04:51,839
You got tossed out of your golden
playpen, that's what happened.

712
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:59,247
My mother gave me 25 cents f or
mowing the lawn around our house.

713
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:03,167
Seems only a minute ago...

714
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:05,968
...I could smell the grass.

715
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:10,288
It's so f ast.

716
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:14,207
People grow up and then they...

717
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:18,723
We're all gonna die, Shirley.

718
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:21,926
That doesn't make
much sense, does it?

719
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:24,167
Sometimes it does.

720
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:30,598
Sometimes at 3:00 in the morning.

721
01:05:31,009 --> 01:05:34,718
Did you know I went to spy on you
once in the lobby of the theatre?

722
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:38,723
-Spy on me?
-lt was a long time ago.

723
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:42,161
You were meeting your f amily
to take them to the ballet.

724
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:46,242
I saw your daughters in their white
gloves and patent leather slippers...

725
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:49,566
...and that aging Vassar-girl
wife of yours...

726
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:52,448
...and her understated little suit.

727
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:54,884
And you...

728
01:05:55,049 --> 01:06:01,397
There you were, shaking hands
with people, smiling, saying hello.

729
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:05,403
One hour bef ore that,
you'd been in bed with me.

730
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:11,278
I put that smile on your f ace,
you damned hypocrite!

731
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:13,440
I want you to get out of here now.

732
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:18,125
Swim the pool, do whatever
you have to do, but get out.

733
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:25,049
As soon as you tell me
who's coming over.

734
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:27,564
I told you that's
none of your business.

735
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:31,881
On a 10-point scale,
how would you rate him in bed?

736
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:47,325
What did I do to you, Shirley?
I'm sorry f or whatever I did.

737
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:49,719
The usual red-blooded
married man thing.

738
01:06:49,889 --> 01:06:54,041
At lunch, you lectured me about
the duties of a f ather and a husband.

739
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:58,122
It's a classic by now, reprinted
yearly in the Reader's Digest.

740
01:06:58,289 --> 01:06:59,563
I don't remember.

741
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:04,007
It's the first really chic restaurant
you took me to in New York.

742
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:07,161
Right out in f ront
of everyone who counts.

743
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:10,366
-You cried.
-I also raised my voice.

744
01:07:10,529 --> 01:07:12,918
It tore me apart to see you crying.

745
01:07:13,089 --> 01:07:16,638
You chose that place because you
thought I wouldn't make a fuss...

746
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:21,963
...in f ront of all those mink hats and
snobbish waiters and stylish f ags.

747
01:07:22,129 --> 01:07:23,278
No, no.

748
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:25,963
Did you really think
you could get rid of me...

749
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:29,838
...in no more noise than
the sound of finger bowls tinkling?

750
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:31,442
I loved you.

751
01:07:31,609 --> 01:07:33,998
I didn't know what to do.

752
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:38,601
So you went back to your wife whom
you didn't love. Well, it figures.

753
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:41,522
It's her real estate,
she owns all the pots and pans...

754
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:44,328
...knows where all
the lost shirt buttons are.

755
01:07:44,489 --> 01:07:50,007
Why give up those comf orts? Well,
I had a few comf orts of my own.

756
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:53,206
When you were on that train
back to Connecticut...

757
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,327
...remember that groovy bellhop
in my hotel?

758
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,765
-Absolutely primitive, no hang-ups.
-You're lying.

759
01:07:59,929 --> 01:08:02,045
You called me f rom the station.

760
01:08:02,209 --> 01:08:05,679
I put the phone on the pillow
between us so we both could listen.

761
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:09,159
All that snivelling about
your innocent wife and children.

762
01:08:09,329 --> 01:08:12,207
We laughed so hard,
we stuffed the sheets in our mouths.

763
01:08:12,369 --> 01:08:14,280
You're lying.

764
01:08:15,169 --> 01:08:17,967
You'll never know, will you?

765
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,439
Let me do your back.

766
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:41,799
-No.
-Please let me.

767
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:59,721
Shirley, let's go away
f or a couple of weeks.

768
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:03,640
I read about a great old castle
in Ireland.

769
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:07,484
A real one,
with a moat and a drawbridge.

770
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:13,842
Some king built it,
hundreds of years ago.

771
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:18,042
It's an inn now
with crazy old f our-posters...

772
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,805
...and big soft beds with canopies.

773
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:25,480
Ned, I want you to go away now.

774
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:31,603
Will you come with me, Shirley?

775
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:37,921
Do you really think it's that easy?

776
01:09:39,849 --> 01:09:43,888
Of course everything's always
been easy f or you, hasn't it?

777
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:48,568
You could always get
a cab in the rain...

778
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:51,243
...a woman into bed.

779
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:56,044
God knows I was
easy enough to get.

780
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:58,359
You wore a blue slip...

781
01:09:58,969 --> 01:10:02,484
...with a safety pin holding up
your shoulder strap.

782
01:10:03,689 --> 01:10:06,726
I thought we were
going to make it.

783
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,929
I really thought
we were going to make it.

784
01:10:10,089 --> 01:10:12,683
I kissed that safety pin.

785
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:16,366
Ned, please don't.

786
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:29,560
Shirley.

787
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:42,362
I never meant to hurt you, Shirley.

788
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:49,363
Please believe me.
Please.

789
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:13,208
What's the matter with you?

790
01:11:16,049 --> 01:11:18,199
I'll get you a sweater.

791
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,166
No.

792
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:26,199
-You must be catching something.
-How can I swim in a sweater?

793
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:29,327
-Listen, I'll drive you home.
-No.

794
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:34,559
I've got to swim home.

795
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:40,679
-For the love of God, why?
-I've just got to. I've got to.

796
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:45,488
-I'll go get the car.
-No!

797
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,209
I can't go in a car.
It's impossible.

798
01:11:48,369 --> 01:11:50,325
How can I?

799
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:55,564
Lucinda's waiting.

800
01:11:56,009 --> 01:11:59,319
The girls are home playing tennis.

801
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,158
I'm swimming home.

802
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:05,680
My God...

803
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:35,078
Come with me.
Come with me, Shirley.

804
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:38,921
-Ned, I can't.
-Please. Come with me.

805
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,364
-Please don't.
-Shirley.

806
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:44,965
-Leave me alone.
-You know you don't want me to.

807
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:47,848
Please leave me alone.

808
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:53,362
We made love together in this pool.
And you loved it, remember?

809
01:12:54,009 --> 01:12:58,525
-I lied.
-You loved it, Shirley. You loved it.

810
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,319
-Ned, don't.
-Please.

811
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:03,161
-Baby.
-No, Ned.

812
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:05,365
-Please.
-Ned, no, don't.

813
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:10,887
No, stop it, Ned.
Don't. Ned, don't. No.

814
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:12,926
Damn you! No!

815
01:13:13,249 --> 01:13:17,162
I lied! I lied all the time
about loving it anywhere with you!

816
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:21,117
You bored me to tears with all
your stories about your old deals...

817
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:24,201
...your old girls, your golf scores,
your bloody war...

818
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:27,679
...your bloody duty, wife and kids.
You bored me to tears.

819
01:13:27,849 --> 01:13:30,363
-I was playing a scene with you.
-You loved me.

820
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:34,317
You met your match in me,
you suburban stud. I was acting!

821
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:50,399
You loved it.

822
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,284
You loved it.

823
01:13:53,449 --> 01:13:56,009
We both loved it.

824
01:13:56,409 --> 01:13:58,969
You loved it!

825
01:16:57,809 --> 01:17:00,039
Just one lane.
I wanna swim just one lane.

826
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:03,758
-You don't understand.
-I understand you ain't got 50 cents.

827
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:08,127
Can't you make an ex ception? My
house is right over there on the hill.

828
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:11,565
-I'll come back with the money.
-Get the hell out, mister.

829
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:21,805
Listen...

830
01:17:22,129 --> 01:17:24,484
...will you lend me 50 cents?

831
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:28,278
-Please. Please.
-Why the hell should I?

832
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:31,998
I'll pay you back.
Don't you realize I'll pay you back?

833
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:34,478
Beat it.

834
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:36,287
-Howie!
-Mr. Merrill.

835
01:17:36,449 --> 01:17:38,485
-Lend me 50 cents.
-Don't do it.

836
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:40,844
Howie, f or chrissake.

837
01:17:42,249 --> 01:17:45,207
What's 50 cents?
I mean, considering.

838
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,325
Thanks, Howie.

839
01:17:48,649 --> 01:17:51,117
Thanks a lot.
Thanks an awful lot.

840
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,761
Hold it.

841
01:17:55,929 --> 01:17:57,408
Can't you read, buddy?

842
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:02,238
Take a shower.

843
01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:23,363
Go on back and wash those feet.

844
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:12,768
Spread your toes.

845
01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:22,403
Bottoms.

846
01:19:25,489 --> 01:19:27,161
Okay.

847
01:21:01,249 --> 01:21:04,480
-Your f riends' pools run out of water?
-What?

848
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:07,641
How do you like our water, Mr. Merrill?

849
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:11,882
Hi, Jack.
You sure got a lot of chlorine in it.

850
01:21:12,129 --> 01:21:13,721
Stings your eyes?

851
01:21:14,009 --> 01:21:17,399
-Yeah, that's too bad.
-Ain't seen you in a while.

852
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:21,323
-Too bad you don't get into town.
-We sure had good times.

853
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:26,887
I used to see you f our or five times a
week. A few drinks, a hamburger.

854
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:28,482
How is the series?

855
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:31,846
-What are you waiting f or? Ask him.
-What series?

856
01:21:32,009 --> 01:21:34,159
-The World Series.
-Two years ago.

857
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:38,083
-Did you use the seats I gave you?
-They were great seats.

858
01:21:38,249 --> 01:21:40,319
-Are you gonna ask him?
-Shut up.

859
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:43,401
I'll ask him. When you
gonna pay your bill?

860
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:46,682
We're decent people,
trying to make a living.

861
01:21:46,849 --> 01:21:48,282
We got bills too.

862
01:21:48,449 --> 01:21:51,919
You're the first deadbeat
we ever got in our place.

863
01:21:52,129 --> 01:21:53,687
Hold it down, Lil.

864
01:21:53,849 --> 01:21:55,282
Now, wait a minute.

865
01:21:55,449 --> 01:22:00,125
Listen, I'm gonna send the both
of you a check tomorrow.

866
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,885
Yeah, that's a laugh all right.

867
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:06,883
He's no f riend of yours.
The check isn't worth anything.

868
01:22:07,049 --> 01:22:11,008
-Okay, that's enough.
-You should see the orders I sent up.

869
01:22:11,169 --> 01:22:16,163
His wife wanted French strawberry
jam. American ain't good enough.

870
01:22:16,329 --> 01:22:19,878
Mrs. Merrill had to have
Dijon mustard.

871
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:25,169
Hearts of palm, hearts of artichokes.
Some rich diet you have up there.

872
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:27,889
Hearts of Jack Finney
is what they get.

873
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:30,688
Let's break it up.
Let's not have a fuss.

874
01:22:30,849 --> 01:22:35,047
I gotta go.
How's the f amily, Howie?

875
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:38,846
My boy won the American Legion
Scholarship Award.

876
01:22:39,009 --> 01:22:40,647
-Straight A's.
-Wonderful.

877
01:22:40,809 --> 01:22:45,087
Our kids behave themselves,
not run around drunk, wrecking cars.

878
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:47,803
He kept his daughters' names
out of the paper.

879
01:22:47,969 --> 01:22:50,005
I bet that check didn't bounce.

880
01:22:50,169 --> 01:22:53,241
-Leave my daughters alone.
-Then teach them manners.

881
01:22:53,729 --> 01:22:56,163
-They never listened to him.
-Shut up.

882
01:22:56,329 --> 01:23:02,006
I'm not blaming the girls. It's him.
Always trying to be "one of the gang."

883
01:23:02,169 --> 01:23:04,637
My daughters worship me.

884
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:07,323
They love me and respect me...

885
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:11,837
...because I'm their f ather,
and they respect me.

886
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:14,206
-They respect me.
-Yeah?

887
01:23:14,409 --> 01:23:15,558
My girls love me.

888
01:23:15,729 --> 01:23:20,245
We heard those girls talking in
our place, giving you the raspberry.

889
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:21,728
You're a liar.

890
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:24,363
Come on,
don't talk to my wife that way.

891
01:23:24,529 --> 01:23:26,281
She's a goddamned liar.

892
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:31,279
Wanna know what your girls thought
of you? Your girls laughed at you.

893
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:36,045
I heard them. They thought
you were a great big joke.
