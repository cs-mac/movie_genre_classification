1
00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:03,138
Mrs. Owen is expecting
a lot of guests.

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:04,303
She chose you.

3
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:06,188
Welcome to Soldier Island.

4
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:08,933
Mr. Lombard, you seem
to be under the impression

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,885
that I am a particular kind
of woman.

6
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:12,965
And I assure you that I'm not.

7
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,525
They're the 10 little soldiers...

8
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:15,875
You know, from the poem.

9
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:17,779
Ladies and gentlemen...

10
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:18,779
Who is that?

11
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,128
You are charged
with the following indictments.

12
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:24,531
Philip Lombard...
That you did murder 21 men.

13
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:26,781
What the hell
are they playing at?!

14
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,570
Malicious nonsense.

15
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,874
Cyril.
I really tried to save him.

16
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:32,462
I almost drowned.

17
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:33,721
Twenty-one men?

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,252
I'm the only one telling the
truth in a room full of liars.

19
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:38,664
Who is it?

20
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,069
We are cut off.

21
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:43,748
Rats in a barrel.

22
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:45,601
Almonds.

23
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,949
Almonds be buggered.

24
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,073
Cyanide.

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,948
None of you moved them?

26
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,170
- No.
- No.

27
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:06,116
Was it you, Doctor?

28
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,004
No.

29
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:13,623
How did Mrs. Rogers die?

30
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,709
I have no idea.

31
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,331
Did you give her something?

32
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:20,431
Yes... a mild sedative.

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,860
Did you give her too much?

34
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:25,557
Miss Claythorne, I warned you
against becoming hysterical.

35
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,076
It's the poem.

36
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:28,904
It's the poem.
Don't you see?

37
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,049
Ten little soldier boys.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,627
One choked himself,
one overslept himself,

39
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:34,615
and then there were eight.

40
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:36,364
There were 10 of these
and 10 of us,

41
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:37,872
and now there's eight.

42
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,390
Oh, General... General,
did you move the figures?

43
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,795
What?

44
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,326
The figures.
Did you move the figures?

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,955
No.
Of course not.

46
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,581
Perhaps
it was you, Miss Claythorne.

47
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,684
- You discovered it.
- Of course it wasn't me.

48
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,937
- Why would I do that?
- To be the center of attention.

49
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:54,539
Do you crave attention,
Miss Claythorne?

50
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,276
Any kind of attention?

51
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:58,887
- What are you talking about?
- Shall we just have breakfast?

52
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:07,053
It was dreadful news
about Mrs. Rogers.

53
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,325
She was a wonderful cook.

54
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,347
Such a shame.

55
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:16,074
This egg is four minutes
precisely, is it?

56
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,563
Yes, madam.

57
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:23,545
Rogers, did you take away
two of these figures?

58
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,203
No, miss.

59
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:29,112
Condolences, Mr. Rogers.
When are you expecting Narracott?

60
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:30,251
Mid-to late morning, sir.

61
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,390
His timekeeping
is somewhat erratic.

62
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:35,875
Will that be all?

63
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,461
Yes. Thank you, Rogers.
Thank you very much.

64
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:43,022
Tony Marston was young
and strong.

65
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,157
He didn't die
from some stimulant.

66
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,346
Perhaps he was poisoned.

67
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:50,714
And... And Mrs. Rogers...
Perhaps she was given too much.

68
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:53,490
What drugs do you have
in your medical bag, Doctor?

69
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,166
Why did you even bring it?

70
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,576
You are a guest.
It's not work.

71
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,594
Actually, it is work.

72
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:03,608
I was trying to maintain some
sort of professional discretion.

73
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,447
However, Mrs. Owen suffers
from female neuroses.

74
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:11,220
My speciality
is women's disorders.

75
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,667
Mr. Owen engaged me
in a professional capacity

76
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,214
to tend to his wife!

77
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:17,803
Gave up on the surgery, then,
Doctor?

78
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,982
No. People do not just die
out of nowhere for no reason.

79
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:24,431
They die because something
was done to them by someone.

80
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:25,855
I'm gonna check your bag.

81
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,938
- Don't you dare touch...
- What have you got to hide?

82
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,224
How about I do it?

83
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,311
I'm not being searched
like some grubby criminal.

84
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,851
Then what if the general
goes with him?

85
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,779
He's an honorable man.

86
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:39,217
Fine!

87
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:39,575
But while you're at it,

88
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:43,352
you might want to search
Judge Wargrave's case as well.

89
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,373
I know where I've seen you before.

90
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,385
Chap who has the clinic
beneath mine in Harley Street,

91
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:50,015
he's a cancer specialist.

92
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,198
That's where I saw you.

93
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:54,292
If anyone has strong painkillers
and sedatives in his case,

94
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,601
it's Judge Wargrave.

95
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,505
Is that true, Judge?

96
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:03,547
I have had health problems, yes.

97
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,214
Then that's very cruel, Doctor.

98
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,323
Don't blame me.
You pushed it.

99
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:09,358
General, shall we?

100
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:21,144
Just mild sedatives.

101
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:22,284
As I said.

102
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:24,564
Bog-standard.

103
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,161
Nothing special.

104
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,439
My surgery was a success.

105
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:34,887
This... the house, the island...
Is meant to be my recuperation.

106
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:40,287
Sea air, peace... and rest.

107
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,204
Very sorry.
I'm... very sorry.

108
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:47,654
Well, there's an end to it.

109
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:48,344
Like hell it is.

110
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:51,177
Why shouldn't she be searched?

111
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,057
Equal rights for women.

112
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:56,951
Let's see what you've got.

113
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,153
Dr. Armstrong,
control yourself, please.

114
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:08,392
Who the hell
do you think you are?

115
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,343
I'm a doctor.
You're a secretary.

116
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,042
Somebody moved them.

117
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,794
They did.

118
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,627
Someone did that.

119
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,282
Did you really kill
all those men?

120
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:59,385
Yes, Miss Claythorne.
I did kill all those men.

121
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:01,546
And more.

122
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:03,623
Why?

123
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,899
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

124
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,824
They had something I wanted.

125
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,915
In this case, it was diamonds.

126
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,790
Worth more than a few lives.

127
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,366
What about you?

128
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,346
What did you want?

129
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:27,548
I nearly drowned.

130
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,394
I failed to save a little boy
in my care.

131
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,146
And there isn't one minute
of every day

132
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:35,249
that I am not sorry for that.

133
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,817
Why aren't you?

134
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,640
I know what I am.

135
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:43,529
I always knew
it would catch up with me.

136
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,055
And here it is.

137
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,026
I love you,
I love you, I love you.

138
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:53,212
I think about you
and you kissing me

139
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,794
and your hands on me and in me
and your mouth on my body,

140
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,737
and I cannot bear
that you are not with me now.

141
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:03,445
I wish, I long,
I crave for you, my darling,

142
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,169
and I feel so cruel
to poor, dear John,

143
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:10,587
but the sun rises and sets
in your eyes, Henry.

144
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,348
I love you.
I love you.

145
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,773
"I am yours."

146
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:19,306
The men are all ready
for the whistle, sir.

147
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,906
Morale fairly good.

148
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,666
Here.
Let me.

149
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,495
Henry.

150
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:51,354
You've been a...
a great friend to my wife and I.

151
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,107
Perhaps you could call me John.

152
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:07,173
Thank you, John.

153
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,812
Myself and Mrs. Rogers were here
for a week

154
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,232
without seeing another soul

155
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:28,569
apart from Narracott
with the delivery, sir.

156
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:34,931
Lombard.

157
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:37,628
Where are you going?

158
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:41,165
We're sat around
waiting for Ulick Norman Owen.

159
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,268
What if he's been here
all along?

160
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,224
Plenty of places
he could be hiding.

161
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:49,803
Wait for me.

162
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:26,035
Please, please,
please just fucking stop.

163
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:29,923
Stop.
S-Stop. Stop. Stop.

164
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:48,955
Oh, this is... this is barmy!

165
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,246
No one could hide down there.

166
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:04,186
Ever get the feeling
you're being hunted, Tubs?

167
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,771
Now, stop calling me that.
I ain't even fat.

168
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,028
And no, I don't.

169
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,239
Really?

170
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:16,781
'Cause Mr. Owen, whoever he may
be, knows a lot about us.

171
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,909
Well, not about me.

172
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,995
Edward Lander was a degenerate.
He was a pansy.

173
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:25,013
He fell down the steps
into his cell.

174
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:35,784
You never touched him?

175
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:40,420
I wouldn't want to be near
one of them dirty bastards.

176
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,339
Come on, Tubs!
Keep up!

177
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,564
General?

178
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,667
Is your suitcase ready?

179
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,529
She died.

180
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:11,074
Spanish influenza,
after the war.

181
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:12,713
Who?

182
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,146
My wife, Leslie.

183
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:21,641
After all that...
she died of the Spanish flu.

184
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,044
So many did.

185
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:32,102
I should have just stepped aside
like a gentleman and...

186
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,882
just let them be happy.

187
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:40,688
Do come back to the house,
General.

188
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,671
You haven't
brought your case down yet,

189
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,059
and we want to get away as soon
as Mr. Narracott arrives.

190
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,160
He's not coming, Narracott,
you know.

191
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:53,575
No one's coming for us.

192
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,638
We won't be leaving the island.

193
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:56,987
This is the end.

194
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,687
It's a relief to come to
the end, to know that it's over.

195
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:07,098
You won't understand that yet,
but you will...

196
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:08,702
In time.

197
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,049
I think you're quite mistaken.

198
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,938
The boat will come and we'll all
be waiting for you.

199
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,887
Miss Claythorne.

200
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,388
Good.

201
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,212
Bring a couple of chairs,
would you?

202
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,302
What's going on?

203
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:30,980
It's a bit early
to be on the sauce.

204
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:33,280
It's been something
of a morning.

205
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,671
Hey. Hey.

206
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:42,320
Bastard's down there.
I heard him.

207
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,510
What bastard?

208
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:46,031
Owen.

209
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:48,448
I can hear him moving about.

210
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,270
Marston's room.

211
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,551
What are you doing?

212
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:24,973
Camp bed.

213
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:27,588
Well, we had to find somewhere
to store it, and...

214
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,050
young men don't look under beds.

215
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:31,994
But w-what do you need
a camp bed for?

216
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,179
What were you planning?

217
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,484
Well, I can't sleep in my room,
can I?

218
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,595
Me wife.

219
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,939
Yeah. Obviously.
Of course.

220
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,590
I've got to find somewhere else
to set up.

221
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,255
What for?
We're all leaving.

222
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:46,198
Well, you might be.
This is my job.

223
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,733
I can't go anywhere
until my employer dismisses me.

224
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,314
Your employer?
Your employer is insane.

225
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:55,558
Be that as it may,
I've got nothing else to go to.

226
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,969
All right, then.
Carry on, Rogers.

227
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,578
Did you know he had a gun?

228
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:08,625
No.

229
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,394
Do stop.

230
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:26,655
Mr. Narracott seems
a sensible man.

231
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:28,202
He'll be here.

232
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:34,033
I must say, I understand now

233
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:37,722
why you teach in such
a substandard establishment.

234
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,089
I'm just observing
that most schools

235
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:44,627
would not want to be associated
with an inquest.

236
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm not accusing you.

237
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,915
There's been quite enough
of that already.

238
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,343
Yes, there has.

239
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:50,814
More than enough.

240
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,040
Apart from the egregious
Mr. Lombard

241
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,694
and the Rogers,
who I find most dubious,

242
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:00,655
and the depraved Mr. Marston,
it's all nonsense.

243
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,591
Everyone was simply doing
their duty.

244
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:05,903
As was I.

245
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:08,235
As were you?

246
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,573
You didn't say anything
last night.

247
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,588
It wasn't for gentlemen's ears.

248
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:17,002
But Beatrice Taylor was my
maid of all work.

249
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,095
Foundling girl.

250
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:24,974
An unwanted...
From the war, you know?

251
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:31,241
I believed her to be a clean,
decent, modest girl.

252
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,702
I taught her needlework skills.

253
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,768
We had quite the little home.

254
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,271
But then she got herself
into trouble.

255
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:04,548
The family way.

256
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:10,541
As her own loose mother had
with her.

257
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,238
She begged me for help.

258
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,947
Naturally and quite properly,
I refused.

259
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,477
Miss Brent, please!

260
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,502
I beg you!

261
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,071
What happened to her?

262
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,820
She threw herself under a train.

263
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,479
She killed herself?

264
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,389
Even made the local paper.

265
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:45,063
And they turned it into some
potboiling sentimental tale.

266
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,143
She asked you for help.

267
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,514
If you had helped her...

268
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,266
It was the weakness
in her character

269
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:52,163
which drove her actions.

270
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:53,753
Why should I be reproached?

271
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,056
Ask Rogers for some tea.

272
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,415
Lemon, not milk.

273
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,788
It's a
wild-goose chase if you ask me.

274
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:16,442
Grown man hiding
and sneaking about.

275
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:17,453
It's ridiculous.

276
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:20,523
Marston was given cyanide,
though.

277
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:21,896
Wasn't he, Tubs?

278
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,462
Cyanide?

279
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:26,140
I'm pretty sure of it.

280
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,065
I don't know.

281
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,838
You were convinced of it
this morning.

282
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,933
Claythorne for the cyanide.

283
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,313
- I'd put money on it.
- She don't seem the type.

284
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:39,619
No.
She's exactly the type.

285
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,832
What about the old boy,
the general?

286
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,093
Dangerous men come back,
you know, from over there,

287
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,521
their noggins all scrambled.

288
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,901
Oh. Well,
let's search everybody, then.

289
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,963
God-bothering Miss Brent.
Let's search Wargrave.

290
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:53,049
What, the judge?

291
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:54,377
Well known as a hanging judge.

292
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:56,516
He's infamous
for the black square.

293
00:20:56,635 --> 00:21:00,054
The story goes that he'd watch
every execution he'd ordered.

294
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:03,497
Tubs, you've been looking
sideways at Armstrong

295
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,963
all morning,
and now everyone's fair game.

296
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,261
You suggested the judge.

297
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,771
I was taking the piss.

298
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,629
Mr. Owen is on the island,
and I'm going to find him.

299
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,292
You don't want to pay attention
to what he said.

300
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,996
He's just stirring the shit pot.

301
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,377
Well, I can stir it right back.

302
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:56,974
Don't look.

303
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:01,778
Someone did this?

304
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:04,043
Well, it weren't
no bleedin' accident.

305
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,062
It's murder.

306
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,658
He said no one was
coming for us.

307
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,459
He said this was the end.

308
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,516
Miss Claythorne?

309
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,046
"Eight little soldier boys
traveling in Devon."

310
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:45,101
One said he'd stay there,
and then there were seven.

311
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,213
Count them, Judge.

312
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:52,022
Count them.

313
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,471
Cyril!

314
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,549
Run!

315
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,817
Find help!

316
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:20,401
A boat!

317
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:22,268
Run!

318
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,267
Miss Claythorne!

319
00:24:45,822 --> 00:24:47,337
I just want to go!

320
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,877
You'd drown!

321
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:51,671
Please!

322
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,568
Please.

323
00:24:58,673 --> 00:24:59,907
Come inside.

324
00:25:00,023 --> 00:25:00,975
Come. Come.

325
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:04,981
I've got you.

326
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:06,451
Don't worry.
It's all right.

327
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,577
I told you Owen
was on the island.

328
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,600
What made you so sure?

329
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:23,107
Instinct.

330
00:25:23,226 --> 00:25:25,130
We've got to be rational.

331
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:27,034
Stick with procedure.

332
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:28,700
Who is this Owen?

333
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,128
And Mrs. Owen.

334
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,118
I don't think there even is
a Mrs. Owen.

335
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,610
We must all have
something in common,

336
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:35,962
someone who knows us all.

337
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,830
Well, how can that be possible?

338
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:41,556
I can imagine crossing paths
with a doctor, a judge,

339
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,617
but someone like Mr. Lombard?

340
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:47,346
Well, we've crossed paths now,
haven't we?

341
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:52,140
Mr. Lombard, Blore tells me
that you have a revolver.

342
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,723
Oh, Tubs.

343
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,429
'Why have you got a gun?
He's got a gun?

344
00:25:56,544 --> 00:25:58,373
I carry it everywhere.

345
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:01,788
And it was implied
that I might need it.

346
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,485
Implied?
By whom?

347
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,042
My client needs a good man

348
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:10,578
who can handle situations.

349
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:13,627
Who's your client?

350
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:14,817
Mr. Owen.

351
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,808
Ulick Norman Owen.

352
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,390
Never heard of him.

353
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:20,021
But he has heard of you.

354
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:22,751
Audrey, the box.

355
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:45,517
It's dangerous, then.

356
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:48,612
My client believes
that it could become volatile.

357
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:51,674
I see.

358
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:56,164
And how would Mr. Owen wish
me to proceed?

359
00:26:56,553 --> 00:26:58,977
He leaves that
to your discretion.

360
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:01,039
But forewarned is...

361
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:03,015
ls forearmed.

362
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,694
I understand.

363
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:19,920
That's who got in touch with me
about the job with Mrs. Owen...

364
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,025
Isaac Morris in Soho.

365
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:24,892
Soho.

366
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:30,674
I was invited here by the Owens,
whom I've never heard of,

367
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:34,164
to join a mutual friend...
Mrs. Culmington.

368
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,421
Perfect place to recover,
it said.

369
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:40,110
The envelope was postmarked
London, Soho.

370
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,173
A sink of depravity.

371
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,297
A godless desert of vice.

372
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:50,105
What brings you here,
Miss Brent?

373
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,976
Mrs. Owen wrote to me.

374
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,635
She was interested in my work.

375
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:57,724
The moral education of girls
of the lower orders.

376
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,592
They have to be taught
modesty and decency

377
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:04,150
or society will be drowned in a
rising tide of unwanted babies,

378
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,332
all squalling to be fed.

379
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,699
She wanted to contribute
to my cause.

380
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:11,610
Blore?

381
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:16,165
I got a letter
from Ulick Norman Owen.

382
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,881
He was impressed
by my standing in the force.

383
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:24,801
He said if I could see my way
clear to spending some time,

384
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,776
keeping an eye out, that he
would recompense me generously.

385
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:29,365
Keeping an eye out for what?

386
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,741
He said that someone
was here under false pretenses.

387
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:35,052
He also supplied
a list of guests.

388
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:36,818
All of you.

389
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:38,959
Everyone here.

390
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:42,610
What he didn't say was that
Lombard would have a gun.

391
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,826
Is it Mr. Owen's voice
on the record?

392
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,218
Does anybody recognize it?

393
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,607
Are we forgetting
about the gun here?

394
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:51,022
There's a Fenian sat over there
with a bloody gun!

395
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:51,970
Don't blaspheme.

396
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:53,723
Hand it over. Come on.

397
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,144
Surrender your weapon,
Mr. Lombard.

398
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:57,329
- Not a chance.
- I could make you.

399
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,602
You can try.

400
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:02,093
Is Isaac Morris Mr. Owen?

401
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:03,437
No.

402
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,532
I'd have found that sweaty
bucket of lard by now.

403
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:07,837
Jews.

404
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,502
Wherever there's a problem,

405
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,331
there's Jews
at the bottom of it.

406
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,144
Something struck me.

407
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,753
I can't think
why I didn't see it before.

408
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,643
Ulick Norman Owen.

409
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:24,496
Una Nancy Owen.

410
00:29:24,614 --> 00:29:26,399
Or...

411
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,790
U.N. Owen...

412
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:36,677
is "unknown."

413
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:42,905
It's a riddle, perhaps.

414
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:44,570
What does it mean?

415
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:48,033
It means that Mr. Lombard
is right to insist

416
00:29:48,144 --> 00:29:50,068
that the killer
is on the island.

417
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:52,730
And he's getting very wet
out there.

418
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,789
The killer's not out there.

419
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:56,576
The killer is in here.

420
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,109
It is one of us.

421
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,008
We've never met each other
before now. Why?

422
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:11,950
How could I possibly be capable?

423
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,524
Oh, anyone is capable,
Miss Brent.

424
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:17,456
Forty years on the criminal
bench has taught me that.

425
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:19,999
- Rogers.
- Here we go again.

426
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:21,660
Lining up the next suspect.

427
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,845
You mark my words.
Rogers.

428
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:25,313
He's an oily bugger.

429
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:26,499
Slinking around.

430
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:28,804
Going back and forth
during dinner.

431
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:29,855
He would have had time

432
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,433
to put something
in Mr. Marston's drink.

433
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:33,603
I heard him tell Mrs. Rogers
to shut up.

434
00:30:33,718 --> 00:30:35,903
Well, she's shut up now,
isn't she?

435
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:37,489
He's the one moving the figures.

436
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:39,509
But the... the general,
the rest of us,

437
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:42,333
that record, this house...
Why?

438
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,126
Rogers... He's got
low cunning running though him

439
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:47,212
like Brighton
through a stick of rock.

440
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,259
We need to watch him.

441
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:51,807
Any faith I ever had
in the thin blue line

442
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:54,663
evaporated the second
I met you, Tubs.

443
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,966
You call me that one more time,
mate... one more time...

444
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,272
And you'll what?

445
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,089
We are all being hunted.

446
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,957
There's someone else
on this island,

447
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,372
and when I find him,

448
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:13,906
I'm gonna make him number 22
with a bullet right there.

449
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:14,953
Oh, God.

450
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:18,186
How could you say that...
so easily?

451
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:21,039
I just open my mouth,
and it comes out.

452
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,871
I'll see what can be done
about supper.

453
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,488
There's some liver and kidneys.

454
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:34,431
Perhaps a pie
with some good gravy.

455
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,191
That would be delicious, Rogers.

456
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:39,619
Thank you.

457
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:41,729
Thank you, Rogers.

458
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,544
Well, I ain't eating a
mouthful of his pie.

459
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,266
Oh.
Well, good night.

460
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:36,918
Trust in God.

461
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,464
But perhaps also...
we should lock our doors.

462
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:10,384
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

463
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,073
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

464
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:15,779
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

465
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,559
He restoreth my soul.

466
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,273
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

467
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:08,730
Yea, though I walk through...

468
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:11,983
the valley
of the shadow of death,

469
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:17,076
I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

470
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,642
I will fear no evil.

471
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,623
I will fear no evil.
I will...

472
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,638
I will fear no evil.
Thou art with me.

473
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:00,606
Get up!

474
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,246
Get up!

475
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,171
Get up!

476
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:08,903
Get up!

477
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,951
I was looking for him.

478
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:17,368
I wanted a coffee.

479
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,597
Ilooked.

480
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,182
And I found this.

481
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,405
It wasn't me.

482
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:26,333
I just wanted a damn coffee.

483
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:27,403
It wasn't me.

484
00:35:27,522 --> 00:35:29,394
He's been here all night.

485
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:32,287
Seven little soldiers
chopping up sticks.

486
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:35,077
One chopped himself in half,
and then there were six.

487
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:37,724
So she's right.

488
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:40,299
It is the poem.

489
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:43,234
But he's fucked,
Mr. Unknown Owen,

490
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,276
because six little solder boys
played with a hive.

491
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,342
A bumblebee stung one,
and then there were five.

492
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,329
And there is no hive here,
and there are no bees,

493
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,312
so what are you gonna do now,
Mr. Unknown Owen?

494
00:35:53,424 --> 00:35:55,176
You're fucked!
You're fuck...

495
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:01,159
Now get dressed.

496
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:06,574
We will all get dressed,
and I will make coffee.

497
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:09,373
Miss Brent, shall we?

498
00:36:09,488 --> 00:36:10,484
Yes.

499
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:15,834
Shit.

500
00:36:15,953 --> 00:36:17,230
Shit the bed.

501
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,289
We'll need to find
something to wrap him up with

502
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:20,713
or he's gonna go everywhere.

503
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:43,601
Coffee.

504
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:46,855
There's no milk, I'm afraid.

505
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:51,531
Does this person...
mean to kill us all?

506
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:54,463
I believe so, yes.

507
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:00,852
I've lost a ball of wool.

508
00:37:01,998 --> 00:37:05,061
I'm quite ridiculously
distressed about it.

509
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:08,122
It's only wool.

510
00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:18,498
I'm so very tired.

511
00:37:22,518 --> 00:37:24,347
Drink your coffee, Miss Brent.

512
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,859
I'll bring you a candle
to see by.

513
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,749
Thank you, dear.

514
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:16,218
I'll make some more.

515
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:44,822
Judge Wargrave, I feel I owe you
an apology for...

516
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:47,761
exposing your illness in such
an unforgivable fashion.

517
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:51,129
We're all feeling
a little ragged, understandably.

518
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,406
What's your opinion
of the others?

519
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:02,746
I haven't really formed one.

520
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:04,694
I don't trust any of them.

521
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,805
Blore.

522
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:06,990
That bastard Lombard.

523
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:08,148
Claythorne.

524
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:10,370
Miss Brent
and her religious mania.

525
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:17,383
But you and I...
we have sharp minds.

526
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:21,350
Actual intellects.

527
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,804
We should stay together.

528
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:29,365
Very well.

529
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:38,214
Oh.

530
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,828
Here.
Here.

531
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,696
Thank you.

532
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:45,483
Dribbling down myself
like a child.

533
00:39:51,811 --> 00:39:54,310
Miss Claythorne's making
the coffee.

534
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:57,884
She should be watched.

535
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:18,630
Right.

536
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,039
You do the stairs.

537
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,494
I'm going to wash the guts
out of the wood store.

538
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,006
Can I?

539
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:06,533
I rather enjoy domestic tasks.

540
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:09,299
They are soothing.

541
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:11,600
Normal.

542
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:13,616
Indeed.

543
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,895
I'll just be a moment.

544
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:34,779
All right.

545
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:30,676
Stung by a bee.

546
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:34,578
And then there were five.

547
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,092
Well, I suppose with no Rogers,
I should think about lunch.

548
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,590
I could eat a scabby horse.

549
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:03,656
You're actually hungry?

550
00:44:04,524 --> 00:44:08,301
Well, it was heavy work...
dealing with Rogers.

551
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,959
And you're the one
who suggested lunch.

552
00:44:10,077 --> 00:44:13,096
Only because it's what one does
at this time of day.

553
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:14,044
But I'm not hungry.

554
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:15,277
How could you possibly
be hungry?

555
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:17,264
Oi, you.

556
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:21,153
Don't go implying...
casting aspersions...

557
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:23,611
I've got... I've got nothing
to do with this.

558
00:44:23,722 --> 00:44:24,956
I've got nothing to do
with any of it.

559
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:26,483
Just because I said
that I was hungry...

560
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:28,958
I am hungry.
It doesn't prove a single thing.

561
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,242
I'm going to get dressed.

562
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:43,087
The whole morning, dragging
Rogers around, clearing up guts,

563
00:44:43,198 --> 00:44:45,006
without so much as a cup of tea
to wet me whistle.

564
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:46,216
And you...
You look at me like...

565
00:44:46,331 --> 00:44:48,830
Calm down.

566
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,635
You've got some front, love.

567
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:56,569
You've got
some right brass neck.

568
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,036
Don't go downstairs on your own.

569
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:04,098
Not with those two.

570
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:06,439
What, Wargrave and Armstrong?

571
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:10,405
You wait up here for me.

572
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:36,187
It was locked, which means
there must be a master key.

573
00:45:36,306 --> 00:45:37,734
Rogers must have had
a master key.

574
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:39,162
You two dealt with the body!

575
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:40,666
And you found it.

576
00:45:41,184 --> 00:45:42,537
Or did you?

577
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:44,286
You shrieking like a woman.

578
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:46,063
Was that a bit
of amateur dramatics, was it?

579
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:48,920
I did nothing to Rogers.
I didn't take any master key.

580
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,104
We don't even know if there is
a master key.

581
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,068
And we only have your word
that the gun was stolen!

582
00:45:53,163 --> 00:45:55,511
- You could've taken it!
- Why would I steal my own gun?

583
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:58,002
I don't know
why you'd do anything, Lombard.

584
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,950
I don't know
why you killed Rogers

585
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:01,656
or Miss Brent or MacArthur!

586
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:02,603
I didn't kill them.

587
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:04,193
Well, you would say that,
wouldn't you?

588
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:06,971
Just like you'd say
that your gun was stolen!

589
00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:11,489
You really are a first-class,
five-star,

590
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:14,269
solid-gold fucking moron.

591
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:15,975
Please, the lady

592
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:18,318
Double bluff.

593
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,960
What, Tubs?

594
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:23,626
Why you would steal
your own gun.

595
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:25,259
Armstrong's got a point.

596
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:27,123
It's all riddles and games,
smoke and mirrors.

597
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:28,750
Double bluff.

598
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:32,565
You were the last one down.

599
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:36,171
The last one.

600
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:38,868
Ages behind everyone else.

601
00:46:38,983 --> 00:46:40,687
What... What took you so long?

602
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:44,338
I don't care to say.

603
00:46:44,457 --> 00:46:46,568
You killed Rogers.

604
00:46:47,114 --> 00:46:49,300
You took the master key.
You went to bed.

605
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:50,962
You made sure all of us
were downstairs.

606
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:52,930
And then you got into my room
and you took my gun.

607
00:46:53,025 --> 00:46:54,182
You have my gun,
you little prick.

608
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:55,408
Lombard.
For heaven's sake.

609
00:46:55,523 --> 00:46:56,680
I never killed Rogers,

610
00:46:56,793 --> 00:46:58,859
and I ain't got your key
or your sodding gun.

611
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:00,132
Then what took you so long?

612
00:47:00,244 --> 00:47:02,354
If you weren't in my room
stealing my gun,

613
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:03,698
then why were you the last down?

614
00:47:03,813 --> 00:47:06,712
I was in the bloody lavvy,
if you must know.

615
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:08,375
Constipated!

616
00:47:11,984 --> 00:47:13,217
Oh, yes.

617
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,218
Yeah.
Laugh it up.

618
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:17,700
It's not funny.

619
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:20,120
I was bound up something rotten.

620
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,289
Sat there in a muck sweat.

621
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,117
So it weren't me.

622
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:26,779
It could have been any of us.

623
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:31,110
Any one of us
could have had the key.

624
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:33,883
Any one of us
could have the gun.

625
00:47:52,948 --> 00:47:54,715
It is the only way to be sure.

626
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,634
It's not like you've been
singled out.

627
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,554
We're all getting the same.

628
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:20,925
No key.

629
00:48:21,044 --> 00:48:22,278
No gun.

630
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:28,033
Now... Now you, Miss Claythorne.

631
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:29,616
Of course.

632
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:50,443
I'm just being thorough.

633
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:18,034
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?

634
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:19,700
I do.

635
00:49:19,818 --> 00:49:22,004
I'm in love with him.

636
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,786
I love him so much it hurts.

637
00:49:23,904 --> 00:49:24,840
Silly.

638
00:49:24,936 --> 00:49:26,602
Girls are silly.

639
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:30,096
And I'm going to marry him.

640
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:32,949
I heard Mummy say he couldn't
afford to get married.

641
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,288
Well, I'll find a way, Cyril.

642
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:36,640
If you marry Uncle Hugo...

643
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:38,389
When I marry Hugo.

644
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,691
Will you be my aunt?

645
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:40,642
I will.

646
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:42,546
Aunt Vera.

647
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:44,180
And what fun we'll have.

648
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:47,548
Christmas and birthdays
and summer holidays.

649
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:50,877
Picnics, parties, pony rides.

650
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:54,454
How happy we'll be
when we have everything.

651
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:32,250
Cyril!

652
00:50:58,035 --> 00:51:00,135
Why isn't Lombard doing this?

653
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:05,131
Blore and I thought it a
good idea to keep you two apart.

654
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,777
Well, well, Miss Claythorne.

655
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,422
Mr. Lombard.

656
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,323
Philip.

657
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:19,143
Vera.

658
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,259
Nothing.

659
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,646
We'll search the rest
of the house.

660
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:36,929
Every room.

661
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:48,386
We're in hell.

662
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,322
And we're being punished
for what we done.

663
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:53,116
He refused the hood.

664
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:54,782
He haunts me still.

665
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:55,954
Look at them.

666
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:58,027
There's something going on
between them.

667
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,005
Someone has to come for us soon.

668
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,473
They... They have to.

669
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:04,049
I reckon we're being watched.

670
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:09,114
We are.
