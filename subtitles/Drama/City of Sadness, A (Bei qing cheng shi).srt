00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:43,165
Democracy comes from
the Greek root "demos"..

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,624
meaning "the people"..

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,707
and "kratein" meaning "to rule"

5
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,499
In other words..

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,040
to govern according to..

7
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,249
the will of the majority

8
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,332
Lincoln once said

9
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,374
Of the people

10
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,999
by the people

11
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,707
for the people

12
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:17,915
It represents the ideals of the
future China that I truly believe in

13
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,249
A people's republic!

14
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,165
Prof. Yang

15
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,790
Will we ever see that day?

16
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,540
I know that day will come

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,415
Even if I don't live to see it..

18
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,040
You will!

19
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:53,582
Professor! Professor!

20
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,540
Yang Qu-yun, the former leader of
the Revive China Society..

21
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,374
was gunned down on October 1st, 1901

22
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,207
It was the first political assassination
in Hong Kong's history

23
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,499
Hong Kong was once a British colony..

24
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:31,749
a haven for political exiles
and revolutionaries

25
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:39,374
After the assassination of Yang darkness
loomed over Hong Kong

26
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,040
On October 1st, 1906

27
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:48,957
Sun Yat-sen, aka Sun Wen, left Tokyo
on a perilous journey to Hong Kong..

28
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,832
THE FORBIDDEN CITY
BEIJING

29
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,665
Your Majesty

30
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:11,665
The traitor Sun Wen left Japan
for Hong Kong yesterday

31
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,332
He must not leave Hong Kong alive then

32
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,707
Summon General Yan

33
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,415
China/ Hong Kong Border

34
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,915
ENTRY PERMIT

35
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,832
What is the purpose of your visit?

36
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,624
To visit ancestral graves

37
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,957
That policeman, he's the one

38
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,249
Tail this man

39
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,415
CHEN XIAO-BAI: FORMER HONGKONG
CHAIR OF THE UNITED LEAGUE OF CHINA

40
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,540
Young master was accepted at
a Western college!

41
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,957
The master is giving away
rice in celebration!

42
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,832
Line up only once!

43
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,665
Take only as much as you can carry
with one hand!

44
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,707
Come!

45
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,707
Jin Li Yuan Estate

46
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,457
Step right up!

47
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,207
Master, all the guests have arrived

48
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,915
Young master is also ready

49
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,374
You're going to a western college,
you should wear a western suit

50
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,249
Yes, father

51
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,290
Congratulation, Yu-tang!

52
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,457
Mr. Chen, you're late

53
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,499
Please follow me

54
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,915
What the hell..

55
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,082
The son is poised to take
over from his father

56
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,290
Chong-guang will be the first
Chinese Taipan in Hong Kong!

57
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,207
Yale University in America!

58
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,124
You're taking too much!

59
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,207
But you said "one hand"!

60
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,832
Thank you, brother!

61
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,790
Three, two, one!

62
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,040
Not bad.. but the queue
looks a bit odd with the suit

63
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,082
Where's my present?

64
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,290
Mr. Shi, allow me to introduce you to..

65
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,124
Burmese tycoon, Mr. Deng Youlin

66
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,249
Hong Kong's Chief of Police, Mr. Shi Mi-fu

67
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,374
Mr. Shi is the pride of
the Chinese community!

68
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,124
What is it?

69
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,999
Sun Wen is coming!

70
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,249
How much money do you need this time?

71
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,040
Do you know why he's coming?

72
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,457
Yu-tang

73
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,499
Dr. Sun is meeting with United League..

74
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,499
delegates from the thirteen provinces

75
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,165
He's going to unite the
various factions and..

76
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,790
launch a mass rebellion within
the next few years

77
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,415
It will take place..

78
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,707
across the country..

79
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,207
in Guangdong, Guangxi,
Fujian and Yunnan!

80
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,457
Yunnan's Lui Zhi-yi,
Guangdong's Xu Xue-qiu..

81
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,790
Shandong's Xu Jing-xin and..

82
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,665
Hubei's Liu Jing-an..

83
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,999
Delegates from all over are coming here..

84
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,290
to discuss the grand plan with Dr. Sun

85
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,249
Huang Xing and Sung
Jiao-ren are coming too!

86
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,207
We're on the verge of a great change

87
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,624
China will be shaken to its core

88
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,124
A new world is coming!

89
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,624
Yu-tang, just imagine

90
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,624
The Revolution begins right here

91
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,249
And you will be part of it!

92
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,415
How much?

93
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,082
Three thousand Hong Kong dollars

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,082
You ask for more each time..
I'll think of something

95
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,874
Offer them each 25 cents
and treat them to cakes

96
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,124
Yes, madam!

97
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,374
Ma..

98
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,499
Shush or I'll take you away and sell you!

99
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,749
What the hell!

100
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,082
Mama!

101
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,457
The time and day are confirmed

102
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,040
9 a.m. on the 15th

103
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,290
Dr. Sun will arrive at Star Ferry Pier

104
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,957
I need to know who's
leading the Qing assassins..

105
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,957
and how many men they have

106
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,874
Our comrades in GuangZhou
will do their best to find out

107
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,040
The Qing court will try to eliminate..

108
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,957
Dr. Sun at all costs

109
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,249
You and your men are our
only defense in Hong Kong

110
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,207
We've been waiting for this day!

111
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,374
After Cixi placed the Emporer
under house arrest..

112
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,332
at the end of the Hundred Days Reform

113
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,332
I led 300 brothers out
of Tientsin to escape..

114
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,915
persecution from the
conservative fraction

115
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,249
Only thirty of us survived

116
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,290
As long as Cixi remains in power..

117
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,415
we will fight to restore our honor!

118
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,207
General Fang, we're counting on you!

119
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,790
Brothers!

120
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,832
Our day of reckoning is here!

121
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,749
Four days from now, we'll
fight to the death!

122
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,082
Our time has come!

123
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:14,915
Yes, sir!

124
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,499
Father!

125
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,290
Go to bed

126
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,415
Do you remember why we came
to Hong Kong?

127
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,707
Why mother died? Why can't I go to school?

128
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,582
We've lived in 15 towns
over the course of 6 years

129
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,624
We've finally found a place to settle down!
Why do we need to run again?

130
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,874
One day we will return home to Tientsin

131
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,040
and never run again

132
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,165
I've heard the same lie too many times!

133
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,957
KOWLOON WALLED CITY:
LAST CHINESE ENCLAVE IN
BRITISH-RULED HONGKONG

134
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,415
I cried the day I received
the imperial decree!

135
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,832
My prayers were finally answered..

136
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,165
after years of disgrace and humiliation

137
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,415
Thank the heavens for giving me..

138
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,207
the chance to fight for my country

139
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,415
I'm a soldier, we're all soldiers!

140
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,415
Soldiers are meant to die in battle!

141
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,915
Brothers, drink up!

142
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:44,165
Death to the traitor!
Long live the empire!

143
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,249
4 DAYS BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL

144
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,374
Rise

145
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,707
Where did he go?

146
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,582
He went to Li Yu-tang's house..

147
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,915
then Gao Sheng Theatre

148
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,124
Thank you!

149
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,707
I hear you like to gamble?
Gambling is a passion!

150
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,874
Passion means getting what..

151
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,749
you want at all costs

152
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,957
I like people with a passion

153
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,332
If I get paid, I'll do anything

154
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,790
Brother, it's already dawn!
It's closing time!

155
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,624
One last round! Just deal!

156
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,457
I can do this..

157
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,624
Yes, yes.. l knew it!

158
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,290
You're going to lose this time!

159
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,207
Reveal!

160
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,832
I win!

161
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,749
We're closed now!

162
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,999
One last round!

163
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,040
Good morning, master

164
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,832
Good morning, father

165
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,040
Where is he?

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,415
He's taking his breakfast in his study

167
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,832
Can't he sit down to a proper meal?

168
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,290
You..

169
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,124
You're studying?

170
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,249
Yes, father

171
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,124
Tomorrow is your late mother's birthday

172
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,499
Yes, father

173
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,415
Your face..

174
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,332
A-si

175
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,832
You can read?

176
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:19,165
Young master taught me 53 words!
But now he's busy with his studies

177
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,790
You want to learn to read?

178
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,165
I do!

179
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,290
I'll ask Tang Jiu to find you a teacher

180
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,790
Thank you, master!

181
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,207
DA-YOU PHOTOGRAPHY

182
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,540
Master Liu!

183
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,624
Prepare an opium pipe for Master Liu!

184
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,874
Master, have you seen that woman before?

185
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,582
People say he squandered..

186
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,374
the family fortune..

187
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,749
all because of that woman

188
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,790
Nosy!

189
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,749
Brothers and sisters!
Fellow citizens of Hong Kong!

190
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,124
Not far to the north..

191
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,290
Our fellow countrymen are suffering..

192
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,207
under the corrupt and dying Qing Empire

193
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,457
My fellow countrymen,

194
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,582
the Chinese United League was founded
in Tokyo..

195
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,665
to overthrow the corrupt Qing regime..

196
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:01,999
and bring democracy to China

197
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,415
Support democracy! Support Dr. Sun!

198
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,957
Donate to the Chinese United League..

199
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,665
Chong-guang?

200
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,665
But master..

201
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,457
Support democracy!

202
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:31,957
Support Dr. Sun!

203
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:39,165
Support Dr. Sun! Support..

204
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,124
Come home with me!

205
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,790
I will not forsake my country!

206
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,207
Go home!

207
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,457
I will not forsake my country!

208
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,165
Go home!

209
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,374
I will not be a coward!

210
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:04,957
We will not be cowards!
We will not forsake our country!

211
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,124
You're turning against me too?

212
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,249
Young master is a grown-up..

213
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:33,040
Move over!

214
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,415
Chen Xiao-bai!

215
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,832
Did you know that my son took part in..

216
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,415
the street riots?

217
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,624
Did you have anything to do with it?

218
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,915
What were you thinking
when you gave him these books?

219
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,832
He's my son, my only son!

220
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:09,124
I was forty before I finally had a son!

221
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,957
I gave him these two

222
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,207
These were gifts for you

223
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,957
I set ground rules when we first met

224
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,249
I provide the money but
I don't get involved.

225
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,957
I don't care how you waste my money!

226
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,457
But how could you get my son involved?

227
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,707
Do you know what Police Chief Shi
told me?

228
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,082
The Qing court sent assassins!
They have guns!

229
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,624
Did you bother to warn me?

230
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,374
I'm a businessman!

231
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,665
My son will be a businessman!

232
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,082
No, You're a rebel!

233
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,915
The day you donated your first cent
to the cause..

234
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,290
you became a rebel!

235
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,499
You hired me to be
Chong-guang's teacher!

236
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,874
You willingly gave money to the cause!

237
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,749
No one forced you!

238
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,374
Now you say what's right for you..

239
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,582
isn't right for your son?

240
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,832
I don't care

241
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,207
I'm saying this for the last time

242
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,499
I'm an old man.

243
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,124
I don't care if I'm labeled a rebel!

244
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:33,915
But my son a rebel?! I will not allow!

245
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:44,207
3 DAYS BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL

246
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,207
I waited all night for you!

247
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,915
Did you do what we asked?

248
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,749
I promise there will be no police
at the theatre tonight

249
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,832
Mr. Chen, a telegraph!

250
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,124
General!

251
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,915
We have news!

252
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,582
Yan Xiaoguo is leading the assassins.

253
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,790
He's now hiding out at the Walled City!

254
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:39,999
It's too late!

255
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,874
Protect Mr. Chen!

256
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:20,457
Hurry! Go!

257
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,124
I told you to step back!..

258
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,582
I'm a member of this opera troupe!

259
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,582
Step back!

260
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,874
I need to find my father!
My name is Fang Hong!

261
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,832
Father!

262
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,874
One day we will return home toTientsin..

263
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,082
and never run again

264
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:58,290
I've heard the same lie too many times!
Revive China, Sun Wen

265
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,290
We can't find Mr. Chen

266
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,499
Yu-tang, my brother

267
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,374
We've been best friends..

268
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,999
since we met eight years ago

269
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,582
I'm deeply sorry..

270
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:56,332
for upsetting you today

271
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:00,707
But Dr. Sun's visit to
Hong Kong is extremely important

272
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:05,665
The Qing court will send assassins

273
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:10,957
I may be in danger so I
must ask one last favor

274
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,707
If anything happens to me..

275
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,790
you must see the mission through!

276
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,915
The hope of China rests with Dr. Sun

277
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,540
The future of China depends on Dr. Sun

278
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,332
In China, there is only one Dr. Sun

279
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,957
I bid you farewell

280
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,040
I will fight to the end

281
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:44,874
Get up! Get up!

282
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,124
All of you! Outside!

283
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,957
The Chief of Police has
ordered China Daily..

284
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,749
to be shut down immediately..

285
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,207
for publishing propaganda..

286
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,499
inciting civil unrest
and disturbing the peace!

287
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:05,915
Proceed!

288
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,624
You have no right!

289
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,082
We'll fight back!

290
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:20,832
Master Li..

291
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,790
Stop fighting!

292
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:24,582
Stop!

293
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,124
What's going on?

294
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:51,832
As your friend, I already warned you..

295
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:55,207
I told you not to meddle!

296
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,290
You beat up my staff and
destroyed the press

297
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:03,457
How can call yourself my friend?

298
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,040
The Qing court is determined
to eliminate Sun at all costs

299
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,082
My British superiors ordered
us not to interfere!

300
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,832
You're playing with fire.

301
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,040
Have you forgottened that
you're just a businessman?

302
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,915
Have you forgotten that..

303
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,832
you're also Chinese?

304
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:20,207
Well said!

305
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,540
Very brave of you..

306
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,999
China Daily published propaganda..

307
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,374
and incited student protests

308
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,624
We are under British rule!

309
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,040
Shut down the newspaper immediately!

310
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:38,915
More than thirty people were killed..

311
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,415
at the Gao Sheng theatre last night

312
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,665
And Chen Xiaobai is still missing!

313
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,374
How could you let this happen?

314
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,832
What has the Chief of Police been doing?

315
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:52,082
Well said!

316
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:59,832
I warned you

317
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,749
Officers, shut it down!

318
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,290
I dare you!

319
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,624
Arrest anyone who resists!

320
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,665
Attention!

321
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,415
We will put out the news
of Dr. Sun's arrival..

322
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,082
even if we must do it by hand!

323
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,874
Who's that old man?

324
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,165
That's my father!

325
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,290
Master Li

326
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,249
Resistance Leader Dr. Sun Wen

327
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,332
Due to Arrive in Hong Kong October 15th

328
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,124
Hong Kong Government intervenes

329
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,749
We've reached a turning point

330
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,415
If the revolution is to succeed..

331
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,790
we cannot fight divided!

332
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,624
We need a plan
that will bring us together

333
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,999
Dr. Sun is coming to..

334
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,415
unite the different factions..

335
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,207
of the resistance..

336
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:16,540
and launch a rebellion
within the next 3 years!

337
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:21,207
The very foundations of
China will be shaken!

338
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,374
We're on the verge of great change!

339
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,832
A new world is coming!

340
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,832
The great revolution..

341
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,624
starts here!

342
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,874
And we're all part of it!

343
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,707
Please trust me

344
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:46,540
I, Li Yu-Tang, promise to..
..lead you through this!

345
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,540
We can still safeguard Dr. Sun!

346
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,415
2 DAYS BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL

347
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:23,999
It's your family heirloom

348
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:33,249
So, what do you want in return?

349
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:37,707
I need you to protect someone
the day after tomorrow

350
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,665
Alright..

351
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,915
Give the most dangerous task to me

352
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:07,290
Master Liu, don't you want to know
who you're protecting?

353
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,332
Master Li

354
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,624
What's wrong with
falling in love with a woman?

355
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,415
You had your pick of women

356
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,207
Why did you have to fall
for your father's woman?

357
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:45,874
Stinky tofu!

358
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,915
You have superb fighting skills!

359
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,749
I know you.
You're the hero, Li Yu-tang!

360
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:47,290
You put on a good show today!

361
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,374
Oh?

362
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,040
Come..

363
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,082
You told off that man..

364
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,457
who works for the British!

365
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,165
I hate cowards who bully the weak!

366
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,332
You stand up for the truth

367
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,707
I.. admire that!

368
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,332
Hero Li, call me if you
need me in the future!

369
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,749
My size helps even if..

370
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,040
I just stand by your side!

371
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:14,665
How about the day after tomorrow?

372
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:18,415
Who are we fighting? The British?

373
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,332
The bad guys!

374
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,457
Great!

375
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,415
Take care of the child..

376
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:12,874
Why did you sneak into my house
the other day?

377
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,540
We went our separate ways long ago!

378
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:20,207
Don't bother me or my family
ever again!

379
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,374
Stay out of my life!

380
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,749
Are you done?

381
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:47,207
Master, count me in

382
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,332
I grew up on the streets

383
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:54,540
I have my shares of wounds,
I'm not afraid of anything!

384
00:42:56,333 --> 00:43:00,040
But A-si, the mission
is extremely dangerous

385
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,290
I just want the master to be safe

386
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,624
Alright then

387
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,332
Master..

388
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,374
I must ask a favor?

389
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,999
I'm in love with the
daughter of the photographer

390
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,915
When this is all over..

391
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,540
Will you help me propose?

392
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,915
Yes..

393
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,957
Of course!

394
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:55,249
Long live Boss! Long live Boss!

395
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:56,540
A-si!

396
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,249
Turn around!

397
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,540
Where to?

398
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,749
To see the photographer

399
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,374
Got it!

400
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,415
Sir, may I help you?

401
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,874
I'm here to discuss
a marriage proposal

402
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,457
Come, A-si!

403
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:53,332
A-si has been with us at Jin Li Yuan
for over 10 years

404
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:57,499
He's thoughtful, honest and caring

405
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,207
Please accept this money

406
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,124
More will come later

407
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,207
Please don't joke with me

408
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:18,082
I promise you..

409
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,790
Once your daughter joins our family
at Jin Li Yuan..

410
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:26,290
I will treat her like my own

411
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,082
Let's discuss this inside

412
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:46,374
My daughter would be honored..

413
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:48,332
to be part of Master Li's household

414
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,665
A-chun, bring some tea for Master Li!

415
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,332
Master Li..

416
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:01,082
Let's discuss the wedding arrangements
and the dowry

417
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:03,915
Where shall we hold
the wedding banquet?

418
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,832
When shall we set the wedding day?

419
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:10,582
Master Li, what do you think?

420
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,790
Master Li?

421
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,499
Let's take a family portrait together

422
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,249
Yes, of course!

423
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,540
Three.. two.. one!

424
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:42,332
Master

425
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:43,874
Father

426
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:50,707
Where is he?

427
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,749
Stop playing..

428
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:52,915
Son, it's not safe outside

429
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,374
Promise to stay home for
the next few days..

430
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:08,124
please?

431
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,415
Let's eat!

432
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:55,582
Professor, not eating, drinking
or talking is bad for your health

433
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,832
As your former student, I'm concerned

434
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,040
I've brought the Professor..

435
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,207
his favorite wine: Shanxi's Fan Jiu!

436
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:19,040
Is this is my last meal?

437
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,457
Of course not!

438
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,874
You're my mentor!

439
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:32,957
I've been taught to respect my mentors

440
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,832
You're like a father to me

441
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:41,999
If you still consider me
your mentor, set me free!

442
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,624
So that you can thwart my plans?

443
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,124
Yan Xiaoguo

444
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:49,665
Do you remember the advice..

445
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,624
I gave you at your graduation?

446
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,832
Talented

447
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,749
But foolish

448
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:06,165
Will probably never achieve greatness!

449
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,665
Professor, you've misjudged me

450
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,457
Do you think that I blindly..

451
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:23,207
serve the imperial court?

452
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,957
It's not true

453
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,207
I have a question, Professor

454
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,457
Other than war and suffering..

455
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,207
disgrace and humiliation..

456
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:42,665
What have the foreigners..

457
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:43,707
brought us?

458
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,332
The belief that we are all born equal!

459
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,374
In China some can be born emperors..

460
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,665
and into privilege..

461
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,665
while others are born into slavery!

462
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,957
The Emperor has the "mandate of heaven"!

463
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,415
That needs to change!

464
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:04,249
We need to establish a
democratic republic!

465
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,957
Xiaoguo, you received a western education

466
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,582
How could you remain blind to
the world outside?

467
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:17,290
The world is much bigger
than you imagine!

468
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,999
My western education taught me to see..

469
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:22,165
how evil and greedy..

470
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,665
the foreigners really are!

471
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,124
Do you think you can save China..

472
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,249
with meetings and protests?

473
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,374
Professor

474
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:38,290
You're just a teacher,
you'll never achieve greatness

475
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,207
You still can't stomach the
sight of blood, can you?

476
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,374
You're all the same, useless and weak!

477
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,457
If your revolution
succeeds, China is doomed!

478
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:13,124
I won't kill you,
but I don't ever want to see you again!

479
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:44,499
I need 100 silver coins to bury
my father and his men

480
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,790
Bring her the money!

481
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,165
Yes, sir!

482
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:55,499
I'm hungry

483
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:02,665
More rice

484
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:03,874
Yes!

485
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,707
I want to see your friend

486
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,499
My father died because of him

487
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:18,707
He disappeared at the same time
your father was killed

488
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,874
He went to ask your father for help

489
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,915
I will take my father's place

490
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,540
At 9 a.m. tomorrow, Dr. Sun
will arrive on shore

491
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,624
There will be a crowd of a thousand..

492
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,415
at the Star Ferry Pier

493
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,082
The assassins can easily blend into
the crowd of coolies, merchants..

494
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,040
foreigners and civilians

495
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,665
We must be on the alert!

496
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,790
The large police presence at the pier..

497
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,457
will be our best defense

498
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:49,624
The assassins won't dare
make a move there

499
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,832
Master!

500
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:59,790
They're my brothers, they all run fast!

501
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:04,499
We need someone to keep watch..

502
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,624
from the roof and signal us

503
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:08,540
I'll do it

504
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,790
Dr. Sun will make three stops tomorrow:

505
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,332
Yashuhito Society,
Mrs. Sun's residence and the China Daily

506
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:15,415
We need to be extra vigilant
at these locations!

507
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,207
Understood!

508
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:17,499
From Queen's Road
to Yashuhito Society..

509
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:20,165
Fang Hong will lead the procession..

510
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:23,040
Wang Fu-ming will bring up the rear

511
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,832
Remember, do not break formation!

512
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,124
Tan Jiu warned me yesterday that..

513
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,374
3 vacant properties along Queen's Road
were leased on the same day

514
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,499
We don't know who rented them

515
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,040
We must get through the
these areas quickly

516
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,332
Do not stop!

517
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,790
Reporting for duty, sir!

518
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:11,290
At your service, sir!

519
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,165
1 DAY BEFORE SUN'S ΑRRIVΑL

520
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,290
Thank you all

521
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,457
It's for you!

522
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,374
After tomorrow, I will marry you, A-si

523
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:30,790
A-si, do you know who
you're protecting tomorrow?

524
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,374
I just want the master to be happy

525
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,082
This book was written by him..

526
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,749
it's young master's favorite!

527
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,749
Read it to me, please

528
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:56,957
Alright

529
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:07,624
I gave up medicine in order to help
overthrow the Qing Empire..

530
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:11,707
and free my fellow countrymen

531
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,915
When I left Hong Kong..

532
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:16,957
I endured great hardship on the road

533
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,207
My mother was worried

534
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,540
She said: the revolution
will save lives..

535
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:26,499
but practicing
medicine also saves lives

536
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:30,582
Why choose the harder path?

537
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:35,415
I said: mother, there's much
you don't understand

538
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,957
Practicing medicine can save a few lives

539
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,749
But the revolution can save millions

540
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,874
After 260 years of foreign rule..

541
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,874
and 2000 years of autocratic rulers..

542
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,749
China is in decline

543
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,957
The Manchurian regime
is corrupt and oppressive

544
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,749
it will only bring..

545
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:03,374
further suffering

546
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:10,665
The tide of revolution is rising.

547
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:12,749
The will of the people shall prevail

548
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,624
We need to gather our courage..

549
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:17,457
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty..

550
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:20,249
and establish a true democratic nation!

551
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,874
The road to revolution
is paved with blood

552
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,207
My life is destined to end in time

553
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:32,499
But the republic will herald
a new era..

554
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,790
of lasting peace and prosperity

555
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:37,749
We must continue to struggle..

556
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,957
and overcome obstacles..

557
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,790
in order to end the
suffering of millions

558
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:49,582
and allow the exiled millions
to return to their homeland

559
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,874
After I was kicked out of Shaolin..

560
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:19,790
I headed south and ended up in Putian

561
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,749
I kept going south until
I reached Hong Kong

562
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:25,999
If I went any further..

563
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,832
I would have fallen into the sea!

564
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:38,915
Try the tofu

565
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:43,415
Stinky tofu! Stinky tofu!
These are for you!

566
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:44,290
Do you have one that's green?

567
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,374
Stinky tofu! It's for you!

568
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,082
Thank you!

569
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,374
You're a Shaolin monk?

570
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:56,040
Grab a chair..

571
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:01,374
Will you show us your kung-fu tomorrow?

572
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,165
I've never actually been
in a real fight before

573
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,915
I'm not sure if my kung-fu works

574
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,124
But after tomorrow's mission..

575
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,499
I will proudly return to Shaolin!

576
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:17,790
You can't leave!

577
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:19,957
I'm getting married soon!

578
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,457
Really?

579
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:24,749
You must come to my wedding! I will!

580
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:28,832
Miss Fang, you're invited too!

581
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,999
After tomorrow,
I'm taking my father's ashes home

582
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:33,499
We will never leave home again

583
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,457
Dinner's ready!

584
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,832
It smells good!

585
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:47,415
Let's eat!

586
01:00:51,166 --> 01:01:15,749
Master

587
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,540
Chief inspector Shi sent this over

588
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,290
Master Liu..

589
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,249
I haven't been called
Master Liu in a long time

590
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,790
My father told me on his deathbed:

591
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,999
The most important thing in life is..

592
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,290
Integrity

593
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,957
But tomorrοw..

594
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,665
I'll fail! I will be a liar!

595
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:42,165
Do you know what
is the most painful thing in life?

596
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:48,624
To watch the one you love die..

597
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:03,457
To fall in love with the wrong woman..

598
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:07,457
I drove my father to his death..

599
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:10,874
She killed herself in front of me..

600
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,915
I'm tortured by that knowledge
each day..

601
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:20,415
I'm like a ghost

602
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:26,374
Nothing could be more painful

603
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:35,665
All for a woman, was it worth it?

604
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:43,707
Tomorrow, will it be worth it?

605
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,790
Thank you, Master Li..

606
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:16,749
Tomorrow, Liu Yubai will be set free!

607
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:51,249
What..

608
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,457
What're you doing here?

609
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,915
I need your help

610
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:06,624
What can I possibly do for Mrs. Li?

611
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,415
You must help me!

612
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:16,457
Alright! I'll help you
for old time's sake!

613
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:20,665
But you have to pay

614
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,707
I need you to protect someone tomorrow

615
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,999
I'll pay any price to keep him safe!

616
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,624
I'll do anything for money! Who is it?

617
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,207
Li Yu-tang!

618
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,499
What?

619
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,582
You want me to protect your new man?

620
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:37,457
Shen Chong-yang!

621
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,249
Get out of my house!

622
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,040
Can't you do something worthwhile..

623
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,457
for once in your life?

624
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,582
Get out! You must help him!

625
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,290
Get out!

626
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,540
He's raising you daughter!

627
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,082
You know that?

628
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,540
I was with you for 8 years
and you gambled the entire time

629
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,207
But I stuck with you!

630
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,749
I never asked for anything!

631
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,624
I stayed and accepted my fate..

632
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:16,374
because I loved you

633
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:20,749
But when I became pregnant..

634
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:23,499
I didn't want my child
to suffer the same fate

635
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,874
I needed a man who could be a good father

636
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,207
a man who could raise a child

637
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,124
Come over here!

638
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:49,832
Look, your daughter is down there

639
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:56,290
When she grows up..

640
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,624
What do you want me to tell her
about her real father?

641
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,915
If you come tomorrow

642
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:17,874
When she grows up, I'll tell her that

643
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,832
her father's name is Shen Chong-yang!

644
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,457
Stop

645
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,332
Go

646
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,540
Loser! Where's the gun?

647
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,665
You were told to steal a gun
from the police station!

648
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,540
Look! It's money!

649
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,207
Take it all!

650
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,374
Loser..

651
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:26,832
Master, you're back

652
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,457
Master..

653
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,290
Mr. Chen?

654
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,249
There's a change of plans for tomorrow

655
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,624
We need a decoy to ensure..

656
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,124
the safety of Dr. Sun

657
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,749
You want to use our people as bait?

658
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,290
We're dealing with an invisible army!

659
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,165
It's the only way to keep Dr. Sun safe!

660
01:12:24,416 --> 01:12:26,457
No, that's out of the question!

661
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,332
Dr. Sun hasn't been home in ages!

662
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:31,249
But he's sacrificing his one chance..

663
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,082
to see his ailing mother!

664
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:34,915
Revolution is not just
about spending money..

665
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,707
printing newspapers
and distributing pamphlets

666
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,499
Li Yu-tang!

667
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,499
Revolution is about blood..

668
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:46,249
and sacrifice!

669
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,040
Since joining the cause..

670
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:52,082
I've faced death many times!

671
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,124
I can still die at any moment!

672
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:57,457
Revolution is about
sacrificing our generation..

673
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,415
for your son's generations!

674
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,999
Enough!

675
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,249
I'm just a businessman

676
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,290
We're drawing straws..

677
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,582
to determine who
will pose as Dr. Sun..

678
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:45,374
on the last leg of the journey tomorrow

679
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,582
We must stall for one hour..

680
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,499
no matter what!

681
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,540
We need to give..

682
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,707
Dr. Sun time..

683
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:56,665
to meet and organize with..

684
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,707
the thirteen delegates

685
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:01,290
The fate of 400 million countrymen..

686
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:04,499
will be decided in that one hour

687
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,540
Who drew the short straw?

688
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,374
Who?

689
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:42,540
No! It can't be!

690
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:45,082
You shouldn't even be here!

691
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:47,874
Draw again!

692
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:51,707
Why? Because I'm the son of Li Yu-tang?

693
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,332
You don't understand!

694
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:57,749
I promised your father that
you wouldn't get involved!

695
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:01,207
Uncle Chen, this is a
historical turning point

696
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:05,124
The entire nation is involved!
How can I be the exception?

697
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,457
But you're his only son!

698
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,749
Only son?

699
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:10,290
Isn't this exactly
the type of feudal thinking that..

700
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,707
the revolution hopes to change?

701
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:16,082
Aren't we striving to
establish an equal society?

702
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:20,915
I can't sacrifice my life, but they can?

703
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,540
You want them to draw straws again..

704
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,999
because I'm the son of Li Yu-tang

705
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:33,707
How can you justify it to them?

706
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,707
Chong-guang

707
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,707
I..

708
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:57,457
I just can't let this happen..

709
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,332
General, we've got the gun!

710
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,207
Are you clear about the mission?

711
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,540
Yes, sir!

712
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,499
Thank you!

713
01:17:55,833 --> 01:18:00,082
Tomorrow we'll use this
foreigner's invention..

714
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,749
to kill that traitor Sun

715
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:46,332
Xiao-bai, thank you!

716
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,415
Don't stop!

717
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,499
Run!

718
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:33,499
Use the covered walkway!

719
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,499
Grab the sacks of rice!

720
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,332
Tell A-si to get the rickshaw!

721
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:34,624
A-si has left; he said master
wasn't going out today!

722
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:45,415
Who fiddled with my watch?

723
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:28,207
Charge straight ahead! Go!

724
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,040
Go!

725
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:51,124
Hurry!

726
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,165
Go!

727
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,499
Stinky tofu!

728
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,540
Go!

729
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:05,624
Stinky tofu!

730
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:09,332
My name is Wang Fu-ming!

731
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:20,707
Go!

732
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:15,290
Wang Fu-ming, born in ZhengZhou,
Henan, 1878; deceased 1906

733
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,207
A-si!

734
01:29:56,583 --> 01:30:00,915
Young master? Go away!

735
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,540
Come here.. You shouldn't be here!

736
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:06,874
Come here!

737
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,790
I won't let you do this..

738
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,540
What are you saying?

739
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,249
You can't do this

740
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:16,624
Do you know how important this day is?

741
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:20,832
Do you know how much preparation
it took and..

742
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,665
how many lives were sacrificed?!

743
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,040
I don't care

744
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,082
A-si

745
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:29,999
The future of our country..

746
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:34,374
is at stake!

747
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:40,415
I don't care! I can't let
young master do this!

748
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:44,207
It's now 9:59

749
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:47,499
We'll depart at 10:00

750
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:53,540
And then Dr. Sun can leave safely

751
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:56,957
Young master..

752
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:01,707
It's now 9:59 and 30 seconds

753
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:08,749
A-si, will you stay with
me for the final hour?

754
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:18,707
15 seconds to go..

755
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,457
It seems I've waited seventeen years..

756
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:25,707
for this hour!

757
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:31,332
Young master, don't do this, I beg you..

758
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:36,415
55, 56, 57..

759
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,707
58, 59!

760
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,249
Asi, let's go!

761
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,540
Go!

762
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:46,040
Young master..

763
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:19,374
A-si, you told me once that..

764
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,207
Each night when you close
your eyes in bed..

765
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:25,832
you see A-chun

766
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,665
When I close my eyes..

767
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:31,749
I see China's future!

768
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:22,957
They're coming!

769
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:09,165
Stay away!

770
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,999
Father, forgive me!

771
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,332
Yu-tang!

772
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:49,915
Fang Hong, born in Jinghai,
Tientsin, 1890; deceased 1906.

773
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:54,082
You, out in front, don't move!

774
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:56,540
Step out of the carriages! Αll of you!

775
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:57,415
Stay put!

776
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,665
We were only passing through..

777
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,499
Don't move!

778
01:36:01,791 --> 01:36:02,624
Were you involved?

779
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:03,374
But it has nothing to do with us!

780
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,207
We were heading that way..

781
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,165
Nobody moves!

782
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:07,874
You two may go!

783
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:09,749
But this is a serious matter!

784
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:10,290
We can leave yet

785
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,165
You're relieved of duty!

786
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,790
We should wait for orders..

787
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:54,624
Where did you find this man?

788
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:56,624
He's sabotaging our mission!

789
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,457
Get him!

790
01:37:04,333 --> 01:37:06,124
You idiot!

791
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:11,457
Are you trying to start a rebellion here?

792
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,790
This is Hong Kong

793
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,124
A colony of the Great British Empire!

794
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:18,040
Round them up!

795
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:36,165
Li Yu-tang

796
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:39,957
You practically own Hong Kong

797
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:44,290
But you've never had a police escort..

798
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:46,124
have you?

799
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:49,874
Here's your chance

800
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:56,290
Move!

801
01:37:58,625 --> 01:37:59,957
Li Yu-tang

802
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:02,665
Move!

803
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:06,165
Let's go!

804
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,415
Yu-tang

805
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:43,874
In 5 minutes, there will be no police
in the streets of Hong Kong

806
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:46,790
Our superiors have ordered
all of us to retreat

807
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:51,665
He said that China's affairs
are to be resolved by the Chinese

808
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:56,290
I'll take you as far as I can
on the last part of your journey!

809
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:00,290
Go!

810
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:51,290
The beggar! The beggar's here!

811
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:58,499
Run!

812
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:06,915
Get up there! Hurry!

813
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:52,457
We'll go upstair to meet with Mrs. Sun!

814
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:55,040
We must stall for another 15 minutes!

815
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:17,332
How old are you?

816
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:19,915
Seventeen

817
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,540
How are your parents?

818
01:49:26,458 --> 01:49:28,374
My mother is dead

819
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:30,999
My father is nearly sixty

820
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:46,624
I must thank you on behalf of my son

821
01:49:46,916 --> 01:49:48,790
I must also thank your father

822
01:52:18,083 --> 01:52:20,332
Farewell!

823
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:56,290
Use the tunnel!

824
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:55,249
Liu Yu-bai, born in Yangzhou,
Jiangsu, 1871 ; deceased 1906

825
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,832
Get in!

826
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:28,749
Chong-guang!

827
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:34,249
Go!

828
01:56:27,541 --> 01:56:32,082
Take this to Nianci..

829
01:56:43,375 --> 01:56:51,957
Go.. just go..

830
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:56,540
Go!

831
01:58:27,208 --> 01:58:32,540
Shen Chong-yang, place and date of
birth unknown; deceased 1906

832
01:58:32,958 --> 01:58:36,832
Our main targets are Guangdong,
Guangxi and Yunnan

833
01:58:37,166 --> 01:58:41,540
We'll start rebellions in ChaoZhou
and HuiZhou at the same time

834
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:44,624
Meanwhile, Guangdong and Guangxi..

835
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:46,874
will join in to thin
out their forces..

836
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:08,790
Go back!

837
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:12,665
Bao-shi, take my place!

838
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,374
Go back!

839
02:00:53,833 --> 02:00:55,165
Chong-guang..

840
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:02,332
Go!

841
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:08,457
Sit tight!

842
02:01:32,916 --> 02:01:40,540
Let go!

843
02:02:21,083 --> 02:02:22,415
You asked for it!

844
02:02:55,708 --> 02:03:01,707
Deng Si-di, born in Xiangshan,
Guangdong, 1884; deceased 1906

845
02:03:09,375 --> 02:03:10,915
Ten years ago..

846
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:14,499
Qu-yun and I discussed "the revolution"

847
02:03:14,833 --> 02:03:16,207
I said:

848
02:03:16,416 --> 02:03:20,665
revolution will bring prosperity to
400 million countrymen and put an end..

849
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:23,124
to hunger and poverty

850
02:03:24,041 --> 02:03:25,665
Ten years have passed

851
02:03:25,916 --> 02:03:28,499
I saw many comrades sacrifice their lives

852
02:03:28,833 --> 02:03:31,332
My exile ended; here I am again

853
02:03:32,125 --> 02:03:36,540
"Revolution" no longer has
the same meaning for me

854
02:03:37,458 --> 02:03:40,249
Today if you asked me,
"What is revolution?"

855
02:03:41,666 --> 02:03:43,290
I would say:

856
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:47,040
A nation cannot progress
without sacrifice

857
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:50,582
The road to modernization
is paved with blood

858
02:03:51,291 --> 02:03:52,915
And that blood..

859
02:03:54,041 --> 02:03:56,207
is called revolution

860
02:04:07,875 --> 02:04:10,374
Sun is indebted

861
02:04:56,416 --> 02:04:59,790
By imperial decree,
execute Sun the traitor!

862
02:05:00,666 --> 02:05:02,040
Yan Xiaoguo..

863
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:13,832
Don't do it!

864
02:05:14,875 --> 02:05:17,999
It's all over!

865
02:05:19,416 --> 02:05:20,707
Sun Wen is gone!

866
02:05:20,916 --> 02:05:23,415
Death to the traitor!
Long live the empire!

867
02:05:25,666 --> 02:05:27,457
Sun Wen has already left!

868
02:05:28,083 --> 02:05:31,582
Death to the traitor!
Long live the empire!

869
02:05:58,583 --> 02:06:03,124
Chong-guang! Run!

870
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:12,749
No!

871
02:06:12,916 --> 02:06:14,957
Chong-guang!

872
02:07:10,125 --> 02:07:14,832
He's not Sun Wen!

873
02:07:27,583 --> 02:07:31,540
Yan Xiaoguo! He's not Sun Wen!

874
02:07:42,458 --> 02:07:45,749
He's not Sun Wen!

875
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:48,707
No!

876
02:07:51,125 --> 02:07:54,165
Chong-guang!

877
02:07:58,583 --> 02:08:00,374
Yan Xiaguo!

878
02:08:14,833 --> 02:08:19,790
Your student has fulfilled his duty
to his country!

879
02:09:28,333 --> 02:09:30,082
I told you..

880
02:09:31,333 --> 02:09:33,999
stay home for a few days

881
02:09:35,333 --> 02:09:37,999
Why didn't you listen..

882
02:10:45,458 --> 02:10:52,624

the success of the "Xinhai Revolution"..

that finally toppled the Qing Dynasty
