Password accepted.

8
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:57,667
Lisa, I'm for real.
Are you?

9
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,900
There's a price to pay.

10
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,900
Close and send.

11
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,733
Jesus.

12
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,067
Didn't mean to scare you.

13
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,667
That's OK.
Um, well, you here for...

14
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,633
A room.
I have a reservation.

15
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,433
OK. Well, let's go
to the office.

16
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,633
Your girlfriend?

17
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,367
Uh... No, no.
She's just a guest.

18
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,833
Nice place you got here.

19
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:14,500
Thank you.
I do my best.

20
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,567
Go in the other door over there.

21
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
So, uh...

22
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,833
How long you here?

23
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,333
Passing through.

24
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:32,800
OK. Miss...

25
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,667
Ms.

26
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,567
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Ms. Smith, right?

27
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,333
Yeah. Well, um...

28
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,033
I'm J.T. Welcome to
the Lone Star Motel.

29
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,733
And if I can do anything
for you, just, uh...

30
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,200
Hi.
The key.

31
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,533
Oh, yes.
You are number seven.

32
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,333
Lucky seven.

33
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,833
And is that your car?
'Cause if that's your car,

34
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,833
you can just, uh... You can
leave it right there.

35
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:04,067
Don't touch it.
Don't go anywhere near it.

36
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,833
Sorry. Did I
interrupt something?

37
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:14,567
Oh, no, no. She was
just checking in.

38
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,633
Hey, I was wondering
if y'all had some magazines.

39
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,633
What kind of magazines
you looking for?

40
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:25,000
You know, like Cosmo or Vogue or, you
know, like, some fashion magazines.

41
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,500
'Cause I'm going
to be a model, and

42
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,900
I need to keep up
with the latest trends.

43
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,333
You're going to be a model?

44
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,667
Yeah.

45
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,833
Wow. Yeah, you could be a model.

46
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,567
Yeah.
I think so.

47
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,833
I'm Tanya.

48
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,300
- I'm J.T.
- J.T.!

49
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,633
Where the hell did you put
that Crescent wrench?

50
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,700
Now, how am I
supposed to fix the...

51
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,500
I'll see you later,
J.T.

52
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,300
Anytime.

53
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,500
What was that for?

54
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,867
That's a warning.
Where's the wrench?

55
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,033
It's on top of the file cabinet.

56
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,900
Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,067
I don't know.

58
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,833
I'm not too sure about this.

59
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,000
Well...

60
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,567
Who's that?

61
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,500
Tanya.

62
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,800
You boning her?

63
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,333
Not yet, I'm not.

64
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,167
But you're planning on it?

65
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,733
You couldn't get the Beamer?

66
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,567
I hate the Hyundai.

67
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,567
Well, it's more than you've got.

68
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
She looks trashy.

69
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,333
I know.
I love that.

70
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,700
Sorry.
Asshole!

71
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,033
Jerk. Hey, hey!
Watch it, fag boy.

72
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,867
Oh, my god. I hate
this fucking town.

73
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,033
What? What did you just say?

74
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,833
Did you say that you
wanted to suck his cock?

75
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,967
Get off me!

76
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,567
I can help with that.
Come here. Come here.

77
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
Get off!

78
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,033
Put him on his knees!

79
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,867
Want to give a little suck
in front of us all, huh?

80
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,700
Save your boyfriend!
Come on, James!

81
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:45,033
Save your boyfriend!
Save your boyfriend!

82
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,833
Come here, you little shit!

83
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,500
I know where you live, man!

84
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,500
Stupid fuck! I can't believe
that cross-breeding...

85
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,000
Just drink your beer.
Relax.

86
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,133
Fucking asshole.

87
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,667
Don't you want to
just fucking kill him?

88
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,167
Yeah. Cut his fucking dick off?

89
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,500
I absolutely would love
to do that.

90
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,567
I'd love to shove it
right down his throat.

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,967
But you know what? It isn't
going to do any good.

92
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,533
What are you talking about?

93
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,367
I'm talking about wherever I
go, for the rest of my life,

94
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,467
I'm going to run
into redneck Joey

95
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,167
at the 7-Eleven, at the
Wal-Mart, at the K...

96
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,533
I know you're not
planning on spending

97
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,067
the rest of your life here.

98
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,500
I mean, that's insane.
We're getting out of here.

99
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,167
Who's going to run the motel?

100
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,133
Have your father hire someone.

101
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,367
We're getting out of here.

102
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,700
Yeah, maybe you are.

103
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,500
You are, too.

104
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,167
I don't think so.

105
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm not quite sure
what goes on over there.

106
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,967
Me, neither.

107
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,633
It must be a party or something.

108
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,633
You know, I bet the woman next
door, she gets pissed off.

109
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,867
What woman? What woman?

110
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,967
Well, there's some chick
in number seven.

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,633
She drives a cutlass.

112
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,133
Nice car.
Yeah.

113
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,867
Very nice car.

114
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,833
Oh, god. Oh, god.

115
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,533
I'm too drunk
to talk to anybody.

116
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,833
That's OK. You don't
have to say a word.

117
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,700
Hi.
How you doing?

118
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,300
What are you boys doing?

119
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,333
Well, uh, we're hanging,
having a good time.

120
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,000
We're going
to go skinny dipping.

121
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,300
Yeah. Y'all are drunk.

122
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,100
A little drunk, yeah.

123
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,700
You got any beer left?

124
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,700
I got this one.
You can have it.

125
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,500
Thanks.
Uh-huh.

126
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:32,133
Me and James were, uh...
Were brawling earlier

127
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,967
with this big crowd of guys.
Uh-huh.

128
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,967
Yeah.
They were all...

129
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
Cowboy boots and...

130
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,833
yeah. Tough guys.
Oh, yeah.

131
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,000
I like tough guys.

132
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,333
Well, I like naked women.

133
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,367
How sweet.

134
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,733
You want to go swimming?

135
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,000
I would love to,

136
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,367
but there's
no lifeguard on duty.

137
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,467
Well, that's not a problem,

138
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,833
because I can save you.

139
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:56,333
Do you think you could?

140
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,000
Absolutely.

141
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:02,033
See, I read this manual
and I learned how to do

142
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,567
mouth-to-mouth and
that heart-pumping thing.

143
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,033
Heart-pumping thing?

144
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:12,133
Yeah. That's right.

145
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,867
Yeah, I feel safe now.

146
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300
You're really scared?

147
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,033
Not about drowning.

148
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,200
Listen...

149
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,200
I'll make you a deal.

150
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,000
Wait.
What are you doing?

151
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,833
Well, I'm getting naked,
you're getting naked,

152
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:44,500
and then, my friend,
she is getting naked.

153
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,067
Uh, no. That's my cue to leave.

154
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,867
Oh, James. Come on.

155
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,333
Huh?

156
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,533
OK. Go.

157
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,967
I'm going. I'm going.

158
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,667
I just ain't never seen a
model get naked before.

159
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,967
Me, neither.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,333
I'm talking about you.

161
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,767
Oh.

162
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,967
OK. Go.

163
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's go.
I'm going. I'm going.

164
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know why
you're sitting down,

165
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,967
'cause you're going in,
like, 2.2,

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
you know what I'm saying?

167
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,567
All right.

168
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,233
Right. I know.

169
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,033
I know you know.

170
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,167
Nice.

171
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,067
Yeah.

172
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,400
You have a great body.

173
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:36,200
Thank you.

174
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,367
For a farm boy.

175
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,333
OK. Let's see it.
Let's do it.

176
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,333
OK. Go.
All or nothing.

177
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,333
We're playing a game here.
We're having fun.

178
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,333
Right.
All or nothing.

179
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,100
Or nothing.

180
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,000
You are brave.

181
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,567
Thank you.

182
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,067
It's your turn.

183
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,233
To what?

184
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:18,333
To come in the pool.
Come on.

185
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,533
Please.
It's not fair, really.

186
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm not very fair.

187
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,100
Seriously. Please,
will you get in the pool?

188
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,733
Come on.

189
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,000
I need some beauty in my life.

190
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,700
Tanya, honey?

191
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,200
Tanya?

192
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,000
Tanya?

193
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,200
Whoo! All right!

194
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,533
Was it worth it?

195
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,533
Absolutely.
100% worth it.

196
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,033
100%?
Uh-huh.

197
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,200
Absolutely.

198
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,167
Whoo!

199
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,367
Whoo!

200
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,000
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

201
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,067
- J.T. Hello!
- Hi!

202
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
Look who it is, hey!

203
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,167
Hey!
Come on in!

204
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,367
Great.

205
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,167
Party town.

206
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,833
♪ This world
is not my home ♪

207
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,133
♪ This world
is not my home ♪

208
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,800
♪ This world
is not my home... ♪

209
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,033
Tanya.

210
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,067
Tanya, honey, I'm leaving.

211
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,567
Tanya. You up?

212
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,500
Tanya!

213
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,967
Morning, Tanya.

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,167
Tanya. Honey,
what's wrong?

215
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,067
Tanya, what's wrong?

216
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,867
Tanya.

217
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,500
Tanya, wake up!

218
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,633
Jesus. Drunk?

219
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,800
Daddy, go away. I don't
have any clothes on.

220
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,833
So fucking what? You
scared the shit out of me.

221
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,967
Go away.

222
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,800
Come on.

223
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,300
Pull yourself together
before tonight.

224
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,400
We got more people coming.

225
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:14,067
Daddy, you said we could go to
Paris and I would be a model.

226
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,867
Right.

227
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,967
That's just what
we're going to do.

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,900
A couple more gigs, Paris.
Uh-huh.

229
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,400
Par-ee.

230
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,500
Uh-huh.

231
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:28,567
You have to be 20.
I'm already... 20.

232
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,467
A model? Right.

233
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,933
Daddy's going to make sure
that never happens.

234
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,967
Concentrate.

235
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,967
Clear.

236
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,833
I'm keeping
my clothes on tonight.

237
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:06,333
Yes, me, too. Unless, of
course, she just begs.

238
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,333
Oh. Well, yeah.
Right.

239
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,800
In your dreams.

240
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,800
You know? I think that
I'm going to go get her.

241
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,500
But I mean... why don't
we just, you know,

242
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,767
hang out for a while,
the two of us?

243
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,967
Fine. If you're going
to pout, just go.

244
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,500
I'm not pouting at all.

245
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,967
Just go. Well, that's
what I'm doing, man.

246
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,033
Relax! Lighten up.
Have fun.

247
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,833
Tanya?

248
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:44,967
Hi.
Hello.

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
How you doing?
I'm fine.

250
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,467
Good. Well, um,
you want to come out?

251
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
Can't.
We got some beer.

252
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,600
Thanks. All right.
I'll see you later, OK?

253
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,833
Can I help you, son?

254
00:19:56,867 --> 00:20:00,833
Uh, no. No. I was just seeing
if Tanya wanted to come...

255
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,600
Did you get my little
girl drunk last night?

256
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,967
No.

257
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,633
You know, I'm hoping

258
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,033
you can respect
our right to privacy.

259
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,467
I'd hate to tell
your old man that...

260
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,967
we were leaving this...

261
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,833
really fine hotel for another

262
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,800
'cause you was harassing
my daughter.

263
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,533
Harassing?

264
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,600
Run along, junior.

265
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,133
What was that all about?

266
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,633
Let me tell you something.

267
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,467
I cannot believe that he
just put his hand on me.

268
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,967
I mean, all these fuckers
telling me what to do...

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,300
first, that chick, and now him?

270
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,800
Wait. What chick?

271
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,800
Come on. The chick in number seven.
The one who has the car.

272
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,133
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

273
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,633
Yeah, exactly. Well, first
her, and then this dickhead.

274
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,467
Hey. Fuck you!

275
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
Fuck 'em.

276
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:04,867
Yeah. I mean, fuck 'em.

277
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,300
They don't have
to live here. We do.

278
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,133
Oh, man. Motherfucker.

279
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,500
I mean, this is going to
be mine one day, right?

280
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,467
Oh, yeah. So you're a
prince among thieves.

281
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,800
No. I am a king.

282
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,300
Well, long live the king.

283
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,033
Thank you very much.

284
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:13,000
Hi.
What's that?

285
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,233
Having trouble finding the key?

286
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,500
I don't...

287
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,667
The office key,

288
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,033
the one with
the black rubber on it.

289
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,567
Listen. If you're from the police,
I told them everything...

290
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,067
Why don't we go inside?

291
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,167
After you.
OK. Great.

292
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:27,933
Listen, do you mind if...

293
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,133
Why don't we just go and
come back for her later?

294
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,333
She'll be out in a minute.

295
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,833
You said that a half hour ago.

296
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,433
I know, but if we just give
her a couple more minutes...

297
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,833
You're totally stuck
on her, huh?

298
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,900
No.

299
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,000
Just because you saw her naked?

300
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, just because
I saw her naked.

301
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:45,000
I mean, I got a thing
for a beautiful girl

302
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,800
who gets naked with me.

303
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,500
Don't you ever get
a hard-on for a girl?

304
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,500
Sure.
Yeah. Sure.

305
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,967
Wait, what is that
supposed to mean?

306
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh, forget it.
Come on. We'll go...

307
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,000
No, I'm serious.
No, come on. We'll...

308
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,000
No, I'm serious.
I mean, just because

309
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,333
I care about my hair
and my clothes...

310
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,667
Forget it.
I said that I'm sorry.

311
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,233
No. As a matter
of fact, you didn't.

312
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,400
Well, what do you want me to do?

313
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,033
Well, I actually
want you to say it.

314
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,867
Look at this. Oh, my god.
I love this car.

315
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,333
What's the problem?

316
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,067
I don't know.
It won't start.

317
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,900
Are you kidding me?

318
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,167
This is ridiculous.

319
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,167
We're stranded here
on a Friday night?

320
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,533
Damn it! Fuck.

321
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,900
Oh, my gosh.
Wait a minute.

322
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,333
Wait, you're not thinking...

323
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,000
Just do me a favor and
don't... Don't touch the car.

324
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,767
Well, then,
how are we going to get it?

325
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,467
Oh, man, is she stacked!

326
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,400
All right.
This is perfect.

327
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,367
Look. She's showering.
You get up there.

328
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,633
No!

329
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:14,000
No, you're going
to keep an eye out.

330
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:17,567
I can't believe that you drilled
a hole to spy on people.

331
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,500
Well, it's a boring fucking town.
What can I say?

332
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,200
Get out!
Get out!

333
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,767
Get out!

334
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:23,700
Man, muffled: Hey!
What the fuck is this?

335
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:28,967
Fucking blackmail scheme?

336
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,667
You middle-aged punk!

337
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,367
Yeah!

338
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,067
Hey!
Hey, Tanya.

339
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,700
- OK. Come on. Go!
- Let's go. Let's go.

340
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,833
Tanya, come on.
Is that your dad?

341
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,467
Is she coming? Yeah.
Sure, she's coming.

342
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,567
He's over there.

343
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,133
Come on. I don't think
this is a good idea.

344
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,500
No, it's a very good idea.
I don't have any shoes.

345
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:48,967
That's OK. We're going
to take care of everything.

346
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,667
She's going to know about this.

347
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,667
Shh. No, she's not going to know.
We're going to have the car back.

348
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,033
Now, listen. Don't touch the car,
'cause I'm going to hit the alarm.

349
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:55,833
- This is your car?
- Yes, it is my car...

350
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,300
Not exactly.
For tonight, it is.

351
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,067
Look, go hit neutral.
Go hit neutral.

352
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,667
We're going to push the car
away from the building...

353
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,867
Are you serious?
So no one hears it.

354
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,133
OK. Here we go. Shh.

355
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,533
Hit it in neutral.
Hit it in neutral.

356
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:09,200
Excellent.
Excellent. OK.

357
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,133
Push. Push.

358
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:15,700
Push. Push. Push. Push.
Push. Push.

359
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,333
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Get in!

360
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,533
Oh! God damn it!

361
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,500
Where's my car?
Where's my car?

362
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,633
Where's my fucking car?

363
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,500
Shit!

364
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,667
Over-fucking-confident

I have to say,

373
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:53,300
I'm getting quite fond of
the little machine myself.

374
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,667
It's too bad you can't keep it.

375
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,667
I know. It's just
not a chick's car.

376
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,133
You know what I'm saying?

377
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,467
What are you talking about?

378
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,967
Well, you know, this car...

379
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,533
it's just built for a man,
like a man.

380
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,800
It is a man's machine.

381
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,367
Well, maybe it belongs
to her husband.

382
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,533
You should...
Oh, yeah.

383
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:12,200
You shouldn't be driving
it either, then.

384
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,800
I'm going to check
the glove compartment.

385
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,833
Assneck.

386
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:17,167
What's an assneck?

387
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Total assneck. You don't even
know what an assneck is?

388
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,400
No. What's an assneck?

389
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:24,333
Nothing. Hey, give me
the keys to the trunk.

390
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm going to open it.

391
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,000
What's an assneck?

392
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,000
No. Not "what's
an assneck?"

393
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,667
"Where's
an assneck?"

394
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,067
Exactly.
Where's your assneck?

395
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,367
You want to know
where my assneck is?

396
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,233
Well, I'm going
to guess on my ass.

397
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:42,333
Nope.

398
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,967
The ass part of your ass?

399
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,467
Uh, yeah.

400
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,300
Could you be more specific?

401
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,033
J.T.?

402
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,533
What do you think that is?

403
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,300
I don't know, but it stinks.

404
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,800
Yeah, it does.

405
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,633
OK. Let me explain it
to you.

406
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,800
Your assneck...
You guys are so stupid...

407
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,667
is between your
scrotum and your...

408
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,567
That's Dr. Brewer.

409
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Oh, my god.

410
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,667
Oh, my god.

411
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,833
Do you think she killed him?

412
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,100
Somebody put bullet
holes in his head.

413
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,667
This is so beautiful.

414
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,233
I swear to god. This means
that I can keep the car.

415
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:33,833
I can't believe it.

416
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

417
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,233
Absolutely! Because
if she killed him,

418
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,500
then she's not going
to report the car stolen!

419
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,167
Do you see?
Am I right?

420
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,500
If she killed him,

421
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,933
she would have no
problem killing you.

422
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,167
You know what? I'm so not
worried about that, because...

423
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,133
Oh, my god.
And this so beautiful.

424
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,467
But she doesn't know
I have the car.

425
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,167
I'm just some kid, like,
who gave her a key

426
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,667
and, you know, took a
piece of paper from her.

427
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,833
I love this.

428
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,400
That's true.
No! There's...

429
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,633
That's a good point.

430
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,667
There's no fucking way
we're keeping this car.

431
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,033
We have to call the cops.

432
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,500
You know what? It's a
fucking dead body.

433
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,067
You can't leave it in the trunk.

434
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,233
Um...

435
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,067
Yeah, that is a problem.

436
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,900
That is
the problem, J.T.!

437
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,233
I can't even believe
we're discussing this.

438
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:21,800
You put it in the lake.

439
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,567
Yeah. I was thinking that.
That's a good idea.

440
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,500
We can weight it down
with something.

441
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:28,233
We'll probably find
some rocks or something.

442
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,733
This woman killed this man!

443
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,167
That happens to be
against the law!

444
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,067
Oh, you're such an assneck!

445
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,900
Total assneck!
Yeah, right?

446
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,567
Here. Help me...
Help me get him out.

447
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,900
Help me get him out.

448
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:42,667
This is great.

449
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,800
See it?
Don't spill my beer.

450
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,133
I'm begging you, as a
friend, not to do this.

451
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,300
One, two, three.

452
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:56,967
It's totally heavy.

453
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Will you listen
to me for a second?

454
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:01,233
All right?
This is my only chance.

455
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,867
I'm never going to own a car,

456
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,000
not even a shitty one
like your Hyundai.

457
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,400
We do not have the money.

458
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,700
We're never going to have the money.
Do you understand?

459
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,533
This is not the way.

460
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,500
There are other ways
to get a fucking car.

461
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Well, this is my only shot
and I have to take it.

462
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:18,367
It's wrong!

463
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
It's not like we killed him.

464
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,167
Shut up.

465
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,800
We're helping. She's not
going to get away now.

466
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,167
Hell, where's she going
to go without her car?

467
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,533
Exactly.

468
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:32,067
I can't even believe that
we're having this discussion.

469
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,900
Something's leaking.

470
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,100
Oh. Ugh.

471
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,533
Oh, my god.

472
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,367
Oh, god.

473
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,433
Put it back.

474
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,167
Will you help me bring it
into the lake, please?

475
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,667
No. I said no.

476
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,933
Please, James?

477
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:03,533
Just come over here and help
me bring it into the lake.

478
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,367
Fuck you, J.T.

479
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:19,200
Where are you going?
I'm going home.

480
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:29,867
All right.
Let's hurry.

481
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,167
You ready?

482
00:33:56,033 --> 00:34:00,500
We should put some rocks in
the thing to weigh it down.

483
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,533
Yeah.

484
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,833
Close his eyes. Jesus.

485
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,167
All right.

486
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,067
All righty.

487
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,500
Is that it?

488
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,067
Yeah.

489
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,667
Want to go for a swim?

490
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
Not really.

491
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,167
Where's James?

492
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,833
He went up, uh...

493
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,567
Up there.

494
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,733
Should we go get him?

495
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,867
Probably thinks
he can walk home.

496
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,533
Shit.

497
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,667
I cannot believe this.
Look at this!

498
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,233
I haven't even had
the car a day,

499
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,333
and already, I fuck it up.
Come on!

500
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,733
I'm cold.

501
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,533
Go.

502
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,733
Hey, big boy.
You want a ride?

503
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,067
You're in my seat.

504
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,900
I'll move.

505
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:49,733
So did you finish?

506
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,867
Are you coming or not?

507
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,500
I wasn't there, all right?

508
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,267
All right.

509
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,400
It's wet.

510
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,833
It will be fine.

511
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,300
What did we do, man?

512
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,467
We didn't do anything.

513
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,300
Just don't think about it.

514
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,733
It's better that way.

515
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,833
Hey, faggot.

516
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:44,567
Where did a couple of
pole-smokers like yourselves

517
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,233
get a fine-lookin'
piece of ass like that?

518
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,767
I didn't know you were
looking at my ass, Joey.

519
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:53,833
What?

520
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:55,200
What did you say, you little...

521
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,667
Pull over!

522
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,367
Pull over, you little fuck!

523
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,400
Pull over! Hey!

524
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:15,733
Hey, pull over,
you little ass licker! Huh?

525
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,900
Pull over so I can fuck
your girlfriend!

526
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,567
Yeah, fuck your girlfriend!

527
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,000
Pull over.

528
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:26,400
I don't think that's
such a good idea...

529
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,567
Pull over. Let's give
him what he wants.

530
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,067
If they try to drive
off, block them.

531
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,867
Yeah.

532
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,300
Well, well, well.

533
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,533
Where did
a couple of fags like you

534
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:54,367
get a fine-looking machine
like this? Huh?

535
00:38:57,933 --> 00:39:00,233
Is there a problem, huh?

536
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:01,767
Problem?

537
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:16,867
Don't worry.

538
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,367
You and your lover there, you
can have a little fun later on,

539
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,667
screwing in a new light bulb.

540
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,800
You swing a pretty mean bat.

541
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,367
Whoo-ee! Ha ha!

542
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,200
How did you get all wet?

543
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:44,667
You want to know?

544
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,500
Can I hold your bat?

545
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,900
Uh, I don't, uh...

546
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,700
Can I hold it in my mouth?

547
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:00,000
You fucking pig!

548
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,500
You had to call me faggot?

549
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,500
That's right, mother!
Last out! Aah!

550
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,533
Fag! It's a fucking faggot
kicking your fucking ass!

551
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:18,200
You stupid shit! Son of a bitch!
Stupid shit!

552
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:20,500
Piece of dumb ass! Ugh!

553
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:21,533
Freakin' hick!

554
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:29,000
Oh, you stupid,
ugly dumb-ass shit-faced...

555
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,833
Let's go.

556
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,467
Where are we going?

557
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,700
I know a hiding place.

558
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:33,133
So, you're really going
to keep the car?

559
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:37,700
Yes. I cannot exactly return
it looking like this.

560
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,533
She'd kill you.

561
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,867
All right.
What next?

562
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,967
I don't know. Maybe
we should rob a bank,

563
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,633
rape somebody.
I don't know.

564
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,367
Shut the fuck up.

565
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,533
It's a long walk back.
Let's go.

566
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,467
I'm this way.

567
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,200
See you later.

568
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,500
Hey. Shouldn't we kiss
or something?

569
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,600
Some other time.

570
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, sir, what do we got?

571
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:41,333
Well, it's him, all right.
He's real goddamn dead.

572
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:42,833
Yeah.

573
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:43,833
You been by the house?

574
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:45,233
Yeah.

575
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:47,067
They're still taking photos.

576
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:52,067
It's all mixed-up,
you know?

577
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,567
Who are they?
Are those the guys...

578
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, those are
the guys that found him.

579
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,333
Found him. Yeah.
They were fishing, and, uh...

580
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,667
He was floating near the shore.

581
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,400
They thought he was an alligator.
They were going to shoot him.

582
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,733
Yeah. This is all
screwy, you know.

583
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,733
This is all screwy, you know.

584
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,900
Yeah. What's screwy
about it is...

585
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,333
There's something screwy?

586
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:15,667
Have you been to the house?

587
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,733
Well, yeah.

588
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,367
Well, it's pretty neat
in there, right?

589
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,367
And then you come here, and
it's all out in the open...

590
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,533
A floater, everything. The victim
is floating right here, you know.

591
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,900
It looks like two people did it.

592
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:31,067
It looks like, uh, one was a
pro and the other an idiot.

593
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,233
Well, you know many professional
killers working in town?

594
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:37,333
'Cause I don't. No, this was
done by somebody's boyfriend,

595
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,333
somebody's husband,

596
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:41,167
one of the women that got him indicted.
I don't know.

597
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,500
Got it.

598
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:46,167
Yeah. This guy was assaulting
his female patients.

599
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,667
Eight of them banded together
and got him indicted.

600
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,367
You seen the paper?
No.

601
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,500
Hey, Neal, quit fuckin' around.

602
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:56,300
Come here, give me that paper.

603
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,133
Hmm.

604
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:10,533
Says here you have
him in custody.

605
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,833
Well, I guess I do now.

606
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,800
You got a problem.

607
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,033
Yeah, no shit.

608
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,300
But I knew the guy,

609
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,833
he was going to
turn himself in today.

610
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:22,033
He didn't want a big,
uh, production

611
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:25,833
with reporters and
handcuffs and everything.

612
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,167
I screwed up.

613
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,800
Yeah.
You killed him.

614
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,400
Hey, don't even joke about that.

615
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:32,833
My wife's been crying ever since
she found out he was missing,

616
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,500
so, uh, I don't even know
what that's about.

617
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,067
But don't scratch me off
your list of suspects.

618
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,833
Hmm. God bless
the women.

619
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,800
Whoever did this was no woman.

620
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,667
Ordinary woman, a housewife,

621
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,833
or anything like that,

622
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:50,167
it was an expert.

623
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,133
Do you think
they're still around?

624
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,667
No.

625
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,900
I think the guy who
dumped them in the lake,

626
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,400
he's still around.

627
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:06,500
Police believe
Dr. Brewer was already dead

628
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:10,167
when he arrived here at the
shores of our own lake Coleman.

629
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,467
And then he was thrown
into the lake

630
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,700
by his killer, or killers.

631
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,000
I spoke with
detective Lopez earlier,

632
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:20,467
and he told me that several
clues found at the scene...

633
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
They dumped the body?

634
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,800
Jesus, what the fuck
is going on?

635
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,033
Who could be that stupid?

636
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:37,800
Stars shine bright on the lone
star motel, this is Arthur.

637
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,700
Oh, hello, James.

638
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:42,200
No, he's out somewheres.

639
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:46,833
Yeah, your car
is still here. Why?

640
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:50,033
No, he is supposed
to be back, but he ain't.

641
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,433
All right,
I'll tell him. Bye.

642
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,667
James just called for you.

643
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,967
He did?

644
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,367
Yeah, he's coming over.
Are you fixing his car?

645
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,667
Yeah.

646
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,533
Seemed awful concerned about it.

647
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,333
Yeah, well, you know how he is.

648
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,700
Yeah? Well, I don't want
to know how he is, J.T.

649
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,567
Now get in there.

650
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,833
Dad?
Yeah?

651
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:18,033
Did you clean up number seven?

652
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,367
No.

653
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,233
The lady said
not to be disturbed.

654
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:22,733
She did?

655
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah.

656
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:26,733
Did she say anything else?

657
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,067
Yeah.

658
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,533
What else?

659
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,067
She wants to marry me.

660
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,133
No, really.

661
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:36,000
Really.

662
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:45,133
Hey.

663
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,633
Yeah.

664
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,900
What you got?

665
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:49,567
Tell you what we got.

666
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,500
We got paint chip over here.

667
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:54,533
From a tree,
could be our vehicle.

668
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:58,233
Um, we got footprints,

669
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:00,700
tennis shoes, bare feet.

670
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:02,467
That's a beach.

671
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,667
So what?
So what, yeah.

672
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,533
We got tire tracks.

673
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,900
It's probably our best lead.

674
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,167
I'm waiting on the make.

675
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,367
Tire tracks?

676
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,500
Our best lead is tire tracks?

677
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,800
Well...

678
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,567
Jesus Christ.

679
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,133
Someday you'll grow up
to be a detective like me.

680
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,133
Well, the title "detective"

681
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:26,300
infers that you would be
able to detect something.

682
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,733
That's the best you can do?

683
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:31,233
Neal, give me that list.

684
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:32,800
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

685
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:35,200
We're going to go by
every hotel and motel.

686
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:36,833
Here you go.

687
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:38,167
I don't give a shit what you do.

688
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,333
Just give me something.

689
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:40,733
Yeah.

690
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,500
We'll look for somebody that
looks suspicious, you know?

691
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:45,400
I think this guy is probably

692
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:48,500
a Joe salesman-looking
kind of guy.

693
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,233
Nobody to look at.

694
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:51,500
Oh, Jesus.

695
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:54,067
But, uh, deadly with a gun.

696
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:02,833
Look, we...
We made a mistake.

697
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,367
It's not too late to admit it.

698
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,000
We did some terrible things
last night.

699
00:49:07,033 --> 00:49:09,833
I know. I can't believe I
threw a dead guy in a lake.

700
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,367
We... We can just
go to the cops

701
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,900
and tell them the truth.

702
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,467
And this Brewer guy,
he was a scumbag.

703
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,900
Won't we get arrested?

704
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:17,800
Maybe.

705
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,167
And what about her?

706
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,333
Well, what about her?
Is she still here?

707
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:22,900
Well, I don't know, you know?

708
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:24,333
It's kind of hard to tell.

709
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:25,733
I've been watching, believe me.

710
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,300
You had to sleep.

711
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:29,367
Exactly. So who knows?

712
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,333
You know, all my life
I've lived here,

713
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:36,533
all I wanted was
something different,

714
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:38,467
something...

715
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,067
I don't know.

716
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,067
Something that's mine.

717
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,867
Hi.

718
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,333
How you feeling?

719
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:50,800
Like shit.

720
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:53,167
We were just talking
about last night.

721
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,367
What about it?

722
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,200
About how it's not too late
to do the right thing.

723
00:49:57,233 --> 00:49:58,700
Which would be?

724
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,233
Go to the cops.
Right.

725
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:01,833
Look, it was
a stupid thing to do.

726
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:03,667
It just got out of hand.
Out of hand?

727
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,667
If we just tell our story
and stick together,

728
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,033
everything will be fine.

729
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:09,833
I woke up with the guy's blood
underneath my fingernails.

730
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:11,700
Look, I'm just saying...
You didn't.

731
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,033
Stay cool.

732
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:18,900
Car trouble?

733
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,967
Yep, she's dead as a doornail.

734
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,733
Don't worry, I won't bite.

735
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:24,400
I was just
getting out of the way.

736
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:26,333
Why do you have that off?

737
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:27,533
Um, well, I was just...

738
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:28,700
Put it back on.

739
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,333
Yeah, I was just
about to do that.

740
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:31,833
You sure it's got gas?

741
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:33,300
Yes, ma'am.

742
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,633
Do I look like your mother?

743
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,067
No.

744
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,933
Then don't call me ma'am.

745
00:50:41,067 --> 00:50:43,033
Take it.

746
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,000
Be careful, it's loaded.

747
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,300
I seem to have lost something.

748
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,333
I think you boys
know what it is.

749
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:53,033
I think you know who has it.

750
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:55,067
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

751
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,900
These two help you dump
the body in the lake?

752
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:58,667
No.

753
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,467
Get in the car.

754
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,133
Just bring me the car,
you little weasel,

755
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,000
and I'll let you keep
your pathetic little life.

756
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,500
Fuck you.

757
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:07,967
Ha, what?
You heard me.

758
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,500
You killed Dr. Brewer,
the three of us know it.

759
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,167
I want your car, and I want you

760
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,500
to get the fuck out of here.

761
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:16,667
I practically built that car
with my bare hands.

762
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,667
No redneck teenager...

763
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,133
No, you see, I'm not a teenager.

764
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,167
Shut the fuck up or I'll
tear your tongue out.

765
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,367
I could take that gun from her pretty
little hand right this second,

766
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,233
kill all three of you.

767
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:28,900
One, two, three.

768
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:30,833
Take this Hyundai and disappear.

769
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:32,667
No one would find me

770
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,967
because I don't exist.
But you do.

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,700
Your fingerprints are all
over the inside of that car.

772
00:51:38,733 --> 00:51:40,633
His, too.

773
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,467
Strands of her hair are in the
backseat where you fucked her.

774
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,700
We didn't fuck.

775
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,333
Please, be quiet.

776
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:48,000
Was there blood on your hands
after dumping him in the lake?

777
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:49,500
Probably.

778
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:52,033
Now that blood's
on the steering wheel,

779
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,333
in your room,

780
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:55,633
on your clothes, even.

781
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:58,500
Just a trace and, well,
if I were a cop,

782
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,933
I'd be much
more interested in that

783
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,833
than, say, a weak story

784
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:04,667
about a woman in number seven,
lucky seven,

785
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,067
that no one can find.

786
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,200
Cops.

787
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,167
Oh, god.

788
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,767
Give me the gun.

789
00:52:31,433 --> 00:52:33,000
How y'all doing?

790
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:34,333
Very good.
How you doing?

791
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,467
You J.T.?

792
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,533
Yes, sir.

793
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,667
And what's your name?

794
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,500
Uh, James.
James Wooly.

795
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:43,567
And you?

796
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,400
Tanya Bayer.

797
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:46,833
Ma'am?

798
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:48,433
Smith.

799
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,667
Do you know a Joey Evans?

800
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:55,833
What's so funny?
You know him, J.T.?

801
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:58,167
Yeah, I know Joey.

802
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,633
You see him last night?

803
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,000
Nope.

804
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,000
What about you, James Wooly?

805
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:11,067
No, no, I... I... I didn't
see Joey last night.

806
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,333
That's real peculiar,
'cause, uh,

807
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:15,967
Joey came down to the
station this morning,

808
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,533
he was pretty badly beaten up.

809
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:19,133
Said the three of you did it.

810
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,400
He's got a witness.

811
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:22,900
Says you jumped him
in a parking lot in town.

812
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:27,100
Said you were driving a
black Camaro or trans am.

813
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:31,333
This is the only car I own.

814
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:34,067
Yeah, we just
got it started, too.

815
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,867
Do you own a car?
No.

816
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:40,333
What about you ladies?
You got a car?

817
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,667
You see a car like that around?

818
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,200
I hear little Joey's got
a drinking problem.

819
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,133
Isn't that right, James?

820
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,500
Y-yeah.

821
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,967
Maybe Joey's got my friends here

822
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,667
confused with someone else.

823
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,667
Maybe Joey just
fell down drunk last night

824
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,000
and, uh, hurt himself.

825
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:00,500
Yeah, very possible,

826
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:03,533
'cause we were here all
night long swimming.

827
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:05,833
So is that the story
everybody's going to stick to?

828
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,067
Um...

829
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:12,533
You got something you want
to tell the officer, James?

830
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:16,667
No... No.

831
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,667
Look, we were here last night.

832
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
There were people here
to vouch for us.

833
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, whatever.

834
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:46,633
All right.

835
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:48,367
How you guys doing?

836
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,367
You, uh, you guys go out
to the lake last night?

837
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:56,200
No.
Look, we told you.

838
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:58,067
We were here.
We were swimming.

839
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:02,733
We told your partner.

840
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:05,033
And what's your name?

841
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,500
Smith.

842
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:09,200
Smith?
Yep.

843
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:13,500
Is that first name, last name?

844
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,600
Smith is my last name.

845
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,400
And, um...

846
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,900
You're not from Coleman,
are you?

847
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:24,600
Just passing through.

848
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:29,200
And what's your, um, visit here?

849
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm just visiting
my nephew J.T.

850
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:36,200
Uh-huh.

851
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,733
Oh, you guys are related?
Yep.

852
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:41,333
I got to ask
some questions here.

853
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:46,367
So, um, are you here
on business or pleasure?

854
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,467
Is that an official question?

855
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,167
Well...

856
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,500
I could be...

857
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,033
No, no.

858
00:55:55,067 --> 00:55:59,700
No, it just seems to me
that you're dressed up so...

859
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,067
Elegantly.

860
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,233
You're a 5-star type
of girl.

861
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:06,333
Thank you.

862
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:09,300
All right.
You need help with the car?

863
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,533
Uh, no.

864
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,400
I can get you a tow truck
right away.

865
00:56:12,433 --> 00:56:14,367
No. I think
it's going to be fine.

866
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,200
All right.
All right, guys.

867
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,067
Take care.

868
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,733
Say hello to your dad.

869
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:21,300
Detective.
Yeah?

870
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:24,500
What's your name?
Guadalupe.

871
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:25,800
Guadalupe Lopez, yeah.

872
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,167
Detective Lopez...
Yeah?

873
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,833
Uh, is there a problem
with the lake?

874
00:56:28,867 --> 00:56:30,000
We had a floater.

875
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:31,533
What's that?

876
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:34,367
It's, uh, we had a
dead body at the lake.

877
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,167
Um, here.

878
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,633
You can, um, give me a call.

879
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:44,167
Top number, you can
call 24 hours, OK?

880
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:03,167
So, you're a pack of thugs.

881
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,000
You scare me.

882
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:07,667
You kids go on a crime spree?

883
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,833
How many other people
saw you in my car?

884
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:11,567
It's my car.

885
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,800
J.T.!

886
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:17,633
You're trying to prove
something, aren't you, kid?

887
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,500
Now's not the time.

888
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:22,400
You seen your pop lately?

889
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:24,167
No.

890
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,300
No?

891
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,667
Know where he is right now?

892
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,667
No.
Well, I do.

893
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,300
What about your dad?

894
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,900
What about him?
Do you love him?

895
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:33,333
I... I don't know.

896
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,733
Because after I kill
J.T.'s dad, I'll do yours.

897
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:37,233
Or maybe I should
start with Harold,

898
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:39,833
seeing how he's a pimp.
My dad is not a pimp.

899
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:42,333
And I suppose I could just look
up your name in the phone book.

900
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:44,033
All right.

901
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:46,000
We'll get you the fucking car.

902
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:48,633
I knew I could
count on you, James.

903
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,700
It's fully dark
at 5:30.

904
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,000
Don't bring the car
out until then,

905
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,067
and don't let anyone see you.

906
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,833
In front of my room,
keys and all, 5:45.

907
00:57:56,867 --> 00:58:00,833
If the car's not there,
I start with the families.

908
00:58:00,867 --> 00:58:04,600
And I work
my way in... to you.

909
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,467
That is so great.

910
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,800
This is perfect, we have her
exactly where we want her.

911
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,400
I'm going to fucking
kill you, man!

912
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:18,133
I swear to god!
You got us into this!

913
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:19,467
Now the fucking cops
are after us,

914
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,833
and this bitch
is going to kill us!

915
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,200
Relax, OK?

916
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:24,633
She is not going to fucking
kill anybody, you understand?

917
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,567
You fucking son of a bitch.

918
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,000
All you care about is your
fucking greed and yourself!

919
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:31,500
Well, you know what?

920
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,867
Leave me the fuck out of it
and give her the fucking car.

921
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,900
Son of a bitch!

922
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,400
You think he's upset?

923
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:51,667
A little.

924
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,000
Tanya, let's go.

925
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:55,867
Shit, my dad, with a client.

926
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,967
So?

927
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,333
So... So I gotta work.

928
00:58:58,367 --> 00:58:59,700
What do you mean you gotta work?

929
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:01,933
Just get the car, OK?

930
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:01,867
You are the most beautiful girl
in the world.

931
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,867
What do you want?

932
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,900
I'm sorry, hon.

933
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:18,367
I got a fella here who's
interested in investing.

934
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,967
I thought you could fill him in

935
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,433
on some of the details.

936
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:25,867
Come in.

937
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:36,233
Sit down.

938
01:01:36,267 --> 01:01:39,400
That's OK.
I'd as soon stand.

939
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

940
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,667
You're choking me,
for Christ sake.

941
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,700
What's the matter,
you don't like that?

942
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:50,800
Not very much, no.

943
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,733
Your wife doesn't
do that to you?

944
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:56,633
No, no.

945
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,400
She doesn't choke you?

946
01:01:58,433 --> 01:02:00,333
No.

947
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,833
She doesn't tie you
up and make you beg?

948
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:05,467
No, she doesn't do any of that.

949
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,100
Hmm.

950
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,867
Don't play dumb, daddy.

951
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,233
Maybe you're the one
that does the spanking.

952
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:19,533
Spanking, huh?

953
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,167
Yeah.

954
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,900
Go ahead.

955
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:35,333
Make my day.

956
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,800
Ahh.

957
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,400
No, I...

958
01:02:39,433 --> 01:02:42,533
Go ahead.

959
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:45,033
I can't do that.

960
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,133
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?

961
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:03,667
No, it wasn't so bad.

962
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,833
Yeah, go again.

963
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,400
Harder.

964
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:25,667
Let me hear the proposal.

965
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,167
Well, the 5,000 level,

966
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,233
the return is slow.

967
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,833
At 10,000 level, you get
your money back quicker.

968
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:43,567
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

969
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,000
You're a whore, aren't you?

970
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,533
You're going to be
my little whore.

971
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,100
Jesus.

972
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,867
I heard about you
from the boys in town.

973
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,000
I couldn't wait to meet you.

974
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:31,867
Ah, you're just about
to meet Mr. Wiggle!

975
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:09,167
Ah.

976
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:22,700
Don't you want to meet
Mr. Wiggle?

977
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:26,033
Say hello to Mr. Wiggle
or he won't come out!

978
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:27,500
Don't you want to meet
Mr. Wiggle?

979
01:05:27,533 --> 01:05:28,667
No!

980
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,067
Oh, I'm going to fill
that wet, screaming mouth!

981
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,000
I'm going to stuff
your mouth full!

982
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,233
Sorry to interrupt,

983
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:39,333
but I thought I heard
the word "no," right?

984
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:41,233
Let me leave!
I'll leave!

985
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:42,700
You wish!

986
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:43,900
Oh, goddamn!

987
01:05:43,933 --> 01:05:45,033
Kill him.

988
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,633
I can't. I can't.

989
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,833
Go ahead, I got him.

990
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,000
Put the bell to this temple.

991
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:50,567
I don't know.

992
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:54,333
What about the cops?

993
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,000
I'll take care of you.

994
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:01,167
Do it!

995
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,800
No! Don't do it!
Don't do it!

996
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,400
Ta da!

997
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:07,500
I got kids and a wife!

998
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:10,000
This is a private party.
You're next.

999
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,500
What the...

1000
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:13,200
Hey!

1001
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:14,633
Hey, what's going on in there?

1002
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,200
Blackmail's hard on a girl, huh?

1003
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,000
If I kill him, will you
keep your promise?

1004
01:06:21,033 --> 01:06:22,133
What promise was that?

1005
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:23,667
To take care of me.

1006
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,033
Take care of yourself, sister.

1007
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,467
I'll do whatever you want!

1008
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,933
Take a good look
while I clean up.

1009
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:54,000
Get a good look?

1010
01:06:54,033 --> 01:06:56,467
Uh-huh.

1011
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,367
There you are.

1012
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,900
Did you notice
who's not in the picture?

1013
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,367
You.

1014
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,400
That's right.

1015
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:12,300
What are you doing?

1016
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,400
Shut up!

1017
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:14,733
I've seen what you
do for a living,

1018
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:17,233
familiarize yourself with
what I do for a living.

1019
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,200
I want my car.

1020
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,533
Oh, my god.

1021
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,200
What are we going to do?

1022
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,533
She's not going to let us go.

1023
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:02,833
What are you doing?

1024
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,033
J.T.!

1025
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:02,567
J.T.!

1026
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:06,533
J.T. Ain't here, James.

1027
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:07,567
Well, do you know where he is?

1028
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,800
I just come in.

1029
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,367
I ain't seen
hide nor hair of him.

1030
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,000
He's supposed to be watching
things around here, but...

1031
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:13,733
Yeah, thanks.

1032
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,333
What?
He's taken it.

1033
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:22,500
What?

1034
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,167
J.T., he's taken
the fucking car.

1035
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,233
Shit. Where is it?

1036
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:27,367
I don't know!
If I knew, I wouldn't...

1037
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,233
Shh, shh, shh!
What time is it?

1038
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:30,667
It's 5:00.

1039
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,200
We're going to die in 45
minutes, I swear to god.

1040
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:36,100
OK, all right, maybe
he's bringing it here.

1041
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:39,900
Maybe?

1042
01:09:39,933 --> 01:09:41,533
Maybe?!

1043
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:42,700
Shh.

1044
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:44,933
Are you comfortable with maybe?

1045
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,333
Oh, what the...

1046
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:54,333
Look what you started.

1047
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,267
Ugh.

1048
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:16,100
Do you know who
that is in there?

1049
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,167
Mr. Wiggle?

1050
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,333
That's the fucking mayor.

1051
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:26,267
Well, not quite.

1052
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:30,067
You don't understand.

1053
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,900
She's going to kill us.

1054
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,300
No, she's not going to kill us.

1055
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:34,700
If we don't bring her that car.

1056
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:36,567
No, she is not going to kill us.

1057
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,600
I don't care what you do, man.

1058
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:42,400
But you better do it.

1059
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,167
I will.

1060
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,233
You have got to get
the fucking car!

1061
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:48,733
I will.

1062
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:52,367
I will not die
in this fleabag motel.

1063
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,500
Come in.

1064
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,500
You're not going to give me
a gun again, are you?

1065
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:34,000
You want the gun?

1066
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:37,167
Take the gun.
Take the gun.

1067
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:41,167
I'm sorry.
That was mean.

1068
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,033
I'm sorry.
Take the gun.

1069
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,167
Take the gun.
Take it.

1070
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:52,067
He's not bringing
the car back, is he?

1071
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,533
Get out of here.

1072
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,667
Think you can get out of here?

1073
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,300
Do you?

1074
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,567
No, you're here
for something else.

1075
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,200
You're not going anywhere.

1076
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,333
You're not going anywhere.

1077
01:12:13,367 --> 01:12:15,833
Have you got a plan?

1078
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,733
I think you've got a plan.

1079
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:28,000
You got a plan.

1080
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,233
Well, there you are.

1081
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,500
Hey, dad.

1082
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,667
James is looking for you.

1083
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,833
James is here?

1084
01:12:41,867 --> 01:12:42,967
Yeah.

1085
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,667
His car is still out front.

1086
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,033
Don't y'all have school tonight?

1087
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:49,867
Uh, yeah.

1088
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,733
Yeah.

1089
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,667
How's it going?

1090
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,700
What?

1091
01:12:55,733 --> 01:12:57,167
School.

1092
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,067
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

1093
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,600
Fine.

1094
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,833
I, um,

1095
01:13:05,867 --> 01:13:08,300
I'm real proud
of you, J.T.

1096
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,733
Sticking with it
the way you have.

1097
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:12,700
I know it's gotta be hard.

1098
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:17,000
Thank you, dad.

1099
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:18,833
Where'd you see James?

1100
01:13:18,867 --> 01:13:20,833
He's out front
talking to somebody.

1101
01:13:20,867 --> 01:13:22,133
OK.

1102
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:23,967
What are you doing tonight?

1103
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,900
Eh, I don't know.

1104
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:27,500
OK, well...

1105
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:28,733
Watch TV, I suppose.

1106
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:30,200
I mean, what I always do.

1107
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:33,667
OK. Um, there's, uh,
been a lot of robberies,

1108
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,500
I was hearing on the,
you know, news report.

1109
01:13:36,533 --> 01:13:39,033
So, you should
really be careful.

1110
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:41,500
Lock your doors
and check the windows,

1111
01:13:41,533 --> 01:13:43,533
and...

1112
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:47,167
All right.

1113
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,267
Have a good night.

1114
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:53,400
Yeah.

1115
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:56,800
You know, get an American car.

1116
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:00,567
Jr, Jr, Jr, J.T.,
come here.

1117
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:05,000
Um...

1118
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,833
Are you in a hurry?
Yeah.

1119
01:14:08,867 --> 01:14:10,167
Where you going?

1120
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,000
Class.

1121
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:13,400
Oh.

1122
01:14:13,433 --> 01:14:15,500
You going to, uh, college?
Mm-hmm.

1123
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:16,900
You're a college boy now.

1124
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:18,567
Mm-hmm.
All right.

1125
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,533
Let me ask you something.

1126
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:23,500
How many guests
do you have in this place

1127
01:14:23,533 --> 01:14:26,800
staying in the last
couple of days?

1128
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,833
Uh, just... three.

1129
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:31,300
Three?
Uh-huh.

1130
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,733
Can I see the register?

1131
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:35,233
Yeah, but I mean,
it's just that girl, and...

1132
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:37,700
Just... Just let me see
the register. OK.

1133
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:39,300
All I've got...

1134
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,567
is this...

1135
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,867
Tanya... Oh, that's the girl.
The blond.

1136
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,033
Is that your girl?

1137
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:45,667
No.
No?

1138
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,400
All right.

1139
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:48,500
Harold...

1140
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:49,633
Yeah, that's her dad.

1141
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,067
That's her dad?
Mm-hmm.

1142
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,400
And then my aunt Smith,

1143
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:53,867
didn't fill out a card.

1144
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,333
All right.

1145
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:57,633
All right, you know, I had...

1146
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:58,967
What's that?

1147
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,900
No, I was just, um...

1148
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,233
Hi.

1149
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:05,733
Hello.

1150
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,000
Hello.
Hi.

1151
01:15:10,033 --> 01:15:11,333
All right.

1152
01:15:11,367 --> 01:15:14,567
Um... What's your name again?
I forgot your name.

1153
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,067
Tanya.
Tanya.

1154
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,667
And what's your last name again?

1155
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,733
Bayer.

1156
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,533
Bayer. And you're...

1157
01:15:21,567 --> 01:15:24,167
You're in business?

1158
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,000
You... pleasure?

1159
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:27,633
What...
My dad's here.

1160
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:29,167
Your dad's...
I'm with my dad.

1161
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,867
Oh, your daddy's here, right.

1162
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,833
And is your dad, um...
All right.

1163
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:35,567
All right.

1164
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,667
Is your dad... And your dad is in
business or something like that?

1165
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1166
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:40,167
All right.

1167
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,500
Is he here?
Is he staying here?

1168
01:15:41,533 --> 01:15:43,333
Yeah. He's in number five.
Can I talk to him?

1169
01:15:43,367 --> 01:15:44,833
Number five.

1170
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,800
It's right there
on the end, on the left.

1171
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:47,800
What's his name again?

1172
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:48,833
Harold.

1173
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:50,000
Harold, Harold.

1174
01:15:50,033 --> 01:15:52,033
All right, J.T.
Mm-hmm.

1175
01:15:52,067 --> 01:15:53,500
You know, you give me a call.

1176
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:56,167
Whenever, you know.
If you hear something,

1177
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,700
you know, we just...
We have to check every motel.

1178
01:15:58,733 --> 01:15:59,967
Of course.

1179
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,200
And, uh, it's just going to
take a little time.

1180
01:16:03,233 --> 01:16:04,833
We might be back, you know?

1181
01:16:04,867 --> 01:16:06,867
Do you have anyone else
working in here?

1182
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,867
Just me and my dad, yeah.

1183
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,400
Yeah, just you and your dad.

1184
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:10,600
Good luck.
All right.

1185
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:16,300
We got to get the
fuck out of here.

1186
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,033
No shit.

1187
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:19,833
Do you think
he's going to get her?

1188
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,500
Smith?

1189
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:22,667
Yeah.

1190
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,233
No. We're going
to end up in jail.

1191
01:16:25,267 --> 01:16:26,567
I'm not worried about that,

1192
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,167
but I'll tell you something
I am worried about

1193
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,167
is the fact
that we can't bring...

1194
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:34,167
Her car here while
he's here, you know?

1195
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,000
Are you really
going to bring it?

1196
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:38,033
I don't know.

1197
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:40,400
I think we should go get it.

1198
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:43,067
Well, that's what
I'm going to go do.

1199
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,667
I'm going to get it.

1200
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,400
I want to go.

1201
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,200
I'm going to get it, and I'm
going to bring it close to here,

1202
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:55,067
and then I'll check out
if he's here.

1203
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,533
I'm going to get in the
backseat with you.

1204
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,467
It's really cramped up in there.

1205
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,167
Perfect.

1206
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,500
All right, we could do that.

1207
01:17:06,533 --> 01:17:09,233
Should we go?
Yeah.

1208
01:17:09,267 --> 01:17:11,833
All right, let's go. OK.

1209
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,833
Uh, dad, I'm taking the Beamer.

1210
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:18,500
What about your car?

1211
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,033
Uh, later.

1212
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,867
Where are we going?

1213
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,000
Right over there.

1214
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:48,200
Where's the car?
It's in there.

1215
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:50,000
Oh, you moved it?

1216
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:51,167
Yeah.

1217
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,467
Why did you move it?

1218
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,333
Because she pissed me off.

1219
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:56,367
You know what, she was acting
all superior and everything,

1220
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,333
and it was just like...
like I had to do something.

1221
01:17:59,367 --> 01:18:00,567
You were going to keep it.

1222
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,000
No, I wasn't going to keep it,
because it's just a car,

1223
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:05,233
and I don't want people
to get hurt.

1224
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:06,867
I'm not going to keep it.

1225
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,833
You painted it?

1226
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:17,367
Yep.

1227
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
You know,
I was going to keep it,

1228
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:22,333
but I guess I should
take it back, right?

1229
01:18:22,367 --> 01:18:24,067
Right.

1230
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,800
Oh, Jesus.

1231
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,533
No, it wasn't me, I swear!

1232
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:31,833
You ask Tanya!

1233
01:18:31,867 --> 01:18:32,900
This way.

1234
01:18:32,933 --> 01:18:34,467
She knows I wouldn't do it.

1235
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,567
Sorry.

1236
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,833
I'm innocent.

1237
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:38,000
It was a tall woman.

1238
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:39,367
Don't put me in here!

1239
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,333
Ask Tanya!

1240
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:43,800
They're closing in on us.

1241
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,200
Move it, now!

1242
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:58,400
I replaced the tires
so the cops could not

1243
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,800
trace it back to the lake,

1244
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:01,367
and...

1245
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,000
Probably the coolest thing.

1246
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,033
Every state.

1247
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,067
It's beautiful.

1248
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,133
Wow.

1249
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:15,367
She thought of everything.

1250
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,400
I know. It's too bad
I have to give it back.

1251
01:19:17,433 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, but...

1252
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:21,833
I'm about to give you
something much better.

1253
01:19:21,867 --> 01:19:23,867
Close the door.

1254
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:46,667
Red?!

1255
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

1256
01:21:51,033 --> 01:21:53,000
Red.

1257
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,700
You changed the tires,

1258
01:21:54,733 --> 01:21:56,333
and you got shitty
fucking taste in music.

1259
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:58,200
Shut that thing off.

1260
01:21:59,367 --> 01:22:01,033
And get on your knees!

1261
01:22:03,233 --> 01:22:04,933
James, get over here.

1262
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:13,033
We had to, man.

1263
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:14,900
On your knees.
Why?

1264
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:16,500
On your knees!

1265
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:20,000
Do it.

1266
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:21,633
She's going to fucking kill us.

1267
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:23,700
Tape their hands.
The tape's in my bag.

1268
01:22:23,733 --> 01:22:26,367
She's going to fucking kill us.
Shut up.

1269
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,500
Why are you doing this?

1270
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,533
You said if we helped you,
you'd leave us alone!

1271
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:36,900
Now get the fuck out!

1272
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,567
- Aah!
- Hurry up.

1273
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:45,167
You're a fucking bitch! I can't
believe you're doing this!

1274
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,200
Why are you doing this?!

1275
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:56,233
You stole my car.

1276
01:22:56,267 --> 01:22:58,833
It's just a stupid piece
of machinery.

1277
01:22:58,867 --> 01:23:01,200
I trusted you.

1278
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:03,233
You said you wouldn't kill us!

1279
01:23:03,267 --> 01:23:05,667
I'm not going to.
She is.

1280
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:10,033
A deal's a deal.

1281
01:23:10,067 --> 01:23:11,667
What deal, Tanya?

1282
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,000
You had a deal with me,
you fucking bitch!

1283
01:23:14,033 --> 01:23:15,333
Just get in the car.

1284
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:17,800
I want to leave
right when this is over.

1285
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:19,300
No.

1286
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,700
No.

1287
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:32,533
How sweet. A Judas kiss.

1288
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,367
Tanya.

1289
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:38,867
Please...

1290
01:23:46,433 --> 01:23:48,733
No!

1291
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,533
OK, let's go.

1292
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:21,667
The gate?

1293
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,333
Are you dead?

1294
01:25:19,933 --> 01:25:21,667
Deaf, what?

1295
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,533
Ohh...
Huh?

1296
01:25:23,567 --> 01:25:24,667
What?

1297
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,133
I think I'm deaf.

1298
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:29,500
I'm not dead.

1299
01:25:29,533 --> 01:25:32,367
Well, she said
fall no matter what.

1300
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,800
What?

1301
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:35,500
Tanya, she said fall.
I know.

1302
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:37,400
She saved our ass, didn't she?

1303
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:38,967
I can't believe...

1304
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,667
what about her ass?

1305
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:44,400
I think I'm deaf
in this ear now.

1306
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:47,600
Not dead.

1307
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:08,900
Get out.

1308
01:26:16,367 --> 01:26:18,667
Here.

1309
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,867
You're a pretty smart girl,
you know that?

1310
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,333
You think so?

1311
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:24,233
You wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

1312
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:30,500
What are you doing?

1313
01:26:30,533 --> 01:26:33,133
What are you doing?

1314
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:34,433
I thought you loved this car.

1315
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:39,533
I do.

1316
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:43,667
Sometimes, you have to
kill the things you love.

1317
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,367
And sometimes you don't.

1318
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:50,700
Are you coming?

1319
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,700
Better hurry.

1320
01:27:09,867 --> 01:27:12,000
What now?

1321
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:13,667
I don't do divorces

1322
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,500
and it's never personal, OK?

1323
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:18,200
You're quick and loyal.

1324
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,467
That's good, because if you
killed those boys back there,

1325
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,800
I would have had to kill you.

1326
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,400
What?
They were friends.

1327
01:27:23,433 --> 01:27:26,167
If you'd done them, I never
would have trusted you.

1328
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,200
Our ride's here.

1329
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,700
Hey! Hey,
what the hell?

1330
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,167
So...

1331
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,833
Do you still want to be a model?

1332
01:28:00,867 --> 01:28:02,700
No.

1333
01:28:06,033 --> 01:28:08,500
What do you suppose those
boys are doing right now?

1334
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,333
Swearing off women forever.

1335
01:28:10,367 --> 01:28:12,533
Let's hope so.

1336
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:15,067
You brought the Beamer!
Bitching!

1337
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,500
I love it!

1338
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:18,067
Shut up, shut up.
Come on, let's go.

1339
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,733
Let's get some beer, let's
go for a ride. Come on.

1340
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:32,033
Might as well.
There's nothing else to do.

1341
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:42,200
Oh. Well,
that figures.
