1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
25.000 English

2
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,160
They're here.

3
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
They're coming, sir.

4
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,200
Hand me those files on the death
of young Williams, will you, please?

5
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Colonel Waldron, you know Herr Rinder.

6
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Herr Doktor from the Swiss Red Cross.

7
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Oberleutnant Strauss.

8
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
Major Von Steiner.

9
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,880
Colonel Waldron is
the senior British officer.

10
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,600
Major Rose,
head of the lntelligence Committee.

11
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Wing Commander Shurlock,
head of their Escape Committee.

12
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
Nicht wahr?

13
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,120
I think you've come to investigate
the killing of my officer.

14
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
An accident.

15
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,680
I would like the Red Cross
to see the whole camp.

16
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,040
Your sleeping quarters, mess, toilets.

17
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,040
And see that you are being treated well...

18
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,040
...according to the spirit
of the Geneva Convention.

19
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
Come on.

20
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,920
Please, sir, can I have my ball back?

21
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,760
You are the Sportfuhrer?

22
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm Colby.

23
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
Colby?

24
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
That's very familiar.

25
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
It's a common name.

26
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
They're very enthusiastic.

27
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,800
No bloody good, but very enthusiastic.

28
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
Do you play matches?

29
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh, yeah, we have a league.
Four divisions.

30
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
We even play internationals.

31
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
Internationals?

32
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
Yeah.

33
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,040
England, lreland, Scotland, Wales.

34
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
You call that international?

35
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,880
It would be international
if you played against Germany.

36
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,360
We'd murder you.

37
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,640
Colby! John Colby.

38
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,760
Yes. Westham United and England.

39
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
That's right.

40
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,160
It's a shame the war
has ended your career.

41
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,680
Interrupted.

42
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
Let's hope so.

43
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
The colonel's protest will be
a waste of breath, I'm afraid.

44
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,120
Two hearts.

45
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,000
If we don't kick up a stink, we give
the blighters permission to do it again.

46
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,080
No bid.

47
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Pass.

48
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,520
Colby, what were you talking
to Jerry about?

49
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,760
None of your business.

50
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
Two spades.

51
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
It is our business.

52
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,840
You were seen in conversation
with the enemy, a Major Von Steiner.

53
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,200
What did he want?

54
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,640
He recognized me.

55
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
As what? Pass.

56
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
Pass.

57
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,160
So the major's a football fan, huh?

58
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,080
Elementary, my dear Shurlock.

59
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,880
Karl von Steiner played
for Germany in 1938.

60
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
What did he say to you?

61
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
Buzz off.

62
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,480
-In German?
-Yeah.

63
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,680
I think I'm getting something.

64
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,480
...working to extremes
to divert world attention...

65
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,400
...from their losses in North Africa...

66
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,480
...and the reported inhumane treatment of
the prisoners from East European nations.

67
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,480
Over here, over here.

68
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,720
What's the verdict on Williams?

69
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
Regrettable mistake.

70
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,280
The whole bloody war's
a regrettable mistake.

71
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
I agree.

72
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,360
Do you?

73
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,280
You can believe me or not,
it's nothing to me.

74
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
If nations could settle their differences
on the football pitch...

75
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,920
...wouldn't that be a challenge?

76
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
How would you like...

77
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,320
...to play a game against a team
from the Wehrmacht?

78
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,320
A team from the army base nearby?

79
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
What for? To settle the war?

80
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Unfortunately not.

81
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,080
Let's say, for morale.

82
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,880
Yours or ours?

83
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
For both.

84
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,160
Life in this place must be very boring.

85
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,040
What sort of team? They any good?

86
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,680
I haven't chosen a team. It's just an idea.

87
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,400
It's not an order. You can't make us play.

88
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
No, it's a challenge.

89
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,320
No.

90
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
It'd be a washout. A complete washout.

91
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,000
Why?

92
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,040
Look at them.

93
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,440
Look at them. They're bloody useless.

94
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,080
I mean, look at those clothes,
and those bloody great boots.

95
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,080
They're charging about there
like a herd of elephants.

96
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
Play football? They can hardly stand up.

97
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,560
Boots can be supplied.

98
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,800
You mean, proper gear?
Shirts and shorts?

99
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,920
No.

100
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,160
They couldn't run about for 90 minutes.

101
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,360
They'd be chuckin' their guts out.

102
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,480
All right, I'm sorry.

103
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,920
Major....

104
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,560
I'd want...

105
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,280
...special conditions, special rations.

106
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,600
The team would have to live together,
eat together....

107
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,360
I'd want meat...

108
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,920
...fresh vegetables, eggs...

109
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
...beer.

110
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,080
You talk to your colonel?

111
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,080
No matter what he says,
if you could supply us with all that stuff...

112
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
...you'll have a game of football.

113
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,000
Which reminds me...

114
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
...if it's confined to officers...

115
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,560
...I'm not bloody playing.

116
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,400
I want a decent team. I want the lads...

117
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,960
...from over there.

118
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Okay?

119
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,320
We shall see.

120
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,640
All right.

121
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,120
Just a minute.

122
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Right. Escapes.

123
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
We've had all the usual requests...

124
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,160
...but here's a new one you might like.

125
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,000
Peter Bailey has a plan to pole-vault
the south fence.

126
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,000
God, what will they think of next?

127
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, Christ, refused.

128
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,120
Anything else?

129
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
No. Let's have Hatch in.

130
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Hatch.

131
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

132
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,520
You're an American?

133
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,240
Enlisted Canadian Army '38,
transferred commandos.

134
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,640
How long have you been with us?

135
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,880
Since Dieppe.

136
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,080
How many attempts?

137
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Two on the way, three since then.
Time before last, I got as far as Stuttgart.

138
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,840
How's this one going?

139
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,680
Well, sir, the whole thing
depends on the fact that...

140
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
...some of the goons don't patrol
when we're havin' a shower.

141
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,280
Some of them?

142
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
Yes. Like Hans and Anton.

143
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,120
At least one of them should be outside
walking back and forth...

144
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,520
...but they know we're inside
havin' a shower.

145
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,400
They come inside, lean against the door,
have a smoke if they can bum one.

146
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,920
I think if somebody went missing,
they wouldn't report it.

147
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
-Why not?
-They wouldn't be sure.

148
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,080
They'd think they'd miscounted
and leave it until roll call.

149
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,120
And if you could cover for me at roll call,
I could be gone for days.

150
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Wait a minute.

151
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,680
You're going too fast for me. How are you
gonna get out of the wash house?

152
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,560
There is a vent in the shower room.
It leads into a storeroom or something.

153
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
Yes, I know.

154
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,800
It must have been built as a lavatory
to match the one on the German side.

155
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,960
If I can get in there,
with something to pick the lock--

156
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,120
And you'd be back in the enclosure
where you started.

157
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,640
But I'd be all alone. There's no one there.

158
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
And I could get onto the roof...

159
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,880
...go underneath the barbed wire
and drop into the German compound.

160
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,080
Naked?

161
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,240
How are you planning to get out
of the German compound naked?

162
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
I've got five or six ideas.

163
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,080
Shall we discuss them?

164
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,520
Yes.

165
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,160
Colby insisted on playing the other ranks
against the best of the officers.

166
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,120
What's the idea behind that?

167
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,160
I suppose he wants to pick
the best team possible.

168
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,960
I don't think he's quite got the point,
has he?

169
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
Tell him to come and see me, will you?

170
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,360
Cover him, Tony. Let's go.

171
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,360
Good goal. Well done, sir.

172
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,520
-What's your name?
-Sid Harmer.

173
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
How'd you like double rations
for a month or so, Sid?

174
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,840
Whose mother
do you want me to strangle?

175
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,160
Welcome aboard.

176
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay, I'm ready to sign up.

177
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,920
Sign off, Hatch.

178
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,680
Give 'em the ball. Stop it.

179
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
Come on.

180
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,360
Tackle it.

181
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Nice try.

182
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,840
Thanks, Colby.
It's not quite like playing for Manchester...

183
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,400
...but it's better than not playing at all.

184
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,840
Welcome aboard.

185
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,000
What about me?

186
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,040
Get out there.

187
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,960
What about me?

188
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,680
Get out there and play.

189
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,520
The map of Marburg is from an old
guidebook, but it's reliable, I should hope.

190
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,640
There's a fast train to Cologne
at 5:33 every Saturday.

191
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,960
Now, under the map you'll see
they've done a sketch of the stadium...

192
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,000
...the exits, perspectives,
and changing rooms.

193
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,200
Colonel...

194
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,120
...what are you talking about?

195
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm talking about your escape, Colby.

196
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,000
My escape?

197
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,120
Yes, of course.
The whole team if possible.

198
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
What about the lorry
that's taking you to the match?

199
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
You could loosen the floorboards
on the way in and...

200
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,240
...drop out on the way back.

201
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,120
You stick to scrounging, Pyrie,
and I'll stick to football.

202
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,920
It's your duty, Colby, as an officer.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,680
It could be an excellent opportunity.

204
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,520
It's certainly worth considering, old boy.

205
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
I am not interested in getting them killed.

206
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,240
Are you afraid to try?

207
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,360
Your escaping is
just some bloody upper-crust game.

208
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,640
They've done their job
and want to be left alone till it's over.

209
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Now, that will be all, Colby.

210
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
Thank you.

211
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
Come on, Hatch.

212
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
-Good tackle, Terry.
-Come on, Terry.

213
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,640
Go.

214
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,440
Did you see that?
Am I good, or am I good?

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,880
-What's your name?
-You know my name.

216
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,280
-What's your name?
-Terry. Terry Brady.

217
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,560
How'd you like to come and live
with the officers?

218
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,280
Only if you've got a chaperone, mate.

219
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,720
Welcome aboard, Terry.

220
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,440
Where'd you learn to do that?

221
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
When I was a boy...

222
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
...in Trinidad...

223
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,400
...on the streets, with the oranges.

224
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,920
How'd you like to play football
against the Germans?

225
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,240
Why not?

226
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,480
Unload him, Tony.

227
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,120
Hey, foul there.

228
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Stupid, bloody Yank!
What the hell do you think this is?

229
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,120
-Bloody hell!
-Well, what'd I do?

230
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,440
You know bloody well.

231
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,520
No, you tell me. What'd I do?

232
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,680
You can't tackle like that in soccer.
I've told you that for a year!

233
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,320
I was just goin' for the ball.

234
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,240
You use that bloody American style
again here, and you'll be barred.

235
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,720
You play English, I play American.

236
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,520
We don't play the bloody American game.
Get off.

237
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,160
Hey, what kind of game is this?
For old ladies and fairies?

238
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,320
I quit.

239
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay.

240
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,480
One, two, three...

241
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,320
...four, five, six, seven...

242
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,240
...eight, nine, turn.

243
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,120
One, two...

244
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,000
...three, four, five--

245
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
Hatch, the committee
has considered your plan.

246
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,520
You may see the tailor and the forger.

247
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,760
And the locksmith.
I've got to see the locksmith.

248
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,080
Yes, but see the tailor first.
That takes time.

249
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,720
...seven, eight, nine, turn.

250
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,920
Thanks.

251
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,760
Hey, Colby.

252
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Colby, I've been looking for you.

253
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,200
You know that football team of yours?

254
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
Know what you can do with that team?
Know where you can put it?

255
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,240
'Cause I don't want to be on that team.

256
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,280
As a matter of fact, you couldn't pay me
to be on that football team, Colby.

257
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,400
You got it, Colby?

258
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,440
I don't need you
or your football team anymore.

259
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,880
You got it?
I don't need this aggravation, Colby.

260
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,040
Captain Colby. How are you?

261
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,520
Sit down, please.

262
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,080
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

263
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,040
Our football match has been taken
a little out of our hands.

264
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,040
It has been decided...

265
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,280
...that a German national team will play...

266
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,160
...a combined team from the prisoners
of war of the occupied territories...

267
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,040
...August 15th,
at Colombes Stadium in Paris.

268
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Paris?

269
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,840
That's crazy.

270
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
Come in, Muller.

271
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,240
This is Hauptmann Rainer Muller.

272
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,120
Coach for our national team.

273
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
Captain John Colby.

274
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,760
We've met.

275
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,240
A long time ago.

276
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,160
Yeah. In London.

277
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,360
You were center-half.

278
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,880
Hauptmann Muller will assist me
and manage our team.

279
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
Make sure you have everything you need.

280
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Paris.

281
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,480
What if I refuse?

282
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,760
I think you will recognize
some of those names.

283
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,320
No, thank you.

284
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah.

285
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,840
There are some good players on here.

286
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
British, French.

287
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,960
Dutch.

288
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,480
Even a Norwegian.

289
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,480
What about the Poles and the Czechs?

290
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,320
I mean, off the top of my head
I could think of...

291
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,560
...half a dozen East European players
who would have to be on that squad.

292
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,800
Isn't that so, Muller?

293
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm sorry. I cannot let you have
any Eastern Europeans.

294
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Why not?

295
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
It's impossible.

296
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,480
Officially, they do not exist.

297
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,160
Germany does not recognize them
as prisoners of war.

298
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,720
They're in labor camps.

299
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,040
Well, maybe not officially,
but they do exist as players...

300
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,760
...don't they?

301
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,680
I don't know whether these
East European players are alive or dead...

302
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,600
...but you can find that out.

303
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,240
As an officer and a gentleman...

304
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,480
...you are obliged to give me
a marginal chance of winning.

305
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,400
Make your list, Captain.

306
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,680
I'll see what I can do.

307
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,040
Collaboration pays.

308
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,320
I don't consider it collaboration.

309
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,440
And you are to be exhibited in Paris
like performing fleas?

310
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,160
I don't think London is going
to take very kindly to this, you know.

311
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,760
You've informed London?

312
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,240
There's no need.

313
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,720
The German propaganda machine
will take care of that.

314
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,560
Get that, Hatch.

315
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
Oh, a customer, good.

316
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,800
-Captain Lawry, how are you?
-I'm very well, very well.

317
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,080
If you'll just get dressed.

318
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,040
That's it. Over there.

319
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,920
Will you be so kind as to stand guard
while I deal with our American friend?

320
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,480
Okay.

321
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,240
Stay where you are, Billy. Just listen.

322
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,120
Here we are.

323
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
Have you shaved?

324
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,400
Good enough?

325
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,800
Very good.

326
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,160
You know, it's really very gratifying.

327
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm surprised at
the relatively good conditions here.

328
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,120
Compared to other camps, that is.

329
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,120
Everyone still wants to escape.

330
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
Getting dressed? Good.

331
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,480
Don't want to dilly-dally.

332
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,320
Now, I can't promise you
a studio portrait, but it'll do.

333
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,800
You didn't make the lens as well,
did you?

334
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,760
No. I'm a genius, not a magician.

335
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Sit down.

336
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,360
All right, now, don't smile.

337
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,400
We want that criminal look
associated with passport photographs.

338
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,720
Solemn, depressed--
The jacket's up. That's lovely.

339
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,080
Now, hold that.

340
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
Wait. One more for luck?

341
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,080
No. Film's too valuable. Sorry.

342
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,200
This'll do.

343
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,960
Now, here we are.

344
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,560
Now, Dupin's the name you want, is it?

345
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
Yeah. Marcel Dupin, electrician.

346
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,600
I need an address in Lyon and papers
to show I'm a conscripted worker.

347
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,760
Yes. Why does Monsieur Dupin
want to go home?

348
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
Compassionate leave, death in the family.

349
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,120
-Can you do it?
-Yes, it's quite simple.

350
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Quite simple. Might even manage
a letter on your bereavement.

351
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Let's see.

352
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,960
What have we got?

353
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,360
French police...

354
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,080
...enter Germany, health officer,
military district....

355
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,560
They keep changing.
That's very inconsiderate of them.

356
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
Very.

357
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
How long will it take?

358
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,760
Well, you must realize, it's my busy time.

359
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,760
Everybody wants to escape
in the good weather.

360
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,760
Just be patient.

361
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,880
All right?

362
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,760
Be patient. Yeah. Thanks.

363
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,000
What the hell's that?

364
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,320
Who the hell are those guys?

365
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,360
I've had it. Look.
They've switched the guards on me.

366
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,200
Those goons are patrolling
like they're supposed to.

367
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,960
-Yes, I know.
-What do you mean, you know?

368
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,840
I know.

369
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,960
Hans and Anton have been switched
to watch over the football team.

370
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,760
Colby's football team?

371
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,280
They're my guards. I needed them.
A couple weeks, I was out of here.

372
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,800
That's bad luck.
Just between ourselves, Hatch...

373
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,640
...l never thought it was
a very good plan, anyway.

374
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,160
Here we are.

375
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,960
Luis, this is Arthur.

376
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,800
-Hello, Arthur.
-Sid and Terry.

377
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
Luis Fernandez.

378
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Terry.

379
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,440
Here's your beds over here.

380
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,880
I'll have the top one.

381
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,680
Help yourself. First come, first served.

382
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,280
I'll take the bottom one.

383
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,720
Okay, just leave me one.

384
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,000
-Not bad, is it?
-It's like the Savoy Hotel.

385
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,320
How would you know?

386
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,440
There are no bleeding chambermaids.

387
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,440
This one?

388
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
Hi, guys.

389
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,880
-What do you think you're doing?
-I decided to join the team.

390
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
Tell me everything.

391
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,200
Being on this team
is a one-way ticket out of here, right?

392
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,920
You're not on this team.

393
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,400
Oh, yeah, sure I am.

394
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,800
-I'm the trainer.
-The what?

395
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,960
The trainer.

396
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,240
Colby, you forgot to put in for a trainer.
Maybe I can't play your kind of football...

397
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,840
...but in my kind, you know everything
there is to know about bruises, sprains....

398
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,040
So if you'll just get on
to your Von Steiner...

399
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,040
...to get me some bandages,
some lineaments, some oils, some tapes...

400
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,600
...we're in business.

401
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,360
I don't want a trainer.

402
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,040
Colby, I'm a ballplayer.

403
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,360
I don't want to be left out
of somethin' like this.

404
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,040
Pull the other one.

405
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,160
I just want to be around the guys.

406
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,360
Bullshit!

407
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't do this to me.

408
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,640
-I don't need a con man.
-Easy, Colby.

409
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,280
-You and your team wrecked my escape.
-How?

410
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
I was ready. I was waiting for my papers.

411
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,160
I was going through the wash house,
but only if those two goons were on duty.

412
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,760
Now those two goons
have been transferred to you.

413
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,480
So the only way out of here
is by bein' on that team.

414
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,480
No.

415
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,560
Why not?

416
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,640
I won't be responsible for your death.

417
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,440
You'll get yourself shot.

418
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,320
That's my choice, isn't it?

419
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,120
So what is it, "yes" or "no"?

420
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,120
Okay.

421
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Tony.

422
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,480
-Nice to see you.
-Great to see you. How are you?

423
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,600
-Hello. Hatch, the trainer.
-Hi.

424
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,160
-Doug Clure?
-Yeah.

425
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,800
-What's going on?
-I'll tell you in a minute.

426
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
-Hatch, the trainer, hi.
-Remy, Jean-Paul.

427
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,480
Colby's mine.

428
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,000
Michel Filieu.

429
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Hatch, the trainer.
Welcome to my holiday camp.

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,320
Hello. How are you? Hello.

431
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,880
-Erik Borg, right?
-Yes.

432
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,720
Colby.

433
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
-Hatch, the trainer.
-Hello.

434
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,120
-Hello. How are you?
-I am Pieter Van Beck.

435
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,760
Come inside.

436
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,880
Hatch, the trainer.

437
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,480
We'll have something to eat,
and I'll explain.

438
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,400
The extra food is part of the deal.

439
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,440
We still respond to roll call
three times a day...

440
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,240
...but apart from that,
we make our own rules.

441
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,200
There is no rank here.
This is a football team.

442
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,720
I am the captain and the manager.

443
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,840
Any questions?

444
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,600
I don't know how you did it...

445
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,840
...but cheers anyway.

446
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,240
It's been a long time...

447
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,720
...and none of us feels like or...

448
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,880
...looks like world-class players.

449
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,960
It'll be tough getting into shape
with those boots...

450
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,320
...so let's hope the German major
gives us the proper gear.

451
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,640
We gotta start somewhere,
so let's start with basics, shall we?

452
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Slow, easy, stretching it fully. Okay?

453
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,680
We won't be needing that for a while.

454
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,560
Come on, put 'em down.
Let's go. Pick 'em up.

455
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,120
Left, left.

456
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
Left, right. Left, right.

457
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,360
Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up.
Put 'em down. Good.

458
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Good. Good. Good.

459
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,640
Good, Colby. Come on, guys.
Pick 'em up, put 'em down.

460
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Good.

461
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,480
They're all different sizes,
so make sure everything fits.

462
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Everything fits.

463
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,800
And I want you all to know
that if you're havin' any trouble with, say...

464
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,920
...appendicitis, heart attacks....
That's okay. There's no problem.

465
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,400
I can handle that. But listen...

466
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
...l don't want any blisters.

467
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,840
No blisters allowed.

468
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,880
So if there's anything wrong
with any of you guys, tell me now...

469
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
...not later, okay.

470
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Minor inconveniences,
say like anal bleeding, tuberculosis...

471
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,280
...growing tumors, little inconveniences
like that. All right?

472
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,560
Shut up, Hatch.

473
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,360
I'm just trying to get some team spirit
going here. Right guys?

474
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,480
Yeah, right.

475
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,920
Make sure everything fits.

476
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Yeah, everything fits. Everything fits.

477
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,800
I'll keep this myself.

478
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,000
Take no notice, lads. They're only jealous.

479
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,040
Up your's.

480
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,000
If you can get up here,
don't try and run through.

481
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,360
Don't try and be a hero
and get a goal yourself.

482
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,560
That center...l want up there,
and I want you to pass. Always pass.

483
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Let the ball do the running for you.
Don't try and run with it.

484
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,560
You're in no condition to run
for 90 minutes, I tell you.

485
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
This especially applies to wingers.

486
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,480
If you can't cross, don't run it through.
Try and get a corner.

487
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,640
A set piece works in our favor.

488
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,360
Which means that, as they--

489
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,720
Give me this.

490
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,320
Colby, after givin' me ball here,
I do this...

491
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,040
...this, this, goal.

492
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,120
Easy.

493
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,600
That's the right spirit, Luis.

494
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,440
Keep it up. Before you know it,
you'll have me thinking it's easy.

495
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,400
Colby, old chap,
Waldron would like a word.

496
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,240
I'll be right back, lads.

497
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,200
How did they get here?

498
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,240
I insisted on having them.

499
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,120
You insisted?

500
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,560
They're all great players.

501
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,200
They were.

502
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,080
You are a naive fool, Colby.

503
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,280
Insisting on great players.

504
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,200
Von Steiner has sent you five skeletons,
guarantees that you'll turn up in Paris...

505
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,160
...for his propaganda victory.

506
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,640
The Germans are doing their job very well.

507
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,000
London knows.

508
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,280
We heard it on the news.

509
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,880
It's in all the papers.

510
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,440
They're calling it another German lie.

511
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,960
London is saying that no British officer
would ever be involved in such a game.

512
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,800
London is saying, Colonel?

513
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,000
What about those poor bastards there?

514
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,920
Do we send them back
to the labor camps?

515
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,320
That's a very good question, Colby.

516
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,320
They can't go in there like that.

517
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Full of lice.

518
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Should take 'em around back, scrub 'em...

519
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,840
...take off what they're wearin' and burn it.

520
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,520
You guys want to get some water?

521
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,720
Anybody got any soap?

522
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,800
Yeah, I have. I've got DDT, as well.

523
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
All right.

524
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,280
Come on, guys. Get some water.

525
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,600
I'm responsible for them being here.

526
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,800
And I'm responsible for them
being sent back, if we don't play.

527
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,120
I can't do that.

528
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,320
But I can't tell any of you
to disobey his high command.

529
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,840
So each of you will have to make
his own decision.

530
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
We play.

531
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,200
What else can we do?

532
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,800
Yes, we play.

533
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,480
Yeah?

534
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,160
-Everybody?
-Yeah, come on, let's play.

535
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,680
Of course, we'll play.

536
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,480
Come on. Looking good.

537
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,960
You got a good bunch out there.
These guys are comin' along real fine.

538
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,480
I think the Germans are gonna have to
go some to beat them.

539
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,920
-You're an optimist.
-Well, what are you?

540
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,080
That's not bad, Hatch.

541
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,520
What's not bad?

542
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,840
Using your hands.

543
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,840
You've got feet, I've got hands.

544
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,160
Gimme that.

545
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,360
-Get in there.
-Sure thing, General.

546
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,400
Luis.

547
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Luis....

548
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,360
Fire a few at him.

549
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,320
You've got to do better than that.

550
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,920
Come on, you guys. Let's fire 'em in here.

551
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,640
There we go. Here we go. Come on.

552
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah, here we go. Put it in here.

553
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,360
Give me some balls, Charley.

554
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,480
You're gonna get serious now, huh?

555
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,440
Okay, guys, come on, fire 'em in here.
Fire 'em in here. Let's go. All right?

556
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,800
Let's go. Come on. Don't be afraid of me.

557
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Yeah. What, what's that?

558
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,320
Right down the middle.

559
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,480
Can you do it with your mouth shut?

560
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,440
The mouth and the hands
work together as a team.

561
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,760
Come on, come on.

562
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,520
Get your body behind it.

563
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,960
Not like that, like that.
Hands behind it, pull it into the chest.

564
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,360
I'm aware of that.

565
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,320
Come on, Hatch. I want to see it now.

566
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,480
Come on, right there in the middle.

567
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,400
I thought you were my friend.

568
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,000
I am your friend.

569
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,320
You know, Hatch, to be honest with you...

570
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,760
...you don't kick well...

571
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,680
...you don't dribble well...

572
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
...but you could be a good goalkeeper.

573
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,160
-Keep trying.
-Thanks a lot.

574
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,200
He's right. You're not bad.

575
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,880
Ca va, Monsieur Dupin ?

576
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,800
I'm good. Do you have my papers?

577
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,240
I kept my word. It was ready,
but the colonel took it.

578
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,360
-He wants to see you.
-The colonel?

579
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,720
-The colonel took my passport?
-Yes, he did.

580
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,880
Thanks.

581
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
How's the French coming along?

582
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,360
-Comme ci comme ca.
-You don't need much.

583
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,360
I am going to a funeral. Fine.

584
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,760
Je vais a un enterrement,
something like that.

585
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,280
That's good.

586
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,360
Remember to take your identity tag
when you go.

587
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,280
-We don't want you shot as a spy, do we?
-No.

588
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't want to be shot as anything.

589
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,360
Au revoir.

590
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,160
He's on his way, sir.

591
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Good.

592
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,640
Enter.

593
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,680
Hatch.

594
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,400
-Hello.
-Sit down.

595
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,520
-Cup of tea?
-Yes, please.

596
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,160
Tea?

597
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,440
Beautiful.

598
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,560
God knows what the fellow will do
in civilian life.

599
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,880
Make his own pound notes
and share certificates, I shouldn't think.

600
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,240
Are you ready?

601
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,720
Pretty near.

602
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,640
Anything else we can do for you?

603
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,600
No. I just want to thank you all
for helping out.

604
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,200
Don't thank us, old boy. It's a team effort.

605
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,320
What Pyrie means is that nowadays
the Germans are up to all the tricks.

606
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,960
It's almost impossible
to escape without help.

607
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,680
Helping one another is the most
important part of the whole thing.

608
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,720
How would you like to do something
to help us, Hatch?

609
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Provided, of course, that you get out.

610
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,840
Which way were you planning to go?

611
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,720
To Lyon then to the Swiss border.

612
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,000
Switzerland?

613
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,920
I suppose you hadn't thought of
going via Paris, had you?

614
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,560
No. Paris? No, sir.

615
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,080
I think you'd find it easier.

616
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,080
They wouldn't expect you to go that way.

617
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,560
But I'm still in occupied territory.
Where do I go from there?

618
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,440
We could supply you with contacts,
names, safe houses....

619
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,840
You'd be well looked after.

620
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,680
No, thanks.

621
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,160
I thank you all for your concern, but
I'm really not planning on seein' Paris...

622
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,840
...until after the war.

623
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,600
Why, Colonel?

624
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,080
We want you to contact
the Resistance for us.

625
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,880
What?

626
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,640
And arrange the escape
of the football team.

627
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,200
Colby's escape?

628
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
All of them.

629
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,520
The whole team.

630
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,720
This match is a propaganda stunt
for the Germans.

631
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
It's a wonderful opportunity for us.

632
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
But why send me?

633
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,080
The French may have thought
of all this themselves.

634
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,440
Indeed they may, and then again,
they may not.

635
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,800
We have to get word to them somehow.

636
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,400
What do you want me to do?

637
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,520
Find out if an escape is feasible.

638
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,800
Ask them to try it.

639
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,920
If they won't?

640
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,120
They won't.

641
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,560
But they'd help you
to get to Spain or Switzerland.

642
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,080
I suppose I could do that.

643
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,840
Wonderful.

644
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,320
-Thank you.
-I'll go over the details with you tonight.

645
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,760
-Not a word to Colby.
-He'll have to know something.

646
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,320
He'll have to know you're going,
but not why.

647
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,680
I really don't believe this.

648
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
What?

649
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,840
This frigging game is wrecking my life.

650
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,040
Good luck.

651
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,560
Red Cross.

652
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,840
-Good?
-Good.

653
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,000
All the best, Hatch.

654
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,080
I hope he makes it.

655
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,160
Stay close to it. Easy.

656
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,760
Easy.

657
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Achtung. Achtung.

658
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,400
Lights out.

659
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,280
Lights out.

660
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,600
That was a wonderful evening, darling.

661
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,040
See you tomorrow. Sleep well.

662
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,080
Open the gate.

663
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,680
For Paris, please.

664
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,400
You must change in Strasbourg.

665
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,920
Come on! We must go. Hurry up!

666
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,000
All aboard, please.

667
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,360
What is the purpose of your trip?

668
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Do you speak French?

669
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,160
-Don't you speak German?
-No.

670
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,440
I'm going to a funeral in Paris.

671
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,080
I'm going to a funeral.

672
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,880
My dear, wait.

673
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,200
Quetsche, s'il vous plait.

674
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,200
Merci.

675
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,080
Alors, salut.

676
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,040
Un autre.

677
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,320
Oui.

678
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,840
We don't even know
when or how they'll do the transfer.

679
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,960
'Cause the Germans
could take them one by one.

680
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,760
It all seems risky to me.

681
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,040
Well, I don't know. It seems too soon
to make a decision like that. Tell him.

682
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,680
Mister...

683
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,520
...the answer is "no."

684
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,800
That's what I figured.

685
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,960
We do not know
where they would stay in Paris...

686
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,600
...and I do not want a battle in the streets.

687
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,720
The Germans will have a whole battalion
at least at the Colombes Stadium.

688
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,360
The Colombes Stadium?

689
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,800
Why didn't you say so before?

690
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,920
My friends, the Paris sewer system
branches off just below...

691
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
...the foundations of the stadium.

692
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,520
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

693
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,080
Did I not work in the sewers 20 years ago?

694
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,680
What'd he say?

695
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,680
There were sewers there,
sewers going into the Seine.

696
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,480
It's covered over now.

697
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,920
Who knows.

698
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,160
We will have a look. Okay? Bonsoir.

699
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,440
What am I supposed to do?

700
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,200
You will stay with Renee, please.

701
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,680
The house is safe. Okay? Goodbye.

702
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,080
Salut.

703
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,280
-Bye, Renee.
-Good night.

704
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,520
Thanks. No. Merci.

705
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,640
Look, lady, I just said thanks.
No offense.

706
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,880
We are both on the same side, aren't we?

707
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,160
Please.

708
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,880
I just wanted to talk.

709
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,560
It's been a long time
since I talked to a woman.

710
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,640
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Parlez-vous English?

711
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,720
I understand you very well.

712
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,440
Good. Then why don't you sit down
and we'll talk.

713
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,400
Hatch. My friends call me Hatch.

714
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,440
No.

715
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,000
You don't want to be my friend?

716
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,720
I didn't want to hear your name.

717
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,040
And now that I do, I don't want to hear
anything else about you.

718
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,880
The less I know, the better it is for you.

719
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,240
And for you?

720
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,760
And for me, too.

721
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400
My bein' here has put you
and your friends in a tough spot.

722
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,640
Is that why you're mad?

723
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,760
I'm not mad.

724
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,080
But being in a tough spot,
as you call it, is where I choose to be.

725
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,600
How do you feel about me being here?

726
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,280
How do I feel?

727
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,880
I feel responsible, hopeful.

728
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,680
When I get word that someone
I sheltered is safe, then I'm happy.

729
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,280
I can forget them.

730
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,680
But when I hear
that they've been caught or killed...

731
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,880
...then I remember everything.

732
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,360
I remember their faces, their voices.

733
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,680
What they said about their parents,
their child, their pets.

734
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,200
And I mourn for them.

735
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,920
I don't want to mourn for you.

736
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,520
Well, you're safe with me, Renee.

737
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,960
How?

738
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,600
Well, I'm an orphan. A bastard.

739
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,080
I have no parents.
No money. I'm not married.

740
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,560
No children. I don't even have a pet.

741
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,680
And anything I might say in my sleep
to the contrary can't be held against me.

742
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,840
Do you live here alone?

743
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
No.

744
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,440
Are you married?

745
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,880
He got killed, the first week of the war.

746
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,760
Sorry.

747
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,520
Who do you live with?

748
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,840
With Francois.

749
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,480
Is that your boyfriend?

750
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,320
It's late. I'll have him move out
of his room so you can sleep there.

751
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,240
Wait.

752
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,080
You don't have to get Francois up.

753
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,520
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I can sleep here on the couch.

754
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,080
My son, Francois.

755
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,960
Herr Kommandant.

756
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,600
The American's escape
has put me in a very bad position...

757
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,040
...with the Kommandant
and the high command.

758
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,760
Hatch's escape had nothing to do
with my team.

759
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,440
That was his own idea.

760
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,640
Your men covered for him.

761
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,000
What would you expect them to do?

762
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,400
What would you do?

763
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,480
I want your word that there'll be
no attempt to escape from the team.

764
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,400
Scouts' honor.

765
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,080
The idea of the match was friendly.

766
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,000
That was the idea.

767
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,040
I want your word.

768
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,760
I can't give it to you.

769
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,120
You will all be very closely guarded.

770
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,400
All right.

771
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,320
And down the sewer here we discovered
a foundation pipe of the stadium.

772
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,200
Sounds good to me.

773
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,280
But...

774
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,400
...we must make sure which one it is.

775
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,160
We have to find the original plans.

776
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,080
We think the best chance to escape...

777
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,600
...will be from the visitors' dressing room.

778
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,200
Maybe they'll be left alone at halftime.

779
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,240
Maybe.

780
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,760
But we can run into a concrete wall.
Anything can happen.

781
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,800
You will have to go back.

782
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,840
What?

783
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,560
To the camp.

784
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,920
To tell them.

785
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,720
The team.

786
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,760
They must know that we'll be there.

787
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,920
It took me a year to get out of there.

788
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,360
We need a contact.

789
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,480
Colby must know, and also your colonel.

790
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,040
That's not my problem.

791
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,240
You believe that?

792
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,960
I don't know what to believe.

793
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,080
I don't. I mean....

794
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,480
What am I supposed to do?
Break back into the camp?

795
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,040
No. You get captured.

796
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,480
Get captured.

797
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,520
All right, suppose I get captured?

798
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,080
Then they send me to the wrong
prisoner camp. What about that?

799
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,240
-No, no.
-Now, what about that?

800
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,800
The Germans will take you
to the same place...

801
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,040
...to show the other prisoners
that you are not a success.

802
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,720
You got all the answers, don't you?

803
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,720
Yes.

804
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,360
Mister, you will leave tomorrow.

805
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,120
-Tomorrow?
-Yes, tomorrow.

806
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,360
This friggin' soccer game.

807
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,640
I'll leave you my papers.

808
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,320
They're pretty good.

809
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,720
I'm sure somebody will be able to use 'em.

810
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,640
All right?

811
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,160
He's back.

812
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,400
Schnell.

813
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,600
Thank you.

814
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,600
March, march.

815
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,680
So, our Hatch knows his mythology.

816
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,720
What does it mean?

817
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,400
Mercury.

818
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,720
Messenger of the gods.

819
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,680
No flies on Rosey.

820
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,960
News, eh?

821
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,200
How do we find out what it is?

822
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,920
Good question.

823
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,000
We sent him to Paris on your behalf.

824
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,440
Yours and the team's.

825
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
Colonel...

826
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,640
...l don't know what you're talking about.

827
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,680
We sent him to Paris
to arrange your escape.

828
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,600
-Hatch did that for you?
-No.

829
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,480
-For you.
-We could argue about that.

830
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,360
Why didn't you tell me?

831
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,160
No point, really,
unless he managed to arrange something.

832
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,320
He appears to have been successful.

833
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,800
The snag is he can't tell us.

834
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,920
He'll be in the cooler until after the match.

835
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,880
Then you'll just have to get him
out of there, won't you?

836
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,120
Excuse me.

837
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,360
I have a training session.

838
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,120
Just a minute. Colby....

839
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,760
I know you wanted to play for the sake
of those Eastern Europeans.

840
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,280
I admire you for it.

841
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,400
But you and I both know that you risk
a court martial for this after the war.

842
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,200
What have you accomplished?

843
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,040
Give them a couple of weeks of life?

844
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,120
And what is going to happen to them
after your match is over?

845
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,880
For the same reason
that you wanted to play you must escape.

846
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,600
If you can.

847
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,360
What can I do?

848
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,280
I can't get him out of there.

849
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,440
Now, Hatch is officially your trainer,
isn't he?

850
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,840
Von Steiner and the camp Kommandant
won't buy that one.

851
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,720
You'll have to think of something else.

852
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,280
Crazy Yank.

853
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,200
You, Colonel Waldron and Major Rose...

854
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,320
...will travel to Paris along with
other senior officers from various camps...

855
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,280
...to represent your countries.

856
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,560
I won't do it.

857
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,400
You have no choice.

858
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,880
Then I'll travel...

859
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,760
...but I won't represent anything.

860
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,320
You will be seen.

861
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,640
The team...

862
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,720
...will be ready to travel at midday
on Thursday.

863
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,280
Further arrangements
will be announced later.

864
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,680
One of my men is
in the punishment block.

865
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,920
In solitary.

866
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,240
I can give you a trainer.
You don't need him.

867
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,920
Hatch is my goalkeeper.

868
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,440
The American? No.

869
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,640
Tony Lewis is your goalkeeper.

870
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,120
He's broken his arm.

871
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,200
When did this happen?

872
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,200
This morning.

873
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,720
Put someone else in goal.

874
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,360
Hatch is my best man.

875
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,720
I thought the idea was
to give us a chance.

876
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,240
This is the idea.

877
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,520
If the camp doctor verifies
this broken arm...

878
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,800
...you may have the American.

879
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,120
Thank you.

880
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,240
Well, Tony?

881
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,000
Try and make it a clean break, will ya?

882
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,840
I'll try.

883
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,600
I won't even get to see the game, will l?

884
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,200
Sit on the bed.

885
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,720
Put your arm between those two.

886
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,200
Okay.

887
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,120
-Are you going to put those up?
-Yes, sir.

888
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,920
Which is the team for home?

889
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,520
Then the prisoners shall have it.

890
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,080
We'll have the other.

891
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,400
-The other is the same?
-Yes, sir.

892
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,640
Good.

893
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,080
Colby, I don't know
how to play this game, so...

894
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,480
...where do I stand for the corner kick?

895
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
What?

896
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,880
I said, I'm not very good at the game.
Where do I stand for the corner kick?

897
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,360
Go to sleep, Hatch.

898
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,880
Excuse me.

899
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,800
Colby?

900
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,080
What?

901
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,640
Where do I stand for a corner kick?

902
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,240
The far post, facing the ball.

903
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,680
Thanks. For a while there,
I thought you were keeping it a secret.

904
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,080
Mesdames et messieurs.

905
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,080
So, a hearty welcome
to all our listeners in England.

906
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,880
There are just a few minutes to go
before the kickoff of this historic match.

907
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,600
This great crowd of about 50,000
really has something to look forward to...

908
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,560
...during the next 90 minutes.

909
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,280
To insure fair play
and good sportsmanship...

910
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,840
...the German organizers have picked
a neutral to referee the match.

911
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,600
And he is now ready...

912
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,120
...for the toss of the coin.

913
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:10,640
Heads.

914
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,280
The winner will have his choice
of kicking off or defending.

915
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,040
But will most probably choose to play
towards the east goal...

916
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,920
...with the wind in his favor.

917
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,320
And the Allies will kick off
this great event.

918
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,840
Well, I tell you, years from now
men will say of this game:

919
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,160
"Did it happen?"

920
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:30,040
Well, I tell you in the listening audience:
Today, it is happening.

921
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,240
We're all witness to an occasion
long to be remembered.

922
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,440
Not just propaganda, as some would say...

923
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,080
...but as a magnificent sporting spectacle.

924
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,520
Hatch.

925
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,200
Hatch. Halftime.

926
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,720
All right. Thanks.

927
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,800
What'd he say?

928
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,640
That it's on for halftime.

929
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,240
Here's to victory.

930
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,520
Let's go. Let's play ball.

931
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,720
Play hard, eh?

932
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,120
Let's play hard.

933
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,040
Harmer kicks off for the Allies...

934
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,560
...and the game has begun.

935
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,920
You'd have a job getting...

936
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,120
...twenty-two better players than are
out there on the pitch right now.

937
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,280
The Allies are playing it very cool.

938
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,560
And Pauls of Denmark
makes it deep and shoots.

939
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,920
Very close.

940
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,760
The ball is back in play by Schmidt,
Germany's legendary goalkeeper.

941
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,160
Reinhart, Reinhart to Becker...

942
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,240
...to Baumann, Number 4...

943
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,800
...forward now to Brandt...

944
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,520
...back to Albrecht, Number 11 .

945
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,240
Albrecht out to the left.

946
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,160
He beats Number 4.

947
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,840
-Watch him.
-Watch my back, watch my back.

948
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,800
Watch out, Hatch.

949
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,080
There's your corner kick, Hatch.

950
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,400
-The guy drove me out.
-To the right, to the right.

951
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
Watch him back there. Watch him.

952
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,840
Watch him, watch him there.

953
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,520
Come on, lads, eye on the ball. Come on.

954
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,120
-Now, pick him up.
-Come on, guys.

955
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,840
I got it.

956
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,040
It's a goal.

957
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,240
Germany one, the Allies nil.

958
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,760
And listen to that applause.

959
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,080
The crowd is going wild.

960
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,880
Take it easy. You're as tight as a drum.

961
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,840
-Just give it to halftime, Colby.
-Don't let them pull you off your line.

962
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,240
That's a foul.

963
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,720
Watch him.

964
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,280
Come on. Stick with it. That's it.

965
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,320
That's it. Come on.

966
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,280
Referee, look at this.

967
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,520
Get it out.

968
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,720
Watch him back there. Watch him.

969
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,160
Play the ball.

970
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,600
Germany two, Allies nil.

971
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,280
Come out, Hatch.

972
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,920
Don't lose your temper. It's okay.

973
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,600
Everybody, out. Out! Out!

974
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,440
Take it.

975
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,080
Bravo.

976
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,040
Come on, Luis.

977
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,280
In the penalty area.

978
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,400
The referee will probably call a penalty.
And he does.

979
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,280
This is the fella here. This is the one.

980
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,760
I'll calm my team, but you calm them.

981
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,560
The referee trying to settle them down,
and the call will remain.

982
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,280
It will be a penalty kick, one on one.

983
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,200
Hatch, the goalkeeper...

984
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,920
...he'll have to be on his line,
that's 12 yards away.

985
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,720
He's not allowed to move
until the ball has been struck.

986
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,160
Yes, indeed. Germany's great Baumann
will take the kick.

987
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,080
Goal. He sends the ball past Hatch.

988
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,000
And it's three to nothing
in favor of Germany.

989
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,200
The Allies kick off again. It's Ray.

990
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,160
Ray to Fernandez. Fernandez back to Ray.

991
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,320
And we have seen
some very good football.

992
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,560
Very fortunate for us, indeed,
considering that...

993
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,800
...there are no international games
being played now.

994
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,920
Baumann makes a beautiful tackle.

995
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,960
Dispossesses him, and the Germans
are again on the attack.

996
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,480
Watch your back, watch your back.

997
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,840
I'll get it.

998
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,080
It's good.

999
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,160
Goal for the Germans.

1000
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,360
Four, nil.

1001
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,920
Stay on the bloody line, I told you.

1002
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,840
I missed.

1003
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,280
Stay on the line
and narrow the angle down.

1004
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,640
When they come in, narrow the angle.

1005
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,120
We'll play ten men.
I'll go forward, you cover that back.

1006
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,080
This isn't going to be easy.

1007
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,640
We've taken enough, mates.
Let's get 'em.

1008
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,880
The Allies are playing with ten men.

1009
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,360
Interesting, because Colby has chosen
to give this advantage to the Germans.

1010
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,240
Good. On you go, come on.

1011
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,040
Get it out.

1012
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,240
Referee, look at--

1013
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,160
Keep playing it, lads.

1014
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,160
Four to one, and less than a minute
to go to the halftime.

1015
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,000
This kind of action takes me back
to the World Cup of '38...

1016
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,760
...played right here
in Colombes Stadium in Paris.

1017
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,840
We did it. We made it.

1018
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,440
The end of 45 minutes of play.

1019
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,040
And it's been a brilliant first half.

1020
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:46,480
I don't know about you,
but I can say for myself....

1021
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,800
Well done, lads.

1022
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,560
Hatch, we got you to halftime.

1023
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,040
Let's see.

1024
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,200
Fantastic, Terry. At least we put up a--

1025
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,640
-We scored a goal.
-Oh, yeah?

1026
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,840
-Who scored?
-Terry scored a goal.

1027
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,560
Fantastic. What's the score?

1028
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,640
Four to one. But at least
we scored a goal, one time.

1029
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,920
We're doin' good. It's gonna be all right.

1030
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,320
Way to go, guys.

1031
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,120
What's happening?

1032
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,600
All right, we're getting out of here.

1033
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,800
How?

1034
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,880
Our escape has been arranged
all the way to the Seine River.

1035
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,160
Once we get on the other side,
we're gonna blow the tunnel.

1036
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,080
There's a boat waiting for us
and in one hour we'll be in the country.

1037
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,160
All right?

1038
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,520
Salut.

1039
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,480
Vite. Vite.

1040
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,000
Vite. Vite. Vite.

1041
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,200
Colby, you take the lead off,
I'll bring up the rear.

1042
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,040
Okay. Get Luis and Pieter.

1043
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,400
-I don't want to go.
-Just shut up and get in there.

1044
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,000
We can beat them.

1045
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,480
Bring Pieter over.

1046
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,680
We've still got a chance.

1047
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,280
Chance, my ass.

1048
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,600
Hatch, don't you see?

1049
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,560
You nuts or somethin'?
You have no chance.

1050
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,480
Don't you understand? No chance.

1051
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,040
Get Pieter ready next.

1052
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,640
Hey.

1053
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,080
Come on, let's go.

1054
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,040
Don't worry. Come on. Hurry.

1055
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,000
I don't want to go.
Let's go back. We can win this.

1056
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,160
-Who said that?
-I did.

1057
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,880
It's not as though
we're being slaughtered, Skipper.

1058
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,720
What do you mean, we can win?

1059
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,480
-Wait a minute.
-Colby, we're losin' time.

1060
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,400
You mean you'd go back
and play the second half?

1061
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,040
Move. We've only got a few minutes.

1062
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,080
Yes, but we could win this.

1063
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,640
You could never, with me as the goal.

1064
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,560
Of course, we can.
He's not a bad goalie, is he?

1065
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,360
What's the matter with you?
You want to go back to prison?

1066
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,720
-Come back, we need you.
-That's right.

1067
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,280
You guys do what you want,
but I'm leavin'.

1068
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,080
-You're quitting.
-I ain't goin' back to prison.

1069
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,360
You've got to come back. If you don't--

1070
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,040
-I waited too long to get out.
-If you don't come back, we can't go.

1071
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,760
Hatch, if you go,
we've all got to go with you.

1072
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
We can't go back without the goalie.

1073
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,440
-Hatch, come on.
-Hatch.

1074
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,280
Please, Hatch.

1075
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,360
That game means a lot to us.

1076
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,600
You know that.

1077
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,800
You must go back.

1078
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,560
-Hatch, let's go.
-Please.

1079
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,560
We can win.

1080
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,080
Come on.

1081
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,400
If we run now, we lose more than a game.

1082
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,240
Please, Hatch.

1083
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,640
Good luck, Hatch. Good luck.

1084
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,520
Come on, lads, let's get 'em.

1085
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,680
The Allies are playing above themselves.

1086
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,760
Throwing everything into
a desperate attack.

1087
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,320
Very quickly the Allies have come back
with a goal.

1088
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,960
And it's four to two.

1089
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,760
Come on, run with it.

1090
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,160
Right tackle, Roy.

1091
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,400
Fifteen minutes remaining
of this incredible game...

1092
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,600
...and you won't see many
better than this.

1093
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,920
A marvelous game.

1094
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,320
We anticipated it, and so far, it's a sizzler.

1095
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,200
The Germans are in top form.

1096
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,040
Get lost.

1097
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,040
Get me in there. Break fast.

1098
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,840
The goal has been disallowed. No goal.

1099
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,200
The goal has been disallowed.

1100
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,120
What do you mean, no goal?

1101
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,720
That's a bloody lie.

1102
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,560
That's a bloody lie.
All right lads, we've been had.

1103
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,880
This game has had all the drama.

1104
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,360
An equalizing goal not allowed...

1105
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:47,680
...so the Allies are still behind
three goals to four.

1106
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,800
I want to play.

1107
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,280
-You can't play like that.
-I feel good. I feel better.

1108
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,640
-I must play.
-Ref, he's coming back on.

1109
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,080
I'm okay.

1110
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,360
...into the football festival
and only four minutes remaining.

1111
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,600
-All right, lads, let's go.
-They're all very crucial.

1112
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,480
The Germans are powerful,
and very strong.

1113
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,280
Stick with him, boy.

1114
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,080
Victory. Victory.

1115
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,200
Victory. Victory.

1116
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,800
Victory. Victory.

1117
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,640
Victory. Victory.

1118
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,640
Victory. Victory.

1119
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,760
Victory. Victory.

1120
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,800
Victory. Victory.

1121
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,760
Victory. Victory.

1122
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,800
Victory. Victory.

1123
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,480
Victory. Victory.

1124
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,840
And so we're ready to pick up
where we left off in the action.

1125
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,240
Very good, keep going.

1126
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,800
And Schmidt, one of the best goalkeepers
in the world...

1127
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,680
...showing us again
that he's not lost any of his skills.

1128
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:15,680
About a minute remaining.

1129
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,720
Schmidt left foots it down the field.

1130
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,280
The Germans have a lovely ball.

1131
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,440
It's Baumann. Baumann is...

1132
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,280
...brought down in the penalty area.

1133
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:30,040
The referee responds and rightfully so.

1134
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:33,040
A deliberate foul by Ray
as the clock runs out.

1135
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,800
And the penalty collects.

1136
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,520
And at the very end of the game
they've resorted to fouling.

1137
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,880
What a sad way to end this game.

1138
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,920
This is not fair.

1139
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,480
Come on, Hatch. Come on.

1140
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:05,960
Victory. Victory.
