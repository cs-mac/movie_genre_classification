1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,916
Our numbers have grown
beyond wildest expectation.

2
00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:08,484
<i>And winter will soon be upon us.</i>

3
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:11,620
Resources of the Senate
are drained by these conflicts.

4
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:13,855
There is one among us

5
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:15,991
<i>who could fund endeavor
from his own purse.</i>

6
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,227
It would take considerable
coin and effort

7
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,429
to raise such a force.

8
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:22,531
And in return you will
be offered a command,

9
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>under Cossinius and Furius, of course.</i>

10
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,536
I begin to question turning from
the calm of the ocean breeze,

11
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:31,240
and the safety of my city's
walls in Sinuessa en Valle.

12
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:32,575
Their terms are agreeable.

13
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,477
Father.

14
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,680
Spartacus, this one carried a message.

15
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:37,981
You planned this.

16
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:40,884
<i>It speaks of hope that
word finds them safe</i>

17
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:44,522
within the villa.

18
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,427
<i>Sole command and charge
to bring Spartacus</i>

19
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,830
to deserved end is now yours.

20
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:53,165
<i>There isn't a villa in all the land</i>

21
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,234
that could hold such numbers.

22
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,069
No, there is not.

23
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:59,038
Only a city could hold us now.

24
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,629
Come on, keep it up!

25
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:39,482
Not as easy as butchering
a horse, is it?

26
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,658
Their kick is considerably more gentle.

27
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:51,428
Diotimus.

28
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,797
Spartacus summons you.

29
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,811
<i>The southern coast?</i>

30
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,012
It will force Crassus' army

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,116
to march much greater
distance to meet us,

32
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:12,984
<i>sapping strength and supplies.</i>

33
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:16,021
But will we not stand
as drained at journey's end?

34
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:18,891
The comfort of city walls
will see us revived.

35
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,694
A thing denied Crassus.

36
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:23,195
<i>Diotimus.</i>

37
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:26,399
I would have your counsel.

38
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,767
Apologies...

39
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:30,638
I am absent knowledge
concerning strategies of war.

40
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,307
Yet you are well versed in other needs.

41
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:40,282
<i>You spoke of a city protected by walls</i>

42
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,884
and caressed by ocean's breeze.

43
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:45,720
Ah...Sinuessa en Valle.

44
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:47,756
Uh, home to me for many years...

45
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:56,465
Then you know of its defenses.

46
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,501
You would take the city?

47
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,973
Mmm, that path rests upon your words.

48
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:11,414
There are two gates.

49
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,450
The main one faces
the hills to the west.

50
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,885
Open for trade during light of day,

51
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:17,087
secured as sun retires.

52
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,356
And the other?

53
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,191
Set against cliffs,

54
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,760
running up to the canyons
of Melia Ridge.

55
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,928
Impassable during winter months,

56
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,598
which are already upon its peak.

57
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,935
I would not find
ourselves trapped there.

58
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,671
Nor I.

59
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,140
How stands the main gate?

60
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,710
Formidable, once sealed.

61
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,478
Could a few men from
within see it opened,

62
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,246
beneath cover of night?

63
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:49,152
<i>It is well defended,
and you would be absent means.</i>

64
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,788
The Aedile feared weapons
could be turned upon the guards,

65
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,923
ordered all of note

66
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,093
locked within a storeroom near the gate.

67
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,963
We must give up sword upon entering?

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,069
Let us turn toward more
favorable prospect.

69
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,939
Hold a moment...

70
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,075
<i>I had dealings with
a man during my travels,</i>

71
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:13,111
who claimed the city his own.

72
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,982
Attius, a blacksmith by trade.

73
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,450
I know of him.

74
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:19,685
My dominus often spoke
of his distaste for the man.

75
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:23,055
Can we lay trust in the Roman?

76
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:26,392
He stands Roman only by name.

77
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,028
Weigh his purse with enough coin

78
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:33,366
and he would call Thrace
or Gaul his mother.

79
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:37,037
I would have you with me to break word.

80
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,571
I would join you.

81
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,573
Break camp and follow.

82
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,543
<i>Remain unseen until called to purpose.</i>

83
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,578
What of your brands?

84
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:46,813
<i>If you are searched at the gate,</i>

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,315
<i>effort will be short lived.</i>

86
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,250
A point well made.

87
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:54,754
My fucking dominus holds
sway with the Aedile.

88
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:58,091
Speak the name of Laurus
towards meeting of trade,

89
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:01,794
stand chance of avoiding entanglement.

90
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:05,699
The next you greet him,
it will be Laurus who kneels...

91
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:08,201
and calls you master.

92
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,951
<i>Step forward!</i>

93
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,177
<i>That will do.</i>

94
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,013
Give up weapons.
Any weapons?

95
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,518
<i>Step forward!</i>

96
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,757
<i>State business within Sinuessa en Valle.</i>

97
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:34,193
We come for grain.

98
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:39,599
And all the pleasures
your city has to offer...

99
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:44,237
Ah...you insult me.

100
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,773
By so light a palm.

101
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:52,579
Well...allow
weighted apology...

102
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:56,183
I would have your brace,
and the jewels upon it.

103
00:05:56,251 --> 00:06:00,554
It is most treasured
possession at this time.

104
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:03,023
I would not part with it.

105
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,469
Then turn from fucking gate.

106
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,679
Guards!

107
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:12,264
As you wish.

108
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,085
Oh, please inform Laurus that...

109
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:15,286
his guests will not be able

110
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:17,589
to keep intended meeting, hmmm.

111
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,290
Wait.

112
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,560
Ah, give over weapons.

113
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:26,297
<i>And grace ear of the man that
Decimus saw you well treated.</i>

114
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,500
Gratitude.

115
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,869
<i>I shall see you well rewarded this day.</i>

116
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,317
<i>I understand your plight, Ulpianus,</i>

117
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:48,252
<i>but you must understand my husband's.</i>

118
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,221
The Cilicians yet plague our waters

119
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:52,856
and Spartacus now assaults
transport upon land.

120
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:53,991
The cost
of grain --

121
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,359
-- soars beyond reason.

122
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:57,461
If I raise the price of my bread
any further to cover loss,

123
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,129
I-I fear the crowd
will turn upon me.

124
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:02,066
A matter to be taken up with my husband.

125
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:06,403
I would not ask if profit
were my only concern, Laeta.

126
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,104
My wife is with child.

127
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,844
I will broach subject with him.

128
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:15,879
Gratitude.

129
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:19,449
Hold sentiment until it is deserved.

130
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:22,486
I do not expect him to be moved.

131
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:23,593
<i>Three denarii!</i>

132
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,756
<i>Yeah, fresh this morning!</i>

133
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,498
This is the one you spoke of?

134
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,066
It is, Aedile.

135
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:37,268
I warned you shackle would
not stand warning enough

136
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,070
after Diotimus slipped from grasp.

137
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,806
Words now heeded.

138
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:42,874
<i>See it done.</i>

139
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,108
<i>And in grim wake,</i>

140
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:48,613
post notice to quell
further unpleasantness.

141
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,349
This way!

142
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:55,253
Stand up!

143
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:57,222
Come on.

144
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,424
<i>Ennius.
Forward.</i>

145
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,925
Why are you not at the horreum?

146
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:03,261
I was delayed by young Ulpianus.

147
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,798
He has implored me to broach --
Now is place nor time.

148
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,567
Come on, get on with it!

149
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,775
<i>By permission of honored Aedile,</i>

150
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:20,378
<i>I present yet another beloved slave</i>

151
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:24,081
<i>fallen to treacherous thought
and whisper of rebellion.</i>

152
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,518
And who would not fall to such
beneath heel of a toad?

153
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:30,087
He was discovered
secreting scraps of food

154
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:32,722
intended for journey
far from these walls.

155
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,392
Laurus cannot be faulted
for a dog turned to madness.

156
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,494
Show an animal kindness

157
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:40,229
and it will give loyalty
until the heavens fall.

158
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,231
<i>A journey that would lead to kinship</i>

159
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,233
<i>Show it nothing but the lash
with like mind of untold</i>

160
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:45,835
<i>mischief towards the Republic...</i>

161
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,171
and wonder not why it bears teeth.

162
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:51,707
<i>Shackles alone no longer
offer fair deterrent.</i>

163
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:55,010
Let us add to them with
warning of weighted stone

164
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,178
<i>and the promise of death</i>

165
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,848
for any who dare follow in such regard.

166
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,050
<i>Stop, and listen!</i>

167
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,588
<i>Make him suffer!</i>

168
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:07,223
<i>Finish that fucker!</i>

169
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,165
Must make attempt to end this.

170
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,200
It would but pair our fate with his.

171
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,368
<i>I will not stand idle</i>

172
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:21,237
while the man's life
holds in the balance--

173
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:22,305
<i>Spartacus!</i>

174
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,042
Spartacus!

175
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,278
<i>Spartacus!</i>

176
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:32,048
He will see your fucking
Republic to blood and shit!

177
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,550
<i>Spartacus!</i>

178
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,018
Spartacus!

179
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,087
Spartacus!

180
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:38,475
<i>Spartacus --
See rebellious tongue</i>

181
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:39,589
forever stilled!

182
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:40,823
<i>Spartacus!</i>

183
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,028
Die!

184
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:48,697
<i>With Spartacus that you will
all gonna have to lie!</i>

185
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:49,764
Come on!

186
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:50,765
Throw!

187
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,933
Throw!

188
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,536
<i>This is your time for retribution!</i>

189
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:55,603
Die!

190
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,071
Throw more!

191
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,075
Yeah!
Die!

192
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,343
Yeah!

193
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,487
<i>Come on, throw!</i>

194
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:32,708
You draw attention.

195
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,647
I but end suffering.

196
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:42,484
As I would for all so afflicted
by festering disease of Rome.

197
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,960
Procure a cornicen for each centuria.

198
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,530
I would not have command
obscured during battle.

199
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,432
And see tesserarius tripled in number.

200
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,467
Watch must be alert
should Spartacus attack

201
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,169
under cover of darkness.

202
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:03,838
I will not be caught unawares
as Cossinius and Furius.

203
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,907
Another message from Senator Metellus.

204
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,543
The man threatens to bury
us beneath a storm of parchment.

205
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,812
The Senate grows anxious
for our troops to move

206
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,882
from Field of Mars
in pursuit of Spartacus.

207
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,917
They are not alone in such thought.

208
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,453
Mmm, there are yet needs to be attended.

209
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,222
How stand we on account of arma?

210
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,159
<i>Sabinus and I have procured
what was requested.</i>

211
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,562
You will be well pleased.

212
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,064
Let us weigh the worth of your labor,

213
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:34,633
set achievement to scale.

214
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:36,762
You have exceeded expectation.

215
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,097
He will recognize value
of all your efforts.

216
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,800
And who most deserves
highest command beneath him.

217
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,774
<i>Vulcan himself could not have forged</i>

218
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,343
more glorious arma towards noble cause.

219
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,444
It's a rare thing...
for such blasphemy

221
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,180
to be proven in execution of skill.

222
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:05,682
I stand humbled
by the praise of Crassus.

223
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,917
<i>A straighten back, and see words follow</i>

224
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:10,253
<i>towards honest price.</i>

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,754
Ninety denarii.

226
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:15,857
My-my finest
offering.

227
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,693
And cost of less divine spectacle?

228
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:19,921
One hundred and twenty denarii

229
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:22,363
per soldier, fully equipped.

230
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:27,865
<i>As agreed upon by your noble son.</i>

231
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:32,533
A fair price.

232
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,434
Apologies, Dominus.

233
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,965
He has arrived.

234
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,470
<i>Your terms are agreeable.</i>

235
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:44,272
Tiberius will conclude our business.

236
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,474
Yes, of course,
gratitude --

237
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,109
Did I not tell you?

238
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:52,479
<i>There now stands nothing
between you and deserved title.</i>

239
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:06,959
Am I to be kept waiting
entire fucking day?

240
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:09,195
If that is my husband's wish.

241
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,362
Huh.

242
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,366
Well, one he shall not see granted.

243
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,527
Caesar!

244
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:28,896
Your men forget themselves.

245
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:34,400
You are the one that has lost mind.

246
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:38,204
Leave us.

247
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:41,807
Hmm.

248
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,509
She never did care for me.

249
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:45,143
Have you ever given her reason?

250
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:50,248
My apologies for not worshipping
her as Juno upon cloud.

251
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:54,218
I would fall to my own wife,
too long from my arms.

252
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:58,655
Cornelia has been sent
word of your delay.

253
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:02,290
Delay?

254
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,798
Is that what you term setting upon me

255
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,790
as I return through city gate,

256
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:10,516
in advance of bath or fresh robe
to erase hard journey?

257
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:14,860
I term it necessity.

258
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:17,447
Your victories abroad are well known.

259
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,672
As is your insolence

260
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,897
in waging battle against the allies

261
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:26,047
of Mithridates absent
proconsuls' permission.

262
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,472
The province would have been lost

263
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,298
if I had waited on word
from those sodden fools.

264
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:34,248
Ah, as I would've lost advantage
of lone voice upon ear,

265
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:37,330
if I had waited to break word with you.

266
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:38,725
<i>Speak plainly.</i>

267
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:40,716
I grow tired of mystery.

268
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:44,494
Ah, then let us part veil.

269
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:47,681
You hold revered name
of the Julian clan.

270
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:50,736
Sired from the bloodline of Venus.

271
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:53,856
<i>Divine mother of Aeneas,
forbearer of Romulus,</i>

272
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,547
<i>exalted founder
of Rome --</i>

273
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:58,602
I require no lesson
in my fucking heritage.

274
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:02,819
<i>Then perhaps one in mine.</i>

275
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,392
I am descendant from no god.

276
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,880
Nor man of lofty note.

277
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,643
I'm tolerated within the Senate

278
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,768
solely for the wealth I have amassed

279
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,854
through labor and dealings

280
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:17,643
<i>those with "proper"
lineage deem beneath them.</i>

281
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:22,589
And you believe this singular
cause why they hate you, hmm?

282
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,900
<i>Your campaign against Mithridates</i>

283
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,717
and um other adventures.

284
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:33,939
Costly, were they not?

285
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,286
I know you stand in considerable debt.

286
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:44,373
A dangerous place
for a man to find himself,

287
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:47,690
when he's made enemies
of the "sodden fools"

288
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,053
<i>who would see him to ruin.</i>

289
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,479
Ah, I shall see it repaid.

290
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,665
By what means?

291
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:58,050
You possess name absent wealth.

292
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:02,500
And you possess wealth absent name.

293
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:06,946
<i>Imagine what could be wrested
from highest perch,</i>

294
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:11,759
were Crassus and Caesar
to align themselves.

295
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,477
My name has remained constant

296
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:20,989
since falling from my mother's womb.

297
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,708
You have been heavy with
gold for equal years.

298
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,404
Why now suggest the pairing?

299
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:30,358
Opportunity to seize
laurels and the gratitude

300
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,150
of the Republic presents itself.

301
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:35,804
And with it, first stone upon the road

302
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:40,717
to greater glories.

303
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:43,309
What would you have me aid you in,

304
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,267
to see such a day hastened?

305
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:49,117
Bring end to slave rebellion.

306
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:52,172
And death of Spartacus.

307
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:06,203
Attius.

308
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,228
I would have words, you fucking goat.

309
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,019
Jupiter fuck me!

310
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,440
Have you lost wit coming
here, you mad shit?

311
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:15,232
You are branded an enemy of Rome.

312
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,219
I was told you hold
no love for the Republic.

313
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:21,851
Tell me you have not brought

314
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,773
the Bringer of Fucking Piss
and Shit to my very door?

315
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,731
<i>Your legend precedes you.</i>

316
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,057
<i>I bring but opportunity.</i>

317
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,649
One that you may profit greatly from,

318
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,912
if you are of a mind.

319
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,638
It would have to be very considerable,

320
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:36,530
<i>to outweigh risk of association
dragging me to depths.</i>

321
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:38,021
A river shall flow in its wake,

322
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:43,435
if we find ourselves lighted
upon favorable shore.

323
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,124
What would such a journey require?

324
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:49,367
Your skill, towards
the fashioning of swords.

325
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,858
Swords?

326
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,950
Hmm.

327
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:58,064
The fucking Aedile denies
me the crafting of weapons,

328
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,519
blame laid on fear of your rebellion.

329
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,447
All that is struck now are fucking

330
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:06,370
tools and shackles,

331
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:09,499
to keep the slaves of those
privileged fucks in hand.

332
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:12,005
The Aedile will not be of concern.

333
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,878
How many would you need?

334
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,482
Two will see our needs met.

335
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,850
You give coin enough for many
times what you ask.

336
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,119
The balance towards your discretion.

337
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,155
And what purpose will silent
tongue not speak of?

338
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,693
Do we have agreement?

339
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:45,215
Two swords, and an end to involvement.

340
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:47,317
Return as sun falls.

341
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:48,451
I would linger,

342
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:51,921
and recall joyous times
with trusted friend.

343
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:02,623
I hold concern for the Roman.

344
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:05,888
<i>Let us hope the weight of coin
anchors him to purpose.</i>

345
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,281
And what if current unwars him?

346
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,930
We shall see him dashed upon rocks.

347
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,018
Rejoin Agron.

348
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,077
Make preparations.

349
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,812
When moon is at its highest,
we shall see gate raised.

350
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,274
And fucking city fall to deserved fate.

351
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,409
<i>Attius.</i>

352
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:29,445
<i>My appetite swells.</i>

353
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,280
Where would I find holdings of grain

354
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,081
within Sinuessa's walls?

355
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,631
The finest quality.

356
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:54,199
From the fields of Sicilia.

357
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,468
I have mind towards large acquisition.

358
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,036
Ah, I'll seal that for you.

359
00:19:58,104 --> 00:19:59,505
Apologies.

360
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:04,443
My husband concludes business...

361
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:08,594
No pressing concern
until moon greets night.

362
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,957
You stand well supplied.

363
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,349
Shipment received this day from Sicilia,

364
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,084
with another to arrive upon the kalends.

365
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:15,218
Although most of that

366
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:16,766
has already been purchased by Crassus.

367
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,388
Marcus Crassus?

368
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:21,523
He favors our stores above all others.

369
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,925
And one of the few that
can yet afford cost,

370
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,326
ever rising in light of events

371
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:27,361
concerning the rebel Spartacus.

372
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:29,196
Have heard of the distress
he has caused the Republic,

373
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,731
in my travels.

374
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,800
What brings you to Sinuessa en Valle?

375
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:34,101
<i>Slaves.</i>

376
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:38,671
I find myself with ever
expanding family of them,

377
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:42,607
and would ensure they
are well provided for.

378
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,978
You have thought toward
housing them in the city?

379
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,546
It has crossed mind.

380
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,049
If you wish to see them
any form of comfort,

381
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,617
I would strike from such.

382
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:52,852
<i>Pleasure doing business with you.</i>

383
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,122
I witnessed a slave stoned
in the marketplace.

384
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,524
A common occurrence?

385
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,525
No.

386
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,628
Yet I fear it will become so,

387
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,797
if this matter of rebellion
is not soon concluded.

388
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,500
Let us pray, then.

389
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:10,938
For the proper end to it.

390
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:14,108
<i>He at last frees himself.</i>

391
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,479
You were at the stoning
this morning, were you not?

392
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,286
I was present at unfortunate spectacle.

393
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:28,755
And ended it prematurely.

394
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,630
Gratitude.

395
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:39,166
The crowd pressed towards frenzy.

396
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,469
I would not see more blood
spilled absent cause.

397
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,872
Nor I.

398
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,179
Absent cause.

399
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:11,710
Bring knife to bear upon beard.

400
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:16,181
Hmm.

401
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:19,617
Why do you pause in the face of command?

402
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:22,453
She but obeys a higher one.

403
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:24,989
The dominus orders
you to remain unshorn.

404
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,657
Toward what purpose?

405
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:29,093
His thoughts are his own in such regard.

406
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,962
And what are yours?

407
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,099
I do not understand.

408
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,534
It is a simple question.

409
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:40,903
What are your thoughts?

410
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:42,238
Towards what subject?

411
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:45,574
The one that stands before you.

412
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,777
How do you gauge Caesar?

413
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:48,811
I do not know him,

414
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,348
and can form no opinion of worth.

415
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:53,283
Demand any question,

416
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,819
and he shall break answer to aid you.

417
00:22:56,887 --> 00:23:00,757
You are taken with wife?

418
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:02,893
Your eyes stand as my wife's.

419
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:10,078
Mmm.

420
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:14,457
As does taste upon lips.

421
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:17,227
I would be reminded
of her in shadow's touch.

422
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,773
Eyes shut towards difference...

423
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:32,517
and warmed by longing remembrance...

424
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,894
Kore.

425
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,596
Remove yourself.

426
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:44,764
Yes, Dominus.

427
00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:52,005
You send gift of wine and warm embrace,

428
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:53,139
only to snatch
away --

429
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:58,945
She was not sent for your
fucking pleasure.

430
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,114
Apologies.

431
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,383
I did not know the girl held meaning.

432
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:12,058
You've been away too long
from civilized company.

433
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:14,627
See yourself to robe,

434
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:17,797
and thoughts towards
more pressing matters.

435
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,302
<i>You present yourself
with breasts and ass</i>

436
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,503
<i>formed with morning dew.</i>

437
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:27,206
<i>Is it wonder that a man strong of desire</i>

438
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:31,610
would not be tempted
to taste such ripe offering?

439
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,548
Take lesson and remove
yourself from fucking sight.

440
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:36,616
Yes, Domina.

441
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:40,022
We have not yet procured enough horses.

442
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,392
<i>I will not have cavalry found
lacking in moment of need.</i>

443
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,794
What has happened?

444
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:46,295
Nothing of concern, apologies.

445
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:51,700
Break words, and find comfort
in how they are received.

446
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:54,403
I was attending Caesar as commanded...

447
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:56,371
Caesar?

448
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:58,273
<i>Gaius Julius Caesar?</i>

449
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:01,310
He laid hands upon me.

450
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:05,580
If your father had not appeared, I...

451
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:06,814
Where is he?

452
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,653
<i>The man we hunt...</i>

453
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,155
<i>was a champion at the arena,</i>

454
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:15,023
<i>to rival any in the Republic.</i>

455
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:19,561
Yet only a gladiator,
regardless of skill.

456
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:21,964
How has he bested our legions?

457
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:23,132
Spartacus knows of war,

458
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,003
and the waging of it from
his days in Thrace.

459
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:28,371
If rumor is true,

460
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:31,140
he fought among the auxiliary
beneath the fool Glaber

461
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,243
before his fall of Vesuvius.

462
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:35,912
Then he's familiar with our tactics.

463
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,381
And has used such knowledge
to the regret of those

464
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:39,715
that have pressed him.

465
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:40,717
Hmmm.

466
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:41,885
He believes he knows

467
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:47,290
what a "proper" Roman soldier will do.

468
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:49,659
A thing that could
be turned toward advantage.

469
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:52,529
<i>Would that my own blood
stood now so sharp of mind.</i>

470
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:54,897
<i>Ah, years and the taste of battle</i>

471
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:56,532
<i>will hone your pup's teeth.</i>

472
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,768
<i>Of that I have little doubt.</i>

473
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:04,707
Yet to bring Spartacus to ground
I must have a wolf at my side.

474
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,175
Hmm.

475
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:10,046
And let us turn gleaming fang
towards moon of full purpose,

476
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:12,949
and see blood and gore matted upon fur.

477
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:15,618
<i>Curfew!
Inside please.</i>

478
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:18,054
<i>Make your way indoors!</i>

479
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:20,390
<i>Curfew!
Move, move.</i>

480
00:26:20,457 --> 00:26:21,391
Move along!

481
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:22,392
<i>Off the streets!</i>

482
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,393
<i>You move along!</i>

483
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,198
<i>Clear these streets!</i>

484
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,607
<i>Messalina!</i>

485
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:41,345
She has a habit of running wild.

486
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,980
Here.

487
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,049
You stay close to your mother.

488
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:49,052
Gratitude.

489
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,687
You inside.

490
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,332
<i>You there.</i>

491
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,907
I laid eyes upon you
in the square this morning,

492
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:14,444
did I not?
As I upon you.

493
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:16,112
Word has reached ear you spoke my name

494
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,582
upon entering gate, claiming business.

495
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,751
I fear you have been misled.

496
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,921
You have nothing I find of worth.

497
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,460
Then why are you within these walls?

498
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:30,627
Remove hand.

499
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,429
What is your purpose here?

500
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:35,432
Put question to honored
husband, and have reply.

501
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,800
He trades with the Aedile?

502
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:40,871
He does.

503
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:46,009
The mistake is mine, then.

504
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:49,246
See yourself from the streets
before nightfall,

505
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:51,848
to avoid further misunderstanding.

506
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:58,955
<i>Come along!</i>

507
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:00,356
Apologies.

508
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:03,326
I assure you, not all
in the city stand as him.

509
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:06,295
What he spoke of, removing
myself from the streets...?

510
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:08,463
Is it not troublesome?

511
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:10,733
I made attempt to dissuade my husband,

512
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,368
but he thought it best
to have streets cleared

513
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,836
of all but city guard,

514
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:17,974
<i>until the rebellion has been quelled.</i>

515
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:20,076
You have a place
to call your own this night?

516
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:22,813
Yes.

517
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,749
I have my eye towards such.

518
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:43,533
<i>Move inside!</i>

519
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,162
<i>All streets are to be cleared!</i>

520
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:49,473
<i>Curfew is in affect!</i>

521
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,541
<i>A little more securer this time!</i>

522
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,123
<i>The streets cleared by guards?</i>

523
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,525
By command of the Aedile.

524
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:09,693
Did you know of this?

525
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:10,760
Fuck yourself.

526
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:14,564
News greets me with shared ear.

527
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:16,699
Trust these will service need.

528
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:24,706
They will.

529
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:26,641
Yet there is more
we must ask of you now.

530
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,553
I thought as much.

531
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,889
Two hundred denarii a piece,

532
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:35,677
<i>and you may lay hidden
here until sun crests</i>

533
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:38,193
and curfew is lifted.

534
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,329
It is not sleep we seek.

535
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:42,598
What deformity of mind
do you think I suffer from,

536
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,100
that I would give further
aid to enemies of Rome?

537
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,785
You hold no love for the Republic.

538
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:53,502
Sentiment often belched from wine
served tongue in years passed.

539
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:57,297
Words of a drunken fool,
jealous of... priviledged wealth.

540
00:29:57,488 --> 00:30:00,390
We find ourselves heavy with Roman coin.

541
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:05,629
<i>What cost would sober intent?</i>

542
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:09,500
Five thousand denarii would
see me far from this city,

543
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:12,904
and shores of fucking Republic.

544
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:14,105
A bargain well struck.

545
00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:18,811
Call me Roman no more, then!

546
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:19,979
How many more swords do you need?

547
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:23,482
<i>Those that join us are well armed.</i>

548
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:27,619
Join you?

549
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:30,690
You move to take the fucking city?!

550
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:32,325
We move to liberate it.

551
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,460
The gate stands only in our path.

552
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,262
We would to slit throats in the night

553
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:37,496
and see it raised.

554
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,832
<i>Unexpected curfew presents difficulty</i>

555
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,634
in reaching it unnoticed.

556
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:44,704
City guard would raise
clamor well in advance --

557
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:56,483
I cannot aid you in this.

558
00:30:56,551 --> 00:31:01,221
It would mean my life.

559
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:06,160
You have forged weapons
for Spartacus himself.

560
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:10,297
If we are discovered with
your craft clutched in hand,

561
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:13,534
then they will send you
to the afterlife all the same.

562
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,710
Fuck the gods.

563
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:22,412
What would you have of me?

564
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,388
Gently.

565
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:35,058
I should not have content
fall to ruin by rough use.

566
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,893
Go fetch the rest.

567
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,461
See that they are careful.

568
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,003
You would see me weighted
with unnecessary comforts.

569
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,940
Have I grown that heavy?

570
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:51,974
These are yours?

571
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,743
I would not be found wanting,

572
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,980
if campaign stretches
beyond expectation.

573
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,716
You wish to join me,
in pursuit of Spartacus?

574
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:01,785
I wish no such thing.

575
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,687
Yet I will not be removed from your arms

576
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,622
for months threatening years.

577
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,393
Publius and I shall travel
with you and Tiberius.

578
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,396
You know women are forbidden
within encampment.

579
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,798
Yet they are not banned
from followers' camp,

580
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,901
unless rules have shifted
absent knowledge.

581
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,339
I would not have my family
bedded among slaves and whores.

582
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,107
Is it not better solution

583
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,744
than having them stricken from embrace?

584
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,449
Desire much appreciated.

585
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:35,486
Yet I could not stay mind
from thought of your safety,

586
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,354
placed so near the enemy.

587
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:41,558
I would have you remain here,

588
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:45,928
far from the threat of death
war so often promises.

589
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:51,935
Is that sole reason?

590
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,340
Father.

591
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,809
All has been attended.

592
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,478
Your army stands ready
to march upon first light.

593
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,280
News well received.

594
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:06,349
I would have word.

595
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,586
There yet lingers issue
of what title I shall hold.

596
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,587
I am possessed of leanings
towards the matter.

597
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,824
Morning sun shall
see them fall to place.

598
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,560
Have these returned
from where they sprang.

599
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:20,295
I would have house in order
before we take leave from it.

600
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,971
I thought honored position all but mine.

601
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:30,874
Now I fear he favors another.

602
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,577
Then you stand as your mother,

603
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,615
bound by blood and inconsiderate worth.

604
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,968
<i>It is a thing of rare beauty.</i>

605
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,636
Is it not?

606
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,906
Yes, Dominus.

607
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,675
You will carry it when
you face Spartacus?

608
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,578
I shall carry my father's sword.

609
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,315
<i>It is not as well bred
or considered as this...</i>

610
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,983
<i>yet it holds deeper meaning.</i>

611
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,719
Caesar will carry it then?

612
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:20,157
As your word and will?

613
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,661
I should not have placed
you within his reach.

614
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,262
He is a man of base needs.

615
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,200
Then why honor him with title,
that above your son?

616
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,569
Apologies, I overstep.

617
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:37,106
You speak your heart.

618
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:39,208
I know your concern for the boy.

619
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,977
He no longer stands as such.

620
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:45,214
But in the eyes of his father.

621
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:50,686
Would my wife could
voice such simple wisdom.

622
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:52,955
I saw the gathering of trunks.

623
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,456
She goes with you?

624
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:56,725
It was her intent.

625
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:02,431
Yet I would find
no comfort in her presence.

626
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,802
As I would in yours...

627
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,473
Is such a thing possible?

628
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,509
I will be forced to place
you within followers' camp.

629
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:16,578
But yes, it is possible.

630
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:19,047
If you so desire it.

631
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:22,383
Yes, Dominus.

632
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,486
I do not pose question as master,

633
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:26,788
but as a man.

634
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:31,593
And would have answer as one.

635
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:34,062
Yes.

636
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:40,235
It is something I desire, Marcus.

637
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,604
Fuck my ass...

638
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:25,614
Quickly!

639
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,817
We must gather more men and swords!

640
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:32,055
Spartacus is here!

641
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,374
He has had ample time.
What's become of him?

642
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,464
There's but one way to know.

643
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:45,465
Let us see it done well.

644
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:58,264
The moon nears its peak.

645
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:02,935
Yet fucking gate stands firmly rooted.

646
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,871
They will see it raised.

647
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,273
<i>Or fall in attempt.</i>

648
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,708
Ready the others.

649
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:13,211
When gate trembles,
death follows upon heel.

650
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:28,926
<i>Spartacus is within our walls!</i>

651
00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:29,927
<i>Move, come with me.</i>

652
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:31,462
See gate protected!

653
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,230
<i>You, open the storeroom!</i>

654
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,833
<i>Quickly!</i>

655
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:44,042
Reward will surely find hands for this.

656
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,146
Of that I have no fucking doubt.

657
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:02,661
<i>Attius!
Raise the alarm --</i>

658
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:05,130
<i>Call for more men!</i>

659
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,669
Hide yourself, I will find
you when it is over!

660
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,609
See gate opened!

661
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:51,779
<i>Clear the way!</i>

662
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:11,667
Move!

663
00:39:22,712 --> 00:39:24,780
Arm yourselves!

664
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:26,649
Forward towards the front gate!

665
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,837
Diotimus.

666
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:56,505
Where is Laurus?

667
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:00,009
I am here, slave.

668
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:08,312
You would turn against your
dominus and join rebellion?

669
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:10,521
Fucking animals...

670
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:33,779
<i>Diotimus.</i>

671
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,618
The villa is taken.

672
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:40,153
See yourselves free.

673
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:44,590
Move.

674
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:49,862
My dominus... <i>He is dead?</i>

676
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,733
Then I shall follow
him to the afterlife...

677
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,669
and piss upon his shadow...

678
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,224
Ulpianus!

679
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:20,392
We flee to Melia Ridge,

680
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:22,827
if they have not already sealed escape.

681
00:42:22,895 --> 00:42:23,976
Have you seen my husband...?

682
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:25,897
I have not, we must go.

683
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:27,899
I will follow once I find him.

684
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,534
May the gods protect you.

685
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:32,904
The Aedile.

686
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:34,406
Have you seen the Aedile?

687
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:38,310
You.

688
00:42:38,378 --> 00:42:40,145
You aid Spartacus?

689
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:41,714
No.

690
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:43,115
I stand the man himself.

691
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:10,742
Caesar.

692
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:15,113
I had thought to find Crassus himself,

693
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:16,514
the tone so matching.

694
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:21,552
I am proud reflection of my father.

695
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,421
<i>Tiberius?</i>

696
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:27,525
Jupiter's fucking cock,

697
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:30,127
you were but a child
since I last laid eyes.

698
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,068
Apologies.

699
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:39,671
<i>I am for my own home before we march,</i>

700
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:44,609
<i>I did not wish to stain
it with such business.</i>

701
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:48,147
Years abroad led you
to strange pleasures,

702
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:52,751
worthy of the beast you appear.

703
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:56,722
And your father...
he's not spoken to you of this?

704
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,526
He finds himself preoccupied
with more pressing concerns.

705
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:03,396
Well, I'm certain
he will share confidence.

706
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:08,268
When he deems you deserving.

707
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:09,435
You think I am not?

708
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:13,908
Sleep well, young master.

709
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:16,978
And dream of future glories.

710
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:18,946
Under my command.

711
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:17,405
Sanus.

712
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:22,711
<i>Please, let my wife live!</i>

713
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,515
The city is taken.

714
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:30,252
<i>See the Romans that yet live to chains.</i>

715
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,154
<i>Chains?</i>

716
00:45:32,222 --> 00:45:33,789
You let them live?

717
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,224
They pose no threat.

718
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:36,992
<i>Nor fucking use.</i>

719
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,296
Would they show mercy
if we were beneath heel?

720
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:47,636
<i>Still, cunt!</i>

721
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:50,305
Spartacus!

722
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,308
<i>The Aedile bars himself in the horreum,</i>

723
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,644
spilling pitch and threatens
to put light to bear.

724
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,046
Come.

725
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:01,283
I will not lend aid
to you and your animals.

726
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:02,851
If grain is put to fire,

727
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:08,523
even I will not have voice
to calm my "animals."

728
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:09,825
<i>You will do this,</i>

729
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:14,696
or see your people that
yet live fall from this world.

730
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:21,504
<i>Please.
Stay still!</i>

731
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:47,831
You will not have my city's heart!

732
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:49,733
Kill them!

733
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:52,102
<i>Kill them!
Fuck the Roman man!</i>

734
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:57,875
Make attempt on gate
and I will for all to torch,

735
00:46:57,942 --> 00:46:59,310
you fucking cunts!

736
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,982
I can take him... Agron!

738
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,250
Lower spear.

739
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:14,392
Laeta... <i>Kill them all!</i>

741
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,593
Go to him.

742
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:17,795
And pray your words hold meaning.

743
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:19,597
<i>Don't listen to his words!</i>

744
00:47:19,665 --> 00:47:21,733
<i>He's the reason we suffered!</i>

745
00:47:26,372 --> 00:47:29,307
I thought you dead.

746
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,009
You would place our fate
in her fucking hands.

747
00:47:32,077 --> 00:47:35,613
I place it in what I believe in.

748
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,183
I yet live, among a clutch of others.

749
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:40,251
How many?

750
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:41,919
Too few.

751
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:44,989
And we will be fewer still,
if you do not stop this.

752
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:46,790
You would give them
all we have worked for?

753
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:50,561
<i>I would see no more death this night.</i>

754
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:54,898
Open gate, let us see sun
crest upon another day.

755
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:56,967
I will not bow to fucking slaves!

756
00:47:57,035 --> 00:48:01,772
Turn thought from them,
and towards your people.

757
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,741
If you do this,

758
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:07,478
<i>you will condemn them
all to the afterlife.</i>

759
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:08,712
Your wife among them...

760
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:18,923
Oh, no!

761
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:41,413
He would have opened the gate!

762
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:42,848
I know he would of.

763
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,217
He would have opened the gate for me.

764
00:48:45,284 --> 00:48:47,786
I could not place faith in it.

765
00:48:56,362 --> 00:49:00,732
We have had our fill of blood
and vengeance this night.

766
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:06,137
No Roman that yet draws breath
shall suffer further harm.

767
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:08,205
The city is ours!

768
00:49:09,975 --> 00:49:13,578
<i>The city is free!</i>

769
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:15,713
<i>Once again the Romans fall!</i>

770
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:19,183
<i>Victory!</i>

771
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:28,593
<i>To see one loved robbed
of life is a heavy thing.</i>

772
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,263
One done lightly by Romans
many times to me.

773
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:34,164
It is no balm,

774
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:37,568
but know that I carry
the full weight of your loss.

775
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,007
Place her in chains.

776
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:52,818
War often carries with
it great sacrifice.

777
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,686
None more keenly felt

778
00:49:54,754 --> 00:49:57,623
than threat of those
one holds closest to heart

779
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,191
struck from this world.

780
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:05,430
I would not have
my son fall to such a fate

781
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:09,534
<i>because he was not ready for command.</i>

782
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:11,903
Nor would I deny him opportunity,

783
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:15,072
to prove himself
a man in his father's eyes.

784
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:25,248
You stand as my word and my will.

785
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:30,820
You honor me, father.

786
00:50:30,888 --> 00:50:33,690
As I shall honor the name of Crassus.

787
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:36,660
<i>Ride with Caesar
and men of your choosing.</i>

788
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:40,230
Seek out Mummius and what
remains of Cossinius' legion.

789
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:42,766
Find Spartacus and send
word of his movement,

790
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,568
but do not tempt engagement

791
00:50:44,636 --> 00:50:47,171
until I have arrived with proper force.

792
00:50:54,846 --> 00:51:00,117
<i>You fill the air with lofty promise,</i>

793
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:04,487
only to command I bow to a fucking boy?!

794
00:51:04,555 --> 00:51:06,489
He is my son!

795
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:09,192
<i>And shall be treated
with mirrored respect!</i>

796
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:20,437
I have spread coin towards your
election as Military Tribune.

797
00:51:20,504 --> 00:51:24,675
<i>Formal title Tiberius
is yet too young to hold.</i>

798
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:30,213
Wear my token to pass
unmolested through encampment,

799
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:34,685
until appearance is shorn
to Roman likeness.

800
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:37,755
I would prefer fancy sword
and expected position.

801
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:40,924
Stay upon path I have set,

802
00:51:40,992 --> 00:51:45,796
and see greater glories
bestowed at journey's end.

803
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:46,930
Hmm?

804
00:51:51,836 --> 00:51:52,836
Sound horn!

805
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:00,377
<i>We advance south on Spartacus</i>

806
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:02,913
<i>and those who follow him in rebellion!</i>

807
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:06,149
Let our shadow fall upon them...

808
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:07,885
and every man, woman, and child

809
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:11,555
so touched by it struck from this world

810
00:52:11,622 --> 00:52:14,992
by the might and glory of Rome!
