21
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:09,321

    It's gone, Richie. Okay?

22

    You and me, we're even.

  >> And you think she's here?

271
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,545
    Is that what you think?

272
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,649
         You know, uh..

273
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,184
      ...if you're really
        her best friend

274
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,921
      you know that, um...
  she doesn't have a husband.

275
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:53,691
   Even when she was married,
   she didn't have a husband.

276
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,160
       Hey, who are you?
          Who are you?

277
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,562
             Hello?

278
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,231
    <i> Hello? Miss Best Friend!</i>

279
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,233
          Who are you,
    Miss Best Friend Person

280
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,968
          who are you?

281
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,209
   There was a...blonde woman
           over here.

282
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,910
           >> I bet.

283
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,912
>> Alright, never mind.

284
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,819
              Wow.

285
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,195
     <i> So she, uh, she hasn't</i>
    <i> called yet or anything?</i>

286
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,430
             >> No.

287
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,465
 >> Is she ever late like this?

288
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,866
           >> Never.

289
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,072
     >> Well, let's not get
       worried, I guess.

290
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,508
  Maybe -- maybe it's possible
   that she, uh, I don't know

291
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,544
       hung out with some
       friends after work

292
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,546
  or got a drink or something.

293
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,681
         >> No. Never.

294
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,718
     >> It's not possible?

295
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,920
   >> No. It is not possible.

296
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,222
    She never hangs out with
   friends. She's never late.

297
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,791
She never allows me to be late.
       She never drinks.

298
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,594
She never smokes, and she never
   has left someone like you

299
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,097
    looking after me. Ever.

300
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,333
     >> Yeah, well, there's
    a first for everything.

301
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,737
  <i> >> As soon as she gets home,</i>
 <i> you can get back to your life.</i>

302
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,509
     >> Did you draw this?
            >> Yes.

303
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,013
            >> Huh.

304
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,782
 Another artist in the family.
      That's really good.

305
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,086
 You know, it reminds me, uh --

306
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,423
I draw too. I used to draw these
 flip-books when I was younger.

307
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,425
 You know what flip-books are?

308
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,263
   Anyway, I had this cartoon
    character named Sophia.

309
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,134
         Sophia and all
     her little adventures.

310
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,036
   Your mom used to love 'em.

311
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,338
      She'd laugh at them,
  she thought they were funny.

312
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,440
She thought they were real cool.

313
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,910
         I don't know.

314
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,080
 I don't remember us growing up
   with anyone named Sophia.

315
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,849
      Sometimes I wonder,
            if maybe

316
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,819
     she named you after..

317
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,954
      ...these flip-books
        I used to make.

318
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,923
         <i> I don't know.</i>

319
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,725
 <i> Maybe she mentioned something.</i>

320
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,760
 >> She doesn't talk about you.

321
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,699
       Actually, she said
  you were passive-aggressive.

322
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,367
        >> Passive what?

323
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,002
     >> Passive-aggressive?

324
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,670
     >> Passive-aggressive?

325
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,039
      Passive-aggressive?
      What does that mean?

326
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,041
        >> Look, I have
    a test tomorrow morning.

327
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,043
   So if you wouldn't mind --

328
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,286
>> You got a pencil over there?

329
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,356
  >> Make sure you return it.

330
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,665
         <i> >> Dear Vista</i>

354
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,731
         and disappear

368
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,594

 and looked like she was trying
   a key into your apartment

   <i> and then she sprinted down</i>

00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,754
     >> So, you want me to
     <i> stay</i> with Sophia now?

407
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,923
     >> Just do one fucking
          thing right!

408
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:02,192
Please, just do this one fucking
   thing that I tell you to!

409
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,262
  Can you do this? Can you get
   her out of there, please?

410
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,931
    >> Yes, fine, whatever.
          Okay. Fine.

  Blondie, get her outta here.

            Maggie?

429

00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,528
          Oh, no, no,
     that's not gonna work.

   she's not my mother, okay?

   >> She told me to take you
     out of the apartment.

437
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,774
     There was no directive
 as to any certain destination.

438
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,942
    >> There certainly was.

439
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,977
     I'm not budging until
       we sort this out.

441

  find the terms unacceptable.

442
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,416

        gotta do, okay?

443
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,486
 We are not going to my place.
 That is an indisputable fact.

   What are you looking for?

446

       I got a headache.

447
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,261
  Something with electrolytes.

448
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,296
        >> Electrolytes?
   >> Where's your bathroom?

449
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,126
     >> What are you doing?

450
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,628
          >> Nothing.

451
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,365
     >> Why? Who does this?

452
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,767
    You know who does this?
        Animals do this.

453
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,138
    Huh? I don't understand.
     Why would you do that?

454
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,673
     >> Alright, I'll check
      the security footage

455
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:30,974
     see who's responsible.

456
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,677
 >> Here's some emergency money
    for you to spend on me.

457
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,046
     >> Let's go, come on.
   <i> >> Let's clear those out.</i>

458
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,451

462

    <i> >> I can't tell you what</i>
  <i> she was brought in for, Sir.</i>

463
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,698
     <i> I can tell you she was</i>
 <i> transferred to central booking</i>

464

  What -- what happens there?

466
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:00,804
        <i> >> She's placed</i>

            <i> >> Yes.</i>

469
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,111
    >> Okay, what -- what --

470
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:09,747
     Do you know what time
      the arraignment is?

471
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,881
         <i> >> Let's see.</i>

472

    <i> is scheduled for 4 a.m.</i>

473
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,754
           >> 4 a.m.?
  Are you fucking kidding me?

474
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,323
       What am I gonna do
    with the kid till then?

475
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,024
        <i> >> I don't know</i>
       <i> how to respond --</i>

476
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,193
   >> Holy crow, I'm fucked.

00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,496
     I'm so fucking fucked.

478

           Let's go.

479
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,011
   >> What the hell is this?

480
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,014
>> It's called a bowling alley.

481
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,584
I work for the guy who runs the
  place. We can bowl for free.

482
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,753
        >> I don't bowl.
       >> You don't bowl?

483
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,389
Well, this is all that I can do

484
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,224
 for 10 o'clock at night, okay?

485
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,227
  It's either this or the bar.
     You know what I mean?

486
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,950
     >> What are you doing?

487
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,153
      >> What does it look
        like I'm doing?

488
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,922
      I'm doing homework.

489
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,224
 >> Alright, so you don't bowl.
        Okay, I get it.

490
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,026
      There's other things
      to do. There's food.

491
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,361
     There's arcade games,
   there's other activities.

492
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,998
  >> What don't you understand
        about homework?

493
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,134
>> Alright, fine, but you know..

494
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,003
 ...do you not ever have...fun?

495
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,939
       I mean, don't you
        ever let loose?

496
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,841
     >> Gymnastics is fun.

497
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,843
      >> Gymnastics. Okay.

498
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,145
  So you did a triple-backflip
      whatever you call it

499
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,714
  but you did it with the face
        of an assassin.

500
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,817
 I mean, where are the smiles?
      >> You don't smile.

501
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,386
  >> What about your friends?
   What do you do with them?

502
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,823
 >> I don't have many friends.
  Is that what you wanna hear?

503
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,392
      Just me and Mother,
     and that's just fine.

504
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,895
    >> You and Mother, huh?

505
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,066
       You ever heard of
      the movie "Psycho"?

506
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,401
    You know, there's always
      a test, by the way.

507
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,271
    Your whole life is gonna
      be a test, alright?

508
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,074
I mean, sometimes I'd skip out,
    I'd not do my homework.

509
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,476
        >> Yeah and look
      how you turned out.

510
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,387
  >> Gideon wants to see you.

511
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,690
>> Gideon would like to see me?
            >> Yeah.

512
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,559
          >> What for?
        >> I don't know.

513
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,862
>> Well --

514
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:42,232
I have -- I have my niece here,
 you know? I mean, I'm gonna --

515
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,901
 <i> We need somebody to watch her.</i>

516
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,203
        >> It'll only be
      a couple of minutes.

517
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:49,573
    >> Get somebody to watch
  my niece or I'm not moving.

518
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,310
       >> I'll watch her.

519
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,479
     >> Get somebody else.

520
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,685
         >> Look, I, uh

521
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,488
        I have to go for
        a couple minutes

522
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,924
 um, I'll be right back, okay?

523
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,060
       You'll be alright?

524
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,811
           >> Richie!

525
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,746
           >> Gideon.

526
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,581
       >> Who's the, uh,
        who's the girl?

527
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,885
>> Oh, that's...that's my niece.

528
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:36,386
          >> Oh, yeah?
            <i> >> Yeah.</i>

529
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,455
   >> Uh, brother or sister?

530
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,823
           >> Sister.

531
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,025
   <i> >> Yeah? How's she doing?</i>

532
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,227
       >> She's in jail.
      >> Now that's cool.

533
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,430
      <i> >> Calls me tonight,</i>
        <i> out of the blue.</i>

534
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,831
    <i> To torture me, I guess.</i>

535
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,268

        to her in years.

536
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,070
        >> You worked in
     The Devoe last night?

537
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:55,772
            >> Yeah.
            >> Yeah.

538
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:56,840
      >> I got this, uh..

539
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,776
 ...I got this problem, Richie.

540
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,612
     I, uh...I met someone

541
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,982
     recently, who changes
   the way that I see things.

542
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:08,819
    The way that I operate.
   It's a, um...it's a girl.

543
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,755
    It's not just any girl.
She's, you know, she's red-hot.

544
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:15,292
  <i> I wake up sweating thinking</i>
 <i> she won't be lying next to me.</i>

545
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:17,194
       Maybe I'm thinking
      I might get burned.

546
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,696
    Whatever it is, it's the
 worst-case scenario, you know?

547
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,099
        I've dreamed up
     all the bad scenarios.

548
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,034
   <i> I mean, this girl, Richie.</i>

549
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:27,404
     This girl has me under
   a fucking spell, you know?

550
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,106
     I just can't shake it.

551
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:32,442
    It scares me sometimes,
   the things I'd do for her.

552
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,844
     >> I know the feeling.

553
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,913
   >> I know you do, Richie.
 That's why I can talk to you.

554
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:40,283
   Because unlike these other
assholes, you have been in love.

555
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,286
  Am I right? With that girl?
        What's her name?

556
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,090
           >> Vista.
    >> Vista. Right. Vista.

557
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,892
    >> You're probably gonna
      be surprised by this

558
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:53,230
 since you and I don't talk so
 much, but when I met my girl..

559
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,099
...I kinda thought of you guys.

560
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,835
I thought of what you guys had.

561
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,372
      >> Well, um, what's
       your girl's name?

562
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,707
 >> See, that's the thing, man.

563
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,575
     She's, uh, she's gone,
           you know?

564
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:08,512
     She's been ignoring me
  for the past 24 hours or so.

565
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,047
  She completely disappeared,
           you know?

566
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,082
   Here. Take a look at her.

567
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,719
       <i> Beautiful, right?</i>

568
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,723
      <i> Anyway, she doesn't</i>
     <i> come home last night.</i>

569
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,392
   <i> There's no call, no text,</i>
  <i> no e-mail. There's nothing.</i>

570
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,195
   I ask around when was the
  last people heard from her.

571
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,997
  I don't like the responses,
           you know?

572
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,366
        Something about
 the tone of a person's voice.

573
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,168
    <i> So, day keeps moving on</i>
          <i> without her</i>

574
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,537
   and my imagination starts
     running wild, Richie.

575
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,606
And I start thinking about other
  guys I've seen her look at.

576
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,175
    I started thinking about
          her friends

577
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,976
     that she doesn't know
         I know about.

578
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,012
       I started thinking
     what I'd do to someone

579
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,814
 if I found out he bedded her.

580
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:47,617
 I would shackle the fucker up
 for a year and I would slowly

581
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,519
       and systematically
     torture him every day

582
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,787
  until he finally shuts down.

583
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,856
      <i> I would burn off all</i>
        <i> his fucking skin</i>

584
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,357
      <i> is what I would do.</i>

585
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,993
 These are the kinds of things
  I'm thinking about, Richie.

586
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,329
          I'm thinking
       about bad things.

587
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,331
             Right.

588
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,988
  >> So, do you recognize her?

589
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,192
           <i> >> Richie.</i>
            >> Yeah?

590
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,061
           >> You do?

591
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,063
      >> Yeah, no, I mean,
          I, uh, I --

592
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,001
  I see her, I see her around
      The Devoe sometimes.

593
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,504
I mean, I don't know her, but --

594
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,340
    >> Hard to miss, right?
           >> Right.

595
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,909
    It's the arguments about
the little things that get you.

596
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,145
         We got in some
  little spat about something.

597
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,447
     I don't even remember
   about what, and then, poof

598
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,482
she's gone. She's out the door.

599
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,552
         <i> You know where</i>
       <i> she goes, Richie?</i>

600
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,487
     She goes to The Devoe.

601
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,588
           >> Really?
            >> Yeah.

602
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,690
        She marches over
     to that shithole club

603
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,993
       she texts me that
   she found her friend Flora

604
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,062
   and that was it. That was
   the last I heard from her.

605
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,865
   I got friends over there.
I keep tabs on the competition.

606
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,435
 The bouncers tell me that she
goes into the club around 1 a.m.

607
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,970
            and then
     she doesn't come out.

608
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,339
      She goes in, but she
       doesn't come out.

609
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,175
     At least, not through
        the front door.

610
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,877
     You did the late shift
       last night, right?

611
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,514
        So I wanna know.

612
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,217
     Did you see anything?

613
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,519
     >> Did I see anything?
            >> Yeah.

614
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,022
     <i> >> Did I see anything?</i>
           >> Mm-hmm.

615
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,024
        >> My late shift
      is later than most.

616
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:38,028
 As you know, I don't...I don't
   see much of anything ever.

617
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,830
  You know, most days, nobody
    even talks to me at all.

618
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,999
      I mean, nobody sees
         anything in me

619
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,836
    and I don't see anything
     in...in anybody else.

620
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,507
And that's, uh...that's my life.

621
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,679
      >> You didn't answer
          my question.

622
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,254
       Forget it, Richie.

623
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:06,556
      You're good people,
         I just, uh --

624
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,160
 I don't know. I thought maybe
      you knew something.

625
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:12,829
     You know, it's just..

626
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:16,099
...my head is just all fucked up
      right now, you know?

627
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,134
>> I -- I'm sure that, you know

628
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:21,238
 this will all...be sorted out.

629
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,539
  I mean, these things happen.

630
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,874
      These fights, right?
            >> Yeah.

631
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,611
          >> I mean --

632
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:28,778
             Look.

633
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,183
      Heroin does strange
       things to people.

634
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,923
       >> What was that?

635
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,594
   >> I -- I was just saying
          that I think

636
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,129
       >> How'd you know
        she does heroin?

637
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,431
    How would you know that?
 >> I must have misunderstood.

638
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,733
        >> What's there
       to misunderstand?

639
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,035
 You said heroin, I didn't say
      anything about that.

640
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,070
         >> Didn't you?
 >> No, no. I didn't tell you.

641
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,207
  I haven't even told my best
 friends. Why would I tell you?

642
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,310
 >> You said that that she went
 looking for her friend Flora.

643
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:03,680
   Flora is slang for heroin.
   Flora is slang for heroin.

644
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,551
   >> You ever heard of that?

645
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,588
      Ever heard of Flora?

646
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,557
 No. Boy here knows everything
    about that, he says no.

647
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,159
  Would you fuckin' lie to me?

648
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,461
    >> I had a very intimate
  relationship with the lady.

649
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,264
     I know all her secrets
   and I know all her names.

650
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,833
      I know who Flora is.
     I know what she does.

651
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,936
    I don't know much about
many things, but I do know that.

652
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,340
    I have my niece with me.

653
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,877
     Yesterday, I would've
      told you to kill me

654
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,179
   but today I have a niece.

655
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,674
   <i> Hey, listen, it's Richie.</i>

656
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,678
      Uh...about that girl
        from last night

657
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,781
     um...Gideon is asking
        around about her

658
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,017
     and he's...he's saying

659
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,119
  that she was his girlfriend
        and I'm just --

660
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,821
      <i> >> Hold on a second.</i>

661

662
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,759
         >> Bill. Bill?

663
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:27,263
       Um, what happened
   with that girl last night?

664
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,431
           Did she --

665
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,266
  Did the police show up or --

666
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,968
         <i> >> What girl?</i>

667
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,171

         <i> >> What girl?</i>
      <i> From what bathroom?</i>

669
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,413

  <i> bathroom last night, Richie?</i>

670
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,215
  <i> Is that what you're sayin'?</i>

671
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,184
             >> No.

00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,335
      >> It's from Gideon.

811
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,612
      >> How come you guys
      don't talk anymore?

812
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,615
       >> Well, it's not
        just one thing.

813
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,951
        >> I wanna know.
   >> It's a bunch of things.

814
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:18,454
We grew up in an unhealthy home,
       your mother and I.

815
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,489
        She had you when
     she was really young.

816
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:23,292
        She had you when
      she was a teenager.

817
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:27,196
 And I guess, she didn't wanna
bring you up in that environment

818
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,098
         and I was part
      of that environment.

819
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,969
      >> So what happened
      was you grew apart?

820
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,072
     >> What happened was..

821
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,076
   ...I became a bad person.

822
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,580
     >> I -- I don't think
          that at all.

823
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,353
      I -- I think you're
         a dumb person.

824
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,459
 Oh, my God! I love this song!

825
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,041
       ¶ When I learned ¶

826

       ¶ Feeling alive ¶

827
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:50,613
        ¶ And you know ¶

828
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:53,516
       ¶ You were fine ¶

829
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:56,285
       ¶ Sharing knives ¶

830
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:59,155
         ¶ Cut and go ¶

831
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:01,891
        ¶ I just hoped ¶

832
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,860
     ¶ That you were home ¶

833
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:08,064
   ¶ It was the faintest cry
       in a sorry place ¶

834
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:13,169
    ¶ In the faintest times
   I will never forget why ¶

835
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,971
       ¶ I always liked ¶

836
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:18,407
         ¶ You and I ¶¶

837
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,209
     >> Come dance with me.
       >> I don't dance.

838
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,144
          >> Come on!
       >> I don't dance.

839
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:25,781
          >> Come on.
       >> I don't dance.

840
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:27,616
             A-ah!

841
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,853
       >> What happened?
      >> Nothing. Nothing.

842
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,588
        It's just, uh --

843
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,926
      It was an accident.

844
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,035
 <i> >> I think you need stitches.</i>

845

 <i> >> You're the public defender?</i>

846
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,488
        >> No, I am not.
    My name is Bruce Warham.

847
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,623
  >> I work for Gideon Young.
            >> Who?

848
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,726
   >> Mr. Young has asked me
        to represent you

849
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,761
  as a favor to your brother.
         >> My brother?

850
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,231
   >> From what I understand,
the gentleman who assaulted you

851
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,799
  has filed a cross complaint,
             right?

852
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,033
         >> My brother?

853
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,069
     >> I want you to know
       something. I, uh..

854
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,208
       ...I'm really glad
        that I met you.

855
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,145
  >> Richie, are you alright?
            >> Yeah.

856
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,613
          >> You okay?
          >> I'm fine.

857
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:34,049
    >> I'm sorry, Miss Hill,
  I don't have a lot of time.

858
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,218
        Are you aware of
      the cross complaint?

859
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,953
            >> Yes.

860
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,089
    <i> >> You should know that</i>

861
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:44,093
even though you're the one with
the shiner, he also has grounds.

862
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:46,729
          >> Grounds?
        Grounds to what?

863
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,998
         >> Oh, my God.
     You're bleeding a lot.

864
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,866
  >> There's a pharmacy there.
         >> No, no, no.

865
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:54,203
     >> I'm gonna go there.
 I promise, I'll be right back.

            <i> for one.</i>

867
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,375
    He could press charges,
     although I don't think

868
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,876
   that's very likely, but..

869
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:04,180
 ...they could try and frame it
that way. You should know that.

870
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,115
         >> Excuse me.

871
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:08,117
      >> This man hit me,
        he assaulted me.

872
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,219
        >> I understand.

       <i> if I'm the victim?</i>

874

   We'll get you out of here
        in a few hours.

00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,061
   <i> Miss Hill, it'll be fine.</i>

888
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,220

   This might sting a little.

889
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,222
      >> Ah! Jesus Christ!
         >> I'm sorry.

00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:29,024
        It'll be over in
       a second. Breathe.

       then breathe out.

893

This is a temporary fix. We need
   to get you to a hospital.

894
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,900
      >> No, no hospitals.

        back home safe.

898
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,876
      I just wanna do one
       thing right, okay?

899
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,912
         >> Then what?
 I'll have to worry about you?

900
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,715
 That I'll never see you again?
  That you'll be gone forever?

901
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:55,084
   Instead of thinking about
   yourself, think about me.

902
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:57,119
     How's Sophia supposed
    to go on more adventures

but there are much worse people
      out there, alright?

907
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,301

want me around you for a reason

908
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:13,669
  and they have good reasons.

        a lot of people.

910
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:18,574
   At least you wouldn't say
    that I shouldn't exist.

911
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:22,411
    >> Huh? Who -- who says
      you shouldn't exist?

912
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:25,247
            >> Dad.
        >> Dad? Darren?

913
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:27,549
     >> Yeah, he's a jerk.

914
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,952

        >> All the time.

915

          been better.

916
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,789
   I see him on the weekends.

918
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:36,925
       What does your mom
        say about this?

        It's just noise.

920
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,030
 He called me a failed abortion
    in front of his friends.

      Just the way he is.

 Does he still work at that, uh

00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,345
   the store down the street?
       That music store?

       No, I do not, sir.

1083
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:49,110
     At the time that this
      incident took place

1084
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,879
   I was under the influence
  of a menopausal medication.

1085
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,915
     I don't remember much
   of anything that happened.

1086
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,717
     >> Let's take a walk.
      >> Until a couple --

1087
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:57,418
 >> Maybe you'll remember this.

1088
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,855
>> Listen, my niece is up there,
okay? You gotta let me back up.

1089
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:03,825
   >> If we ever see you here
 again, we'll call the police.

1090
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:05,360
>> Please let me back up there.

1091
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:08,062
     >> You have 2 minutes
       to get outta here.

1092
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,864
      >> Come on. Come on!

1093
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:55,276

1095
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:00,415

       <i> for so many years.</i>

1097
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,286
 <i> I wonder if it's better to go</i>

1098
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:08,923
 <i> that a loved one who's missing</i>

1099

1104
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,657
 >> Yeah, man, he's fucked up.

1105
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,559
  >> Do you know where he is?

1106
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,994
   >> No, I haven't seen him
        in like an hour.

1107
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,196
        >> Yeah, thanks.

    >> He -- he invited me.

1114
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:28,429
     Devin, it's important.
        It's important.

1118
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,818
   >> Richie! Hey, come here!

1119
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,686
   It's good to see you, man.

1120
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,189
      Hey, I'm real sorry
   about before. I fucked up.

1121
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,258
      I overreacted, okay?
>> You don't have to apologize.

1122
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,260
         >> No, no, no.
       I fucked up. Okay?

1123
01:15:32,262 --> 01:15:34,896
     I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
    >> You don't have to be.

1124
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,998
          >> Come on,
    let me get you a drink.

1125
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,533
       I've been thinking
         about it, man.

1126
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,568
       I've been thinking
     about a lot of things.

1127
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,337
  And I -- I gotta stop losing
      my temper, you know?

1128
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:46,674
  <i> I gotta approach things in a</i>
 <i> positive and constructive way.</i>

1129
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,477
      Because when I think
  about it, I was 18 years old

1130
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:51,345
        when I first got
      into this business.

1131
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:55,182
  I didn't know what the fuck
     I was doing, but I had
      a positive attitude.

1132
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,218
          I took this
   abandoned warehouse dumbo.

1133
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,787
        I turned it into
 the hottest party in New York.

1134
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:01,589
 I was cleaning 60 Gs a night.

1135
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:05,159
 I was 18, on top of the world.
    You know how I did that?

1136
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,095
    You know how I did that?
      I seized the moment.

1137
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,199
      I seized the moment.

1138
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,805
  Anyway, enough of that shit.

1139
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,107
    Did you say your sister
      was in jail earlier?

1140
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:22,143
          Or am I just
      making that shit up?

1141
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:24,579
       >> It's not jail,
  it's called Central Booking.

1142
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:26,047
  >> She's in Central Booking.
            <i> >> Yeah.</i>

1143
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,315
>> It's on Center Street, right?

1144
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:29,550
>> She gets out in a few hours.
            <i> >> Good.</i>

1145
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:31,752
         I was thinking
  about maybe picking her up.

1146
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,920
         >> You should.

1147
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,156
        >> I don't know
      what to say to her.

1148
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:37,725
      >> What do you mean?
  >> I don't know what to say.

1149
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:41,062
  >> It's easy. You just tell
       her you love her.

1150
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:42,563
           That's it.

1151
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:45,366
 >> Who else is gonna pick her
     up? She got a husband?

1152
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:49,136
  >> She has an ex-douchebag.
      <i> >> A douchebag, huh?</i>

1153
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,706
  >> Ex-douchebag. He knocked
    her up when she was 17.

1154
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:54,008
      You gotta go there.
   Here's what you gotta do.

1155
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,843
       You gotta go there
       and be supportive.

1156
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,211
           >> Right.
     >> She's your sister.

1157
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,213
    She's had a rough night.

1158
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:01,882
   I'm real glad you came by
     to my little gathering

1159
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,684
         I didn't think
      you were gonna come.

1160
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:05,886
        <i> >> I'm not here</i>
       <i> for the gathering.</i>

1161
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:08,856
    I'm here to talk to you
        about something.

1162
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:11,659
>> I think I know what you wanna
       talk to me about.

1163
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:13,427
    >> I don't think you do.

1164
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:16,063
>> People come to my gatherings
         not to see me

1165
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,598
  they come for other things.

1166
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,601
     >> No, that's not it.
 I'm not here for other things.

1167
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:21,836
       Gideon, I'm not --

1168
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:24,138
   >> I got uppers, downers,
    I got whatever you want.

1169
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,707
     You don't have to lie.
      I don't give a fuck.

1170
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,710
  >> No, listen, I don't lie.
       I don't lie. Okay?

1171
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:30,978
           >> Relax.

1172
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,781
   >> I don't lie. I want you
     to know that about me.

1173
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,583
      >> Okay, okay. Okay.
     >> No, it's not okay.

1174
01:17:35,585 --> 01:17:37,385
    Because I was dishonest
        with you before.

1175
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:41,722
   I was dishonest with you.
It's been eating me up all day.

1176
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:43,290
    And I try never to lie.

1177
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:46,427
      I hurt someone once
  by lying and it just, it --

1178
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:49,230
      I wanted you to know
  that about me. I don't lie.

1179
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:51,699
             Okay?
            >> Okay.

1180
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:54,502
       >> It's important
  that you know that about me.

1181
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:55,936
  >> Alright. It's duly noted.

1182
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:59,507
 >> Now that we've cleared that
up, I need you to do me a favor.

1183
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:01,976
          >> Alright?
          >> Alright.

1184
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:04,078
     >> Ask me what I know
     about your girlfriend.

1185
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:09,850
    >> You fuckin' with me?

1186
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,719
     >> No, I ain't fuckin'
           with you.

1187
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:14,522
I ain't fuckin' with nobody, but
 I wasn't very truthful before.

1188
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:17,391
So if you wanna redo that thing,
       you wanna go ahead

1189
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,694
       and ask about her,
     you go ahead and ask.

1190
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:20,995
            >> Okay.
            >> Okay?

1191
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:22,797
      >> What do you know
      about my girlfriend?

1192
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:26,267
  >> I know that she came into
The Devoe sometimes. I met her.

1193
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,336
     I met her a few times.
   She was a real sweet girl.

1194
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:31,839
            >> Yeah.
       >> But she's gone.

1195
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,910
         >> She's gone.

1196
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,046
>> What do you mean she's gone?

1197
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:41,215
     >> I mean she's dead.

1198
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:47,755
          She's dead.
  Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

1199
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,391
     Hold on. I don't know
  what you're doing right now.

1200
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,727
      Why you saying this?
   Let me tell you something.

1201
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,762
         You're talking
   about the love of my life.

1202
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:57,331
       >> I know. I know.
>> If you are fucking with me --

1203
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,400
          >> I'm not.
>> If you are fucking with me --

1204
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:02,636
    >> The love of your life
    died of a drug overdose

1205
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:04,505
  in the fourth bathroom stall

1206
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:06,807
     of the ladies restroom
    in The Devoe last night.

1207
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:09,543
   I was there. I found her.
         >> What? What?

1208
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:10,945
      >> She's beautiful.

1209
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:14,381
   She was beautiful to you,
  and she was beautiful to me.

1210
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:16,117
          But to Bill

1211
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:18,152
      I guess she was bad
         for business.

1212
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,687
        >> Where is she?
        >> I don't know.

1213
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:21,222
        >> Where is she?
        >> I don't know!

1214
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:24,592
>> Why are you doing this to me?
  >> I'm not doing it to you!

1215
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:27,795
  >> Why you telling me this?
  >> I'm sorry I lied to you.

1216
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:30,464
   I'm sorry I lied. I didn't
       know what to say.

1217
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,233
   I didn't know what to do.

1218
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:34,401
          Whatever you
    do to me, I forgive you.

1219
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,971
         I forgive you.
>> Why are you doing this to me?

1220
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:39,073
         >> I'm sorry.
>> Why are you telling me this?

1221
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:40,608
       >> I forgive you.
         I forgive you.

1222
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,083
         >> Pull over.

1223
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,571
            Get out.

1224
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,812
       Get the fuck out.

1225
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,411
        >> Your sister's
      fucking my husband.

1226
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,389
     >> What was your plan?

1227
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,492
        >> I don't know.

1228
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,163
      Stab her in the eye
       with a pen, maybe.

1229
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,278
        >> I'm so sorry.

1230
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,116
   I'm never gonna leave you
  like that ever again, okay?

1231
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:43,684
 >> What happened to your eye?

1232
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:52,026
 >> Go back to bed for a couple
 of hours before school, okay?

1233
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,545
         Be right back.

1234
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,835
         >> I love you.
       >> I love you too.

1235
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,199
         >> Goodnight.
           >> Night.

1236
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:18,779
  >> I can see it in her face.

1237
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:22,216
She's changed since last night.

1238
01:25:22,218 --> 01:25:23,851
  You got her liking you now.

1239
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,321
     10 hours and suddenly
     you're Mr. Wonderful.

1240
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:28,889
        >> Don't pay me.
       >> Take the money.

1241
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:30,691
   >> I don't need the money.
          >> Take it.

1242
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:32,493
   >> I don't need the money
        anymore, Maggie.

1243
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,033
   >>This is just between us.
    This whole thing. Okay?

1244
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:46,039
   I'm gonna call out of work
     for a couple of days.

1245
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:49,443
     Just do it from home.
     It's work. It's fine.

1246
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,714
    >> You don't want anyone
     seeing you like this.

1247
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:55,549
         You called me
     because you don't want

1248
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,084
          your friends
     seeing you like this?

1249
01:25:57,086 --> 01:26:00,320
    >> I've a lot of people
  depending on me. Unlike you.

1250
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,723
     There's a lot of money
          on the line.

1251
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:05,025
    I walk into that office
        with a black eye

1252
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,995
  with any scent of emotional
      baggage, it's done.

1253
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:10,497
 Everything I worked for. Gone.

1254
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:12,599
 We come from different worlds.

1255
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:15,602
       >> I know exactly
      where we come from.

1256
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:18,539
       And I know that we
      used to be friends.

1257
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,607
      We used to be close.

1258
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,879
    >> Well, we were young.
  And we could make mistakes.

1259
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:28,649
 >> Yeah, but I mean, don't you
    miss anything, you know?

1260
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:29,950
      I miss what we had.

1261
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:32,419
      >> Yeah, 'cause you
     got to be a teenager.

1262
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,888
      You got to do stuff
    that other teenagers do.

1263
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,990
          I had a kid.

1264
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:39,026
    I didn't have the luxury
         of hanging out

1265
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:41,261
          with friends
     from the neighborhood.

1266
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:43,931
  I didn't have the privilege
     of making bad choices.

1267
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,270
    Look, this is just a --

1268
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,708
          This is just
    a onetime thing, Richie.

1269
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,612
I don't want my daughter having
     any more false idols.

1270
01:26:58,614 --> 01:26:59,613
             <i> Okay?</i>

1271
01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:01,348
          So, please..

1272
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,884
      ...if you can just..

1273
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,788
           ...leave.

1274
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:16,663
     >> 4th grade, PS 164.

1275
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,901
Scottie Evans and Jimmy Knight,
        they got to me.

1276
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:25,005
 Sometimes it was a black eye.
     Sometimes they cut me.

1277
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:30,677
  Then one day, you come down
      there. You remember?

1278
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,447
      You put your fist up
      real high...and boom

1279
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:36,016
   you punched Scottie Evans
    on his chin he goes down

1280
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:39,953
 like a ton of bricks. I never
     seen anything like it.

1281
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:42,823
They said, uh, "You embarrassed
    that your little sister

1282
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:45,125
  fight your battles for you?"
       I didn't think so.

1283
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:49,830
    Just seeing you standing
        there, you know?

1284
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:53,734
  "You don't mess with Richie,
you don't mess with my brother."

1285
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:55,602
       I knew the truth.

1286
01:27:56,804 --> 01:28:00,007
    I had the coolest sister
         in the world.

1287
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,944
       And then we, uh..

1288
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:07,514
         ...we grow up.

1289
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:08,815
           We change.

1290
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:12,452
           I changed.

1291
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:18,692
And you go and you have this --
  this beautiful girl, Maggie

1292
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:21,495
     I mean, she's a one in
   a million. She's so smart.

1293
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,434
      I know you don't get
        to be like that

1294
01:28:27,436 --> 01:28:29,736
       unless your mother
    is the best of the best.

1295
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:36,677
 And then I realized that, uh..

1296
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,581
  ...some things never change.

1297
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:48,121
You're still the coolest sister
         in the world.

1298
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,314
            >> Look.

1299
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:30,050

     <i> Around 7? We'll talk.</i>

1301
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:37,123
       But if you're late
    or you disappoint Sophia

1302
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:39,426
   I'm gonna kill you. Okay?

1303
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:44,998
            >> Okay.

1350
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:59,412
   ¶ It was the faintest cry
       in a sorry place ¶

1351
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:04,717
    ¶ In the faintest times
   I will never forget why ¶

1352
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:07,353
       ¶ I always liked ¶

1353
01:37:07,355 --> 01:37:09,322
         ¶ You and I ¶

1354
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:14,794
         ¶ You and I ¶¶
