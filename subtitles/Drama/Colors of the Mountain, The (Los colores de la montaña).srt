1
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,110
Notes and testimony on
Neo-colonialism,

2
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,630
Violence and liberation.

3
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,712
NEOCOLONIALISM
AND VIOLENCE

4
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,516
This film was made with the
collaboration of peasants, workers,

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,076
students, intellectuals
and revolutionaries.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,636
To all these we express

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,956
our deep appreciation.

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,519
Data from: the Second Declaration

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,039
of Havana; the U.N.
the General Confederation of Labour

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,559
and contemporary publications

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,956
Scenes have been taken
from the following films:

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,116
Tire Die by Fernando Birri,
Mayoria absoluta by Leon Hirxmann

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,276
El cielo y la tierra>> by Joris lvens,

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,311
Extracts from Faena by Humberto Rios
Theatre Frankestein

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:25,794
We thanks l'AGER FlLM
of Rome for their collaboration

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,792
This film speaks of
neo-colonialism

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,152
and violence in Argentina

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,512
and in most of the countries
of Latin America not yet liberated

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,475
For this reason, It does not deal with
Cuba, the first free territory of America

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,957
To Che Guevara and to all those
who have fallen

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,197
In the struggle for
Latin American liberation.

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,633
THE GREAT COUNTRY

23
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,193
THE GREAT UNFINISHED NATION

24
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:16,548
my first name : VICTIM

25
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:17,677
my surname : HUMILIATED

26
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:19,922
my condition: REBEL

27
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,301
A common past

28
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,549
A common enemy

29
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,372
A common possibility

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,309
THE GEOGRAPHY OF HUNGER

31
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,878
DISPOSSESSED, SHUT OUT, DAMNED

32
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,193
WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
A FALSE HISTORY

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,597
FALSE HOPES OF WEALTH

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,598
A FALSE INTERNATIONAL VIEWPOINT

35
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,872
FALSE ECONOMIC BELIEFS

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,356
A FALSE FREEDOM

37
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,391
OUR FIRST ACT

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,397
OUR FIRST WORD

39
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,953
TO BE FREE
THERE IS ONLY ONE CHOICE

40
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,310
PUT THE PEOPLE IN POWER

41
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,633
INVENT

42
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:40,582
IDEOLOGY

43
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,519
ORGANIZE OUR REVOLUTION

44
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,952
THE DUTY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY

45
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,798
IS TO MAKE THE REVOLUTION

46
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,271
NO SOCIAL ORDER COMMITS SUICIDE

47
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,589
A LONG WAR

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,071
A CRUEL WAR

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,109
IMPUNITY

50
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,159
THE PRICE OF BECOMING MEN

51
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,151
A PEOPLE WITHOUT HATE
CANNOT TRIUMPH

52
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,917
COLONIZED MAN

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,997
FREES HIMSELF THROUGH VIOLENCE

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,355
THE UNCIVILIZED WILL TEACH
THE CIVILIZED

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,269
POWER

56
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,239
RELEASE MAN

57
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,034
ALL OUR ACTION

58
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,993
IS A CRY AGAINST IMPERIALISM

59
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,953
AND A PLEA FOR UNITY AGAINST
THE GREAT ENEMY: THE U.S.A.

60
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:14,869
"for having loved too much...."

61
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,871
Latin America is a continent at war:

62
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,312
For the ruling classes,
a war of oppression

63
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,715
For the oppressed peoples,
a war of liberation

64
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,197
1: HISTORY

65
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,279
The independence of
the Latin American Countries

66
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
was betrayed from birth

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,392
It was betrayed by the exporting elite
of the port cities.

68
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,756
In the same year Bolivar consolidated
independence in Ayacucho

69
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,993
Rivadavia signed a Trick-loan
in Buenos Aires

70
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,113
with the Baring Brothers Bank

71
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,875
British merchants took over

72
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,035
the national bank
that issued the country's currency

73
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,158
and, in the name of free trade,

74
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,114
their manufacturers invaded
the internal market

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,473
From that moment on. England
replaced Spain

76
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,831
In dominating almost
all the continent.

77
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,116
what it had not obtained before
with armies

78
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,233
It now obtained with its loans

79
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,998
The country exported wool
and imported textiles

80
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,313
It exported meat and leather

81
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,557
and imported grand pianos

82
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,075
The exporting agricultural bourgeoisie

83
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,396
thus became an agrarian appendage

84
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,953
of European industry

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,195
For the first time in history,

86
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
here, in Latin America,

87
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,075
a new form of domination
began to be applied:

88
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,672
the exploitation of colonial commerce

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,755
through the local bourgeoisie

90
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,473
This was the birth of neo-colonialism

91
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,799
To impose neo-colonialism

92
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,549
it was necessary to divide
the continent

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,633
The unity of America
was destroyed.

94
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,433
Canning's diplomacy balkanized
the South of the continent

95
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,954
The Yankee empire then completed
his work in the North and Center.

96
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,792
The colonial ambitions
of the two great empires

97
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,869
were satisfied with
Latin American blood...

98
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,117
from Mexico to the river Plate

99
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,869
One people was pitted against another

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,558
one province against another

101
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,399
In less than a century,
20 nations emerged

102
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,909
from what had been four viceroyalties

103
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,355
The Monroe Doctrine and the big stick

104
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,350
legalised open aggression
against the continent.

105
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,312
In less than a century the United States

106
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,675
carried out 41 armed interventions
in Latin America.

107
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,028
Today the impunity of such aggressions

108
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,393
Is guaranteed by the O.A.S.
(Organization of American States)

109
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,315
Balkanization first,
pan-Americanism today

110
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,790
Both are aspects of a single policy:
Neo-colonialism.

111
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,909
2: THE COUNTRY

112
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,712
Argentina: Over 4 million square
kilometers of surface area

113
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,556
and 2,800,000
of continental surface area

114
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,349
A long triangle that could hold
Spain, Italy, England, France,

115
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,908
Germany, Belgium, Poland
Holland, Czechoslovakia,

116
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,955
Austria, Denmark, Bulgaria, Hungary.

117
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,117
From the Antarctic to the Tropical
Forest, all climates

118
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,598
Immense untapped natural resources

119
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,033
A million square kilometers
of woodland.

120
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,958
Four thousand Kilometers
of ocean coastline.

121
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,551
A million square kilometers
of continental shelf

122
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,478
La Pampa, the most famous
prairies in the world.

123
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,558
A country that produces 8 million
calories of energy per capita.

124
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,150
that consumes 10 million
and needs many more

125
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,076
but exploits barely 3%
of its water power

126
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,158
and 10% of its arable land.

127
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,030
An immense country,
practically deserted

128
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,789
23 million inhabitants,
of which 70% crowded in the cities

129
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,199
45% in only one of its 23 provinces
Buenos Aires

130
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,593
where 60% of industry is concentrated

131
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,916
and the proletariat.

132
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,032
In the federal capital,
the population exceeds

133
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,760
24 thousand inhabitants
per square kilometer.

134
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,080
While in Patagonia, the ratio,
is less than 2 per square kilometer.

135
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,159
In it's socio economic structure,
Argentina is the country

136
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,592
that least resembles the rest of Latin America,
It is proportionally the most industrialised.

137
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,713
Its rural population is the smallest,
The percentage of middle class citizens

138
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,036
and the living standard
are among the highest.

139
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,630
Its working class is unionized.

140
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,633
Its intellectuals are many
and brilliant

141
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,628
but perhaps the least Latin American
on the continent.

142
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,548
This country often called
<<Pays Estancia>>>>

143
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,309
"Ranch" country"
"Cannery" country,
"Breadbasket of the World"

144
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,434
is for the Oligarchy the product
of three factors: English gold

145
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,839
Italian hands...
French culture.

146
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,354
3: DAILY VIOLENCE

147
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,398
THE VIOLENCE VISITED
ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES

148
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,831
IS A CONSTANT, PLANNED,
SYSTEMATIC VIOLENCE

149
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,078
I am a worker, one of the sacrificed
I have always worked, even on Sunday.

150
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,513
Now there isn't any work....

151
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,388
Many factories are closing...

152
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,878
The government told the police
to surround the building...

153
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,277
When they found out I had been
a union delegate...

154
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,234
A DAILY VIOLENCE

155
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:35,472
TO DOMINATE MAN,NAPALM AND POISON GAS
ARE NOT YET NECESSARY

156
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,269
THERE IS AN INFINITY OF ECONOMIC,
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL MEANS

157
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,438
JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS ARMIES

158
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,879
Sure, I'm afraid of losing my job.

159
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:57,076
Think of your family, like me.

160
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,409
The police killed three
of our friends...

161
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:03,677
They fired me because when Peron tell...

162
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,984
..they changed the whole personnel

163
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:11,060
They were shooting at us,
not in the air!

164
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,959
The police kept the doors under guard

165
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,311
Persecution in the factory

166
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,551
NEO-COLONIAL VIOLENCE DOES NOT
HAVE TO BE PUT INTO PRACTICE

167
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,070
IT IS ENOUGH FOR IT TO EXIST
POTENTIALLY

168
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,194
OUR WAR IS THE PEACE, THE ORDER,
THE NORMALITY OF THE SYSTEM

169
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,591
75% of Argentine workers cannot satisfy
their basic needs with what they earn.

170
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,516
The buying power of wages

171
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,392
has fallen by 40% in recent years.

172
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,798
Working hours for wage-earners

173
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,355
have risen to 11 hours a day.

174
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,118
Our country has one million
farm workers

175
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,159
but only half have a permanent job.

176
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,355
Latin America, out of a surface area
of 20 million square kilometers

177
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,633
only 6% of arable land
is under cultivation

178
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,193
The latifundio :50% of the land,

179
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,631
is in the hands of 1.5%
of the landowners,

180
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,713
while 80% of the population
has no land at all.

181
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,751
90% of the rural population
lives in shacks and hovels

182
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,748
no different from pre-Colombian times

183
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,031
Electricity, drinking water are lacking,
and so is common sanitation.

184
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,950
This is the breeding ground
of malnutrition, disease, and hunger.

185
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,033
In Argentina, there are 900 thousand
abandoned children.

186
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,116
In the rural zones, of every
100 babies,70 are illegitimate.

187
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,030
Of every 10 babies born alive, 4 die.

188
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,111
In Brazil: 43% of the infant population
dies of hunger,

189
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,716
300 thousand a year.

190
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,757
More children die of malnutrition every year,
than died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

191
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,873
40% of the urban population

192
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,836
lives in absolute promiscuity.

193
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,829
In Buenos Aires and surrounding areas,

194
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,034
800 thousand people live
in sub-standard housing.

195
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,277
45 million Latin Americans
lives resigned to poverty,

196
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,880
in slums and shanty towns,
"corventillos, villas miserias"
favelas, ranchardas, cantegriles

197
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,238
In Argentina:
one million cases of syphilis,

198
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,870
One and a half million cases
of tuberculosis

199
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,438
Two million cases of "mal de chagas".

200
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,914
In Latin America,
the average worker's income

201
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,634
Is 20 times less than that
of the upper classes.

202
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,879
For 110 million people
(half the population)

203
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,358
income does not reach
120 dollars a year,

204
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,790
Ten dollars a month,
-Thirty cents a day.

205
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,953
If the present rate of development
continues, the Argentines...

206
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,917
will  have to wait 70 years

207
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,111
to reach the yearly income
of today's Frenchman...

208
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,836
and 200 years to reach
that of today's American.

209
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,711
"High in the Heavens"

210
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,872
"a warrior eagle"

211
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,711
"Wings boldly upward"

212
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,679
"in triumphant flight"

213
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,473
"Blue one wing"

214
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,151
"the color of the sea"

215
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,194
"The other blue wing"

216
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,633
"the color of the sky"

217
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,313
"Hovering high above"

218
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,318
"Radiant dawn"

219
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,230
"arrow's point"

220
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,876
"it imitates the golden face"

221
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,674
"and forms a wake in the purple sky"

222
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,429
"The wing is the patio"

223
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,474
"The eagle is the flag"

224
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,992
"it is the flag"

225
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,958
"of my country"

226
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,909
"born of the sun"

227
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,709
"which God gave me"

228
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,118
4: THE PORT CITY

229
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,713
Buenos Aires nerve center
of neo colonial politics,

230
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,196
White city in a half-breed America

231
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,359
City built at the expense
of the whole country.

232
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,030
7 million inhabitants
1 million foreigners.

233
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,312
The biggest city in Latin America.

234
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,351
The fifth in the world.

235
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,113
Buenos Aires:
appendage of the great metropolises.

236
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,949
Here  a " gaucho" is as exotic
as in Paris, London, or New York
.

237
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,993
City of executives
and professional people.

238
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,038
of the caretakers
of neo-colonial interests,

239
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,435
overseers of the settlers.

240
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,514
Cradle of the vast middle class
which once used,

241
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,837
and protected by the Oligarchy,

242
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,635
now thrashes about more defenselessthan ever before
.

243
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,829
The petty bourgeoisie:
snivels over an upset world.

244
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,358
For it, the country is intolerable,
but unchangeable.

245
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,434
Change is necessary, but impossible.

246
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,236
Deeply attached to its own status
and prestige,

247
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,039
but quick to follow
the latest European fashions

248
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,470
the latest European fashions.

249
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,355
Satisfied by edifying speeches,
by psychologists,

250
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,835
and moralizing TV programs.

251
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,636
Buenos Aires: city that turns
its back on the country,

252
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,195
In the huge Rio de la Plata.

253
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,075
Here the statues inspire more
distrust than awe.

254
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,238
Seat of government of the curia,

255
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,955
of the press,
of Army headquarters,

256
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,311
and 80%  of the country's gangsters.

257
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,997
Here the interest in life
of the nation is concentrated.

258
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,232
Here monuments have been raised
to the man who said:

259
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,319
"These provinces want to belong
to England"

260
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,273
"to obey it's laws,
be subject to it's government

261
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,315
"Live under it's powerful influence"
CARLOS MARIA DE ALVEAR

262
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,840
5: THE OLIGARCHY

263
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,673
2 million 500 thousand,
2 million 500 thousand...

264
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,153
Prize champion two-year-old

265
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,872
Excellent quality,
wonderful expression...

266
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,233
very male, powerful, well-boned...

267
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,951
A bull of the San Juan type,
with all the qualities

268
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,116
A bull that belongs to the modern line.

269
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,632
On sale here, Pereira's
prize champion two year old..

270
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,676
We have an offer of 2 million pesos.

271
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,720
Agrarian Argentine society,

272
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,670
the traditional center of our Oligarchy.

273
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,911
Here they are  the
50 families of Buenos Aires

274
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,795
who have taken over
ten million acres of land

275
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,389
One family, the Braum Menendez Behetys,
owns 15 million acres. Here they are

276
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,599
2% of the cattlemen,
own 40% of the livestock.

277
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,476
Barely 5% of the active population

278
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:32,197
which every year makes off
with 42% of national income.

279
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,470
The owners of the country!

280
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,513
Yesterday clinging to the one-crop
system and English capital.

281
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,118
today associated with the
industrial bourgeoisie

282
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,595
and American financial capital.

283
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,432
87 million acres

284
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,315
in the hands of foreign corporations.

285
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,798
Our ancestors built
the country's greatness,

286
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,117
Furthermore, you see, our aristocracy.
in many ways resembles the European.

287
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,995
I remember once in London,
guest of Lord Grifford.

288
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,510
speaking of our aristocracy

289
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,599
he himself compared it
to the Polish nobility.

290
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,552
As in the case of one
of the Carcano girls.

291
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,113
who married Lord Astor.

292
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,791
And then the other girl, Janita Diaz.

293
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,750
the foundling they adopted,
who married the Duke of Luin.

294
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,277
We don't really have much money.

295
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,111
Today we're as worthless.

296
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,197
as a businessman who sells cloth.

297
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,838
And yet we have lived drinking mate

298
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,033
with "espinillo" or "tala" wood.

299
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,154
Because at one time we had soldiers,
who were great civilians.

300
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,992
I want you to know that General Mitre
translated Dante.

301
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,875
wrote poetry and was a well-known
journalist.

302
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,312
who invented the paper "la Nacion"

303
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,637
General Rocca was also
a highly educated man.

304
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,436
And General Augustin P Justo,
who few remember

305
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,471
Had the best library
of Argentine history in the country.

306
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,354
What do these modern folks know?

307
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,357
Up to a year ago you could go
to Punta del Est. But now?

308
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,119
Last year it was already unbearable.
There wasn't a corner not full of upstarts!

309
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,155
I'd like to live in the United States.

310
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,591
There, if you want to go out somewhere, you find
thousands of places to go, things to see

311
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,278
For example, you walk around Paris.
and Paris really...

312
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,270
if the French built it,
It's already a demonstration.

313
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,314
et to know Klee, and at least
3 of Miller's works.

314
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,150
and Saint-John Perse
and Antonio Artaud

315
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,148
and abstract and concrete art,
Pop and Op.

316
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,920
Really it's unbelievable.

317
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,396
She takes these country girls
into the house to work

318
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,673
and last time she gave them
a mattress of my sister's

319
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,678
Within two days she's burned it.
Now she makes her sleep on the floor.

320
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,718
Present, the government

321
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,471
really intend to straighten things out.

322
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,755
That's what the people need.

323
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,437
During all these years,
the General Confederation of Labour

324
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,079
promised things
and gathered in the money.

325
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,511
This General Confederation of Labour
is a huge enterprise.

326
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,917
It's actually a very powerful bank.

327
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,634
But what does it do with all that money.
Nothing!

328
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,991
The Union delegates go around
in cars and silk suits

329
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,228
and if you meet one on the street dressed
like that, well they're just like hicks.

330
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,070
You can't compare them

331
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,396
with a boy from a good family

332
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,954
raised in a prep school,
Saint George's for example,

333
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,598
who associates with human circles,

334
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,712
ethic circles, that’s the right
word ethic!.

335
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,955
He grows with a Christian conception

336
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,230
of the family and society.

337
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,911
you can’t compare him with
one of those sorts.

338
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,510
They're completely uncultured
individuals. Downright illiterate..

339
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,110
Generally, they either learn to write

340
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,470
or get someone else to write
their speeches.

341
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,070
They feel themselves foreigners
in their own country.

342
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,358
They are recalling their golden years.
La Belle Époque !

343
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,634
Here They are,. Yesterday they boasted
of their Spanish descent

344
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,949
today, of their ties with Europe
and the United States.

345
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,551
Here they are.
In the name of liberalism,

346
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,399
They have exterminated
the native population.,

347
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,910
They have turned the country
into a blood bath many times.

348
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,873
Here they are. Guilty of the violence
daily visited on the people.

349
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,709
much to the frustration
of many generations of Argentines.

350
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,549
This is their cemetery.

351
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,874
To crystallize history.

352
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,636
To stop time.

353
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,789
To take the past as a future.

354
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,996
This is the dream of the Oligarchy.

355
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,278
6: THE SYSTEM

356
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,354
The Vietnamese has only
to raise his head

357
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,228
to find the enemy.

358
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,599
For us, it is infinitely
more difficult.

359
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,556
Neo-Colonialism speaks our same language,

360
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,431
has our same skin colour,our nationality

361
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,397
our religion.

362
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,396
It is not easy to recognize the enemy.

363
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,270
Working in Argentina, he operates with

364
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,436
the greatest possibility to manoeuvre.

365
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,311
There would be no neo-colonialism,
If internal power factors

366
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,274
did not make it possible.

367
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,400
In our country, these factors,

368
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,832
are today the agrarian Oligarchy
and the big industrial bourgeoisie.

369
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,269
The armed forces coordinate

370
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,790
and legalize the policy.

371
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,751
The interests of all converge under
a single sign:

372
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,837
The system.

373
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,638
The system

374
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,790
An internal enemy that throws
open the country's doors

375
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,912
to neo-colonial penetration.

376
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,390
Courtesy missions arrive
in every city.

377
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,190
Hundreds of "Peace Corps" organizations
Infiltrate the rural areas.

378
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,598
Missionaries of all religions

379
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,554
swarm over the remotest parts
of every country.

380
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,392
Scholarships and loans
are freely awarded,

381
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,720
and subsidies to universities,
unions and intellectuals.

382
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,752
A common goal unites this infiltration:

383
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,512
The corruption
of the national consciousness.

384
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,515
to facilitate the domination
of the country.

385
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,829
we must unconditionally respect promises

386
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,558
made by our allies,

387
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,116
to maintain their military presence

388
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,230
unequalled service to the
stabilisation of the dollar,

389
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,989
to extend our overseas investment,

390
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,069
to promote our programs
of help and collaboration

391
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,556
in Asia and Africa,
and to reinforce

392
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,230
Allies favorable to the progress of
our hemisphere.

393
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,438
7: POLITICAL VIOLENCE

394
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,552
The Latin American peoples
have no chance of changing their lot

395
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,072
through the institutions of
bourgeois democracy.

396
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,753
of 20 governments, 17 are the product
of rigged elections,

397
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,916
or coups d'etat.

398
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,833
For 12 years now, the Argentine people
have lived politically outlawed.

399
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,600
Their majority movement, Peronism,
is illegal.

400
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,832
Their leader, condemned to exile.

401
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,668
The goal the Latin American pursues,

402
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,231
in his fight for liberation,
is the restitution of his humanity,

403
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,673
that humanity which neo-colonialism
constantly denies him

404
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,959
NÉO-RAClSM

405
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,751
The man of a dependant country
will always be for dominant nations,

406
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,718
a segregated man,
an underdeveloped man,

407
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,189
a subhuman.

408
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,599
of a colonized country

409
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,757
implies direct forms of racism.

410
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,755
In the dependant,
neo-colonized countries,

411
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,438
the forms of discrimination
are more subtle,

412
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,030
but just as effective.

413
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,275
The Argentine Oligarchy
has on many occasions ,

414
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,632
enforced them in the course of history.

415
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,234
Following Sarmiento's motto:
"Civilization of barbarity"

416
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,952
the first national form of
resistance was crushed,

417
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,232
in the massacre of
"the Monorena".

418
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,753
Consequently, an anti-national,
foreign civilization was imposed.

419
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,915
Yesterday 'gauchos' or 'montoneros'

420
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,513
'crilleros' or 'chusmas'

421
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,874
Today 'descaminados' or 'grasa'

422
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,119
and to a certain extent ' mersa'.

423
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,356
Without question,

424
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,110
The people have always been denied
a human dignity.

425
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,800
In certain rural zones of the country

426
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,994
racism can do without the niceties

427
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,750
it uses in the cities
and operate out in the open.

428
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,598
The Indian is worth nothing.

429
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,273
And it's not true because
we all have the same blood.

430
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,349
We have the same blood,
but speak a different language.

431
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,198
That's why you see me naked,

432
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,555
About us, the 'criollos' years ago

433
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,514
didn't even bother themselves.

434
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,555
Nobody helped us.

435
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,712
until today.

436
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,153
We used to go around with the dogs,

437
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,558
looking for the means to stay alive.

438
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,312
Or we would take an empty can
and go down the river to fish.

439
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,399
That was our whole life.

440
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,918
Nobody helped us...

441
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,594
because the Indian was worthless.

442
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,992
Only a Christian had value.

443
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,954
Now they think they treat us
like brothers

444
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,029
because they have had to accept
their own religion.

445
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,717
They thought they
could be done with us

446
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,358
that the Indian was worthless.

447
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,434
Just like that without any reason.

448
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,710
And yet we have the same blood
and walk like them.

449
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,798
But will the colonizer ever admit

450
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,993
that the blood of the man
he has colonized is the same as his?

451
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,838
Here, in a vast region of the country,

452
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,079
men, women, individuals do not exist.

453
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,877
There are only the survivors
of the ancient Indian tribes,

454
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,193
the 'mataco' , the 'coya'
the 'chulupie'.

455
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,475
Names that in the mouth of the master
deny the victim of exploitation
his condition as a man.

456
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,555
80% of the Argentine native population

457
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,479
has tuberculosis and syphilis

458
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,829
They remain men, or potential men,
who flee the movie camera

459
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,636
to avoid the 'criollo'
or the white man.

460
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,116
Interiorized, but not convinced
of their inferiority.

461
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,438
Men who hardly speak, who hardly sing.

462
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,751
9: DEPENDANCE

463
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,555
THOSE WHO LIVE IN RUEAL AREAS SAY

464
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,275
THERE ARE MOUNTAINS WHERE
THEY MINE ENDLESS GOLD.

465
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:41,113
The thing that characterizes the Latin American
countries Is their dependence.

466
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,919
Economic dependence, political
dependence, cultural dependence.

467
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,391
First Spain, then England,

468
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,152
now the United States.

469
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,228
The history of our countries is the history
of an endless colonial sack.

470
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,636
Political independence does not exist
without economic independence.

471
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,836
Jose Marti said:

472
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,631
"A people that wants to be free
must first be free in business".

473
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,990
"Dependence does not permit
any possible development,"

474
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,949
The apparent development
of a few cities like Buenos Aires

475
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,633
only translates the growing expansion
of the great powers within our economy.

476
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,796
Yesterday, Mitre, Pellegrini, Pinedo,

477
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,111
Today Prebisch, Prigerio, Alsogray.

478
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,198
Loans and investments,

479
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,190
have always been part of the same
politics of subjection.

480
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,273
So called imperialist aid

481
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,235
Is an aid that always costs

482
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,711
he who receives it
more than he who gives it.

483
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,431
For every dollar invested
in Latin America,

484
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,234
imperialism gets back four.

485
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,677
Gold and coffee, meat and oil

486
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,077
grain and tin:

487
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,558
the labour of a people
reduced to cheap manpower,

488
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,753
has built the wealth
of the great powers.

489
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,637
In this exploitation lies the cause
of the backwardness,

490
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,593
poverty and oppression,

491
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,398
that in turn guarantee the financing

492
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,068
and prosperity of the rich nations,

493
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,238
lies the origin of that obscure word
invented by imperialism:

494
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,594
Underdevelopment

495
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,312
EVERYDAY WE EXPORT MORE,
AND GET BACK THE SAME.

496
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,194
EVERYDAY WE WORK MORE,
AND GET BACK THE SAME.

497
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,718
ARGENTINA'S FOREIGN DEBT
IS SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

498
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,431
THE FOREIGN MONOPOLIES
AND THEIR LOCAL ALLIES

499
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,837
CONTROL ALMOST
ALL THE NATIONAL ECONOMY.

500
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,638
al the meat industry,
energy, oil.

501
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,798
cereal commerce, the chemical industry
the production of cellulose,

502
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,958
70% of tungsten, 92% of lead,
98% of zinc

503
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,116
Money, Gold

504
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,278
also press agencies and the mass media.

505
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,760
10: CULTURAL VIOLENCE

506
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,039
The majority of the population
in Brazil,

507
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,597
in Bolivia, in Peru, in Venezuela,

508
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,389
in Guatemala, Nicaragua,

509
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,990
in Haiti, the  Dominican republic,
is illiterate,

510
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,957
70 million people. A third of the
Latin American population

511
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,072
does not know how to read and write.

512
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,676
Illiteracy and educational colonization,
go hand in hand

513
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,628
In an openly colonized country,

514
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,549
ideological penetration is not necessary.

515
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,308
But in a semi colonized country,

516
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,389
ideological penetration
plays an essential role.

517
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,992
It destroys in the people
the idea of a nation,

518
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,077
and institutionalizes and
normalizes dependence.

519
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:16,191
The primary goal of ideological penetration
is to keep the people

520
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,637
from becoming aware,
from understanding their

521
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,434
neo-colonialized position,
and from wanting to change it.

522
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,472
In this form, educational colonization

523
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,075
effectively replaces
the colonial police.

524
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,036
The middle social strata
of the population

525
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,552
are the carriers
of neo-colonial ideology.

526
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,114
The university the principal instrument
of this colonization.

527
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,554
Behind the myth of academic freedom,

528
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,276
generations of students
have been led to believe

529
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,191
that the university an island of democracy
within an oppressed nation.

530
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,639
The university

531
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,513
is an organ of existing
political power,

532
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,554
designed to mould minds suited
to the system.

533
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,874
Behind the farce of academic freedom,

534
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,436
are hidden the  ideologies
that legalize Dependence:

535
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,918
the philosophy of the one-crop economy
liberalism,

536
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,157
trade, neo-colonial development,
technocratism.

537
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,199
All authentically national thought

538
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,472
has been censured or simply ignored.

539
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,111
Thus an intelligentsia has grown up

540
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,472
that has no ties with the people
or the reality of the country.

541
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,077
Now lets visit the Pepsi Cola Salon.

542
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,316
Here Manuel Mujica Lainez,

543
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,193
member of the Argentine Academy
of Letters

544
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,269
member of the National Academy of Fine Arts
is presenting his latest book:

545
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,676
"Royal Chronicles"

546
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,838
Mujica Latinez was recently awarded
the "Kennedy" Prize

547
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,954
and before that the National
Literature Prize

548
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,119
the Municipal Prize,
the Gerchunoff Prize,

549
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,914
and the Pen Club Prize

550
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,155
and the Writer's Society Prize

551
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,397
the most important award hereabouts

552
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,033
and the Gold Medal
of the Italian Government

553
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,272
and the decoration of the French writers

554
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,233
and many other awards of the 'Gerchunhoff'
type that I really don't remember.

555
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,957
Have you been influenced
by European culture?

556
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,712
Yes, a great deal. I am a man
of European formation.

557
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,276
Even as a child I received
a classical formation.

558
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,717
For that matter,
I've done some translations.

559
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,480
impossible without such a preparation,

560
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,716
It's not just a matter
of knowing English.

561
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,597
but of capturing the
Elizabethan spirit.

562
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,110
Where would you like to live?
In Venice, always,

563
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,835
to the very last moment.
I'd like to live there forever.

564
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,395
Here everything is complicated.

565
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,750
There everything is easier.

566
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:50,518
All those kids when they have
a vacation

567
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,599
they hop on a train and go to

568
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,634
Venice, or Vienna, Madrid, Paris

569
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:04,631
wherever they please.
They're so close to everything!

570
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,072
We're so far away.

571
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,112
so out of place!

572
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,394
This opinion is shared by an intelligentsia
subordinated to neo-colonial power

573
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,759
An elite that translates into Spanish,

574
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,879
the ideology of the oppressor countries.
for the petit-bourgeois intellectuals.

575
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,355
A hybrid, depersonalized elite,,

576
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:44,396
always hiding behind something
apoliticism or objectivism

577
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,835
indifference or intelligence.

578
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,035
11: THE MODELS

579
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,158
NOTHING IS MORE LOGICAL AMONG US
THAN A RACIST HUMANISM,

580
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,318
SINCE THE EUROPEAN HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE
TO BECOME A MAN

581
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,478
BY CREATING SLAVES AND MONSTERS

582
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,638
COMRADES, LET US NOT HONOUR EUROPE

583
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,798
BY CREATING STATES,INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIETIES
IN ITS IMAGE.

584
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,958
HUMANITY EXPECTS MORE FROM US
THAN THIS CARICATURAL

585
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,118
AND GENERALLY OBSCENE IMITATION.

586
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,278
As soon as he learns to read,

587
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,718
a child in a dependant country

588
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,708
is assailed by all the models
of a civilization

589
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,595
he is forced to accept as a single,
universal value

590
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,277
Universalizing themselves
as a class and system,

591
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,837
the bourgeoisie and imperialism

592
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,510
universalize the culture
that supports their domination.

593
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,075
Behind the myth of a universal culture

594
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,400
they have hidden, in Latin America,
their interests as a colonial class.

595
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,712
Hegel said:

596
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,870
"The best thing a child can do
with his toys is break them".

597
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,873
But breaking down these values,

598
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,514
in which one has believed
since childhood,

599
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,917
To maintain itself, neo-colonialism

600
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,113
needs to convince the people
of their inferiority.

601
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,589
Sooner or later, inferior man

602
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,997
will recognize Man with a capital M,

603
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,591
And this recognition will mark
the collapse of all his defenses.

604
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,637
If you really want to be a man,

605
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,991
says the oppressor

606
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,992
you must be like me,
speak my language,

607
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,988
deny your essence,
alienate yourself in me.

608
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,990
Neo-colonized man, the intellectual,
the artist

609
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,194
have value only when they are
recognized by the metropolis.

610
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,954
The paternalism of European culture

611
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,392
conceals the deeply rooted racism
of the colonizing powers.

612
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,754
As early as the XVII Century,
Jesuit missionaries praised

613
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:26,398
the extraordinary ability of the native
in copying European works of art.

614
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,635
Copyist, translator, interpreter,

615
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,837
at best, spectator.

616
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,429
Neo-colonized man will always be led

617
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,475
to leave his own creative capacities
untapped.

618
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,358
Far from assimilating and transforming

619
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,556
the values of other cultures
to build his own,

620
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,992
he gives up all efforts at research
and invention.

621
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,234
The result is inhibition, uprooting,

622
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,078
escapism, cultural cosmopolitanism,

623
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,919
artist imitation,
the betrayal of the country.

624
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,953
The model of a universal man,

625
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,948
with universal values,
Universal culture,

626
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,869
will always win out

627
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,390
over historical and class values.

628
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,956
CULTURE WILL BECOME A UNIVERSAL FACT
AT THE SERVICE OF ALL MEN

629
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,596
WHEN WE HAVE DESTROYED
AT THE UNIVERSAL LEVEL

630
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,236
IMPERIALISM AND CLASS SOCIETY
WHEN WE HAVE UNIVERSALIZED

631
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,876
THE COMPLETE LIBERATION OF MAN

632
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,710
Christ touched the sick,

633
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,550
the dead eyes of the blind,
and made them see.

634
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,754
He touched the ears of the deaf
and made them hear.

635
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,077
He put his hands on the cripple

636
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,236
and they got up and walked.

637
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,318
The dead came back to life.

638
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,034
Good men of Jerusalem

639
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,030
unnail those two hands gently

640
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,836
all powerful, merciful

641
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,919
you will understand

642
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,476
like Veronicas

643
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,470
who understand all the suffering

644
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,992
of humanity!

645
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,833
I see the gentleman has a ring
on his finger.

646
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,032
A metal ring,

647
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,669
And his tie?
It is green.

648
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,718
any question you want to ask her.
She'll receive you in private,

649
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:51,068
because naturally, there’re questions
that can't be answered in public

650
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:55,035
Madam Diana will offer ten free
consultations.

651
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,950
Now you can ask her a free question.

652
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:06,435
Anyone who has problems,
about money, love, health

653
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,315
If you have no money, Ask away.
Madam Diana will answer free.

654
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,115
All you need is

655
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,515
faith and hope.

656
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,871
I see the gentleman has taken
the 7 of spades.

657
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,877
The 7 of spades means he's not well
he's depressed.

658
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,754
All he has to do is ask me about it.

659
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,950
"Soledad!
I've finally made Pepito confess"

660
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,553
Now I’m going to the police
They'll know I’m innocent

661
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,035
"Mamma! My luck
has finally turned!"

662
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:58,752
Priests, fortune tellers,
faith healers, counselors,

663
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,390
astrologers, professors of morals,

664
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,875
Between the system and the people,

665
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,834
there is a network of persons
whose task is to sow confusion.

666
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:17,269
Neo-colonial violence thus
also takes on sublimated forms.

667
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,593
God, Fate, destiny, Immortality

668
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,598
are made to seem responsible

669
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,509
for a situation created
by the ruling classes.

670
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,436
12: IDEOLOGICAL WARFARE

671
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,236
In Latin America,
the war is waged principally

672
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,238
in the minds of men.

673
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,835
Ideological frontiers
replace conventional ones.

674
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,398
The means of mass communication
replace conventional weapons.

675
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,512
For neo-colonialism,
mass communications

676
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,553
are more effective than Napalm.

677
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,838
An army of psychologists,
sociologists

678
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,511
motivational analysts

679
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,352
try to divide and conquer
the trade unions

680
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,791
political and student organizations

681
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,591
The popular movements are
suffocated or slandered,

682
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,749
their leaders smeared.

683
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,829
Films, magazines,
the radio and periodicals

684
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,358
try to de-politicize the people,

685
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,030
to spread skepticism and escapism.

686
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,710
Prejudices and complexities are developed
against everything native.

687
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,310
People are taught to think in English.

688
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,438
ALL MEANS OF MASS COMMUNICATION

689
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,596
ARE CONTROLLED BY THE C.I.A.

690
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,075
CENSORSHIP ABD IDEOLOGICAL
REPRESSION ARE TOTAL

691
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,795
REALITY,

692
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,194
TRUTH,

693
01:13:10,293 --> 01:13:10,964
REASON

694
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,749
ARE,

695
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,870
LIKE THE PEOPLE,

696
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,469
ON THE EDGE OF THE LAW.

697
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,758
ARTISTS AND INTELLECTUALS ARE
INTEGRATED INTO THE SYSTEM.

698
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,115
VIOLENCE,

699
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,309
CRIME,

700
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,714
DESTRUCTION

701
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,275
BECOME

702
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,469
PEACE,

703
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,999
ORDRER

704
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,430
NORMALITY

705
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,994
I am a man of European formation

706
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,394
universal, cosmic

707
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,232
We not are citizens of a country,
but of the world.

708
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,158
humanity, peace, love.

709
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,038
The 7 of Spades means he's not well

710
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,195
Ethic , that's the right word , ethic

711
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,677
Abstract art,  pop and hop,

712
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,673
MONSTROSITY DISGUISED AS BEAUTY

713
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,833
13: THE CHOICE

714
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,599
The Latin American peoples

715
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,668
are condemned peoples.

716
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,674
Neo-colonialism does not permit
them to choose

717
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,997
either their own life
or their own death.

718
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:08,989
Life and death both bear the mark
of daily violence.

719
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,670
This is our war.

720
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:18,512
Of hunger, of curable diseases
of premature age...

721
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:23,236
4 people a minute die in Latin America.,

722
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:29,433
5,500 a day.,
2 million a year.

723
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,789
This is our war!

724
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,399
A genocide that in 15 years,

725
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,074
in the First world war.

726
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:51,152
What is the only thing  left
for the Latin American?

727
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,233
To choose through rebellion
his own life.

728
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,793
and his own death.

729
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,437
For the man who dies in the struggle
for liberation

730
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,110
death is no longer the end.,

731
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,869
It becomes an act of liberation,
a conquest.

732
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,192
The man who chooses his own death

733
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,995
is also choosing his own life.

734
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,915
He is already life
and liberation itself...

735
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,317
In his revolutionary action,
the Latin American

736
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,632
recovers his existence.

737
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,109
The end of "Neocolonialism and
violence", First part of the film

738
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,869
The hour of the Furnaces X
2nd part "The time of liberation",

739
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,629
3rd part
"Violence and liberation",

740
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,389
The accounts of the Argentine people

741
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,149
during the 20 years preceding 1967.
