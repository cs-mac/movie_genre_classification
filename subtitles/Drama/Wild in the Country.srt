00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,814
    YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHAT     
    MAKES ME TICK, DON'T YOU ?  

200
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:29,553
NO.  YOU'RE A COMPLICATED       
HUMAN BEING,                    
NOT A CHEAP TIN CLOCK.          

201
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,622
YOU CAN STAY OR LEAVE           
AS YOU CHOOSE.                  

202
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,093
            WELL ?              

203
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,129
    THAT'S TWICE                
    YOU INVITED ME TO LEAVE.    
<i>THAT'S RIGHT.</i>                   

204
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,333
AND IF YOU KEEP ON PRETENDING   
THAT YOU'RE A SLOW-WITTED       
COUNTRY BOY, I'LL PUT YOU OUT ! 

205
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,303
    YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH, HUH ?  

206
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,473
WELL, I CAN BE.                 
NOW WHY DON'T WE                
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS ?          

207
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,109
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU     
IF YOU'LL LET ME.               

208
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,479
    I'M NOT EXACTLY DROWNING.   
    WHAT KIND OF HELP ?         

209
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:59,849
HOW DO I KNOW ?                 
ALL I KNOW ABOUT YOU IS WHAT    
I HAVE IN THIS REPORT.          

210
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,886
AND THAT ISN'T VERY MUCH.       
NO, THAT'S MINE !               

211
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,489
            WHAT DOES IT SAY ?  
            CAN I SEE IT ?      
    NO.                         

212
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,425
WHAT IS SAYS...                 
WOULD STAGGER A BILLY GOAT.     

213
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,430
I SEE YOU CAN SMILE TOO.        

214
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:22,172
    I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE       
    FOR BEING SO... HOSTILE.    
    THAT'S THE WORD, ISN'T IT ? 

215
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,442
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.           
YOU DIDN'T INVENT HOSTILITY.    

216
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,178
            WHAT DO YOU WANT ME 
            TO TALK ABOUT ?     

217
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,449
    ANYTHING AT ALL.            
    JUST TALK.                  

218
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,719
WHAT YOU SAY                    
WILL NEVER LEAVE THIS ROOM.     
DO YOU BELIEVE ME ?             

219
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,822
                I THINK I DO.   
                YES, MA'AM.     

220
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,026
                IT'S LIKE I'M-- 

221
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:47,331
    I'M ALWAYS WALKING AROUND   
    WITH A FULL CUP OF ANGER    
    TRYING NOT TO SPILL IT.     

222
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,235
    WHEN SOMEBODY HURTS ME,     
    I CAN'T HELP IT.  I WANNA   
    HURT 'EM RIGHT BACK.        

223
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,471
    I'VE LAID AWAKE MANY NIGHTS 
    WISHING MY PA WAS DEAD,

    <i> BUT I TRIED TO KILL HIM.</i>   

226
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,879
        I GOT THE MARK OF CAIN  
        ON ME, MA'AM.           

227
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,185
    I KNOW WHERE I'M GONNA      
    END UP AND NOT YOU NOR      
    ANYBODY ELSE CAN STOP IT.

    THINKING, GLENN ?           

230
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,511
        ABOUT THE DREAMS        
        I USED TO HAVE.         

231
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,248
        OF MONEY, FAME.         

232
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,084

    YOU WANT ?                  

233
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,923
    I COULD'VE BOUGHT MY MA     
    HER FREEDOM                 
    WITH MONEY AND FAME.        

234
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:51,595
"BOUGHT" ?                      
I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW THAT.      

235
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,804
            LISTEN, MA'AM,      
            MY MA WAS ENSLAVED  
            ON OUR FARM.

        I'VE SEEN HER...        

238
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,946
        OUT IN THE HOT SUN      
        CHOPPING COTTON...      

239
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,750
    WHILE THEM TWO MEN          
    LAID UP DRUNK AND WASTED.   

240
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,553
        SHE DONE THE MEALS,     
         SHE DONE THE CHORES... 

241
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,789
        THAT HANK WOULDN'T DO

242
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,429
        AND THEN, THAT LADY--   

243
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,565
    AND SHE WAS A LADY, MA'AM-- 

244
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:35,539
    SHE'D SOAK HER OLD STOCKINGS
    IN BUTTERMILK...            

245
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,641

    MY POINT IS I'D HAVE        
    BOUGHT MA AWAY FROM THERE   
    IF I'D HAD THE CASH.        

250
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,562
        I'D HAVE BROUGHT HER    
        INTO TOWN,              

251
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:02,999
    GIVE HER A HOUSE LIKE THIS  
    ON A QUIET STREET,          

252
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,271

    IN A ROCKING CHAIR...       

253
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,706
    AND LET HER WATCH           
    THE SEASONS COME AND GO.    

254
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,811
    <i> FROM SPRINGTIME TILL SNOW,</i>

00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:23,052
    THAT'S THE QUIET            
    SORT OF THING SHE LIKED.    

258
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,393
        SHE COULD READ TOO.     
        READ FINE BOOKS.        

259
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,597
        BUT THERE WAS NEVER     
        THE TIME.               

260
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,168
    "OH, DEAR, THIS IS UNDONE   
     AND THAT'S UNDONE."        

261
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,237

    MY MIND GONE NOWADAYS ?"    

262
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,574
        SHE SAID I'D GO

265
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:58,188
    AND THEN, JUST BEFORE       
    MY NINTH BIRTHDAY,          

266
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,991

    PRETTY WELL-OFF, YOU KNOW.

        YES, I KNOW.

OF A HAPPY, NORMAL CHILDHOOD.

00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,504
    YOU TELL THAT TO

IT'S MRS. SPEERY.

HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON ?

    A COUPLE YEARS BACK

    JUST LIKE A GIRL.           

409
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,803
DIARY'S CAN BE                  
VERY PRODUCTIVE.                

410
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,708
DID YOU EVER THINK OF WRITING   
IN A SERIOUS WAY ?

YOU TURN A PHRASE               
A CERTAIN WAY.

413
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,387
    YOU COULD WRITE,

414
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,923

"AH, NOBODY, JUST READS COMICS  
 AND SUCKS A JUG."              

420
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,946
YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR.          
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU THEN.         

421
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,916
    YOU MADE ME SMALL THAT DAY. 

422

                    SOME.       

423
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,489
DON'T YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT ? 
        IT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS
        TO TALK ABOUT IT, MA'AM.

424
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:39,029
    SEE, I WAS HELPING AT HOME, 
    AND I WAS LATE              
    GETTIN' OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

460
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:07,910

YOU'RE JUST AS LONELY           
AS YOU EVER WERE.               

461
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,912
I KNOW I AM.                    

462
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,882
        HERE'S TO LONELINESS.   

463
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,686
IF I LET MY WIFE DIVORCE ME,    
I'D LOSE ALL THIS.              

464
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:21,257
I'M JUST THE STEWARD

HER FATHER LEFT HER.            

465
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,859

IF YOU'LL MARRY ME.             

466
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,197
NOT THAT WE'D EXACTLY STARVE,   
YOU UNDERSTAND.                 

467
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,665
        I WONDER IF YOU REALIZE 
        WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.     

468
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,667
OF COURSE I DO !                

469
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,171
I'LL GET A DIVORCE IF YOU SAY   
YOU'LL MARRY ME.                
I CAN'T BE ANY CLEARER.         

470
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,741
        YOU'RE SAYING           
        IF I MAKE THE DECISION, 
        YOU'LL GET A DIVORCE.   

471
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,545
YOU WON'T MAKE THE DECISION,    
BUT YOU'LL LEAVE IT UP TO ME,   
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. 

472
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,848
            IT'S AS THOUGH      
            YOU WERE USING ME.  
    USING YOU ?                 

473
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,818
            THAT'S WHAT         
            IT BOILS DOWN TO.   

474
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,854
        LIKE A LEVER TO         
        PRY YOURSELF OUT OF     
        AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.

475
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,924
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE BEING      
QUITE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.     

476
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:58,027
I THINK YOU'RE JUST AFRAID.     
YOUR OWN FIRST MARRIAGE         
WAS SUCH AN IMPOSSIBLE--        

477
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,063
            I DON'T WANT        
            TO DISCUSS THAT.    

478
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,270
        WELL, THINK ABOUT IT,   
        WILL YOU ?              

479
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:11,907
    BRING THAT FINE ANALYTICAL  
    MIND OF YOURS TO BEAR       
    ON YOUR OWN PROBLEMS TOO.   

480
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:16,212
PHYSICIAN,                      
HEAL THYSELF ?                  
        THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA.

481
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,716
YOU'RE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE.   

482
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,119
PHIL, WHY DID YOU               
INVITE ME HERE ?                

483
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,556
        I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT  
        MY SON CLIFF.           

484
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,860
            MAY WE DISCUSS HIM  
            FOR A MOMENT ?      
    OF COURSE.                  

485
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,962
            IT'S HIS MOTHER.    

486
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,265
        YOU KNOW SHE'S          
        AS LOOSE-FOOTED AS EVER.

487
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,202
    SHE SPOILED THE BOY ROTTEN. 
    SHE'S GOT HIM HEADIN' DOWN  
    THE SAME ROAD AS HERSELF.   

488
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,972
    ONLY IN HIS CASE,           
    IT MIGHT BE A FATAL ROAD.   

489
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,107
    FATAL ?  HOW ?              

490
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:49,179
        WELL, NO ONE KNOWS THIS,
        BUT HIS MOTHER AND ME.  

491
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,481
        CLIFF HAS WHAT'S KNOWN  
        AS AN "ATHLETIC HEART." 

492
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,418
        TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING  
         TOO FAST.              

493
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,254
            I'VE TAKEN HIM TWICE
            TO THE SPECIALIST   
            IN WASHINGTON,      

494
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:03,626
    BUT IN SPITE OF IT,         
    HE'S DRINKING LIKE A FISH,  
    RUNNING WILD, IN FACT.

00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,983
    TAKE FOR INSTANCE BETTY LEE.

600
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:18,253
    AT TIMES I LOOK AT HER      
    AND I THINK... SHE'S FLAT   
    AND DRIED UP...             

601
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,622
                <i> AND SELFISH.</i>   

602
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,959
    AND THEN AGAIN I THINK      
    SHE'S WARM AND UNSELFISH.   

603
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,863
WHAT ABOUT THIS CHARACTER,      
NORRIE ?                        

604
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:31,233
        SHE WASN'T AT THE GROVE.
        I JUST WROTE HER IN.    

605
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,703
THAT'S A WRITER'S PRIVILEGE.    

606
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,971
            I EVEN GET MIXED UP 
            ABOUT NORRIE TOO.   

607
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:41,944
    SHE SAYS                    
    SHE'LL HAVE ME ANY WAY--    
    PLAIN, FRIED OR SCRAMBLED.  

608
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,479
        AND I ADMIT THAT        
        I AM TEMPTED AT TIMES,  

609
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,449
        LIKE AT NIGHT WHEN      
        UNCLE ROLFE'S OFF       
        AT THE POKER GAMES.     

610
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,451
            BUT I DON'T KNOW    
            ABOUT NORRIE.       

611
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,456
        <i> IN FACT, PROPER FOLKS</i>  
        <i> WOULD SAY SHE'S</i>        
        <i> JUST DOWNRIGHT NO GOOD.</i>

612
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,458
    WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ?        

613
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:01,530
        YOU KNOW ME, MA'AM.     
        I'M NOT PROPER FOLKS.   

614
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,002
NORRIE NEVER HAD A CHANCE.      
HER MA RAN OUT ON UNCLE ROLFE   
ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO.    

615
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,839
    HE'S TAKEN IT OUT ON NORRIE 
    EVER SINCE.                 

616
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:14,210
    BUT SHE GOT AROUND HIM...   
    ONE TIME.                   

617
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,313
SHE GOT LOST OVER THE WEEKEND   
WITH THIS FIFTH AVENUE          
NEW YORK-TYPE SALESMAN.         

618
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,317
    HE CAME THROUGH             
    IN THIS BIG, NEW, SHINY CAR.

619
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,921
            I PRETEND           
            LIKE I DON'T KNOW.  
            BUT I KNOW.         

620
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,158
    THAT BABY'S FATHER HAS      
    A BIG, GREEN CONVERTIBLE.   

621
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,461
[ Chuckling ]                   
        THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.   

622
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,831
    I DON'T LIKE TO SOUND       
    LIKE I'M BRAGGIN', BUT...   

623
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,301
    IT'S LIKE I GOT TWO GIRLS   
    WITH TWO ROADS TO GO.       

624
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,804
        <i> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?</i> 

625
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,041
YES, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.      

626
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:54,016
GLENN, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT    
THERE MIGHT BE A THIRD ROAD ?   

627
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,018
            WHAT'S THAT, MA'AM ?

628
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,754
WHAT YOUR MOTHER WANTED         
FOR YOU-- COLLEGE.              

629
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:01,323
    WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT ?   
THIS DOES, YOUR STORY.          

630
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:06,996
GLENN, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA        
HOW GOOD THIS IS ?              
HOW MUCH PROMISE IT SHOWS ?     

631
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:11,733
    DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT ?   
    I MEAN, YOU YOURSELF SAID   
    THE GRAMMAR AND SPELLING... 

632
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,271
                WAS PRETTY BAD. 
SPELLING AND GRAMMAR--          
THAT CAN BE TAUGHT,             

633
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,373
BUT THIS HAS SOMETHING          
THAT CAN'T BE TAUGHT.           

634
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,945
IT HAS SUCH BEAUTY AND POWER    
AND EXCITEMENT !                
IT JUMPS RIGHT OFF THE PAGE !   

635
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:26,748
ALL YOU NEED IS DISCIPLINE,     
FORMAL EDUCATION.               

636
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,720
    NO MATTER HOW OR WHAT,      
    YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE.

637
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,156
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.             
IT TAKES MONEY TO GO TO COLLEGE.
YOU KNOW THAT.                  

638
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,026
THERE'S SUCH THINGS             
AS SCHOLARSHIPS.                

639
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,394
LOOK, WHAT I'LL DO--            
LET ME MAKE A SUGGESTION.       

640
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,832
TAKE THIS HOME AND REWRITE IT,  
POLISH IT UP A BIT.             

641
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,001
THEN I'LL SHOW IT TO A FRIEND   
AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY.        
HE'LL TAKE IT--                 

642
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,872
    LET A LOT OF PEOPLE READ IT,
    STRANGERS ?                 
OF COURSE.  SOONER OR--         

643
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,907
    I DIDN'T WRITE THAT         
    FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO READ,   
    JUST YOU.                   

644
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,476
                YOU AND ME.     

645
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,412
THEN YOU WANNA BE AN ERRAND BOY 
ALL YOUR LIFE ?                 

646
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,217
OR SLOP HOGS ON SOME FARM ?     

647
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,418

TO BE A WRITER,                 
NOW BE ONE !

        SUPPOSE THEY START      
        LAUGHING AT ME AGAIN.

YOU TAKE THAT CHANCE.           
WHERE ARE YOUR GUTS, GLENN ?    

650
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,962
    I'M AN IGNORANT COUNTRY BOY,
    REMEMBER ?                  
OH, STOP BOASTING !             

651
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,899
    ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL         
    THAT STUFF ABOUT MY BEING   
    A WRITER, GOING TO COLLEGE. 

652
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:20,736
            WHAT ARE YOU TRYING 
            TO DO TO ME ?       
TO WAKE YOU UP, OPEN YOUR EYES. 

653
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:24,706
IS THAT WHAT THE PAROLE BOARD   
TOLD YOU TO DO ?                
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME,   

654
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,708
        NOT RILE ME UP          
        LIKE A MUDDY CREEK,     

655
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,111
    TAKE MY LIFE AND TWIST IT   
    INTO SOMETHING YOU WANT.    

656
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,881
        NOT ME, MA'AM, NOT ME.  

657
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,583
            IT SEEMS TO ME      
            YOU'RE OVERSTEPPING.

658
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,923

            I'M SORRY, MA'AM.   

659
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:45,794

    TO PUT HARSH WORDS ON YA.   

660
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,134
