1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,953
THE METHOD

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,672
<i>In an hour's time,</i>

3
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,480
<i>the IMF-World Bank summit
will begin in Madrid.</i>

4
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,956
<i>Tens of thousands of young people
have arrived here,</i>

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,913
<i>gathered by over 800
anti-globalization organizations.</i>

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,400
<i>They will be demonstrating</i>

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,239
<i>against some of the men
who decide this planet's future.</i>

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,431
There might be trouble.

9
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,518
What if I don't go to school?

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,348
Then there will be trouble!
Now, finish that!

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,120
<i>They have tried to break
the police barricade...</i>

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,991
Have you seen what's happening?

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,713
Shouldn't I take the car?

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,908
- Oh, Sandra!
- For God's sake!

15
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,354
- Who did that?
- He did.

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,039
No, she did.

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,271
- He did it.
- No, it was her.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,630
<i>As in Seattle,
Prague and Geneva,</i>

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,075
<i>it is feared there may be
acts of violence</i>

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,475
<i>prompted by the more radical
anti-capitalist groups</i>

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,399
<i>who accuse the IMF
and the World Bank</i>

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,876
<i>of being used by corporations
in order to exploit child labor,</i>

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,516
<i>sell manipulated food and
destroy the planet's resources.</i>

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,836
<i>Meanwhile, the IMF authorities...</i>

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,550
<i>are forced to listen to protests
by the demonstrators.</i>

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,274
<i>But while the latter object
to neo-liberal policies</i>

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,268
<i>the former consider that free
trade is vital for the 3rd World</i>

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,359
<i>and only a free, globalized
market can help weaker economies...</i>

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,959
No, not today, Roque.

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,628
<i>To achieve the impulse they need
in order to grow.</i>

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,796
<i>We'll shortly hear
the outcome of this summit.</i>

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,713
IMF-WB SUMMIT BEGINS TODAY
IN A BESIEGED MADRID

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,789
<i>Police controls,</i>

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
<i>streets blocked to traffic
and crowd control barriers</i>

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,593
<i>are making the city
a hell for its inhabitants.</i>

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,392
<i>Access roads are jammed</i>

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,114
<i>and tailbacks can be measured
in kilometers.</i>

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,753
<i>They want to demonstrate</i>

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,679
<i>but they won't respect
our right to work.</i>

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,838
<i>They demonstrate against
multinational corporations</i>

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,917
<i>and run from our police</i>

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,078
<i>in shoes made by
those same corporations.</i>

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,597
I'm going right here,
to the Dekia Tower.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,475
Thanks.

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,232
AGAINST THE IMF-WB
ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,710
Good morning.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,434
- The Personnel Department?
- Your I.D., please.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,677
- Floor 35.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,712
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

50
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,393
I'm here for the selection test.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,755
Very well.

52
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,834
Here you are.

53
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,555
Your letter.

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,116
Name?

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,994
It's right there.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,794
Carlos de Aristegui Santos.

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,236
You have to fill out this form.

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,552
You can do it inside.

59
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,190
Excuse me.

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,039
I've filled out this form
already, or one very like it.

61
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,831
Yes.

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,590
Good morning.

63
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,116
- Good morning.
- Hello.

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,514
Hello, there.

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,630
Hello.

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,549
That seat is taken.

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,759
Excuse me, taken by whom?

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,955
By me.

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,471
Nieves.

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,116
Carlos.

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,629
How are things?

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,316
How are you?

73
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,470
Fine.

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,479
- And you?
- Very well.

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,908
It's been ages.

76
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,832
Two years, nearly three.

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,149
Did you apply too?

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,874
Yes, what a coincidence.

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,197
- Shall we fill out the form?
- Yes, of course.

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,874
We'll talk later.

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,470
Excuse me.

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,717
Would you mind
sitting over there?

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,553
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

84
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,114
Having your back to the door
brings bad energy.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,398
Is this your first time here?

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,033
I've had two interviews.

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,036
Two?

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,915
I've had three.

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,557
Well, the first was really
a psycho-technical test.

90
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,108
Yes, I had that too.

91
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,517
Have you all come before too?

92
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,436
Anyone know what
this Gronolm method is?

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,395
Grönholm, right?

94
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,516
Grönholm.

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,190
Grönholm.

96
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,270
Yes.

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,839
Well, no, but I guess it's
the selection method they use.

98
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,554
I know that.
It even says so here.

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,798
"Grönholm
personnel selection method".

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,910
Do you know what it is?

101
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,317
I guess it's the method of
bringing the candidates together

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,755
and making us interact

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,988
to see who stands out.

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,958
Group dynamics, it's called.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,879
It's like those clauses

106
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,317
used by lawyers in multinational
companies to cover their backs.

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,516
Yes, to avoid lawsuits.

108
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,994
- Good morning.
- Hello.

109
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,348
It's logical, isn't it?

110
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,790
Today, you can be sued
for almost anything.

111
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,632
But why do they need
to be so careful with us?

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,677
I've filled this out already.

113
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,793
Excuse me, I've already filled
out a form like this.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,479
In fact, I've filled out two,

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,597
one for each interview I've had.

116
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,758
And my résumé gives
almost the same details.

117
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,670
I don't see why
I should do it again.

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,196
Everyone's doing it.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,715
Yes. And?

120
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,909
And?

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,396
I don't think I'm the only one
here who thinks this is...

122
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,636
I don't know.
Slightly humiliating.

123
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,912
- You know?
- No one's forcing you to do it.

124
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,152
- What?
- It's not obligatory.

125
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,391
Well...

126
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,270
Only fill it out
if you want to be assessed.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,872
Is there a reason for this?

128
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,074
Maybe to try our patience?
Because if that's so,

129
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,795
I'll fill it out
for a third time.

130
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,395
I don't know why
it bothers you so much.

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,797
I don't know, but I think that
with such an inflexible attitude

132
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,149
it's...

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,990
I'm saying it for your own good,
it's not my problem.

134
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,110
It's incredible.

135
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,118
I have to keep filling out forms
and yet I'm the inflexible...

136
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,151
All right, all right.

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,558
You've shown that
you don't lower yourself.

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,990
But let the rest of us do it
if we want to!

139
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,994
Thank you.

140
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,355
Thank you.

141
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,269
Thank you.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,550
Thanks, love.

143
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,591
You're welcome.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,716
What's your name?

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,830
Montse.

146
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,954
Excuse me.

147
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,555
I don't know if you noticed,

148
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,110
but the form wasn't
exactly like the others.

149
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,312
For example, it included
the Grönholm clause.

150
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,239
What now, guys?

151
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,951
- What do we have to do?
- Wait, I guess.

152
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,279
Will we be interviewed together?

153
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,549
I was told so.

154
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,432
A joint interview
with the candidates.

155
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,358
It's what I told you.

156
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,669
Group dynamics.

157
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,716
The candidates are given
a series of theoretical cases,

158
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,354
or problems that might
come up in the job,

159
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,869
and they have to discuss
the best solution.

160
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,274
So we have to wait
for someone from the firm.

161
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,033
A psychologist, probably.

162
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,314
Is it necessary?

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,671
Yes, because usually
the dynamic of these tests is...

164
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,392
<i>- How come you're here?
- I live in Madrid now.</i>

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,832
So I see.
Since when?

166
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,634
Almost 18 months now.

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,353
And how come...

168
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,839
How come you've never called me
in all this time?

169
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,436
Well,

170
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,033
no one has said anything

171
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,437
but if anyone from the firm comes
they've got nowhere to sit.

172
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,199
Maybe no one will come.

173
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,793
- What?
- Maybe not.

174
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,119
Maybe no one will come.

175
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,394
In the U.S. They have a kind
of test for selecting personnel.

176
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,034
They summon the candidates
and lock them in a room.

177
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,116
Lock them in?

178
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,433
Yes, to see how they react,
how they inter-relate,

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,831
- if anyone is conflictive...
- Who talks more, who talks less.

180
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,390
How are they assessed if no one
from the company is there?

181
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,909
I bet there are microphones
and they're listening.

182
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,718
- And cameras.
- Cameras?

183
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,916
- Where?
- I don't know, hidden.

184
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,152
In the lampshades, anywhere.

185
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,157
Is that legal?

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,550
- As if that were a problem.
- It could be.

187
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,598
Maybe that's why we had to sign
the Grönholm clause.

188
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,148
If it's illegal to use cameras,

189
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,954
signing clauses
won't make it legal.

190
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,109
I'm going to ask the secretary
what we're waiting for.

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,752
What is this? A joke?

192
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,714
Are we locked in?

193
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,270
What if I need
to use the bathroom?

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,194
Are they turning on?

195
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,318
Yes, so it seems.

196
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,396
Let's see what the machines
have to say.

197
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,952
Nothing, it seems.

198
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,072
- I've got a note.
- What does it say?

199
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,072
- Haven't you got one?
- No.

200
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,309
Shall I read it?

201
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,119
"Good morning, everyone.

202
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,035
Dekia congratulates you
on getting this far.

203
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,913
You have passed the previous
interviews and tests,

204
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,509
amply demonstrating
your experience and capacity

205
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,675
to occupy the post.

206
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,636
However, today it will be decided
who is the most suitable.

207
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,910
If at any moment

208
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,795
you consider that any
of the tests are unacceptable,

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,479
you can abandon the process.

210
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,838
No one is obliged to do anything

211
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,509
but while you remain here

212
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,633
you must accept
the conditions set out

213
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,875
in the Grönholm method."

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,875
This Grönholm method
is starting to worry me.

215
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,389
Maybe we should ask what it is

216
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,715
before we carry on.

217
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,753
The fact is,

218
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,997
if we're going to be shut
in all day

219
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,350
someone could at least
show his face.

220
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,395
It's another note.

221
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,314
"The first test..."

222
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,834
No, please.

223
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,437
"The first test is the following.

224
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,879
We've told you that you are
the final candidates

225
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,514
but not the seven
final candidates.

226
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,077
One of you is a member of our
personnel selection department.

227
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,318
Your first task is to find out
which of you is not

228
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,873
a real candidate."

229
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,711
I thought it was only
an interview.

230
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,670
It's good.

231
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,069
What's good?

232
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,750
The test. It's really good.

233
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,555
When we came in, we thought we
were all equals, all candidates

234
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,519
but we're not.

235
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,199
I've read about this.

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,919
They pretend to be candidates

237
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,076
so they can observe us up close,

238
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,869
listen to what we say.

239
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,958
Well, let's do it.
Let's find the mole.

240
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,832
I think that if there is a mole,

241
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,910
it's you.

242
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,757
I'm sorry?

243
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,710
Carlos.

244
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,434
Carlos. I'm Ana.

245
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,757
Why do you think it's me, Ana?

246
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,518
Well, you seem to be
very enthusiastic,

247
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,950
trying to direct the test
from the start.

248
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,275
That's not bad.

249
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,676
Well, I think it could be you.

250
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,269
You do?

251
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,317
Why?

252
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,354
By accusing me
you draw attention from yourself.

253
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,113
- For example.
- That's not bad.

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,515
I think it could be
either of you.

255
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,076
I suggest that
we all introduce ourselves

256
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,918
and tell others
where we currently work.

257
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,519
A mole won't tell the truth.

258
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,434
Right, that's the fun of it.

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,836
So what do you think?
Shall I start?

260
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,036
All right.

261
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,396
I'm Julio Quintana,
I'm a lawyer and an economist.

262
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,749
My last job was manager
of Rocher's commercial subsidiary

263
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,676
in Spain.

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,830
Rocher?

265
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,715
Yes, Rocher,
it's a French corporation.

266
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,870
It deals with pesticides.

267
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,548
Before that, I set up
the subsidiary in Portugal,

268
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,352
now number one in the sector.

269
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,594
Aren't you a bit over-qualified
for this post?

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,075
You think so?

271
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,675
Shall I carry on?

272
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,154
I'm Nieves Martin, I run

273
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,716
the Special Products Department
for a publishing company.

274
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,229
Special Products?

275
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,552
Collections for newspapers
and magazines,

276
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,354
packs, hybrids, and events too.

277
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,275
Anything that helps to launch
a book or collection.

278
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,988
It seems interesting.

279
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,119
Why are you leaving it?

280
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,113
You are leaving it, aren't you?

281
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,357
I want to try new things
before it's too late for me.

282
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,269
Well,

283
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,954
I'll go next, if you want.

284
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,512
I'm Carlos de Arístegui,
I'm an economist.

285
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,436
One question.

286
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,235
Is "de" part of your surname
or do you add it spontaneously?

287
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,031
It's part of it.

288
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,759
I studied economics at Cambridge

289
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,516
and mastered in Communications
at the University of Columbia.

290
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,589
Where do you work?

291
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,357
Right now, in the Communications
and Marketing Department

292
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,630
of an English cell phone company

293
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,279
soon to be set up in Spain.

294
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,956
What company?

295
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,231
Whirkel.

296
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,791
Can you two corroborate
all of that?

297
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,639
You know each other, don't you?

298
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,589
- Yes.
- No.

299
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,076
Well,

300
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,840
we haven't seen each other
for nearly three years.

301
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,588
You were working in Barcelona
when we met, right?

302
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,630
Yes.

303
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,035
And you weren't
in your present jobs then?

304
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,875
No.

305
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,353
Can each confirm that the other
wasn't a psychologist then?

306
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,149
Yes, of course.

307
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,757
We only knew each other
for a few days

308
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,714
but he wasn't a psychologist.

309
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,434
That's no use.
They could both be lying.

310
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,996
If one of them is the mole,
he'll have lied.

311
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,351
The other won't say anything,
he has an advantage.

312
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,390
We're saying what our jobs are.
You can believe it or not.

313
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,550
That doesn't matter.

314
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,149
Let's continue
and we'll be in equal conditions.

315
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,513
I'm Ricardo Arcés

316
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,918
and I won't say where I work.

317
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,956
Why's that?

318
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,034
I don't want my company
to hear about this.

319
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,678
- We're not going to tell them.
- Everything gets out eventually.

320
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,949
There seems to be

321
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
a certain lack of collaboration
in the group.

322
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,792
Excuse me, what group?

323
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,630
We're competing for the same job.

324
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,354
Well, it's my turn.

325
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,716
I'm Ana Páez,

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,275
and I'm head of production
at Minena studios.

327
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,869
Basically, we record music

328
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,595
and my idea of opening a studio in
Ibiza has had fantastic results.

329
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,633
We've had lots of people there,
from Mike Oldfield

330
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,876
to Bustamante.

331
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,150
It's been less
for the sound quality

332
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,879
and more for a few days
on the beach.

333
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,990
Apart from that,

334
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,794
the idea was very,
very profitable for the company.

335
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,431
I'm Fernando de Monagas.

336
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,791
I do add the "de" spontaneously.

337
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,114
And I too refuse
to say where I work.

338
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,154
Not out of caution,
like our colleague Ricardo,

339
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,954
but because I don't intend
to make things easier for you.

340
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,910
As clear as that.

341
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,792
If someone is observing us,

342
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,998
the first thing they'll assess
is our capacity to get results.

343
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,549
And here the result

344
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,433
is to discover the mole.
Is that clear?

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,750
Crystal clear.

346
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,474
I don't think they'll assess
only the capacity

347
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,309
to impose ourselves on others.

348
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,839
What will they assess?

349
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,954
Our capacity to work as a team,
for example.

350
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,310
Yes, we're supposed
to discover the mole,

351
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,953
not compete with each other.

352
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,751
Sure,

353
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,958
and they'll name all of us
Head of Department, a team.

354
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,910
I'm betting on the gentleman
on my left.

355
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,070
I'm betting that
he's the mole, I mean.

356
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,919
And I'm doing it
before he introduces himself.

357
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,679
- May I ask why?
- Of course, obviously.

358
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,316
You mentioned the hidden cameras,
the American tests.

359
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,070
It was you who said that maybe
no one would come from the firm.

360
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,429
And, quite honestly,

361
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,592
it seems that for you
this Big Brother-style lock-in

362
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,831
- is wonderful.
- That's got nothing to do with it.

363
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,636
I just want to have
a positive attitude.

364
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,114
You've got it, believe me.

365
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,513
May I ask how you know so much
about these tests?

366
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,790
Yes, of course.
The fact is,

367
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,753
a few years ago,
I worked in Sonivision,

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,672
an electronic components factory.

369
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,916
Yes, Sonivision. It's
on the Barcelona road, km. 65,

370
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,792
area 4, lot 16.

371
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,150
By the way, I'm Enrique León,

372
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,479
and I'm now in a similar company,
called Sonco.

373
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,592
Did you work in human resources,
personnel selection?

374
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,996
No, no. I was financial director.

375
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,634
But it was a small company,
practically family-run,

376
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,273
and someone had to do it.

377
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,869
How do you know so much
about these American methods?

378
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,109
I got into the habit
of keeping myself informed

379
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,470
about selection techniques,
group dynamics...

380
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,716
- How do you do that?
- Magazines, Internet...

381
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,435
That's where you learned about
selection, group dynamics,

382
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,198
hidden cameras and so on.

383
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,190
Yes, it is.

384
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,068
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe you either.

385
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,914
I vote for you too.

386
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,071
I vote for you too.

387
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,833
- I don't think this is fair.
- Don't take it personally.

388
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,151
Sorry, it all points to you.

389
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,238
What do you say?

390
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,351
I think they're playing with us.

391
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,875
Who?

392
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,874
They told us there was
a false candidate,

393
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,070
but I think we're all real
candidates and there's no imposter.

394
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,948
I still think it's Enrique.

395
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,150
As you wish.

396
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,389
We have

397
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,919
five votes for Enrique,
one abstention.

398
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,075
What about you, Enrique?

399
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,271
Are you going to abstain
or vote for someone?

400
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,958
And what do you want to do now?

401
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,197
Search me, or maybe lynch me?

402
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,870
No, we'll just put your name
in this box.

403
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,711
Agreed?

404
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,115
Fantastic.

405
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,238
There's another note here.
Do you have it?

406
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,519
- Shall I read it?
- Yes.

407
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,518
Now you'll have to apologize.

408
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,156
"To face the next test, you must
first choose a group leader.

409
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,797
The person cannot be chosen
by majority vote.

410
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,116
He or she must be chosen
by consensus."

411
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,239
- They don't say who the mole is?
- No, that's all.

412
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,476
They're not going to tell us?

413
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,473
Because one of us here
is not one of us.

414
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,193
There is no mole.

415
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,312
So one of us is going to be
the team leader.

416
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,794
How do we choose?

417
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,989
We don't know each other, it'll
have to be on pure intuition.

418
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,829
Well, on pure intuition,
I propose Enrique as leader.

419
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,555
I refuse to pick the mole.

420
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,432
You're really set on that!

421
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,513
Why? If he were the mole
he'd be the perfect choice.

422
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,315
- No one would have an advantage.
- What I really mean

423
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,956
is that I'm not going
to elect anyone except myself.

424
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,673
- So, if we need a consensus...
- All right.

425
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,512
If you won't collaborate, fine,

426
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,631
but please let us name a leader

427
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,479
and then the company can decide.

428
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,517
That's very good, Julio.

429
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,668
And, in fact,
I'm going to propose you.

430
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,434
Not because he voted for me,

431
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,709
but because I really see him
as a good leader.

432
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,194
I propose that we vote.

433
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,672
- Written, so that it's secret.
- Yes, it's just a first step

434
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,030
to see what support Julio has,
or Enrique.

435
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,992
They're the only proposals.

436
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,390
And Fernando.

437
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,915
All right.

438
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,236
Let's see.

439
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,436
Julio.

440
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,630
Julio.

441
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,796
Fernando.

442
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,156
Julio.

443
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,637
Abstention.

444
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,909
Enrique.

445
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,590
And Carlos.

446
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,518
We've seen through a few of us.

447
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,398
Couldn't Julio have voted for me?

448
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,598
Three votes for Julio,

449
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,710
one abstention,

450
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,480
one each for Carlos, Enrique
and Fernando.

451
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,113
- I support Julio too.
- Four votes for Julio.

452
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,959
Yes, me too, of course.

453
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,919
Abstaining was very noble, Julio.

454
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,395
Yes.

455
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,710
No.

456
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,833
- That wasn't me.
- No?

457
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,514
Five votes for Julio.

458
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,551
Five votes for Julio.

459
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,838
What do you want from me?

460
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,196
Very well.

461
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,590
Given the circumstances,

462
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,672
I wish to announce that I have
nobly ceded my vote to Julio.

463
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,554
No, don't thank me.

464
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,276
There's just one vote to clarify.

465
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,110
Does anyone not support Julio?

466
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,279
Well, it's clarified.

467
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,595
Very well.

468
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,314
Thank you for your trust,
everyone.

469
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,590
DAVID VERSUS GOLIAT

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,278
Julio, isn't that you?

471
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,279
Wasn't that a few years ago?

472
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,157
Yes, May 2001.

473
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,279
A chemical plant, right?

474
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,068
Yes, a pesticide factory.

475
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,234
You reported your company
for causing pollution.

476
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,238
I did what had to be done
to avoid a disaster.

477
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,199
- When was it?
- May 2001, it says here.

478
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,516
You were on all
the news programs.

479
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,439
We've got a national hero
among us.

480
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,993
Thank you, really.

481
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,190
I would have preferred
it hadn't gone that far.

482
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,791
You're making it hard
for the rest of us.

483
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,117
What happened
after you reported them?

484
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,153
We managed to stop the pollution.

485
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,398
A disaster was avoided.

486
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,955
- Weren't there 200 lay-offs?
- 200, yes.

487
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,509
200.

488
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,279
We had to choose

489
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,915
the lesser of two evils.

490
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,073
I tried to sort it out
from inside the company.

491
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,198
I tried to convince the Board.

492
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,716
It meant making some investments

493
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,918
and that meant reducing profits
for a few years.

494
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,195
I have a question.

495
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,951
Did you include this
in your résumé

496
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,354
or did the company discover it?

497
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,033
I didn't include it.

498
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,719
I don't hide it either,
but the fact is

499
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,554
I don't think it's part
of my résumé.

500
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,274
So, they've done their homework.

501
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,428
There's a note.

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,194
You don't have it?

503
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,351
"Now decide what you would do

504
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,435
with Julio Quintana's application

505
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,955
if you were part of this
company's Personnel Department.

506
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,074
Your decision will determine
whether or not he remains

507
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,391
in the selection process."

508
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,709
Well,

509
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,792
I think we're starting to find
out what the Grönholm method is.

510
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,149
Will they have something
like that for each of us?

511
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,919
I think, as a starting point,

512
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,669
that today, ecology and respect
for the environment

513
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,030
is a factor no decent company
can disregard...

514
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,719
If I may, Enrique.

515
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,952
I think we have to tackle
the problem head on.

516
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,353
We have to decide
if we trust Julio, right?

517
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,873
Sorry about this.

518
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,998
But you did betray
the company you were working for.

519
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,236
I didn't betray anyone.

520
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,118
I warned them, I told you.

521
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,708
I tried to talk to the Board.

522
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,269
I'm not denying
you did all you could,

523
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,631
- but you did betray the company.
- I didn't betray it.

524
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,310
They left me no other choice
if I didn't want to be part of

525
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,718
a disaster in the River Duero.

526
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,959
I don't want to pass judgment
on what you did.

527
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,037
- Well, you are.
- No, I'm not.

528
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,754
You are, from the moment
you called it betrayal.

529
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,554
We have to decide
as if we were them,

530
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,428
not judge Julio.

531
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,752
I think the secret vote
worked very well before.

532
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,514
I won't accept you calling
what I did a betrayal.

533
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,476
I tried everything I could,
they left me with no choice.

534
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,679
It's important you didn't betray
the company for your own benefit

535
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,313
but for the common good.

536
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,909
The river
would never have recovered.

537
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,999
Anyway, sooner or later,
the plant would have closed

538
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,270
and the company's image
would have been worse.

539
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,471
Just look at what
the article says about him.

540
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,715
I'm sorry to insist,

541
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
but we're not discussing
the morality of Julio's decision.

542
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,639
We're discussing whether
we'd give him the job

543
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,479
if we had the responsibility
for doing so.

544
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,831
Really, the question is
where should decisions be taken.

545
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,349
- Looking at it that way...
- No, not even then.

546
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,073
What we have to discuss

547
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,430
is the consequences
of our decisions.

548
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,238
If the company asked you,
would you do something illegal?

549
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,638
I would pick Julio,
and I'll tell you why.

550
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
In the end what matters
for a company

551
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,512
are the results of our decisions.

552
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,153
In fact, the best companies

553
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,635
are those which absorb
the best ideas,

554
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,637
wherever they come from.

555
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,108
In the case
of the chemical plant,

556
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,197
or whatever Julio's company was,

557
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,792
the problem laid within
the Board of Management.

558
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,871
It was their responsibility,
quite clearly,

559
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,799
for having accepted
a suicidal risk

560
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,797
in emptying waste into the river

561
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,116
and for not foreseeing
consequences

562
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,673
such as Julio's denunciation.

563
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,676
Exactly.

564
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,199
In fact, a rival company

565
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,516
didn't waste time
in hiring you, right?

566
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,589
All right, I don't have the data
to judge this case.

567
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,073
Maybe the rivals hired him
to improve their own image,

568
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,670
or he negotiated his departure
before reporting the damage.

569
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,118
I'm sorry, it's nothing personal.

570
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,112
It doesn't matter what we do?

571
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,119
Of course it matters.

572
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,754
I don't agree with leaving
moral judgments aside.

573
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,397
It's inevitable
to make them,

574
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,517
and it's good to make them.

575
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,554
I think that what Julio did
was right,

576
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,838
and the company was wrong.

577
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,110
What's more,

578
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,914
I'd have done the same
if I'd had no other choice.

579
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,676
None of us doubts that your aim,

580
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,070
your intention, was correct.

581
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,708
But our duty now

582
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,315
is to decide if
in these circumstances, today,

583
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,397
we'd give you the job.

584
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,355
And there is one detail
that makes me think I wouldn't.

585
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,479
Not that you put other interests
before those of your company

586
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,673
but that you were mistaken
in how you did it.

587
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,877
If you were so obviously right,

588
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,319
and the Board was so wrong on
both a moral and business level,

589
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,716
how could you not make them
see it?

590
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,190
It probably was
a company error too.

591
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,678
Sure. But it's Julio
that we're judging here.

592
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,109
My conclusion, therefore,

593
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,118
is that you were unable
to establish a correct,

594
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,356
efficient communication
with the Board.

595
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,353
That's why I wouldn't
give you the job.

596
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,317
- Shall we vote?
- Yes.

597
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,910
I have to say that,
after the debate,

598
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,509
which I thought
was very interesting,

599
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,629
I wouldn't accept Julio's
application to join this company.

600
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,795
Sorry.

601
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,999
If I were the company
I might not want to employ Julio,

602
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,555
but I'm not sure I want to vote.

603
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,712
That's very clever of you.

604
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,397
Voting means accepting
responsibility for expelling Julio.

605
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,955
That's what they call it,
expulsion.

606
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,919
The company has given us
that responsibility

607
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,429
without consulting us,
and free of charge.

608
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,075
And you've accepted it
without a word

609
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,597
and assumed that it's what
the company expects of you.

610
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,949
But

611
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,793
if it isn't so?

612
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,434
Are you sure it's what
the company wants from you?

613
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,716
So we've got three, three
and one abstention.

614
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,559
Technically, it's a draw
The company can decide, right?

615
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,995
Ana?

616
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,189
I did what I could.

617
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,390
Julio...

618
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,069
Your jacket.

619
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,430
Fucking Grönholm method.

620
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,269
What's up?

621
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,715
What's up?

622
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,878
Drop the screen bullshit.

623
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,991
Come and tell me to my face.

624
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,714
It must have been a mistake.

625
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,871
I'm sorry,

626
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,800
but I've been told
the selection test is over.

627
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,673
The team of psychologists
has decided

628
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,037
to reject your applications
to join this company.

629
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,829
I'm joking!

630
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,519
We have a little problem
with the computer connections.

631
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,789
I'll fix right away.

632
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,959
- Were you joking with Julio too?
- No, that wasn't an error.

633
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,270
Excuse me.

634
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,474
- Am I in your way?
- No, go right ahead.

635
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,914
Let's see.

636
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,832
They should turn on now.

637
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,234
That's it.

638
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,356
Well?

639
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,190
How about a break
to go to the bathroom?

640
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,636
Are there cameras here too?

641
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,198
Can you draw conclusions
from how someone pisses?

642
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,908
Nuts, isn't it?

643
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,438
- What?
- Everything.

644
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,593
It's very well thought out,
you must admit.

645
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,559
And you learn a lot.

646
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,156
The debate, for example.
At first, I thought one thing

647
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,478
and that girl, Nieves,
made me change my mind.

648
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,995
The system is very good.
Yes, very good.

649
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,315
What do you think?

650
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,509
Maybe you're the infiltrator,
with all your questions.

651
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,790
What about the business
with Julio?

652
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,638
One less candidate, right?

653
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,479
You think so?

654
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,759
The only thing I'm wondering

655
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,237
is if they really have
a secret about each one of us

656
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,317
to use when they feel
it's necessary.

657
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,555
Coffee?

658
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,956
Thank you.

659
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,309
Congratulations.

660
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,709
Why?

661
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,348
Your defense of Julio.

662
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,311
You made it very tough.

663
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,828
If it was so good,
why did you vote against it?

664
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,990
Well,

665
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,037
I like to be begged.

666
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,435
Look at them.

667
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,752
The new school.

668
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,915
I don't think
there's a new school.

669
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,269
You don't?

670
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,594
Do you see any difference?

671
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,751
No, none.

672
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,958
Nothing very romantic.

673
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,119
I was offered a better job than
I had in Barcelona, and I came.

674
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,230
Well...

675
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,590
Do you like being in Madrid?

676
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,552
I haven't had time to find out

677
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,354
I haven't stopped working.

678
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,358
Yes, because you came

679
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,077
just after we met.

680
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,999
- When was the Tunis Conference?
- Easter, 2003.

681
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,231
- We had a good time.
- A very good time.

682
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,750
It's a pity we met here,
isn't it?

683
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,750
Why?

684
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,480
Because now I have to beat you.

685
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,393
On the contrary.

686
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,234
That makes it even more exciting.

687
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,268
"The year 2013.
World War III has broken out

688
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,278
<i>and the planet is suffocating
beneath a radioactive cloud.</i>

689
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,311
Fortunately, you are all safe

690
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,512
as you had time
to get to an atomic shelter

691
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,236
equipped with everything
necessary to survive for 20 years.

692
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,950
Unfortunately,

693
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,596
the shelter was designed
for a family of five people

694
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,754
so one of you will have to leave.

695
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,598
Decide who should do it,

696
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,473
but first each one must defend
his right to stay,

697
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,513
using demonstrable arguments.

698
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,356
Whoever is expelled
from the shelter

699
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,075
will also abandon
the selection process."

700
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,348
These are our résumés.

701
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,596
- Must we stick to our résumés?
- No, not as such.

702
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,633
It's so we can check
what each one says.

703
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,234
I guess.

704
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,035
Some things that aren't in a
résumé can be useful in a shelter.

705
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,635
Such as what?

706
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,319
Cooking, for example.

707
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,631
It's what I was going to say.

708
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,751
I'm a great cook,
I can do wonders.

709
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,349
The thing is, it says here

710
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,396
"demonstrable arguments".

711
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,316
I don't know
if what you say is true.

712
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,396
Why don't you start?

713
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,474
You've got it all clear.

714
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,959
Very well.

715
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,348
As you know, I've worked

716
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,074
and am still working

717
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,840
for electronic components
companies.

718
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,838
If you look at my résumé

719
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,034
you'll see I've done courses
in electronics and electricity.

720
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,518
So I'd be able to build a radio.

721
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,192
If there are survivors outside

722
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,277
or life comes back.

723
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,635
Build it?

724
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,878
Weren't you
the financial director?

725
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,152
Yes, but the courses I did
went into great detail.

726
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,988
Look at my résumé.

727
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,428
Yes, I've looked at it.

728
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,029
Sufficient detail
so you can build a radio?

729
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,708
That's what I'm saying.
Ask me about it, if you want.

730
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,115
Won't the shelter have a radio?

731
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,914
- Why? Who says so?
- Nobody. I'm presuming.

732
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,908
If it doesn't say so
you can't presume anything.

733
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,518
And there'll be electrical
maintenance to be done too.

734
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,434
I think good cooking
is more important.

735
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,590
Well...

736
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,997
Has anyone done military service?

737
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,870
Then I could take charge
of organization and rationing.

738
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,748
You'll forget the meaning
of the word "mutiny".

739
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,753
Yes, sir, on the double.

740
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,554
Two days arrest outside
the shelter, without a gas mask.

741
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,069
- Do I have to do pushups?
- Yes, later.

742
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,871
In front of me.

743
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,595
Why do we need someone in charge
of organization and rationing?

744
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,995
Excuse me?

745
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,430
Because it's always needed.

746
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,511
- Who says so?
- You, for example,

747
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,472
when we were talking about Julio.

748
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,596
I was talking about
running a company

749
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,472
not living in a shelter.

750
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,596
What's more,

751
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,519
we're all adults and
there's a thing called dialogue.

752
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,709
Of course,

753
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,435
but we're not arguing about
playing cards or checkers.

754
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,677
20 years in an atomic shelter
isn't a vacation, Nieves.

755
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,111
We can take turns
to organize the rationing.

756
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,799
Great, great.

757
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,232
Nieves, imagine it was your turn,
for example,

758
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,875
and I decide
I want double rations

759
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,071
because I feel like it,
I woke up with an appetite.

760
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,157
If we start like that...

761
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,519
I won't do anything on my own,
if that's your question.

762
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,669
- But between us, we can stop you.
- I'm talking about you, not them.

763
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,918
Are you going to persuade them
to act together?

764
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,238
Are you going to make them all
turn on me?

765
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,998
Are you the mole

766
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,394
trying to provoke things?

767
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,830
You wish.
I'm talking to her, not you.

768
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,879
Yes.

769
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,518
I'll do all that. What's more,

770
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,794
I'll try to get you
left outside the shelter.

771
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,149
You're dangerous.

772
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,794
How much more dangerous am I
than Carlos or Enrique?

773
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,598
Just enough, don't get big ideas.

774
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,358
But I'm funnier too, aren't I?

775
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,432
- Hilarious.
- Of course!

776
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,993
Tell me this.

777
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,239
- You trust them more than me?
- Of course.

778
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,428
I could accept that
authority is needed,

779
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,438
but I'd never be alongside
a military officer.

780
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,877
You know the military service
is just an excuse.

781
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,197
You'd vote for me because you'd
be safer under my authority.

782
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,593
If you behave, that is.

783
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,110
What are you saying?

784
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,916
I'm saying that you,
as a woman among so many men,

785
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,277
prefer that there's authority
so you feel more protected.

786
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,710
Fernando, sweetheart,
where have you escaped from?

787
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,679
Fernando,
you're a trained lawyer.

788
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,633
Why didn't you say so?

789
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,117
That would guarantee you
a place in the shelter.

790
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,392
What use is a lawyer in a world
devastated by nuclear radiation?

791
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,916
- If he were a physicist...
- The law is always needed,

792
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,680
even after the bomb.
You can't deny that.

793
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,440
- What use is law without authority?
- Shit, John Wayne.

794
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,629
All I'm saying

795
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,630
is that if anyone eats
a double ration

796
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,796
I'll beat the crap out of him,

797
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,995
and if anyone doesn't clean up,
he'll get the same treatment.

798
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,679
I give my word on that.

799
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,113
What if you don't comply?
Who'll control you?

800
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,277
You.

801
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,355
How sweet.

802
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,196
To settle the question,

803
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,960
shall we leave Fernando
with the role of judge,

804
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,799
and executioner if necessary.

805
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,353
What do you propose?

806
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,430
Me?

807
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,876
In case the judge
gets carried away,

808
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,789
I offer my services as doctor.
As my résumé states, I studied

809
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,953
two and half years of Medicine

810
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,153
so I know quite a bit.

811
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,430
Not bad.

812
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,478
That was a clever move, Ricardo.

813
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,752
And after all that fuss about
not saying where you worked,

814
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,030
we can read it here at our ease.

815
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,518
Joint Manager of the Transport
Department of Mercolex.

816
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,716
Did you go to class?

817
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,076
When you were a student.

818
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,630
Did you go to class?

819
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,112
Yes, I did. Why?

820
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,349
No reason.

821
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,635
You've taken away my argument.

822
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,189
I was going to offer myself
as doctor.

823
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,273
You studied medicine too?

824
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,278
No, but...

825
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,433
I go mountain climbing and I've
done some first aid courses,

826
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,715
anatomy...

827
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,673
Come on, that's pushing it a bit,
isn't it?

828
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,759
No, why?

829
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,351
I've done first aid courses too
and I don't call myself a doctor.

830
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,479
Yes, you're right.

831
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,632
I was playing for time.

832
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,514
I can't find...

833
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,518
I can't find anything else
of use in my résumé.

834
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,639
Well, yes.

835
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,108
I've got something.

836
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,032
I'll tell you a story
every night.

837
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,470
It might sound a bit odd,

838
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,672
but I studied literature
for a few years and I read a lot.

839
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,115
I can make your life underground
much more bearable.

840
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,670
Really, Carlos,
it was a very good attempt.

841
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,675
But, if you'll forgive me,
right now I think that you and

842
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,034
Ana are the worst qualified.

843
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,468
Because you say so?

844
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,914
There's a doctor,

845
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,429
there's a judge,

846
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,359
- a technician.
- And a cook.

847
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,596
Yes. Don't you like
how she cooks?

848
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,190
It's not that, Fernando.
It's not included in her résumé.

849
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,312
And what use is a radio
if the planet is destroyed?

850
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,070
Well,

851
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,312
I was just giving my opinion.

852
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,196
Nieves,

853
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,429
you're last.

854
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,875
All right.

855
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,431
I offer to be

856
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,756
the mother of all your children.

857
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,949
Irrefutable!

858
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,633
The mother
of post-atomic humanity.

859
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,471
All right,
I hadn't thought about that.

860
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,672
I can fulfill that role too.

861
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,876
That just leaves you, Carlos.

862
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,229
Excuse me, Ana.
I don't want to be rude,

863
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,715
but aren't you a bit old?

864
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,236
No.

865
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,394
Are you sure?

866
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,669
Very sure.

867
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,394
- I'm not twenty, I know, but...
- Nor thirty.

868
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,429
I still have a few fertile years.

869
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,439
And I have a child,
which guarantees I can have them.

870
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,198
I'm sorry to insist.

871
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,235
For how long will you be
able to be a mother still?

872
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,158
Aren't you at a dangerous age
already?

873
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,437
The risk is still acceptable.

874
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,837
Or do you only like adolescents?

875
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,190
Well,

876
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,392
I don't think
this is getting us anywhere.

877
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,998
No, it's very good. They have
to argue to see who wins.

878
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,195
I think that between a good meal
and telling a story...

879
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,237
What?

880
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,868
It's obvious!

881
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,753
Have you read Jack London?

882
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,112
- What?
- Jack London.

883
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,632
He has a story
about some Eskimos

884
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,592
who migrate
when the seasons change.

885
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,639
There's a man who's old,

886
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,670
weary,

887
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,109
almost blind.

888
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,193
He feels he can't keep up
with the tribe.

889
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,150
So the whole group stops
and they say goodbye to him,

890
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,509
one by one,

891
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,428
his children too.

892
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,468
They leave him there,

893
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,474
just like that,

894
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,951
with a little pile of firewood.

895
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,478
The old man sits in the snow,
calmly,

896
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,151
remembering his life,

897
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,238
and when the wood runs out

898
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,559
he freezes to death.

899
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,791
Is that one of the stories
you'd tell us?

900
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,995
Why not?

901
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,598
It's very educational.

902
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,236
A lot of people
could learn from it.

903
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,431
Who do you think you are?

904
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,192
Will you be more useful
with your stories?

905
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,518
Why do you dare call me old?

906
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,789
You little ass-licker.

907
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,238
They can screw me.

908
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,272
Will you offer them your ass?

909
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,716
It would be best if you all chose

910
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,797
and kept us from
insulting each other.

911
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,714
She's right.

912
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,079
I think we should vote.

913
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,436
Who wants me to stay
in the shelter?

914
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,756
I'm voting for the cook.

915
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,515
Nieves?

916
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,438
I'll do the same as before,
if you don't mind.

917
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,709
I'm abstaining.

918
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,479
Do I put Ana's name in the box?

919
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,592
Before you throw me out,
I want to ask a question.

920
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,912
Is it because I'm a woman?

921
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,835
Because I'm over forty?

922
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,839
Or both things?

923
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,952
We're not throwing you out.

924
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,395
Then don't vote.

925
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,518
Do like Ricardo.

926
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,190
Abstain, let the company decide.

927
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,113
Like you did with Julio?

928
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,551
They're not throwing you out
for the reasons you're saying.

929
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,395
It's because you couldn't defend
your presence in the shelter.

930
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,954
So I think.

931
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,753
What's going on down there?

932
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,155
You can't see anything here.

933
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,909
I'm sorry, Ana.

934
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,514
I did the same as you,
defend myself.

935
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,676
I don't believe what I said.

936
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,269
I was playing a role
to win the game.

937
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,594
Honestly.

938
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,108
Over there, please.

939
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,838
Won't you stay for lunch?
There's enough for everyone.

940
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,230
Is this all there is to drink?

941
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,318
Yes, alcoholic drinks aren't
allowed in this company.

942
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,355
I apologize for offering you
a cold lunch,

943
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,836
but the demonstration is causing
problems with the restaurants.

944
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,673
<i>It's fine, don't worry.</i>

945
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,598
Is it my imagination

946
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,079
or does this smell bad?

947
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,075
You don't mind if I eat with you,
do you?

948
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,835
No, not at all.

949
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,789
Thank you.

950
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,628
How are you getting on?

951
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,832
Great, it's fantastic.

952
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,995
The method, I mean.

953
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,269
You think so?

954
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,556
Yes. Forget the Americans.

955
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,354
In my humble opinion,
I think it's very good.
