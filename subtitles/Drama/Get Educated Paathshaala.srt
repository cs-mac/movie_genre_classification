00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,646
l'm sorry.

00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,150
l have to do it.

16
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,426
Hey.

17
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,659
Why are you late?

18
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,599
Come on, hurry up.

19
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,816
Let's begin the prayers.

00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,847
Hail lndia!
- Hail lndia!

27
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,882
Don't you think the
prayer has become longer?

28
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,753
Mr. Hansotia, don't start
complaining in the morning.

29
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,917
l'm not complaining.

30
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,585
Thanks, bye.

31
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,562
Yes, Mrs. Bose, how are you?
- l am very nervous. - Why?

32
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,493
You know, the principal
has called me to his cabin..

33
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,124
..at 5 o'clock.

34
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,003
Mrs. Bose, the principal has
called everyone. - Everyone?

35
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,867
Thank you for the information.

36
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,099
l get high-blood pressure
whenever l hear his name.

37
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,806
Mrs. Bose, have you not
done your homework? - What?

38
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,039
Were you late for school today?
- What are you saying?

39
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,149
Did your parents forget to
sign the remark in the calendar?

40
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,515
What are you saying?

41
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,749
l'm not a student. - Then why are you
scared like one, Mrs. Bose?

42
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,592
Actually, after living
with him for so many years..

43
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,662
..even l feel scared of him.

44
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,924
Everything will be fine, isn't it?

45
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,259
Whatever it is, we'll find out
in the meeting, Mrs. Bose.

46
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,035
You're coming, aren't you?
- Do l have an option?

47
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,034
Even l don't.
- Yes, we don't.

48
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,864
No chance, dude.

49
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,804
You lost my pen the last
time l lent it to you.

50
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,137
l won't lend you one again.
- Come on, give it.

51
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,268
Are you all ready to go into space?

52
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,738
Space journey.
- What? What?

53
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,850
lt's Hanshotia sir's class?
- Oh no.

54
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,685
He'll be here with his
private chalk and duster..

55
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,845
..to bore us.

56
00:05:56,222 --> 00:06:00,124
l don't know why he wants us
all to go to NASA. - l swear.

57
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,555
But you know, sir..

58
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,958
He just knows a few names.

59
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,561
NASA. Universe. Deep space.

60
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,723
Kalpana Chawla.

61
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,198
Kalpana Chawla.
- Sunita Williams.

62
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,759
And who was that lndian..

63
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,927
..whose name he keeps
repeating every time?

64
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,095
Natasha Singh.
- l couldn't follow him.

65
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,297
Natasha.

66
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,939
Go, go.

67
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,307
Go on.

68
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,851
Hey. Hello. Where's Natasha?

69
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,047
Hello. Hello.

70
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,885
Sir's here. Sir's here.

71
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,825
Hello, where are you?

72
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,290
Nats. Tell me.

73
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,059
Vikram Bhatnagar, you stupid fool.

74
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,063
Looking out of the window.

75
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,226
But right now, you're in my..

76
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,738
..in Cyrus Hansotia's class!
Where are you?

77
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,899
Cyrus Hansotia!
- Sit down.

78
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,805
You fool, what are you doing?

79
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,879
Sit in your own place.
- Sorry, sir.

80
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,175
Disgusting.

81
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,847
Be quiet. Be quiet.

82
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,619
Why are you all making a commotion?

83
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,783
Hey.

84
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,224
Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!

85
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,294
What do you want for
being seated quietly?

86
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,961
Bench.
- Bench. What did he just say?

87
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,305
Uncle Waghmare, he said bench.

88
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,204
Bench.
- No, you wouldn't understand.

89
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,267
Sit! Sit!

90
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,937
That's not my bench. This is..

91
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,173
..where Nikunj is sitting.

92
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,314
This is your bench.

93
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,780
As if you'll pass without studying..

94
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,048
..if you sit on this bench?

95
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,281
Go sit there.

96
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,892
What are you staring at?
- l'm thinking.

97
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,754
He can think.

98
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,989
lt'll take you time to
understand what l say.

99
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,302
l've studied till the 5th grade.

100
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,665
That too in Marathi Medium.

101
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:58,071
Who has a doubt here?
- l.

102
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,235
l.

103
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,075
God. Everyone has a doubt.

104
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,410
Fine. Sit!

105
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,817
Waghmare.

106
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,453
What's going on here?

107
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,821
Sir..
- Children are enjoying it.

108
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,989
Are you a child?

109
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,858
Aren't you ashamed?

110
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,797
Dancing in front of the
management like a Monkey.

111
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,097
lf you keep dancing like this..

112
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,832
..you'll start getting bananas
for salary from next month.

113
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,232
Get that?

114
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,037
Come on, get back to work.

115
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,936
Serve tea to the principal.

116
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,039
Wonder how long we'll have
to endure these old hags.

117
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,383
Once l'm given
charge of the management..

118
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,115
..they've had it.

119
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,316
Hey, you just bumped
into the management.

120
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:52,794
Sorry about that. l'm late.
- You aren't late, but very late.

121
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,929
This isn't the age to join school.

122
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,383
l've done the
'Kriyakaram' (Final rites).

123
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,888
lt's 'Kriyakarya' (Exercise),
and not 'Kriyakaram'.

124
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,148
Get it.

125
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,316
Excuse me. Good Morning.

126
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,484
Yes. Good Morning.

127
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,920
Where's the principal's cabin?

128
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,320
Yes.

129
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,091
Go straight, take a right.

130
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,098
You'll find the chemistry lab.

131
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,825
Take the steps next to it.

132
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,426
And you'll see
the principal's cabin.

133
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,129
Thank you.

134
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,831
Are you a 12th grade student?

135
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,910
No, l joined as a teacher today.

136
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,214
So young.
- And you?

137
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,182
l'm Ms. Chandramukhi,
Hindi teacher.

138
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,084
And l'm Mrs. Shinde,

Ah Mam..
- Later.

144
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,326
The British have returned.

145
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,835
They're still venting out their
anger on the English teachers.

146
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,005
Anyway, you must be getting
late for class. l'll see you.

147

149
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,223
Tea for the principal.

150
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,085
Follow tea.

151
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,318
Sure.

152
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,197
Do you have Appointment.

..and certificates
according to your age.

155
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,379

00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,979
But l'm sure you'll do it well.

00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,315
Thank you, sir.

158
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,892

a lot coming from you.

159
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,220
l promise you l won't let you down.

160
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,461
Professor Dixit was saying..

161
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:11,935
..you have interest in music.
- Just a hobby.

162
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,931
Turn your hobby into a profession.

163
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,076
The school needs a
music teacher as well.

164
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,172
lf you don't mind, sir..

165
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,643
..l've never looked at music
from a commercial point of view.

166
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,315
And teaching music is
something l'm not sure about.

167
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,490
And l don't do
things l'm not sure about.

168
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,920
Talking like the rebels.

169
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,426
You belong to an era of revolution.

170
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,188
Sir, revolution
doesn't belong to an era.

171
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,130
lt can occur anywhere,
anytime and anyhow.

172
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,292
Right, sir?

173
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,660
Well said.

174
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,537
Start from day after tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.

175
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,266
Actually, since l've
got here right now..

176
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,434
..l'll start work right away.

177
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,403
Sure.

178
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,507
Attend the staff meeting
at 5 o'clock in the evening.

179
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,575
About the meeting..

180
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,210
Right, sir.

181
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,683
Hello, send Sharma in.

182
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,993
lt's 5 o'clock.

183
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,133
Good evening, Mr. Chauhan.
- Good evening.

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,298
Good evening.

185
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,343
See, Mr. Chauhan
always arrives before time.

186
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,636
Chandramukhi, you must've heard
that saying..

187
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,939
..''You can leave the army,
but the army won't leave you.''

188
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,010
Similarly, for a sports coach..

189
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,586
..whether he's on the
field or out of it..

190
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,154
..his life is always
controlled by a stop watch.

191
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,486
And this is my lifeline now.

192
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,460
You're absolutely correct,
Mr. Chauhan.

193
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,391
l completely agree with you.

194
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,488
Thank God the
principal hasn't arrived yet.

195
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,059
Just see how my heart's beating.

196
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,962
Relax, Mrs. Bose, the
principal is on his way.

197
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,066
Excuse me.

198
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,036
We were supposed to meet
here at 5 o'clock sharp?

199
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,238
Good evening, sir.

200
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,406
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sir.

201
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,574
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sir.

202
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,741
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

203
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,711
Sit.

204
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,079
Sit down.
- Thank you.

205
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,426
He's our new teacher.
- Hello.

206
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,329
Rahul Prakash.
- Udyavar, sir.

207
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,660
Udyavar.
- Udyavar.

208
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,240
Good evening.
- Hi.

209
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,532
Hello Rahul. - Hello.

210
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,333
Rahul Prakash Udyavar.

211
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,543
Hello.
- Hi.

212
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,731
l joined this school 32 years ago.

213
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,470
At that time, there
were 30-35 students.

214
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,647
And we were at the top.

215
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,345
Now there are 350-400 schools.

216
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,683
And where are we now.

217
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,128
Sir, our school is still
remembered in history.

218
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,324
We're the best in academics.

219
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,237
l don't like people
who talk about history.

220
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,599
l believe in the future.

221
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,336
Mr. Chauhan. - Yes, sir.

222
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,270
As a sports teacher are you
happy about the facilities..

223
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,611
..the management has
provided you with.

224
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,841
Sir, not completely.

225
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,518
But, it's a nice cemented court.

226
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,619
l agree it needs
some repair. Not much.

227
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,750
Painting, slight
touch-ups here and there.

228
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,122
And we're good to go.

229
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,423
lf it would've been a
wooden court instead of tar..

230
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,362
Cushions instead of benches..

231
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,293
lndoor floodlight court,
then maybe..

232
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,496
Then what, sir?

233
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,432
Less injuries, more games,
more champions.

234
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,139
lt'll be a dream come true.

235
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,878
But at the moment
it's still a dream.

236
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:26,388
Anjali, what did you join as?

237
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,817
Nutritionist.

238
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,523
Basically, you think about..

239
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,427
..what children should eat
and what they shouldn't.

240
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,663
But since you joined
you've become the cook..

241
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,361
..you look after the cafeteria.

242
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,662
You're the cashier
and the matron as well.

243
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,504
l like it, sir.
l can do anything for children.

244
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,377
lt's very nice of you.

245
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,870
But if l'd sent you
abroad for further studies..

246
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,149
..you would've done wonders.

247
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,641
Thank you, sir.

248
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,446
You thought about it. And
that's more than enough.

249
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,854
l think the same for everyone.

250
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,754
But it's a question for me now.

251
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,563
Four years ago..

252
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:19,406
..this school.. Daniel High School..

253
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,672
..would charge thrice the
amount we charged for fees.

254
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,781
lt might be charging
eight-ten times more now.

255
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,611
Though it's a smaller
school as compared to ours.

256
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,720
Yet, all the parents
line-up there..

257
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,658
..to get their
children admitted there.

258
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,930
They're ready to pay
as much donation..

259
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,425
..as the school demands.

260
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,829
Sir, that's more of a
five-star hotel than a school.

261
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,499
l've heard that they
use digital blackboards.

262
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,830
There are many hi-tech facilities..

263
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,704
..which we can never
compete against.

264
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,436
And, sir.. Sorry, sir.
- Why 'sorry'?

265
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,775
What you said is true.

266
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,940
There are many schools..

267
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,275
..we don't stand a chance against.

268
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,679
Then, what do you propose, sir?

269
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,680
What do we do?

270
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,415
How can we help you?

271
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,751
l just want your cooperation,
that's all.

272
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,694
The management is
putting together a plan.

273
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,831
Next week, l'll e-mail
you all the information.

274
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,625
Okay, sir.
- Okay.

275
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,927
Come on, get back to work.
- Thank you, sir.

276
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,374
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

277
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,902
Thank you very much.

278
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,314
l can't even look at him..
l just closed my eyes.. - Excuse me.

279
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,247
Hello. First day?
- Yes, ma'am.

280
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,784
l'll see you.
- Okay, bye.

281
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,454
Mrs. Bose, Geography.

282
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,621
Were you scared?
- Of whom?

283
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,990
The principal.
- No, it's nothing like that.

284
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,923
Don't be scared. lf you
feel scared, come to me.

285
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,293
l'm there.

286
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,424
lt's time for my class.

287
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,659
Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes.

288
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,669
School's over.

289
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,398
l was confused.

290
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,633
See you.
- Bye.

291
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,801
Oh God..

292
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,807
Excuse me. One moment.

293
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,678
Anjali. TCA.

294
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,648
Hi, Rahul. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you.

295
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,745
Actually, l wanted to talk to you.
- Yes, sure.

296
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,447
Yes. Thanks.

297
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,989
So, first day?
- Yes.

298
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,725
You?
- l joined last year, in mid-term.

299
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,524
l thought l'd be here
for really long.

300
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,059
But now that isn't possible.

301
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,526
Why, any problems?

302
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,692
No, no problems.

303
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,429
l sent a job application
in the US.

304
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,071
So, l'm waiting for that.

305
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,699
Ambitious.
- Slightly.

306
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,637
You begin day after?
- Right.

307
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,504
So, how was the first day?
- lnteresting.

308
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,807
But l think, perhaps, l'll
have to put in a lot of effort..

309
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,382
..from the first day itself.

310
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,515
l like the principal's
views on modernization..

311
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,984
..and growth of the
school and all that.

312
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,614
But l also feel that
the school needs funds.

313
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,892
Do we get salaries here?

314
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,657
We aren't facing such
bad days, Mr. Rahul.

315
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,820
Justjoking.

316
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,692
Want to have some coffee?
- Yes, sure.

317
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,801
You know, our principal
worries a lot about the school.

318
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,732
That's why he's quite
stressed these days.

319
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,495
He really wants to prove a point.

320
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,969
He's very ambitious.

321
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,102
That means he's
going to America as well.

322
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:08,912
Yes. You're really funny.
- Sometimes.

323
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,406
But getting back to the principal..

324
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,717
..he doesn't seem to
have modern thoughts.

325
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,048
l mean, one isn't
necessarily the way he appears.

326
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,989
Exactly, take a look at yourself.

327
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,458
When l heard your name
for the first time..

328
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,119
'Rahul Prakash Udyavar.'

329
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,089
Everyone thought it'd be..
- Some stiff-upper-lip..

330
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,095
..old, adamant English teacher.
- Yes.

331
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,600
Well, here l am.
- Exactly.

332
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,467
Finally, someone my own age.

333
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,670
That's why l'm trying my luck.

334
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,542
What do you mean? - The
principal must've spoken to you..

335
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,672
..about teaching music.

336
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,842
Yes, he was saying, but..
- You said you wouldn't do it.

337
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,923
Look, it isn't easy to teach music.

338
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,725
l think you need to be
a professional for it.

339
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,527
And, l've never
tried it professionally.

340
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,392
But actually..

341
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,695
Music is more of a formality here.

342
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,495
The same CD is played everyday.

343
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,695
The children are bored.
They don't learn anything.

344
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,897
There's no interaction with anyone.

345
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:14,001
They're children after all.
- Exactly, they're children.

346
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,011
That's why it's so difficult.

347
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,709
l've only taught English.

348
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,977
And that's what l'm good at.

349
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,147
l hope you understand.

350
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,084
Yes, actually me too.

351
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,489
lt's actually my mistake.

352
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,892
l promised the
children without asking you..

353
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,896
..that music classes
would start from tomorrow.

354
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,688
And they were really excited.

355
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,430
That's okay, l'll talk to them.

356
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,895
Anyway, welcome to SVM.
- Thanks.

357
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,503
See you later.
- Yes.

358
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,667
Bye.
- Bye.

359
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,703
Bye.
- Bye.

360
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,980
Quiet!

361
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,986
Be quiet!

362
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,664
Madam, we need the
hostel's accounts.

363
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,589
l'm getting late for music class.

364
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,758
And the children are waiting.

365
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,926
Later.
- Okay.

366
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,005
There's no music teacher..

367
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,507
..and there's a music class period.

368
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,802
These children are just..

369
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,173
The school
authorities have gone crazy.

370
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,975
Anjali, why are you in such a hurry?
- The children..

371
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,678
Children? What's
wrong with the children?

372
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,019
Nothing, l'm getting
late for music class.

373
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,559
l was nervous.
- Bye. - Bye.

374
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:43,696
''Lord, tell me where you are?''

375
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,963
''Where can l find you?''

376
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,801
''We're only travellers.''

377
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,936
''Looking for our destination.''

378
00:21:55,314 --> 00:22:01,150
''Lord, tell me where you are?''

379
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,619
''Where can l find you?''

380
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:08,091
''We're only travellers.''

381
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,924
''Looking for our destination.''

382
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,276
''Whenever l miss you..''

383
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,284
''..it's really tormenting.''

384
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,124
''l feel lonely.''

385
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,128
''l often say to myself..''

386
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,129
''Why did you break my heart?''

387
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,329
''Why did you leave me?''

388
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,002
''Why am l still waiting for you?''

389
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,939
''Why do you come to me?''

390
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,074
''Why do you torment me?''

391
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:05,181
''Why am l still so restless?''

392
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:11,112
''Lord, tell me where you are?''

393
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,248
''Where can l find you?''

394
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:18,051
''We're only travellers.''

395
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,964
''Looking for our destination.''

396
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:40,107
EROS

397
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:48,682
''There's a distance,
yet you are close.''

398
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:57,160
''l know l am, but
you aren't helpless.''

399
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,630
''lt torments me every moment.''

400
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,708

00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,407
''l'm always lonely.''

00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,243
''l say to myself often..''

403
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,650
''Why did you break my heart?''

404
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,880
''Why did you leave me?''

405

''Why am l still waiting for you?''

''Why am l still so restless?''

423
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,191
Come on, everyone go to sleep.

424
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,495
Who is that?

425
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:46,902
Who's there?

426
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,108
Who is that?

427
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,211
Who is that?

428
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,512
Who's there?

429
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,482
Stop.

430
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,985
Rohan. What happened?

431
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,318
What happened?

432
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,952
Why are you crying? What happened?

433
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,964
What happened?

434
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,893
Why are you crying?
- What happened?

435
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,431
You fought with him, didn't you?

436
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,201
l swear on God, ma'am, l didn't.

437
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,898
What happened? Why are you crying?

438
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,064
Tell me! Tell me!

439
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,535
Toilet.
- Toilet!

440
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,206
So, why are you crying?

441
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,309
There's one there,
and another there.

442
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,182
There's one in your room.
Go, quickly.

443
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,310
Ma'am, l think all three
are occupied.

444
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,189
Okay, go to my room. Take the key.

445
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,354
Listen, Rohan, don't dirty it.

446
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,891
Rohan.
- What now?

447
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,120
Nothing, go.

448
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,389
Kids.

449
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,966
Kids.

450
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,227
Kids!

451
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,201
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

452
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,338
There are two abilities
that you need in any sport.

453
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,102
Physical and mental.

454
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,843
Because you can physically do..

455
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,312
..what you're mentally focussed on.

456
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,275
You have to focus.

457
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,183
You like painting, don't you?

458
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,221
lf you keep staring
there you'll lose.

459
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,084
Concentrate on the game.

460
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,585
Sorry, sir.

461
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,223
Boys.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,391
l'll be back.

463
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,093
But remember, fair game.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,494
Let's go, sir. - Okay.

465
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,138
Stay within your limits, get it.

466
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,574
You're staring a lot at Natasha.

467
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,313
Stay off my sister.

468
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,376
They both are fighting again.

469
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,615
''Why did you leave me?''

470
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,326
One lunch, please.
- Cupon. - Me too.

471
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,588
Shelly, where are you lost?
- Sir sings so well, isn't it?

472
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,223
l know.

473
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,162
l've heard it ten times
since morning.

474
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:55,631
l've recorded Rahul sir as well.
Look.

475
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,373
Rahul sir?
- He's so cute, isn't it?

476
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,874
When did you take this?

477
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,104
Keep the phone inside.
- Fine.

478
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,350
Amin. You're my friend.
- Yes.

479
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,218
Will you do something for me?
- What?

480
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:18,157
Will you please find out
what Rahul sir's age is?

481
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,023
And if he has a girlfriend.

482
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,593
What are you up to?

483
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,299
l was justjoking, have your lunch.

484
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,163
Joke.

485
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,500
Shall we sit here?
- No, no.

486
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,939
Not here.

487
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,238
Ugly ducking.

488
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,438
He's scary.

489
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,042
Please, sir.
- No, no.

490
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,278
Please, sir.
- Okay.

491
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,215
Tomorrow after recess.

492
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,516
Bye, sir.

493
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,955
Get back to your classes.

494
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,296
Don't worry, sir.

495
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,001
He won't bite him.

496
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,229
He's his friend.

497
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,538
But, all the children
are playing together..

498
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,941
..during the recess,
and he's all alone.

499
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,104
What else will he do, sir?

500
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,607
His name is Parth.

501
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,011
He's a very sweet child.

502
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,142
But he doesn't have any friends.

503
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,716
And no one talks to him either.

504
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,014
That puppy is his only friend.

505
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,016
He plays with him all day.

506
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,089
And he feeds him his leftover food.

507
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,425
He's such a sweet child, sir.

508
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,226
But God has given
a blot on his face.

509
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,162
Sir. This file..

510
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,600
Keep it on my desk.
- Okay. - Thank you.

511
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,169
Wait.

512
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,337
l've done an extended version..

513
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,709
..of Rahul sir's
style of shaking hands.

514
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,515
Recess is over. Come on.

515
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,312
Stop. We'll do it, you just watch.

516
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,547
The bell has rung.

517
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,557
Sir will beat us.
- He always comes late.

518
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,717
Watch.

519
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,690
That's great.

520
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,365
Whose class are you in?
- Cyrus Ganshotia.

521
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,528
Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,196
You fool, go inside.

523
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,364
Go inside.
- Sorry, sir.

524
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,532
Go. Go.
- Sorry, sir.

525
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:34,260
Hello? - Did you read the e-mail?
- l'm doing just that.

526
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,324
ln the meeting held last week..

527
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,402
..we talked about the
progress of the school.

528
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,270
l can understand progress,
but this means..

529
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,371
Only he knows what he wants.

530
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,505
The principal
promised us something else.

531
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,774
But this mail is
completely different.

532
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,540
Did you check the principal's mail?
- l forgot.

533
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,709
l'll do it right now.

534
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,081
Do it right away.

535
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,415
And come to the classroom quickly.

536
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,547
We're all discussing it there.

537
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,351
Okay, bye.

538
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,485
You know, Mr. Rahul.

539
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,390
l'm feeling negative
for the first time.

540
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,588
This is utter nonsense.

541
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,427
Disgusting.
- Exactly.

542
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,329
There are 40 students
in each of our classes.

543
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,402
This is more compared to others.

544
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,061
And now he wants us to handle more.

545
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,198
Anjali, 65 students in one class.

546
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,366
How will we handle?

547
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,310
How can the children study?

548
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,240
And that's his first option.

549
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,405
The second option.

550
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,175
The second option is
more dangerous.

551
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,441
Cut down the number of staff.

552
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,111
How can we reduce
the number of staff?

553
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,187
But he'll certainly drop me?

554
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,284
And where will this
thrown out teacher get a job?

555
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,290
This is dangerous.

556
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,228
This is not done.

557
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,131
Anyway. Mr. Chauhan is our senior.

558
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,290
Let him take the decision.

559
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,532
Rahul, what do you think?

560
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,342
The principal hasn't
left us with any option.

561
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,375
l hope the others agree
with what we're thinking.

562
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,443
Did you talk to the others?

563
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,452
l have.

564
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,680
They are with us.

565
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:08,347
That's good. Let's go ahead then.

566
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,362
Welcome, Mr. Dholakia.

567
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,562
Welcome, sir.

568
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,704
Sir, it's really nice
to see you here.

569
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,139
The school is just like
you left it.

570
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,744
l've looked after it.. - First,
take care of yourself, Sharma.

571
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,680
Sir, that's a
wonderful thing you said.

572
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,842
Come, come.

573
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,852
The school is much better
than before.

574
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,817
How is sister-in-law?
- Shut up.

575
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,185
She must be fine.

576
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,683
Your e-mail's reply was negative.

577
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,193
Your plan failed.

578
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,424
Tell me, what now, Mr. Sahay?

579
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,724
Even your teachers aren't with you.

580
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,200
They clearly refused you.

581
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,203
l will talk to them.

582
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,633
Forget about talking.

583
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,277
They don't even want
to discuss it with you.

584
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,178
l have an option.
- And what is that?

585
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,275
Leave it to me, sir.

586
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,244
What do you think, Mr. Shah?

587
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,948
l think, let him use it.

588
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,885
Fine, then.

589
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,623
Mr. Sahay, you go ahead
with the plan.

590
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,928
You're the boss.
- Thank you very much.

591
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,495
But remember, this second option..

592
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,470
..shouldn't give
them any other option.

593
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,532
l'll see to it.

594
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,435
l'll see to it.

595
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,307
Good. Good, Mr. Sahay.

596
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,813
You have enough time
in a limited period.

597
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,884
Thank you, sir. - So, good luck.

598
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,580
l have a lot of
expectations from you, Sahay.

599
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,745
Don't let me down.

600
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,479
Sir, please come on teacher's day.

601
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,928
Rohan, who are you taking this for?

602
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,399
l'm taking this for uncle Waghmare.

603
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,531
We're all confused.

604
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,766
But there's one girl who knows..

605
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,843
..what she has to give Rahul sir.

606
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,274
But what's in it?

607
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,003
Stop it.

608
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,575
l have a surprise plan for him.

609
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,413
l hope he likes it.

610
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,679
He should like it.

611
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,517
He will like it.

612
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:27,823
''Let me be forlorn
in your innate eyes.''

613
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:33,962
''Let me lose myself in your arms.''

614
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:40,375
''Without you life is incomplete.''

615
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:46,849
''My heart always searches for you.''

616
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:53,388
''Let me be forlorn
in your innate eyes.''

617
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:59,591
''Let me lose myself in your arms.''

618
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,323
''l never knew.. what love was.''

619
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,426
''l never knew what it felt like.''

620
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:12,635
''Let me be forlorn
in your innate eyes.''

621
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:18,680
''Let me lose myself in your arms.''

622
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:25,313
''Without you life is incomplete.''

623
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:31,726
''My heart always searches for you.''

624
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:38,335
''Let me be forlorn
in your innate eyes.''

625
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:44,074
''Let me lose myself in your arms.''

626
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:51,111
''l never knew.. what love was.''

627
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:57,581
''l never knew what it felt like.''

628
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,882
Give him the football.

629
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,360
Natrajan Subramaniam lyer.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,587
Give him the football as well.

631
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,929
Joseph Pereira.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,399
No, sir. Keep the football.

633
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,036
Why is that, sir?
- Go and sit in your place.

634
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,105
But, sir.. sir..
- Sit in your place.

635
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,464
Hey, boys.
- Morning, sir.

636
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,632
Morning. What happened?

637
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,800
Why aren't you practicing?

638
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,537
So, Mr. Sharma, what's going on?

639
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,136
l'm distributing,
footballs to your students.

640
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,541
You should know what
you're distributing.

641
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:32,112
This is not a football,
it's a basketball.

642
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,381
lt's one and the same.

643
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,526
Whichever ball it is..

644
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,889
..it has to go in to the net.

645
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,122
Anyway, will you tell me
who decided..

646
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,399
..which children would
play and which wouldn't?

647
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,024
There's a new rule.

648
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,533
Until you buy the
ball from the school..

649
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,036
..you can't play.

650
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,937
These children play with this
ball everyday, it's their ball.

651
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,172
Then they should go
home and play with it.

652
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,642
lf they want to play here,
they will have to buy the ball.

653
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,108
lt's a new rule.

654
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,153
Don't interfere with
things you don't know about.

655
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,015
There are ten players
and one ball in this game.

656
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,420
And not ten players and ten balls.

657
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,117
You know the rules of the game.

658
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,788
And l know the management rules.

659
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,695
The players you're
refusing are my best players.

660
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,166
l know they're your best players.

661
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,461
But they aren't the best payers.

662
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,734
Mr. Sharma, please leave.
l'll talk to the principal.

663
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,936
The principal is
returning in four days.

664
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,205
You can talk to him.

665
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,208
But there's a request for you.

666
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,476
Please don't toy
around with the management..

667
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,552
..for these four days.

668
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,621
l mean, please don't
interfere in my work.

669
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,780
See you.

670
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,449
Yes. Adab Khan.

671
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,617
He isn't here.

672
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,922
Keep it. We'll sell it later.

673
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,698
This coupon has been
hiked up to 10 rupees.

674
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,494
And in the name of a combo-meal.

675
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,163
Do you know what a combo-meal is?
- No, madam.

676
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,240
lf the children want
to buy one sandwich..

677
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,701
..or a snack, they have to
pay for the entire combo-meal.

678
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,938
Madam, we need to buy cold
drink and chips as well.

679
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,108
Didn't l say no to chips and
cold-drinks for the children?

680
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,880
What are you doing here?

681
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,076
Get back to work.

682
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,950
Go and distribute
the coupons, go on. Go.

683
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,580
Go.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,253
Madam, did you restrict the
purchase of cold drinks and chips?

685
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,822
Yes.

686
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,694
l mean, with whose
permission did you do that?

687
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,926
Why do l need permission?

688
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,593
l'm the nutritionist of the school.

689
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,697
l stopped whatever would be
bad for the children's health.

690
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,770
You're worried about the
health of the children..

691
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,672
..but not of the school.

692
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,745
You're making the school
incur losses.

693
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,179
What's the loss? lt's beneficial,
Mr. Sharma.

694
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,543
No, no, madam,
it's highly detrimental.

695
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,707
Let me explain to you.

696
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,542
We get four containers of
cold drinks in our school.

697
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,883
On a discounted rate of Rs.6.

698
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:49,585
We use one, and sell the
rest in the market for Rs.12.

699
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,855
So the school is making a
profit of Rs.6 per bottle.

700
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,055
Fine, then why are you
selling it to the children.

701
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,632
Sell all four in the market.

702
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,098
No, madam, we can't do that.

703
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,931
We need to use
at least one container.

704
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,130
This is a legal matter.
Don't interfere.

705
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,139
l suggest that you read this.

706
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,708
This is the hostel rate list.

707
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,040
Sharma, this is..
- Madam, l'm very tired.

708
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,703
Please don't ask me anything else.

709
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,547
Come on, give the cupons.

710
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,708
He's tired.

711
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,621
l should get all the papers of
the third standard. - Yes, sir.

712
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,728
Why are you all standing outside?
- Mr. Sharma told us.

713
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,157
Thank you.

714
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,326
Come inside.
- Yes, sir.

715
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,694
Yes, sir.

716
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,574
Very nice, very nice.

717
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,066
Play it.

718
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,103
Play it louder.

719
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,772
Play it as loud as you can.

720
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,280
Play it. Play it.

721
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,610
Don't fall down. Play it.

722
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,282
Good. Good.

723
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,653
Play it louder.

724
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,626
Let Kittu play it loudly.

725
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,786
Go ahead.

726
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,727
Mr. Sharma.
- Hello, Udayavar.

727
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,889
How are u.
- Hello.

728
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,057
What's going on here?

729
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,657
This is fun.

730
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,667
Learning instruments.
- Not instruments.. Guitar.

731
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:14,168
Anything that plays music
is an instrument for me.

732
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,079
Who gave them the guitar?

733
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,980
Udyavar, all your
answers are in this.

734
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,245
Read it. Read it.

735
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,615
Have you read it?
- l am.

736
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,779
Read it.

737
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,947
You keep playing.

738
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,157
Very good, son, very good.

739
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,356
l like seeing children happy.

740
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,164
Don't you like seeing
children happy?

741
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,329
l do. But you can see only them.

742
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,932
But l can see those children
as well. - Yes.

743
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,372
Do you see them happy?

744
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,046
Actually, sir, their parents
don't want to see them happy.

745
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,779
Otherwise their parents
would've paid the fees..

746
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,912
..and they would be
playing the instruments..

747
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,923
l mean the guitar.

748
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,258
Mr. Sharma, have you
ever played the guitar?

749
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,358
No, l never learnt how to play it.
- Exactly.

750
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,824
Exactly. You need to
learn to play the guitar.

751
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,098
These children are so small..

752
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,432
..they can't even hold
the guitar properly.

753
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,864
Forget about playing it.

754
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,800
Rohan.

755
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,379
Everybody put your guitars down.

756
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,914
Put your guitars down.
Put your guitars down.

757
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,346
Okay, sir.
- Show me.

758
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,884
Put your guitars down.

759
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,078
What happened?

760
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,815
l'm taking him to medical,
don't worry.

761
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,981
Don't worry. Don't worry.

762
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,885
lt's paining.

763
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,689
This is nice.

764
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,191
He doesn't teach anything himself..

765
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,359
..and is trying to teach me.

766
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,902
Please calm down.
- How can we calm down, madam?

767
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,062
You're doing as you please..

768
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,230
..and you're asking us to calm down.

769
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,365
You're forcing us to buy
things the children don't need.

770
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,033
And at twice the rate.
- So?

771
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,337
Footballs are available for Rs.300.

772
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,707
And you're selling it at 500.

773
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,871
And the guitar is
available for 500..

774
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,039
..and you're selling it at 1200.

775
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,979
You've even included toothpaste,
comb and towel.

776
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,442
What's going on, madam?

777
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,379
Look, it's the
management's decision.

778
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,954
We can't do anything about it.

779
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,750
Just keep blaming each other for it.
- Right.

780
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,188
You've signed on the circular,
isn't it?

781
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,782
And now you aren't
giving us an answer.

782
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,420
Wonder whether
they're running a school..

783
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,894
..or a departmental store.
Exams are so close.

784
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,328
lnstead of teaching students..

785
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,126
..they're busy raking in money.
Aren't you ashamed?

786
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,396
Look, the principal
is returning tomorrow.

787
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,969
We'll discuss with him.

788
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,298
Please wait for a day.

789
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,066
What will you discuss, madam?

790
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,073
What will they discuss?
- lt's all a false promise.

791
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,335
Let's go, talk to the management.
- lt's futile talking to them.

792
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,501
You've already stooped quite low.

793
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:28,869
How much further will you stoop?

794
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,878
They haven't done anything till now.
- Disgusting.

795
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,107
l've to make all the arrangements.

796
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,419
Waghmare.
- Sir.

797
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,790
What are you doing?

798
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,992
He was standing under
the sun since morning.

799
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,261
So l thought..
- Oh, really?

800
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,269
You've started thinking as well.

801
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:32,169
l've made him stand under
the sun. Get that? - Yes.

802
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,240
What's in your hand?
- Water.

803
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,139
Water?

804
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,481
lf you give him water
l will fire him.

805
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,517
l wonder why this school doesn't..

806
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,419
..get these old people to retire?

807
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,354
Why are you staring at me?

808
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,017
Shall l fire you as well?

809
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,185
Go on.

810
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,124
The parents will have
to endure it as well.

811
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:01,028
Vijay.. Vijay, dear.

812
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,271
l've been standing
here since morning, Papa.

813
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,007
l'm here now, son.

814
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,075
Come on.

815
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,242
This is not fair, sir.
- You aren't doing the right thing.

816
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,115
This is not the way. - We'll take
your school to the court.

817
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,415
Yes, we'll take you to court.

818
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,853
Whether you take the
coat or the pant..

819
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,117
..it doesn't make
any difference to me.

820
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,217
But before doing
anything you better read this.

821
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,386
Understand.

822
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,895
What is this?
- What is this?

823
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,397
This is the supreme court's order..

824
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,468
..which states that private schools..

825
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,593
..can increase their
fees whenever they want.

826
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,303
But..
- Do you get that?

827
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,101
ls your case sealed now?

828
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,265
Are you happy now?

829
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,468
So, leave now.

830
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:41,635
This is good.

831
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,037
Leave.

832
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,205
Strange.

833
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,874
They've turned the school
into a money-minting machine.

834
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,952
The country is like that.

835
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,953
They don't let us follow the law.

836
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,047
Excuse me, sir.
- And, who are you?

837
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,455
l'm Vijay's father.

838
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,987
Vijay? Who is Vijay?

839
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:01,030
Vijay Damodar.

840
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,930
Vijay Damodar.

841
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,059
He was trying to
avert it for a long time.

842
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,070
Your son has a short memory.

843
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,901
He didn't bring the fees.
So he was bound to be punished.

844
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,432
No, sir.

845
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,340
He wasn't avoiding it,
nor is he forgetful.

846
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,209
He knows that
l don't have the money.

847
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,505
That's why he didn't tell me.

848
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,981
But you made him stand in
the sun for such a small thing.

849
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,146
That isn't right, sir.

850
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,313
That isn't right.

851
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:27,920
And it's right for your
son to sit in the class..

852
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,083
..without paying the fees.

853
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,251
You were enjoying that.

854
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,055
And when l punished him
for the fees..

855
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,528
..you came barging in here.

856
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,223
No, sir, l didn't barge in here.

857
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,068
With great difficulty l
managed to save up his fees.

858
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,468
But you suddenly hiked the fees.

859
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,541
So l'll need some time..

860
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,304
We're just asking
you for a little more.

861
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,107
That's not a problem.

862
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,580
And if it's a problem,
take your child home.

863
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,378
And shower your love
on him. What do we care?

864
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,543
Sir, if you could give me
some time..

865
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:01,556
lf you're asking for time,
l'll give it you.

866
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,525
Fine, l give you two.. hours.

867
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,422
Two hours?

868
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,499
Sir, are you mocking me?

869
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,626
lf you're so addicted to begging..

870
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,729
..and you don't have the stature..

871
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,668
..then get your son
admitted into some other school.

872
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,540
Don't trouble us.

873
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,176
Good that you
reminded me of my stature.

874
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,619
l thought l'd get my son
educated in a good school.

875
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:44,432
But l didn't know that
people here would be such misers.

876
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,230
Now you know, don't you?

877
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,667
See you, bye.

878
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,505
Leave now.

879
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:54,703
You're honest and l'm the liar.

880
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,043
God.

881
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,619
You were the only one left,
come on.

882
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,586
What are you doing, Mr. Sharma?

883
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,020
l'm doing my job.

884
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,292
My duty.

885
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,435
Does your duty teach you..

886
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,630
..to pluck out a
plant before it grows?

887
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,674
Mr. Udyavar, l feel blessed
to listen to your preaching.

888
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,803
But you do understand one thing.

889
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,138
This is a school
and not an orphanage.

890
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,648
Neither does this
school run on donations.

891
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,150
Tell me some thing.

892
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,652
Will you work without your salary?

893
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,692
l will do it this month.
- Really?

894
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,755
Strange. l didn't understand that.

895
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,100
You won't understand it, Mr. Sharma.

896
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:57,436
l suggest you deduct
Vijay's fees from my salary.

897
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,110
Enough.

898
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,287
Vijay, come on, go to your class.

899
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,803
Excuse me, sir, can we come in?

900
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,868
Oh, yes.

901
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,242
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

902
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,487
Sir, we want to talk
to you in private.

903
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,618
Mr. Sharma.
- Yes, sir.

904
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,824
Please step out for a while.

905
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,823
Yes.

906
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,267
Thank God you've returned, sir.

907
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,701
Otherwise, this Sharma
was out to sell the school.

908
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,204
He was doing as he pleased..

909
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,433
..in the name of the management.

910
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,367
Mr. Chauhan is right, sir.

911
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,808
Be it parents or the staff..

912
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,880
..Mr. Sharma misbehaved
with everyone.

913
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,573
He didn't spare anyone.

914
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,755
Sir, please stop Mr. Sharma
from what he's doing.

915
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,414
Please help us.

916
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,552
Do you think Mr. Sharma
has the power or the talent..

917
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:30,292
..to do as he pleases?

918
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,198
He's doing everything
according to my instructions.

919
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,932
On your instructions?
- Yes.

920
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:45,540
A while ago you
asked for my cooperation.

921
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,947
Some days l asked for
your cooperation as well.

922
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,218
You may leave now.

923
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,550
Sure, sir.

924
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:01,262
lf this is being done as per
your orders l'll surely leave.

925
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,524
What do you mean?

926
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,295
l don't know about the others..

927
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,428
..but as a teacher
l can't tolerate this.

928
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,501
l would rather resign.

929
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,672
Mr. Chauhan is
absolutely right, sir.

930
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:19,941
He's a senior here.

931
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,683
And my decision is same as his.

932
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,613
ln fact, it's the same
for all of us.

933
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,290
Yes, sir.
- Yes.

934
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,647
l wonder what's going on.

935
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:01,821
But, what do you say?

936
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,861
Why have you called us all here?

937
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,966
Whatever happened between you
all and the principal today..

938
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,803
..l witnessed everything,
l heard everything.

939
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:23,470
But, sir.. there's one thing
that you all don't understand.

940
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,540
We don't understand?

941
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,014
We approached the principal..

942
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,747
..to complain about
Mr. Sharma and the management.

943
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,822
And you know
what happened after that?

944
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,923
Sir, you could've talked to him.

945
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,428
Tried to explain to him.

946
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,061
You saw that the principal
wasn't ready to listen to us.

947
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,425
So, it was necessary
to do this to stop him.

948
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:48,500
Chauhan, this isn't a
solution for anything.

949
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,601
What if the principal
takes action against us..

950
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,739
..for taking this step?

951
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,002
Mrs. Bose, this is the limit.

952
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,876
Why are you so
scared of the principal?

953
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,814
And Mr. Cyrus, you
always talk negatively.

954
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,678
Say something positive.

955
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,881
What if he resigns?

956
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,457
That isn't possible, Waghmare.

957
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,455
Because if all the
teachers resign together..

958
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,023
..how will the school function?

959
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:17,791
What is this?

960
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,002
What is it?

961
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:31,772
New staff.

962
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:35,576
What?
- What do you mean?

963
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,387
He has actually
arranged for new staff.

964
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,685
The principal and the management..

965
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,553
..are many steps ahead of you all.

966
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,490
When you all give your resignation..

967
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,360
..he'll accept them.

968
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,137
And appoint these new
teachers in your place.

969
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,869
But they won't think
freely like you do.

970
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,073
They'll do as per the
management's bidding.

971
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,809
l'm a man of humble means.

972
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,846
That's why l'm just a peon.

973
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:10,819
You all know that l've
studied only till the fifth grade.

974
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,921
l would walk for five
miles everyday..

975
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:17,890
..to go and study in the school.

976
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,154
Everyday, daily.

977
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:25,500
l put in as much effort as..

978
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:30,104
..students put in for
becoming doctors or engineers.

979
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,902
l put in as much dedication.

980
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,702
l've been here since
the school was built.

981
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,978
Many students came here.

982
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,616
Studied. And left.

983
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,448
But, sir, whenever
l think about these children..

984
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:54,019
..l get very upset.

985
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:00,431
Now you have to think of
something for these children.

986
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,433
You're all educated people.

987
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,799
You can think.

988
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,491
Excuse me, sir. May l come in?

989
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:29,858
Yes, please come in.

990
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,500
Come. Come in.

991
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,846
Mr. Sahay, may l begin?
- Please.

992
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,948
With your approval..

993
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,020
..we'll take complete
advantage of the media.

994
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,124
We'll make your children
participate..

995
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,528
..in every talent,
game show and dance competition.

996
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,894
That will cover your school fees.

997
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,626
And without any doubt
you will make profits.

998
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,528
And the same goes for marketing.

999
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,763
We'll show that your
school isn'tjust a school..

1000
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,010
..but is as famous as a brand.

1001
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,246
A brand everyone would
like to be a part of.

1002
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,739
Ms, Suchitra.

1003
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,712
My job will be to add to
the reputation of the school.

1004
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:24,215
The name of your
school will be flashed..

1005
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,280
..in every newspaper and
television for some reason..

1006
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,554
..or maybe without any reason.

1007
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,953
lf something is
flashed ten times a day..

1008
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,025
..it will compel
people to think about it.

1009
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,866
But all this will be
possible only if..

1010
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,932
..l get full cooperation
from you and your staff.

1011
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,101
You'll surely get support, madam..

1012
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,302
l'm sorry, sir.
But l don't understand this.

1013
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:53,573
lf you don't mind, sir,
may l explain this? - Please.

1014
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,214
Okay, just a second.

1015
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,676
Thank you, Chitra.

1016
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,285
Here. Read the second page.

1017
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,813
On the left side.

1018
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,955
Have you heard this school's name?

1019
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,125
Maruti High school.

1020
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:05,819
This school is in Nasik.

1021
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,121
Have you ever been to Nasik?
- No.

1022
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,164
See. You might never
have been to the school.

1023
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,733
But you know about it.

1024
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,267
That's the power of the media.

1025
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:15,962
Let me show you something.

1026
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,732
Look.

1027
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,300
The achievement of a
child From that school.

1028
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:25,144
''lt's the time to disco.''

1029
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,282
''lt's the time to disco.''

1030
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,014
Superb, what a performance.

1031
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,184
What a performance?

1032
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,149
We'd like to ask Lokesh..

1033
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,321
..who he would like to give
credit for his singing talent?

1034
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:42,096
To my Maruti High School.

1035
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:44,299
l'm Lokesh's class teacher, Shreya.

1036
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,224
Lokesh sits here.

1037
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,796
Thanks a lot to 'Little Sensation'..

1038
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,939
..for giving him such a big chance.

1039
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,699
Lokesh is now a hero.

1040
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,740
And now l want one of them
to be successful too. Please.

1041
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,237
Hello, l'm Lokesh's mother.

1042

We're grateful to
Maruti High School.

1043
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,846
My child came on
television because of them.

1044
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,146
And for your information..

1045

Sir, this will affect the
studies of the children.

Sir, the children will be tired.

1055
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:42,351
They won't be able to cope.

1056
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,885
l don't get tired at this age.

1057
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,220
How can the children get tired?

1058

You're so handsome.

You'll surely be selected
for the show. - Thank you.

1096
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:24,917
Fine, now give me
some cake to eat.

Sir.
- Good morning.

01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,282
Come on, everybody, come on.

1101
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,450
Come on.
- Good morning, sir.

1102
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,617
Good morning. Good morning.

1103
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,487
Sir, why are you waiting outside?

1104
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,490
Because l've decided..

1105
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,959
..we won't learn music today.

1106
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,400
What, sir?
- What, sir?

1107
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,596
Why, sir?

1108
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,897
Today we'll meet someone
who doesn't look like us..

1109
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,273
..or speak like us.

1110
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,340
But there's one thing
they do exactly like us.

1111
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,940
What do they do, sir?
- What is that, sir?

1112
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,110
Make friends.

1113
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,578
Make friends?

1114
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,248
Let's see who befriends them first.

1115
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,292
Me, sir. Me, sir. - Me, sir.
- Me, sir. - Okay, quiet.

1116
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,629
Quiet. Are you all ready?
- Yes, sir.

1117
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,988
Yes.
- Yes.

1118
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,998
Right, let's go.

1119
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,562
Look.

1120
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,400
Wow. Puppies.

1121
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,568
Wow.

1122
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,609
So cute.

1123
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:17,424
Sir, they're trying to bite us.

1124
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:19,963
Look there.

1125
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,103
Parth has befriended the puppies.

1126
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,282
How can Parth befriend the puppies?

1127
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,981
Parth doesn't know
how to make friends.

1128
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,356
Only those who have friends know..

1129
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,622
..how to make more friends.

1130
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,297
Are you Parth's friend?
- No.

1131
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,528
You?

1132
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,097
No.

1133
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:04,709
Then, why did the
puppies befriend only Parth?

1134
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,385
Because the language
of friendship is unique.

1135
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,222
lt only listens to the heart.

1136
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,093
That means Parth's heart is
more pure than all of ours.

1137
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,235
So today's friendship
award goes to Parth.

1138
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,533
Parth.
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,541
Come here.

1140
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,085
Go.

1141
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,461
Parth, would you like
to be my friend?

1142
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,268
Parth, will you be my friend?

1143
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,512
Parth, from today we
all are your friends.

1144
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,052
We all are your friends.

1145
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,790
lf anyone says anything to you..

1146
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,651
..l will beat him up.

1147
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,556
Sorry, sorry.

1148
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,106
Come on, boys, buck up.

1149
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,041
Look, if you..

1150
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,443
Chaudhary sir, will our
photos be published in the papers?

1151
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:50,819
Yes, of course.

1152
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,019
The first layer should
be ready as l whistle.

1153
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,191
Second layer ready for mount.

1154
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:07,894
Come on. Vikram.

1155
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,204
Very good. Very good, boys.

1156
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,963
Come on. Bravo.

1157
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,140
Move ahead.

1158
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:14,934
Balance.

1159
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,873
Third layer.
Ready for mount. Come on.

1160
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,080
Prashant, be careful.

1161
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,979
Careful, son, balance.
Try to balance.

1162
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,381
Yes, right, balance your feet.

1163
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,920
Up.. go up.

1164
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,017
Rishi, balance.

1165
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,351
Spread your hands.

1166
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,492
What superb balance.

1167
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,889
Mr. Chauhan, you've finally
created the great wall of Japan.

1168
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,359
The children are ready.

1169
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,959
Sharma, ask them to hurry up.

1170
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,561
Mr. Bhatia..
- l'm doing it.

1171
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,067
They're ready. Take the photo.

1172
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,234
Mr. Sharma,
it's a technical process.

1173
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,470
l have to help them focus.

1174
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,943
Don't disturb me.

1175
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,105
lt's not like you.

1176
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,045
The children are ready at the
sound of a whistle. - No, no.

1177
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,208
What are you saying?

1178
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:59,482
Mr. Chauhan, just two minutes.
- Steady, boys, steady.

1179
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,282
Bravo, Rishi.

1180
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,857
Careful, son, careful.

1181
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,586
Hey, be careful.

1182
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,120
Very good.

1183
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,287
Careful boys.

1184
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,393
Then go and cover it.
Who are you waiting for?

1185
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,464
That's it, boys, very good.

1186
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,502
The children are standing in the sun.
Will you please hurry up?

1187
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,043
Hurry up, hurry up.

1188
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,237
lt's the great wall of Japan.

1189
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,405
lt can collapse any second.

1190
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,051
Sharma, you're very funny.
- Take the photo.

1191
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,114
Steady boys.

1192
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,282
Ready.
- How will l focus?

1193
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,450
Snacks.

1194
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,589
Snacks!

1195
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:43,131
Keep it there.
- Yes, give it here.

1196
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,125
Treat everyone.

1197
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,366
l have acidity.
You just keep it here.

1198
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,441
What are.. - This is in a
triangular formation as well.

1199
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:56,503
Now you can take a photo.

1200
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,045
Steady boys, steady.

1201
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,911
Bravo. lt's okay.

1202
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,484
Just a little longer. Vikrant.

1203
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,985
Vikrant. Vedant.

1204
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,117
Okay. Okay.

1205
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,616
l know it's tough.

1206
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,451
Why did we practise so much?

1207
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,618
Come on, well done.

1208
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,523
What happened?

1209
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,126
See that.

1210
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:21,661
What did l say?

1211
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,029
lt's the great wall of Japan.

1212
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,697
lt can collapse any second.
lt has collapsed.

1213
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,206
Vicky! Vicky! Rishi! Get up.

1214
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,403
Sorry, boys.

1215
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:31,571
What happened, Vedant?
Are you badly injured?

1216
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,648
No, sir, it's fine.
- Vicky, take him to the dispensary.

1217
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,182
No, sir. lt's fine.

1218
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:44,489
lt doesn't even take 10
minutes to get over with this job.

1219
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:46,559
But you're taking so long.

1220
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,458
Why don't you understand?
They're children.

1221
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,259
They've been practising
since morning. They're tired.

1222
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,325
And what they're doing
is a very difficult task.

1223
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,062
These children aren't stars.

1224
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,468
You're behaving like
their mothers are here.

1225
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:01,298
Do you know who they are?
- No. l don't.

1226
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,308
But now l really want to know.

1227
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,606
Which newspaper are you from?

1228
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,443
Mr. Sharma, you know
we're freelancers.

1229
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,575
Yes, they're freelancers.
- Freelancers.

1230
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,976
Which newspapers do you write for?

1231
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,646
Times of lndia, lndian Express,
Hindustan Times..

1232
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,280
..Dainik Bhaskar?

1233
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,519
Mr. Chauhan, they write
for all the newspapers.

1234
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,357
Don't you?
- Yes.. we're going to.

1235
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,257
Did you hear that?

1236
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,095
They are going to.
- l heard it.

1237
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,327
They're very influential
freelancers.

1238
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,528
They're hogging on free snacks.

1239
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,664
Eat it.
- No, Mr. Sharma.

1240
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,037
That's enough.

1241
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,201
We're being insulted.

1242
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,676
Wait, wait.
- No, no.

1243
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,041
Wait, take the photo. - lt's a
question of our self-esteem.

1244
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,273
lt's the question of
the school's reputation.

1245
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,179
Mr. Chauhan, please go
and get your photo taken.

1246
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,615
He insulted us.

1247
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,084
Bhatia, take the photo.

1248
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,247
Back to your classes, come on.

1249
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,355
We'll do it once more, sir.
- No need.

1250
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,586
Please, sir, everyone
has been working hard..

1251
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:53,753
..since so many days.

1252
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,121
Sir, just once.
- We'll do it, sir.

1253
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,199
Sir, sir, please.
- Please.

1254
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,460
Come on.

1255
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:02,730
l'm coming right away.

1256
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,499
l'm completely bored here.

1257
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:05,767
l'm coming.

1258
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,133
Come on.
- Where do we have to go?

1259
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,074
Let's go. - We're needlessly
getting bored here.

1260
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,146
His Ferrari is rolling out.
- Who fled away?

1261
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,044
Mr. Sharma, why do you
eavesdrop everywhere?

1262
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,811
An actor's Ferrari is
rolling out from the customs.

1263
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,176
We have to go and cover that.

1264
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,254
Please. We're
leaving now. You take care.

1265
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,447
We'll come back tomorrow.
- Yes.

1266
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:21,818
And yes, the snacks..
- They'll be here.

1267
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:23,182
You just be here.

1268
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,295
lt's entirely your fault,
Mr. Chauhan.

1269
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,365
You always keep finding faults.

1270
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,229
Now he's gone to cover that Ferrari.

1271
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,097
Now bring back your
students tomorrow..

1272
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,534
..to make this great wall again.

1273
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,439
Sharma, don't talk to much.

1274
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,599
Someday you'll get beaten up.

1275
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,108
Back to your classes, boys.

1276
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:49,810
Sir, the photograph?
- They'll come back tomorrow.

1277
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,712
Now go.

1278
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,464
ls it paining a lot?

1279
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,100
He doesn't feel any pain.

1280
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,765
He's our superhero.

1281
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,137
Vedant.
- Yes.

1282
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,301
lsn't it, Vedant?

1283
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,572
He should've bled some more.

1284
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,172
That way your superhero
would've come back in shape.

1285
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,418
Vicky, we worked so
hard since morning.

1286
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,549
But they didn't take our picture.

1287
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:32,885
That's okay.

1288
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,492
Chauhan sir has said
they'll return in a few days.

1289
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,690
They'll take it then.
By then you'll be fine as well.

1290
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:39,725
Okay.

1291
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:42,194
''l'm your lover..''

1292
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:43,794
''l'm your lover..''

1293
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,168
Very good, very good, son.

1294
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,673
Next.
- But, sir..

1295
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,402
Fine, son..
- l haven't completed..

1296
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,568
Next, next.

1297
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:51,771
Come fast.

1298
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,742
Come on, start.

1299
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,719
''lt feels so unique in your..''

1300
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,158
What happened? Do you have
a soar throat? - No, sir.

1301
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,521
Then sing properly.
- Yes, sir.

1302
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:10,395
''lt feels so unique in your..''

1303
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,557
Hello.

1304
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,393
How are you?

1305
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,267
What's going on?

1306
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,430
How was the party?

1307
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,202
Did you enjoy it?

1308
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,506
You sing. You sing.

1309
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:23,569
Sorry.

1310
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:29,276
''lt feels so unique in your arms.''

1311
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:30,443
No, no, l can't come.

1312
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,612
''lt feels so unique in your..''

1313
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:34,882
Next.

1314
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,951
Take it down.

1315
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:43,755
992354631 .. 0.
- Excuse me, sir.

1316
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:46,460
Yes, l've sent it.
l'll talk to you later.

1317
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,536
The children are singing.
lf you could just..

1318
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,831
l'll call you later, l'll call you.

1319
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:55,975
Mister. What is your name?
- Rahul.

1320
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,874
Mr. Rahul,
l can clearly understand..

1321
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,973
..your excitement as well
as that of the children.

1322
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,685
But see.. l'm just doing my job.

1323
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:07,947
l do this everyday.

1324
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,556
Okay. And l know my job..
very well.

1325
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,861
Listen.
- Yes, sir.

1326
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,456
Yes.

1327
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,358
lf we keep taking
auditions of everyone..

1328
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,902
..it will take a week.

1329
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:26,703
l suggest, we pick up
five-six children randomly.

1330
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,242
Okay. Start selecting.

1331
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,636
Sir, that one.

1332
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:35,473
No, there's no..
character in his face.

1333
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:42,982
Him.

1334
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:47,895
Come out, come out. Come on.

1335
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,021
Come on. Yes, come on.

1336
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,027
Take him.

1337
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,462
Sir, him?
- Look at his face.

1338
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,397
Sympathy votes, stupid.

1339
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,736
Definitely, sir.
- l hope he cries in every show.

1340
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,637
Sir, these ones? Come on,
come on. Get up fast.

1341
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,480
Sir, this one or this one?

1342
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,050
But we've rehearsed together.

1343
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,949
That one.
- Fine, fine.

1344
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,612
Go there, quick.

1345
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,815
Leave her hand.

1346
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,548
And go there. Quick. quick.

1347
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:19,552
And you sit down.

1348
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:20,719
And you be quiet.

1349
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,294
Sir, shall we take him?
He'll be absolutely perfect.

1350
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,493
Me?

1351
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:31,033
Bad. Very bad.

1352
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,673
lf you like him
you can take him home.

1353
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:42,781
Excuse me, sir, please
behave with the children.

1354
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,016
Please don't
discriminate between them.

1355
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,747
Let everyone audition.

1356
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:48,986
Will you stop directing us?

1357
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,520
Look, you've done yourjob.

1358
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,322
You've taught them
what you had to.

1359
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,757
Now, let us do ourjob.

1360
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,432
That's exactly
what you aren't doing.

1361
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:00,896
Your assistants choose anyone..

1362
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,971
..and make them stand on the stage.

1363
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,066
Some sing solos, some duets.

1364
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,671
Some sing lndian,
while some sing western.

1365
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:07,833
And some sing for quire.

1366
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:09,969
And then, you're also
breaking up their combinations.

1367
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,944
That'll shatter the
confidence of the children.

1368
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,574
They'll lose.

1369
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:15,975
They'll lose?

1370
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,587
Mr. Rahul, this is a reality show.

1371
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,421
Do you know what a reality show is?

1372
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,788
Which has everything
except the reality?

1373
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,959
Everything that you see..

1374
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,120
..the judges quarrelling..

1375
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,488
..children missing their parents..

1376
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,656
..their surprise visits..

1377
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,529
..them being shocked
when eliminated.

1378
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,662
All that you see are charades.

1379
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,529
They're only charades.

1380
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,672
And they're perfectly
scripted and performed.

1381
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,872
Mr. Rahul, we do need talent.

1382
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,443
But to ask for votes.

1383
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,039
And you've been
interfering for so long by saying..

1384
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,411
..''Take him, take him.''

1385
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,842
Will they get SMSs?

1386
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:55,719
SMS?
- Yes, my friend, SMS.

1387
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,716
Everyone sings well.

1388
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,460
But people like and
select the ones..

1389
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,928
..who have the talent to
ask for votes as well.

1390
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,024
Because the TRP's of
the show increases..

1391
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,532
..through these votes.

1392
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,764
And through SMSs channels
make profit.

1393
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,837
Anyway, let's not talk
about the industry..

1394
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,066
..that you don't understand.

1395
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,471
You're right.

1396
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,803
l don't understand the
ways of your industry.

1397
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,573
But l do understand these children.

1398
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,447
Please act sensibly
with these children.

1399
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:24,743
They're trying to impress you..

1400
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,980
..and you aren't even
giving them a chance.

1401
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,951
lf you want help l'm right here.

1402
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,115
Just ask for my help.

1403
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,794
But give them a fair chance.
- Okay.

1404
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:35,554
He sings well.

1405
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:36,722
He sings well.
- Yes, he does.

1406
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,557
Come on, come on.

1407
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:39,725
Come on, come on.
- Go.

1408
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,769
Come on, fast, fast, fast, fast.
- Go, go, go.

1409
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,537
Come on, come on. Come on,
come on. Faster, faster.

1410
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:45,999
Yes, good. Come here.

1411
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,067
Good.

1412
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,837
This is your microphone.
Come on, sing.

1413
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,475
Sing your favourite song, alright.
- Yes, sir.

1414
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:55,172
Good, start. One, two, three, go.

1415
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,816
What happened? You
sing well, don't you?

1416
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:01,680
Come on.

1417
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,117
What happened?

1418
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,552
l said, sing.

1419
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,027
Come on. Stop crying, stop crying.

1420
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,688
Come on! Come on, start singing.

1421
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,528
One, two, three, start.

1422
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:13,931
Your face will be seen
on the screen as well.

1423
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:15,162
Don't hide your face.

1424
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,934
Oh, God! What the hell is this?

1425
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:27,573
Okay.

1426
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,241
ls this what you've
taught them, Mr. Rahul?

1427
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,622
They're your winners?

1428
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,021
Who'll come to the
sets to pacify them?

1429
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:40,619
Will you?

1430
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,757
You behave similarly..

1431
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,163
..when they score
less marks, don't you?

1432
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:47,694
So this is my way of working.

1433
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:49,762
Are you satisfied now?

1434
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,536
l'm sorry.

1435
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,608
No, l won't go for the
music show without you.

1436
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,581
But you've been selected.
- No.

1437
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,178
We're best friends, Preeti.
- l know.

1438
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:08,689
But when you come on television..

1439
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,624
..l'll cheer, clap and SMS for you.
- No.

1440
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,692
Madam, l've been telling
everyone the same thing.

1441
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:20,063
Look, the children are studying.

1442
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,533
And this job is going on as well.

1443
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:23,762
What is it called?

1444

Why don't you keep them on my head?

1449
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:37,249
Yes, l was saying.

1450
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,084
Madam, it's a part of education.

1451
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:40,312
Wouldn't you like it as well?

1452
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,690
Your child's photo will be
published in the newspapers.

1453
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,218
He'll be seen on television.

1454
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:47,161
When you walk on the road,
People will say..

1455
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,729
..''There goes Krish's mother.''

1456
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,328
Oh, yes,

1458
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,301

01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,263
Sir, have you understood?
- Yes.

1460
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:00,636
Then please leave.

01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,073
l have to take care of
so many files.

1462
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:04,234
Hi, darling, will you come with
me for the party this evening?

1463
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,608
Get out of my way.

1464
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,181
No one can dare to
refuse Jimmy Oberoi.

1465
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:09,875
Move away.

1466

Let go of my hand.

1467
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,246
Whenever Jimmy Oberoi

..he never let's go.
- Leave my hand.

1469
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,850
A helpless woman can
sacrifice everything.

1470
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,154
But not her honour.

1471
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,264
l suggest that you
give everything to me.

1472
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,061
And keep your honour.

1473
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,362
Stupid.
- Darling.

1474
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,198
Cut it, one more. One more.

1475
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,662
Atif, help him memorize the lines.

1476
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:32,831
That fool.
- Yes, sir, right away.

1477
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:34,199
You don't seem well.

1478
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,176
You're also sweating.

1479
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,744
l suggest, you go inside and rest.
Don't stand out in the sun.

1480
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,306
Yes, you better leave.

1481
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,076
Go.
- But, how?

1482
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,111
Mr. Sharma is standing at the back.

1483
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,279
The school seems so wonderful today,

1484
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,279

01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:54,893
l'm tired, how long
will they make us do this?

1487
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,692
lt's so hot.

1488
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,129
Even l can't bear it anymore.

1489
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,892
My face is burning.
l need to go to the washroom.

1490
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,001
Anyway, the shoot's there.

You can go.

Girls, where are you going?

1493
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:09,968
Come on, one more take.

01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,136
Okay. Back to your positions.

1495
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,769
You go there, and you there. Okay.

1496
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,173
Come on, hurry. Hurry.

1497
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,876
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

1498
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,278
Sir, let the girls leave.

1499
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,647
And we need to go to
our class as well.

1500
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,016
Hey, hero, go to
your position. Come on.

1501
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,655
That's what we've been
doing for the last two hours.

1502
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,187
You're shooting there,
your hero's there.

1503
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:24,383

You'll teach me manners?

01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:33,292
You'll teach me manners?

1508
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:34,860
Acting smart.

1509

Do you want a slap?

1510
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,203
Let him go. He's just a child.

1511
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,340
What happened?
- He's trying to teach me framing.

1512

1513
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,101

What's going on?

1518
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:52,344
Will you finish studying today?

1519
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,348
Will you take all the degrees today?

1520
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:57,153
Just quietly stand
wherever he asks you to stand.

1521
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:58,886

Do you get it or not?

Come on, children, go and

Director, please continue.

01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,763
l didn't trouble my
parents for toys at all.

1541
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,962
lnstead, l gave them a surprise.

1542
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,296
How?

1543
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,965
By baking a cake for them.

1544
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,541
lt was very yummy and very easy.

1545
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,903
First, take a big bowl.

1546
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:32,085
Then add egg, sugar, milk,
flour and this.. baking powder.

1547
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,478
Cut, cut.

01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:35,479
Mr. Cake baking powder..

1549
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,922
..and Jhil-Mil cream tastemaker.

1550
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,084
Will you remember that?

1551
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,858
Continue from there.

1552
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,452
Camera. Action.

01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,274
What a stupid child?

1558
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,309
Where did you get him from? Useless.

1559
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,342
He can't even say the
sponsor's name correctly.

1560
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,912
Sorry, sir.

1561

He's just a child.
- - What are you saying?

1567
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,326
They give us money
and finance our shows.

1568
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,367
lf we don't take
the sponsor's name..

1569
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,436
..our channel will shut down.
Are you out of you're sense?

1570
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:23,834
They're everything for us.

1571
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,032
Please, son, you leave.

1572

Sir, give me one more chance please.
- No!

1573
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,271
Not even once.

1574
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,470
You're stupid.

1575
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:32,978
You don't have a brain!

1576
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:34,275
Go.

1577
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,242
Why are you still
standing here? Go from here.

1578
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:38,977
Go.

1579
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:42,481

1585
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,467
Silence please.
- Silence please.

1586
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:02,142
l'll see how much
you remember. Come on!

1587
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:09,073
Hello, l'm Sweeny.

1588
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,879
A second-standard student
of Saraswati Vidya Mandir.

1592
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:24,990
Wait. wait.

1593
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,397
Friends, are you ready?
- Wow. Good.

1594
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:30,662
l think, yes.

1595
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:35,065
So, first we'll take the potatoes..

1596
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:38,542
..which we've already
chopped into small pieces.

1597
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:43,915
Now, first we'll take Dr. Cook salt.

1598
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,187
She remembers the names of
the sponsors as well. Good.

Okay. Later, we'll

1603
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,476
Zoom, zoom, zoom.
- What happened?

1604
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,206
There's chilly
powder in Sweeny's eyes.

1605
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,216
Keep zooming.
- Good, very good.

1606
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,376
My eyes are burning.
- Brilliant.

1607
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,544
My eyes are burning.

1608
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:21,246
This will do wonders for the TRP.

1609
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:22,447
My eyes are burning.

1610
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,615
Someone quickly get water.

1611
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,987
Get the camera.
- My eyes are burning.

1612
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,151
What happened, Sweeny?
- My eyes are burning.

1613
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,558
Get the lights. Get the lights.
- My eyes are burning.

1614
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:29,323
Get the water quickly. Sweeny.

1615
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:31,693
Move the lights away. The
child's eyes are burning.

1616
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,058
Aren't you ashamed?

1617
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,401
What are you doing?

1618
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,096
We'll go to the doctor.

1619
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:39,599
Move the camera.

1620
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:40,969
Madam, what are you doing?

1621
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,436
What if the camera's lens
had broken?

1622
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,136
What if something
happens to the child's eyes?

1623
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,044
We're going. We're going.

1624
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:49,539
Take them away.
They're all rejected.

1625
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,676
We were only shooting
extra footage.

1626
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:55,122
We've already finished
our selection.

1627
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,525
Come on. Turn off
the camera, let's go.

1628
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,683
Yes, sir.

1629
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:37,287
Everyone's asleep.
- Yes, dear.

1630
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,194
One minute, Okay.

1631
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,705
Rohan. Rohan.

1632
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,443
l'll say everything properly.
- Rohan.

1633
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,606
Mr. Cake baking powder.

1634
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,809
Jhil-Mil cream.
- Rohan. Rohan.

1635
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,249
lt's okay.
- Sorry Ma'am.

1636
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,447
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1637
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,452
Everyone's asleep.

1638
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,492
And you didn't change your uniform.

1639
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:11,164
l was tired, that's why.

1640
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,390
Sorry. Just a minute.

1641
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,628
Rohan, it's okay. You
don't need to change. Okay.

1642
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:17,495
Madam.

1643
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,140
Notjust the uniform, no
one has eaten as well.

1644
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:25,503
What?

1645
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,508
This is what happens everyday now.

1646
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,474
They get tired and fall asleep.

1647
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:33,621
They used to create
such a commotion earlier.

1648
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:37,085
Now l don't even hear them whisper.

1649
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,823
You haven't eaten?
- No.

1650
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,764
Don't worry, l'll feed you.

1651
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,338
lt's your favourite dish.

1652
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,270
Potato, lentil and bread.

1653
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:57,708
This is potato, and yummy,
yummy lentil.

1654
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:58,870
Here.

1655
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:11,351
''Lord, You control everything.''

1656
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:17,893
''No one can go against Your will.''

1657
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:21,400
''ln the scorching sun..''

1658
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:28,169
''..Lord, you can
make flowers blossom.''

1659
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:31,278
''You created the paths.''

1660
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:34,313
''You created the destination.''

1661
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:40,510
''We've set out with our caravan.''

1662
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:50,859
''Lord, You control everything.''

1663
01:27:51,165 --> 01:28:16,184
EROS

1664
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:22,827
''All the leaves have
fallen from every branch.''

1665
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:28,492
''This garden has been disrupted.''

1666
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:40,908
''This place once beamed
and gleamed with happiness.''

1667
01:29:26,928 --> 01:29:29,692
''You're our guardian.''

1668
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,365
''So why did You
bestow this order on us?''

1669
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,403
''Even the angels will be upset.''

1670
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:39,265
''To see these consequences.''

1671
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,537
''No one wants this.''

1672
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:51,415
''Why are You acting
so strangely with us?''

1673
01:29:51,886 --> 01:30:01,352
''Lord, You control everything.''

1674
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:07,961
''No one can go against Your will.''

1675
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,928
''ln the scorching sun..''

1676

1677
01:30:17,945 --> 01:30:20,846
''You created the paths.''

1678
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,940
''You created the destination.''

1679

''We've set out with our caravan.''

1680
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:28,615
Waghmare.
- Yes, sir.

1681
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:35,323
l need your help.
- Help?

1682
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,654
My help, sir?

1683
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:38,857
Who, sir?

1684
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,427
The school.

1685
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,063
The school.

1686
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,933
l gave 30 years of my life to it.

1687
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,706
lt's a small task.

1688
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:52,504
Tell me.

1689
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,671
But it's dangerous.

1690
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,608
But it's for the
sake of the school.

1691
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:03,388
lt's much more compared to
your 30 years of service.

1692
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:07,787
What do l have to do, sir?

1693
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,837
When Mr. Dholakia was here..

1694
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:26,778
..he gave the principal this file.

1695
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:30,543
And sir asked me to keep it safe.

1696
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,821
Mr. Rahul, what's in these papers?

1697
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:48,063
The answer to all the questions.

1698
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,563
Which all of you need?

1699
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:00,475
Sir, can l keep the file back?

1700
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:07,145
Keep this back.

1701
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:42,054
Sir.
- Yes.

1702
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,180
Please come out and take a look.

1703
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,820
What?
- Take a look for yourself.

1704
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:48,987
What is the problem?

1705
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,135
What's going on here?

1706
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,075
Why are you all standing outside?

1707
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,120
Are we having the
assembly outside today?

1708
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:50,722
Get back to your classes.
- Sorry, sir.

1709
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:06,234
But no one will go inside today.

1710
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,904
So, you're their leader.

1711
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,708
No, sir, you're the leader.

1712
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:14,906
l'm just the staff.

1713
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:16,909
And they are your students.

1714
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:19,786
We just want to ask
you one question.

1715
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:21,779
What's the reason..

1716
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:24,281
..you've turned your back on us?

1717
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:27,126
l don't consider it
necessary to answer you.

1718
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:29,788
Get back to your classes, come on.
- Sorry, sir.

1719
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:33,323
But as long as you feel..

1720
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:36,626
..it isn't necessary to answer us,
we'll keep standing here.

1721
01:34:55,056 --> 01:34:57,320
So? Are you assured now?

1722
01:34:58,025 --> 01:34:59,925
Did you hear what
the principal said?

1723
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:04,591
Mr. Udyavar, on the first
day you gave me a jolt.

1724
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,132
Will you get the entire
school to agitate now?

1725
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:09,034
He has already chosen his career.

1726
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:11,295
All of you better
worry about your careers.

1727
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,799
l'm sounding the bell.
Get back to your classes.

1728
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,186
You won't listen this way.

1729
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:10,855
l'll teach everyone a lesson.

1730
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:14,164
l'll throw each one
of you out of here.

1731
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:36,448
Mr. Rahul,
You didn't know my worth.

1732
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:40,716
That's not the point.

1733
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:45,197
When l am not sure what
l was doing right or wrong..

1734
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:48,427
l wouldn't have been
here if you were wrong.

1735
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:55,273
We were all suffering.

1736
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:59,942
Everyone wanted to do
something to get out of this.

1737
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:06,017
l could've never
imagined what you did today.

1738
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:08,745
We're all with you.

1739
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:14,022
Once again, welcome to SVM, Rahul.
- Thanks.

1740
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:26,901
We've just received news from
Saraswati Vidya Mandir school.

1741
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:29,737
Located in the
eastern suburbs of Mumbai.

1742
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:31,810
The students of
Saraswati Vidya Mandir school..

1743
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:33,880
..located in the
eastern suburbs of Mumbai..

1744
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:35,448
..are on a strike.

1745
01:37:35,549 --> 01:37:37,380
Thousands of students
have gone on strike.

1746
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:39,983
Even the teachers
are supporting them.

1747
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,155
According to our sources..

1748
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:43,314
Sir, these papers..

1749
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,085
Rahul Prakash
Udyavar is behind all this.

1750
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:47,225
The reason behind this strike is..

1751
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:50,956
Yes, Sujata, l've received
so many calls since morning.

1752
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,033
l'm just watching that
on television.

1753
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:56,195
The children are standing
in the sun since morning.

1754
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,361
'Zestful morning' with Janvi.

1755
01:37:57,471 --> 01:37:58,529
Good morning, how are you?

1756
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:00,136
l'm your favourite Archana Janvi.

1757
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:02,471
And you're listening to
BlG 92.7 FM.

1758
01:38:02,576 --> 01:38:03,838
And this isn't a joke.

1759
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:06,936
Students have set a
principal straight.

1760
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,105
l don't believe this.

1761
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:10,183
This morning's.. This year's..

1762
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,342
This century's biggest news..

1763
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:15,013
A young teacher of
Saraswati Vidya Mandir..

1764
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:16,248
..influenced the students so much..

1765
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:18,382
..that they went on a
strike against the principal.

1766
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,323
God, what's happening?

1767
01:38:20,861 --> 01:38:23,022
They say, ''lf this continues..''

1768
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:25,360
''..what will happen to the
school and the country?''

1769
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:32,204
Sir. Strike in school.

1770
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:42,373
Today, for the first time l feel..

1771
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:45,145
..that something good is
happening and l'm a part of it.

1772
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:48,512
Mr. Hansotia, it's the first time
you said something positive today.

1773
01:38:50,024 --> 01:38:51,548
l will not be scared from today.

1774
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:53,955
l won't be scared of anyone.

1775
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:59,122
l will stand before the
principal and face him.

1776
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:05,065
Ma'am, now l feel that
your name suits you. Bose.

1777
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:20,048
Sir, your name?
- Rahul.

1778
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:22,517
Sir, l've heard that
you've started this strike..

1779
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,084
..and the entire school
is with you.

1780
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:26,216
But what's the reason
for this strike?

1781
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:32,025
Well.. - Are the teachers
supporting the children's decision?

1782
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:35,258
This isn't a strike
or a revolution.

1783
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:37,961
We're simply asking the
principal a few questions.

1784
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:40,905
And we want answers.

1785
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:45,211
No one is answering
our questions properly.

1786
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:46,506
But it seems like this
is a very serious matter.

1787
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:48,308
Let's find out the
reaction of the people..

1788
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:50,280
..from our correspondents.

1789
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:51,543
Strike, what is that?

1790
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,051
Saraswati Vidya Mandir.

1791
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,415
Yes, my friend studies there.

1792
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,352
Right now we are in front of
Wilson college of Mumbai.

1793
01:39:56,457 --> 01:39:57,617
We want to know that..

1794
01:39:57,925 --> 01:39:59,187
l think it's purely unethical.

1795
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:00,983
They've called for a
strike at such a small age.

1796
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:02,221
What will they do in future?

1797
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:04,421
Nowadays it's really important
to pressurise the system..

1798
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:05,657
..to get what you want.

1799
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:07,524
But that doesn't mean you
put your career at stake.

1800
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:09,033
That is not the right way.

1801
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:13,530
At times they give
electric shocks to children.

1802
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:16,005
Or make them hike up
to 10 kilometres.

1803
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:17,608
Or clip their hair.

1804
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:19,240
What's wrong with the school?

1805
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,507
l didn't get a chance to study
that's why l'm a taxi-driver.

1806
01:40:21,715 --> 01:40:23,512
Strike is a common
thing in this country.

1807
01:40:23,617 --> 01:40:25,585
The schools these days have
turned into business centres.

1808
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:27,647
They ask the parents to get
money for every small thing.

1809
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:29,047
And education..

1810
01:40:29,156 --> 01:40:30,623
Education has gone for a toss.

1811
01:40:30,724 --> 01:40:33,192
But this is the time to teach
these school authorities a lesson.

1812
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:34,954
l'm standing right outside..

1813
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:39,294
There are many questions and..

1814
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,458
The on-going strike by the
students of Saraswati Vidya Mandir..

1815
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:43,092
..is an historical event.

1816
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:46,202
Has the era of revolution returned?

1817
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,137
Surely, the era of
revolution has returned.

1818
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:50,972
l know principal Sahay.
He'll surely solve this issue.

1819
01:40:51,145 --> 01:40:53,113
lt'll be recorded in
history as a black day.

1820
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:54,605
Black day.

1821
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,508
Hello.

1822
01:40:58,018 --> 01:40:59,144
Sir, l'll have it sent.

1823
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:00,344
Pandurang.

1824
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:06,323
Dholakia, what's
going on in your school?

1825
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,054
Don't worry sir. l'm
look into the matter.

1826
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:09,220
l don't want to hear anything.

1827
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:11,990
Look, the media is
pressurising our government.

1828
01:41:12,433 --> 01:41:13,730
And the CM was inquiring as well.

1829
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:16,401
Sort this matter out internally..

1830
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,596
..before an inquiry
commission is ordered.

1831
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:22,037
Or else, it'll affect
your other business as well.

1832
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:24,402
Fine, sir. l'll talk
to Sahay right away.

1833
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:30,243
Cancel all my meetings.

1834
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:31,510
l don't want to see anyone.

1835
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:35,155
Sahay, who is this new teacher..

1836
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:36,688
..who's creating all this trouble.

1837
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,382
What the hell is going on here?

1838
01:41:38,559 --> 01:41:39,992
The entire press and the media..

1839
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,187
..have gathered outside my office.

1840
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:44,455
l don't want that man.
Do you understand that?

1841
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:48,725
That is what you wanted.
- Don't try to teach me, okay.

1842
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:50,731
Stop this charade.

1843
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:53,063
l'm answerable to 10 people.

1844
01:41:53,173 --> 01:41:54,470
And you know very well..

1845
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:56,440
..that l'm the trustee
of the school.

1846
01:41:56,543 --> 01:42:00,673
Do you know the meaning of trustee?
- Sahay..

1847
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:02,043
Shut up!

1848
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,175
No!

1849
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:12,454
'Sir, revolution
doesn't belong to an era.'

1850
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:14,390
'lt can occur anywhere,
anytime and anyhow.'

1851
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,553
'Right, sir?'

1852
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,389
Mr. Principal, what compelled
the children to go on a strike?

1853
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:45,319
The people are asking
this question and not us.

1854
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:46,585
You will have to answer it.

1855
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:49,127
Principal Sahay, this issue
has reached the upper house.

1856
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:50,355
What would you like
to say about that?

1857
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:54,160
l'm the principal of
this school, Sahay.

1858
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,530
l'm responsible for
everything that has happened.

1859
01:42:59,573 --> 01:43:03,805
And l resign.

1860
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:12,146
Would you like to ask anything else?

1861
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:14,618
Mr. Principal, what is
the reason behind this?

1862
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:21,388
Sir, tell us the reason behind it.
- Why are you resigning?

1863
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:22,553
Sir.

1864
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,561
You cannot leave like this, sir.

1865
01:43:30,737 --> 01:43:33,228
Why can't l?
That's what you all want.

1866
01:43:34,174 --> 01:43:36,540
Notjust the teachers, but the
children want it as well. - No, sir.

1867
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,742
No, sir, these children are here..

1868
01:43:39,846 --> 01:43:42,679
..because l know what the truth is.

1869
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:46,548
l want you to tell them the truth.

1870
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,287
What do you know?

1871
01:43:58,665 --> 01:43:59,791
l read the file.

1872
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:07,233
l can understand
your situation, sir.

1873
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:14,541
These children are
your strength, sir.

1874
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,475
Tell them the truth.

1875
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:24,516
What good will that do?

1876
01:44:26,226 --> 01:44:27,488
Until now you were fighting alone.

1877
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:30,654
But now we'll fight together.

1878
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:45,400
Please, sir. - l don't know
why you're doing this.

1879
01:44:54,755 --> 01:44:56,950
My friends, colleagues.

1880
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:02,260
Rahul Prakash..
- Udyavar, sir.

1881
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:04,330
What?
- Udyavar.

1882
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:05,823
Udyavar.

1883
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:07,559
Rahul Prakash Udyavar.

1884
01:45:09,236 --> 01:45:16,574
He compelled me to..
say something to all of you.

1885
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:24,775
'Vidyadaan' (lmparting education).

1886
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,583
lt's such a noble profession.

1887
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:34,218
But teachers are paid the least.

1888
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:36,723
When there are no choices left..

1889
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:43,000
..then people come
here to become a teacher.

1890
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:44,361
l feel really bad.

1891
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:45,796
ln our times..

1892
01:45:48,408 --> 01:45:52,310
..when children make
it to the merit list..

1893
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:55,540
..there are only two
professions they choose.

1894
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:57,617
Doctor and engineer.

1895
01:45:58,819 --> 01:46:02,653
But the teacher's profession..

1896
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:06,988
..would always attract me.

1897
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:11,954
l always felt that we get a chance..

1898
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:15,660
..to create a new generation.

1899
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:22,271
One lifetime is less
for such a job.

1900
01:46:23,777 --> 01:46:26,007
l didn't want to share my sorrows.

1901
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:28,710
And that's
why l didn't get married.

1902
01:46:28,815 --> 01:46:30,783
Even if l had gotten married..

1903
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:33,944
..l would've had two children,
but there are already so many.

1904
01:46:34,788 --> 01:46:36,688
l know everyone by their names.

1905
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:38,348
l know who is mischievous.

1906
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:43,022
But when.. you grow up,
you look different..

1907
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:45,355
..and grow moustaches,
dress differently.

1908
01:46:45,766 --> 01:46:48,564
There are times someone
comes and touches my feet.

1909
01:46:48,668 --> 01:46:49,930
And l ask, ''Who are you?''

1910
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,635
And he says,
''Sir, l belong to the '86 batch.''

1911
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:55,807
Saraswati Vidya Mandir.

1912
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:57,569
l'm in the army now.

1913
01:46:58,378 --> 01:47:01,506
l'm the owner of that company.

1914
01:47:01,615 --> 01:47:02,673
Or the manager.

1915
01:47:02,783 --> 01:47:04,080
lt feels really nice, very proud.

1916
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:06,045
What else can you call it?

1917
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:08,411
l never considered it a business.

1918
01:47:09,823 --> 01:47:12,758
lt has always been a
profession for me.

1919
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:14,326
That is what l believe.

1920
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:18,831
Today, this profession
has turned into a business.

1921
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,898
Commercialization has
taken over everywhere.

1922
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,833
There's competition.
Everything needs to be upgraded.

1923
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:27,566
Whether your thoughts
are up to date or not.

1924
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:30,032
But the school has to be updated.

1925
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:33,778
Unfortunately, l have to say..

1926
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,510
..that the parents are getting
attracted towards this as well.

1927
01:47:39,519 --> 01:47:42,750
lt's true that there
should be certain amenities.

1928
01:47:42,856 --> 01:47:46,792
But this is a school.

1929
01:47:48,695 --> 01:47:50,390
Not a five-star hotel.

1930
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:56,396
The chairman.. of our trust..

1931
01:47:56,503 --> 01:48:00,940
..called me regarding this issue.

1932
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,671
Sahay, l think
you've been showing me..

1933
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:06,746
..the same account books
for the last 12 years..

1934
01:48:06,847 --> 01:48:09,611
..in which only the dates
change and not the figures.

1935
01:48:09,716 --> 01:48:10,876
What's going on?

1936
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:12,042
Where are the profits?

1937
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:16,380
Sir, they leave our school educated,
that's our profit.

1938
01:48:17,924 --> 01:48:21,052
Education is a noble profession.

1939
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:24,926
And that is what we've been
doing for the last 12 years.

1940
01:48:25,866 --> 01:48:28,994
And monetarily, we're doing fine.

1941
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:32,697
You're that old school master..

1942
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:34,931
..who doesn't dress traditionally.

1943
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:37,874
Grow up, Mr. Sahay, grow up.

1944
01:48:40,614 --> 01:48:41,876
The world has changed.

1945
01:48:42,749 --> 01:48:44,580
Competition has become intense.

1946
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:47,816
The schools, which were
social commitments for you..

1947
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:50,013
..have turned into
profitable businesses.

1948
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:51,454
Daniel High School.

1949
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:53,816
lt started four years ago.

1950
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,790
And is charging ten times our fees.

1951
01:48:56,963 --> 01:49:00,023
But the reputation of
our school is much better.

1952
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:02,628
l don't want reputation,
l want money.

1953
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:03,794
Have you understood that?

1954
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:05,862
Do you understand that?

1955
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:07,131
Get infrastructure.

1956
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,208
Give them facilities.
lntroduce courses.

1957
01:49:09,509 --> 01:49:10,567
lmprove the canteen.

1958
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:12,508
l don't care how you
do it, just do it.

1959
01:49:12,612 --> 01:49:14,842
lt should be like
a five-star school.

1960
01:49:15,482 --> 01:49:17,450
That means you want
to create an illusion.

1961
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,746
You want to create an illusion
in the parents mind. -Yes.

1962
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:21,445
And if you don't help me..

1963
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:23,182
..l'll be forced to
close down the school.

1964
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:27,851
Don't give me that smile.

1965
01:49:28,128 --> 01:49:29,459
Don't give me that smile.

1966
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:31,194
You know that l can do it.

1967
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:34,829
And if you have the courage,
read this.

1968
01:49:35,635 --> 01:49:37,796
lf you don't make huge
profits from this school..

1969
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:39,872
..l'll close it down. Get it?

1970
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:41,497
So, upgrade, Mr. Sahay.

1971
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:42,834
Upgrade your school.

1972
01:49:43,143 --> 01:49:46,010
But don't expect any
money from me. Understand?

1973
01:49:48,181 --> 01:49:51,116
'No, there wasn't any other option.'

1974
01:49:52,118 --> 01:49:54,086
lt was important to
introduce new facilities..

1975
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:55,848
..and for that we needed money.

1976
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:58,213
Look, l could've helped you..

1977
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,755
..if you needed a
personal or housing loan.

1978
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:02,558
But you're asking me
for something..

1979
01:50:02,662 --> 01:50:04,755
..where there's no
guarantee of returns.

1980
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:07,098
Please take a look
at the file once.

1981
01:50:08,568 --> 01:50:11,765
You may trust.. - Trust is not
a guarantee, Mr. Sahay.

1982
01:50:11,905 --> 01:50:12,963
Please try to understand.

1983
01:50:13,073 --> 01:50:14,734
l can't do anything. l'm helpless.

1984
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:16,873
Mr. Sahay, please.

1985
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:19,103
Try somewhere else.

1986
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,774
Hello, send him in.

1987
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:26,547
lf you take a look at
the file once.. - Madhav.

1988
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:33,286
Send Gupta in.
- 'l went to finance companies.'

1989
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,285
'But they gave me the
same reply everywhere.'

1990
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:40,122
'No. Some said it subtly,
while others rejected me outright.'

1991
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,595
But l didn't lose hope.

1992
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:45,568
Vrijesh Kumar.
- Yes.

1993
01:50:46,006 --> 01:50:47,564
Sujata Adhikari.
- Yes.

1994
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:49,632
Tanushree Verma.
- Yes.

1995
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:50,867
You can go in.

1996
01:50:53,046 --> 01:50:54,673
l'm Aditya Sahay.

1997
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:57,614
Oh.. sorry but your name
is not in the today's list.

1998
01:50:57,884 --> 01:50:59,010
l had an appointment.

1999
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:00,780
l know that, but sir is very busy.

2000
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:03,687
l'll come back tomorrow.

2001
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,018
Sir is going out for two months.

2002
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:06,922
You can come after that. Excuse me.

2003
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:12,264
Slowly, all my hopes
were shattering.

2004
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:14,732
l was shattering.

2005
01:51:17,804 --> 01:51:20,796
l thought l wouldn't be
able to save my school.

2006
01:52:01,014 --> 01:52:03,346
l wanted to share
this with all of you.

2007
01:52:06,953 --> 01:52:09,751
But l thought you all
are not that strong.

2008
01:52:09,856 --> 01:52:10,914
Maybe l was wrong.

2009
01:52:12,258 --> 01:52:14,351
Maybe you're stronger than that.

2010
01:52:17,697 --> 01:52:19,995
l know you've suffered a lot.

2011
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:21,792
l'm sorry.

2012
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:24,829
And l was suffering as well.

2013
01:52:25,438 --> 01:52:27,167
So please forgive me if you can.

2014
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,379
Because l had a reason.

2015
01:52:38,118 --> 01:52:39,847
l wasn't aiming for any profits.

2016
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:45,020
Just one..

2017
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:54,422
For the first time l took
a decision from my head..

2018
01:52:54,734 --> 01:52:56,201
..and not my heart,
and l was wrong.

2019
01:52:58,304 --> 01:53:00,204
l'm only happy about..

2020
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:06,010
The school not closing down.

2021
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:10,206
Because you all are together.

2022
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:20,058
l never realised how
l spent 32 years.

2023
01:53:22,862 --> 01:53:25,922
l don't know how
l'll spend the rest of the days.

2024
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:34,798
l love you.

2025
01:53:36,009 --> 01:53:37,067
l love you.

2026
01:53:41,247 --> 01:53:42,305
All the best.

2027
01:54:27,794 --> 01:54:30,228
Which are the two most
frequent events in this country?

2028
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:31,763
First is the hike in petrol prices.

2029
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:32,923
And the second is a strike.

2030
01:54:33,299 --> 01:54:34,789
The game's over now.

2031
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:36,368
Everyone get back to your studies.

2032
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:38,869
Because the strike in
Saraswati Vidya Mandir is over.

2033
01:54:38,972 --> 01:54:40,496
We're standing outside
Saraswati Vidya Mandir.

2034
01:54:40,807 --> 01:54:44,174
But regretfully the
principal has resigned.

2035
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:47,804
But we'll always
remember what he said.

2036
01:54:48,114 --> 01:54:50,241
Yesterday's incident is an
eye-opener for those schools..

2037
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:52,318
..that concentrate more on
the facilities of the school..

2038
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:53,544
..than on education.

2039
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,945
Like principal Sahay said..

2040
01:54:56,055 --> 01:54:57,886
..it's necessary to
upgrade the school.

2041
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:00,789
But more important than that
is to upgrade your thinking.

2042
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:04,921
You can SMS us your
views on 6688 for Aaj Tak.

2043
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:12,495
Excuse me, sir.

2044
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:16,202
You're excused.

2045
01:55:18,478 --> 01:55:22,073
For seeing my personal files.

2046
01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:26,845
l came back for some stuff
that l had left behind.

2047
01:55:28,321 --> 01:55:29,845
l wanted to say something to you,
sir.

2048
01:55:33,159 --> 01:55:35,127
Your reputation is much greater..

2049
01:55:35,228 --> 01:55:37,321
..compared to your
age and experience.

2050
01:55:39,132 --> 01:55:42,260
lt sounds nice when it
comes from your mouth.

2051
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:48,131
By the way, sir, this
school needs a principal.

2052
01:55:51,477 --> 01:55:55,038
l tried from a
commercial angle, and failed.

2053
01:55:58,184 --> 01:55:59,981
So why don't you try
it as a hobby, sir?

2054
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,850
lt's not my hobby. lt's my passion.

2055
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:07,149
You talk like the revolutionaries.

2056
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:10,254
Sir, a revolution
doesn't belong to an era.

2057
01:56:12,498 --> 01:56:13,590
Right?

2058
01:56:15,601 --> 01:56:16,898
l heard that somewhere.

2059
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:19,431
Passion is everlasting.

2060
01:56:24,444 --> 01:56:25,502
Have a good day.

2061
01:56:25,678 --> 01:56:27,009
Look after yourself.

2062
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:39,925
Sir. -Yes.

2063
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:48,929
What is it?

2064
01:56:52,071 --> 01:56:53,129
What is it?

2065
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:54,998
Tell him.

2066
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:13,216
Thank you.

2067
01:57:14,293 --> 01:57:17,126
Cut your hair.

2068
01:57:20,133 --> 01:57:22,158
Sir, please, please don't go.

2069
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:27,262
Please, don't go, sir.
- Please, sir.

2070
01:57:27,373 --> 01:57:28,499
Please, don't go, sir.

2071
01:57:29,175 --> 01:57:30,233
We love you, sir.

2072
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:33,010
