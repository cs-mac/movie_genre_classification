1
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
<i>This is Samantha...</i>

2
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,300
<i>...my mother's pet goose.</i>

3
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
<i>Mama loves her...</i>

4
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,200
<i>...just like one of the family.</i>

5
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,800
<i>But I hate that bird.</i>

6
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,400
<i>And she hates me.</i>

7
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,800
<i>She's mean and sneaky.</i>

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,100
<i>And full of tricks.</i>

9
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,100
<i>It seems every First Day morning...</i>

10
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,300
<i>...when we're ready to go to Meeting...</i>

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
<i>...and I got on
my best Sunday clothes...</i>

12
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,100
Samantha!

13
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Thee old hisser!

14
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll blow thee up with a cannon!

15
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Some day I'll drown thee,
thee old squawker!

16
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,100
Little Jess!
What is thee saying, child?

17
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
Samantha tried to bite my legs off.

18
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Next time, I'll throw her down the well.

19
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,100
Here, Samantha.

20
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
See, Little Jess?

21
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Speak to her kindly.
She'll not bite thee.

22
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
She's a pure pet, Samantha is.

23
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,500
She's a snake on stilts!

24
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,900
I'll put her on the chopping block
and chop her head off.

25
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
Hush, hush!

26
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,400
Let's have no more talk of killing.

27
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,400
Run upstairs now and fetch thy brother
and sister. We'll be late for Meeting.

28
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,500
Blackberry pie?

29
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,700
Yes, blackberry pie.

30
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,200
No need to stick thy finger in it
to find out. No dilly-dallying!

31
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,600
Go fetch Mattie and Josh.

32
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Well...

33
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
...perhaps.

34
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,400
Well!

35
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,300
This afternoon?

36
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,600
All right!

37
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
What's thee talking to thyself for?

38
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,300
I'm not talking to myself.

39
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,400
Who's thee talking to then?

40
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,400
I don't see nobody.

41
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Thee knows what happens
to eavesdroppers?

42
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Their ears get long as a hound dog's!

43
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,700
Mama says to hurry.

44
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
I am, but I have to finish
my toilet-tee.

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,100
What's a toilet-tee?

46
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Thee wouldn't know about it
because thee doesn't wash.

47
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,000
Please leave my boudoir.

48
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
"Please leave my boudoir. "

49
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,800
Does thee...

50
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,300
Does thee think I'm pretty?

51
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Thee's not ugly.

52
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
I guess thee's pretty...

53
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,500
...for a girl.

54
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, thank thee!

55
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
Thee's welcome.

56
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,700
Powie! I got Jeff Davis!

57
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,000
Powie! I got old Stonewall Jackson!

58
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Powie! I got old Little Jess Birdwell!

59
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Meet the real Stonewall Jackson...

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,100
...and thee won't feel so feisty.
Get up.

61
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,300
What would thee do
if thee met Old Stonewall?

62
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,400
Mama said not to talk about the war.

63
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Mama said for thee to hurry up.

64
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,500
She's the preacher.
Meeting can't start till she's there.

65
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,000
And anyway, Caleb Cope and me
are riding our horses to Meeting.

66
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,200
Thee old long arms!

67
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,400
Look! Pa's warming up Red Rover.

68
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,900
Where?

69
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,900
How a horse can look so fast
and move so slow beats me.

70
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Thee can hitch him up, Enoch.

71
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You got him nice and warm this morning.

72
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,400
Whoa, Mildred!

73
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Hello there.

74
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,500
Guess I'm lost.
Must have got on the wrong road.

75
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,500
My! Quite a looker, that horse.

76
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,900
He's a looker, all right.

77
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,600
Maybe you can help me. I'm trying
to find that Methodist church.

78
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,600
Thy first turn's at the crossroads.
Bear right for three miles.

79
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,600
Is thee preaching there this morning?

80
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,400
- Who's preaching there?
- Thee?

81
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,600
- Who?
- Thee.

82
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Me?

83
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,300
That's a dandy!
Son, I'm not a man of the cloth.

84
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,800
I sell organs.

85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,600
Now, what in thunderation is all this
thee-ing and thou-ing about?

86
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,500
Bible talk to honor the Sabbath?

87
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,600
No, we talk that way weekdays too.

88
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Excuse me, but it sounds mighty queer.

89
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,900
Who's "we"?

90
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,600
Quakers.

91
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,600
Quakers! Have you folks
got a church around here?

92
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,300
Yes, we call it a Meeting House.
It's just beyond the Methodist Church.

93
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,800
Hast thou an organ in thine
Meeting House, friend?

94
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,000
We don't hold with music playing.

95
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,600
What, no organ?

96
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,100
Dear me! Why, a church
without an organ...

97
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,500
...is like a tree without a bird.

98
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,100
Wait till I talk
to that minister of yours.

99
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,700
He'll never be content
until he buys an organ.

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,300
I wish thee luck with the preacher.

101
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,000
That's three miles over, take
the main road, turn right. I got it.

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,300
Thank you.

103
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Thee.

104
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,100
Get up!

105
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,700
Now look, Mildred...

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,200
...there is a horse!

107
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,400
- I'm going by Caleb's, Pa.
- All right, son.

108
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Red Rover, that man
paid thee a compliment.

109
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,200
If he only knew.

110
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,200
Listen, Red, just don't slow down...

111
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,100
...when thee hears Sam Jordan
coming behind us...

112
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,700
...and, by sugar, we'll stay
out in front today.

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,500
- Thee say something, Jess?
- I was just soothing Red Rover.

114
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,600
If thee talked as much to the Almighty
as thee does to that horse...

115
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,100
...thee might stand more squarely
in the light.

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Sounds like thy sermon's
already begun, Eliza.

117
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,700
Why, Jess!
I thought thee liked my preaching.

118
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Now, Eliza, thee has the prettiest
pulpit voice I ever heard.

119
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
And thee says the truest words.

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,800
Especially during Silent Meeting?

121
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
And this morning,
thee looks like a girl.

122
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,100
Where's Little Jess? Mattie!

123
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm coming, Mama.

124
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,700
Made the stockade in the nick of time.

125
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,800
- Goodbye, folks.
- Goodbye, Enoch.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Good luck, Mr. Birdwell.

127
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,500
Why does Enoch wish thee good luck
every First Day morning?

128
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I guess it's because he...
He wishes me luck!

129
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
Hey, Papa, look!

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,200
It's thy friend, Sam Jordon, Jess.

131
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
No need to look. I can feel him.

132
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,300
Gard's with him!

133
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Mattie, Little Jess, stop craning
thy necks at the Jordans.

134
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,000
It isn't seemly.

135
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,700
Yes, Mama.

136
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,500
Sure are a-coming.

137
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
Thee's not urging thy horse?

138
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,800
Not urging. Just encouraging a mite.

139
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,000
Come on, Red Rover!

140
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
Sit down!

141
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,400
Come on, Prince!

142
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,300
Come on, lazybones!

143
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,700
Come on, Prince! Good boy!

144
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,100
What's gotten into thee?

145
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,600
Morning, Mattie.

146
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,500
Morning, Eliza.
Good morning, Jess.

147
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
- Come on, Papa!
- Come on, Prince!

148
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
Come back, come back!

149
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,300
Mama!

150
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,800
Little Jess, let go!

151
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Come on, Prince!

152
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,500
Gard winked at Mattie.

153
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,700
He did not!

154
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,200
I saw him.

155
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,900
Gard wouldn't do such a vulgar thing!

156
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
I hope nobody saw us.

157
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
Me too.

158
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,300
I want to come to Meeting with nothing
in my heart but peace and love.

159
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,400
Thee gives me a pain.

160
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,500
<i>One eternal day</i>

161
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,600
<i>There, God the Son
Forever reigns</i>

162
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,800
<i>And scatters night away</i>

163
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,300
<i>Filled with delight
My raptured soul</i>

164
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,700
<i>Would here no longer stay</i>

165
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>Though Jordan's waves around me roll</i>

166
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,000
<i>Fearless I'd launch away</i>

167
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,000
Last week...

168
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,100
...I had my 80th birthday.

169
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,300
<i>And I'd like to bear witness
to Proverbs.</i>

170
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,100
First chapter...

171
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,200
...33rd verse.

172
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,200
"Who so harkeneth unto Me...

173
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
...shall dwell safely...

174
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,800
...and shall be quiet
from fear of evil. "

175
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,600
Amen, Emma. Amen.

176
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,500
I ask the prayers of everyone here
to help me be less worldly...

177
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,400
...less concerned about my appearance...

178
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,200
...to mind my tongue...

179
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,900
...and especially have the strength
not to wear earrings.

180
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,200
I've never spoken in Meeting before...

181
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,100
...but I feel so happy this morning
I'd like to share my happiness...

182
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
...with everyone in the whole world.

183
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,300
And to thank our Heavenly Father.

184
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,500
God is love!

185
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,300
Won't thee come in, friend?

187
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,300
Thank you.

188
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,900
You're the minister of this meeting?

189
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
I am. One of them.

190
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,900
My name is Major Harvey.

191
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,100
- Won't thee sit down, friend?
- Thank you, no.

192
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,100
I've had the duty placed upon me of
speaking to you Quakers about the war.

193
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
It is a matter much on our minds...

194
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
...and in our prayers.

195
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,500
But your men don't fight in it.

196
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,600
Some have.

197
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,000
But you do not encourage them.

198
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,500
We do not encourage them.

199
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,500
Ma'am, the Union has endured
two years of bloody civil war.

200
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,800
Thousands have given their lives in
battle to free our country from slavery.

201
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
We are opposed to slavery.

202
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,700
But we do not believe it right
to kill one man to free another.

203
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,300
Ma'am, it's not going to be a question
of fighting for freedom or a principle...

204
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,200
...but of protecting our own towns,
our own homes, from attack.

205
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Would you men stand by while others
die to protect you?

206
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
You look like a boy who could give a
good account of himself.

207
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,800
I've been tempted to fight.

208
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,400
I guess the Good Lord knows why.

209
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,300
I mean, sometimes I get the
sinful wish to get into a scrap.

210
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So I got to watch myself
closer than most people.

211
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,800
So I'll just stay away from the war.

212
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,500
Because if I ever got into it,
I'd be a goner.

213
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,300
And you, son?

214
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,700
Are you ready to put up with looting
and killing without lifting a finger?

215
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,200
Are you afraid to fight?

216
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,900
I don't know.

217
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,500
Here, at last, is an honest answer.

218
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,900
I don't wish to offend...

219
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,000
...but how many of you are hiding
behind your church to save your skins?

220
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,600
Is it right to let others fight for you?

221
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,200
To protect your lives and your property?

222
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Why don't you speak up?

223
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
I'll speak up.

224
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Nothing could ever induce me
to bear arms against my fellow man.

225
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,700
Burn my house!

226
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,200
Destroy my crops! Attack my family!

227
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
And I declare to all...

228
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,400
...especially to thee, Josh Birdwell,
wavering in thy convictions...

229
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,800
...nothing can move me to violence!

230
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,500
Nothing!

231
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,900
It seems Friend Purdy has already
been moved to considerable violence.

232
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,500
I misdoubt any of us here
could say with surety...

233
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,900
...what we would do in case of attack.

234
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,700
I have my doubts as to the strength
of thy convictions too.

235
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,200
I have my own doubts.

236
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,200
I've often asked myself...

237
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,500
...what I would do if I saw
my family endangered...

238
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,100
...my wife and children threatened.

239
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,300
If the test comes, all I can say is...

240
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,800
...I hope and pray I can be an
instrument of the Lord.

241
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,300
That test is coming.

242
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,300
It may well be so, friend.

243
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Let us pray that the will of God
be revealed to us...

244
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,900
...and we be given the strength
and grace to follow His will.

245
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Lord...

246
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,700
...let Thy children partake of Thy love
and the love of all men...

247
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,200
...rendering not evil for evil,
nor violence for violence done.

248
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,500
Let swords be changed into
ploughshares...

249
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,300
...and spears into pruning hooks...

250
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,100
...and children of peace
learn war no more...

251
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
...forever.

252
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,900
Eliza, what does thee like about
that shifty-eyed bird?

253
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,900
Why, Jess!

254
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,600
She marches along so lordly-like.

255
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Marched real lordly through two pecks
of young strawberries this morning.

256
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,600
- Hello, Gard.
- Hello, Josh.

257
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,900
- You home on leave?
- Got a week's furlough.

258
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Hello, Little Jess, Mrs. Birdwell.

259
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,000
Hello, Mr. Birdwell.

260
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,300
I came over to apologize about
that little brush last Sunday.

261
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,400
It wasn't my idea.

262
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,800
We know that.

263
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Jess is going to get a nice slow horse
that doesn't have any racing ideas.

264
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,700
Did thee shoot any rebs?

265
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
What are they like?

266
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,200
They're just people like us.

267
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,200
But did thee shoot any?

268
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,100
Let's have no more talk of war...

269
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,600
...and killing.

270
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,100
I'm sorry, ma'am.

271
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,600
- Come in and set.
- Thank you.

272
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,400
You folks going to the fair?

273
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,100
I used to like the fair...

274
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,000
...but it's come to be
no place for us.

275
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
They've got some fine exhibits.

276
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Needlework, livestock, poultry.

277
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
And geese.

278
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,100
Eliza, it might be just the place
to pick us up a nice slow horse.

279
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,900
Thee go, Jess. The fair's come to have
so many sideshows, freaks, dancing...

280
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,700
Dancing?
What does thee know about dancing?

281
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,000
She knows a thing or two.

282
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,300
Did Mama ever dance?

283
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That was 20 years ago.

284
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,100
Twenty years exactly, come October.

285
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,400
I was courting her.

286
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,100
But did Mama dance?

287
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,000
No, child.

288
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,400
She was tempted to lift a foot,
but she married me instead.

289
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,000
Did thee propose then and there?

290
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,200
Dinner's ready.
Stay and eat with us?

291
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd be pleased to.

292
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,800
What about the fair?

293
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,400
- Come on, Josh, Jess.
- Can we go, Papa?

294
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,000
There's no point in putting temptation
in the children's paths.

295
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
We'd resist it.

296
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,800
We'd resist it as well as thee did.

297
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,100
Why can't we go?

298
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,800
She'll never let us go.
Mama's so straight-laced!

299
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,300
Maybe I can loosen up a few laces.

300
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Isn't it ghastly, ladies and gentlemen?

301
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,800
Isn't it horrible?

302
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,600
This shining blade,
with the razor-edged blade...

303
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,300
...will pass through his mouth,
through his throat...

304
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
...into his very vitals!

305
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,100
And here we have Flame-o...

306
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,100
...the Human Volcano!

307
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,200
Do not deprive your children
of this educational act.

308
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Let's get away from here.

309
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,900
- I promised Caleb I'd meet him.
- Mattie, look at the quilting with me.

310
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,000
Thee wants to see quilts, Josh wants to
meet Caleb, and I want to see livestock.

311
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,400
Let's meet...

312
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,700
...over here by the harvesting machine
in one hour.

313
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,500
Thee stay with me.

314
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,200
Oh, Josh.

315
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,300
There's a rock exhibit I think
thee and Caleb might find edifying.

316
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,800
- Rocks?
- Come along.

317
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm hungry. I want some candy.

318
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,800
Thee's had thy breakfast. Come along.

319
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm thirsty.

320
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,800
You shoot that squirrel down
three times, you get a beautiful prize.

321
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
It's a hit!

322
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
How's that?

323
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,900
Got him.

324
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,200
Howdy, Mr. Birdwell.

325
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,100
Say, you're an old squirrel-shooter.
I'll treat you.

326
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,100
Give that man a rifle.
Another marksman here.

327
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,600
That squirrel sits so still
he makes me nervous.

328
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,700
Never mind the comments, just hit...

329
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,400
He did hit the squirrel!

330
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,000
Where's Mattie?

331
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,200
They're over by the quilting booth.

332
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
See you later.

333
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
Thanks, Gard.

334
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Folks, the man's about to shoot...

335
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
He hit it again!

336
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
Thee wait right here.

337
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,100
You won yourself one of these
beautiful prizes here.

338
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,000
One of these beautiful pri...

339
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,500
One of these beautiful prizes.
Them prizes was made and manufactured...

340
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,500
...by Pierre of Paris, France.
You heard of him?

341
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,500
I ain't either. The man's having a
hard time to make up his mind here.

342
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,800
For Eliza?

343
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,300
- No, thanks.
- Wait!

344
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,400
You won it fair and square.
I insist you take them, friend.

345
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,500
There! Pair of garters
for your wife to wear!

346
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Or your sweetheart!

347
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,700
Just as soon as you get out of mourning.

348
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Come on.
I want to show you something.

349
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,000
How about a demonstration?

350
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,700
I'd just be delighted.

351
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,100
Delighted. Step right in, gentlemen.

352
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
Nothing would please me more.

353
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,600
Low bridge.

354
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,100
Well, Mr. Birdwell, come right in.

355
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,800
Gentlemen, welcome to my organatorium.
Just make yourself at home.

356
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,900
A temple of temptations,
full of instruments of the devil.

357
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,200
Gentlemen, I'd like you to take
a look at this magnificent instrument.

358
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,000
Now, isn't that a beauty?

359
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,900
Just as smooth as silk,
and as fine as frog's hair.

360
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,900
I'll pay two to one if you guess
the shell which contains the pea.

361
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Take your chin off the board.
You'll tip it.

362
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,600
As you see, there's nothing here,
nothing here.

363
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
The pea's there,
and I put the shell over it.

364
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,700
Now, we move the shells.
Watch very closely.

365
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,600
Now where is the elusive little pea?

366
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Boy...

367
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,000
...will you go away?

368
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,100
Forty-eight reeds,
plus the tuba miraballis.

369
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
How many stops?

370
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,300
So you know organs!

371
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,100
It has eight stops
and this vox humana.

372
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,000
Cries like a baby, sighs like a woman.

373
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm partial to music, but I'm a Quaker
and they're against music.

374
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,100
The Quaker!

375
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,200
Why, certainly I remember distinctly.

376
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,000
Thee, thy, thou...
Of course.

377
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,500
But I want you to know, sir,
I honor your prejudices...

378
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,700
...convictions.

379
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,300
Boys, let me tell you...

380
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,100
...there are two kinds of music just the
same as there are two kinds of women:

381
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,700
The uplifting kind and the...

382
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Now, here.

383
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
You take the banjo. Now, there.

384
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,800
There is an instrument that stirs up
a man's worst passions.

385
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,800
Speech!

386
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,700
Speech, ma'am!

387
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,300
Thank thee kindly.

388
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,100
Watch very closely. We go again.

389
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,500
<i>Beware of the owl
Who's waiting to howl</i>

390
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,300
<i>Especially beware of the crow</i>

391
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,900
<i>Of the...</i>

392
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
<i>...crow</i>

393
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, fellows!

394
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,300
By George! That was wonderful!

395
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
This is that rare silver process.

396
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,800
You see the fine workmanship of
Professor Grady. He is the foremost...

397
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,600
Now where is the little pea?

398
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,800
Thank you, madam. Thank you!
Everything's back to normal now.

399
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,300
Now, just a minute.
Place your fingers there. That's it.

400
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,900
Now pump.

401
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,400
Wonderful!

402
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,500
Why, Friend Birdwell,
you've got a real touch.

403
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,100
A real, natural-born touch.

404
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,900
Ice-cold lemonade here!

405
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,300
Who'll have a cold drink?

406
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,300
Has thee forgotten thyself?

407
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,300
I'm to blame.

408
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Mattie didn't want to dance.
I made her.

409
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,500
Let's look for thy father.

410
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,000
It's my last day of furlough.

411
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,500
I mean, I was hoping that Mattie
could stay with me for a while.

412
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Gardiner, thy duties as a soldier
and Mattie's as a Quaker lie far apart.

413
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,100
God bless thee, Gard.

414
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,500
Come along.

415
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,500
Goodbye.

416
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,500
That's a mighty fine fight.
A mighty fine fight!

417
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Here's your coat.

418
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,000
All right, men. Now's your chance
to get the Billy Goat.

419
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,800
Who'd like to give me a silver dollar?
Is there one man...

420
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,400
Caleb Cope!
He can throw the Billy Goat!

421
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,100
- Which one is that?
- There.

422
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
You mean the Quaker man here?

423
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,000
Come on in here, Quaker man!

424
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,500
Thee shouldn't fight.

425
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,900
This ain't fighting.
This is just friendly wrestling.

426
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,200
Go get him, Quaker!

427
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,000
All right, gentlemen!

428
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,400
May the best man win.

429
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Let's go!

430
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
- Did I hurt you?
- What's wrong with you?

431
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
You didn't hurt me. Let's go.

432
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,100
No, thanks.

433
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,800
Come on. Let's go.
What's the matter with you?

434
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,400
The Quaker boy quit!

435
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,900
- Why didn't you kiss him?
- Quitter!

436
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Quitter!

437
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,700
Hold on. I want to talk to you.

438
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,600
Leave him alone.
It's against his principle to fight.

439
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,600
Losing a bet's against my principles.
I think you're in with the boss.

440
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,300
- No, sir.
- So why'd you stop?

441
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,200
- He's a Quaker.
- Shut up! Who wants to hear you?

442
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,700
- Let them alone! These boys believe...
- I know.

443
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,000
They believe in loving their neighbor.

444
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,800
I'm their neighbor.
Do you still love me?

445
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,500
I feel sorry for thee, friend.

446
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,400
Thee feels sorry for me?

447
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,700
Don't let him talk to you that way.
Milk sop!

448
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,400
If thee wants to hit
someone, friend, hit me.

449
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,300
It'll be a pleasure.

450
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,700
I'll take a whack at him.

451
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,200
You want to fight?

452
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,600
You aren't showing me nothing.
What's the matter, Quaker boy?

453
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
- What's the trouble, friend?
- Another friend!

454
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,900
Thee needs cooling off.

455
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,300
My hat!

456
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,900
- Let me up!
- Thee not thirsty, friend?

457
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,100
Is thee having an altercation?

458
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,900
Okay, let's break it up.
Come on.

459
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,000
Fighting!

460
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Dancing! Gambling!

461
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,100
Wrestling! And...

462
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,100
- Sleeve-holders.
- Sleeve-holders?

463
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
I never saw sleeve-holders like that.

464
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,900
They're from...

465
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,100
...Pierre, in Paris.

466
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,700
Listen, thee dirty...

467
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,500
But Mama, he took my hat.

468
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,100
It'll be a pretty day. Be hot
the other side of the Ohio though.

469
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,800
I wish thee didn't have to
make this trip.

470
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,400
It's too close to the war to be safe.

471
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,200
Now, Eliza, I have to
see my customers...

472
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,200
...this time of the year.

473
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,800
Leave Josh at home then.
He's so young to be exposed to danger.

474
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,700
Thee can't keep him tied
to thy apron strings.

475
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,700
This trip will be good for him.

476
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,700
Horse is hitched, bags stowed away,
we're off! Let's go!

477
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,800
Is thee so anxious to leave home?

478
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,600
I want to see Ohio.

479
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,100
I'll miss thee.

480
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,800
Come on, Pa!

481
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,500
Take good care of Josh.

482
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,200
God bless and keep thee.

483
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,700
Jess, see if thee can't
get rid of that horse.

484
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,000
- Afternoon.
- Howdy!

485
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,500
Man of the house around?

486
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,100
Ain't no man in this house
since Pa died.

487
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,300
And Mrs. Hudsp...

488
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,100
Hudspeth?

489
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,500
Ma's here.

490
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
Couple of men to see you!

491
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,200
Men!

492
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,400
Men?

493
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,700
Ma's coming!

494
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,600
Hi!

495
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,200
Hello.

496
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,900
- Mrs. Hudspeth?
- That's me.

497
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,300
I'm Jess Birdwell. I have
first-class nursery stock for sale.

498
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,800
- What kind?
- Everything in orchard fruits.

499
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,600
If thee likes apple trees, there's
Maiden's Blush, Ramblos and Winesaps.

500
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,400
In the berry line, there's
raspberries, gooseberries and the like.

501
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,100
- This your boy?
- This is Joshua.

502
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,600
Meet my girls.

503
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,200
This is Opal, Ruby,
she's my baby, and Pearl.

504
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,100
Gems, every one of them!

505
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,100
Girls, meet Joshua.

506
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,000
Back!

507
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,100
Don't overdo it, girls.

508
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,300
Come in the house.
Let's talk business in comfort.

509
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,300
Sit down, son.

510
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,400
They won't bite you.

511
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,800
Menfolks are so scarce here, the girls
get carried away at the sight of one.

512
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,400
But I keep telling them, "Easy does it. "

513
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,300
Ain't that right?

514
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,100
As a Quaker, I've always been
against violence, Mrs. Hudspeth.

515
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,900
A Quaker, huh?

516
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,000
I guessed as much
from the way you talk.

517
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,400
All that thee-ing and thy-ing.

518
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,400
If I put my mind to it, I can say
you or yours if it suits thee.

519
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,900
No, sir.

520
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,000
"Pleased to meet thee.
Are these thy daughters?"

521
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Prettiest talk I ever heard.

522
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Makes me feel kind of romantic.

523
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,600
Come sit down.

524
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,600
Let's talk business back here.

525
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,000
You been on the road long?

526
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,200
About ten days.
Heading home tomorrow.

527
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,500
See any rebel raiders?

528
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,100
Everything peaceful all the way.

529
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,300
I hope you're right.

530
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,200
What if them ruffians come thieving
with nobody on the farm...

531
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,900
...but four defenseless women?

532
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,000
I shudder to think of it.

533
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,900
Now, about that nursery stock...

534
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,500
First look at my south 40...

535
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,000
...and tell me what orchard stock
would be best there. Opal!

536
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,300
Go hitch up Lady.

537
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,400
We'll drive my mare.

538
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Give your animal a rest.

539
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,400
We can bed you down for the night.

540
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
That's very kind.

541
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,500
- But...
- Oh, now, no buts!

542
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,300
Glad to have some men around
for a change.

543
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,700
Ruby.

544
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,900
Go lay out some clean bedding,
will you?

545
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,400
All right, Ma.

546
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,200
Get going.

547
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,100
Pearl, take care of Josh
while we're gone.

548
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,700
Now, you just set right back here.

549
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,800
I don't want to be a bother.

550
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
You ain't no bother.

551
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,500
Sure is a nice place thee has here.

552
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,900
Want a smoke?

553
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,700
I don't smoke.

554
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Want a drink?

555
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,700
I don't drink either.

556
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,200
Thee have one.

557
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,300
Not unless you do.

558
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,600
Is this a Narragansett Pacer?

559
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,400
You know that breed?

560
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,300
Thee's a favored woman.

561
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,700
That mare ain't got
but one real fault.

562
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,300
She won't be passed.

563
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,400
- Won't be passed?
- No, sir!

564
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,400
What's the fault in that?

565
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,000
I've got three marriageable daughters.

566
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,800
A man ain't got any heart for courting
a girl he can't catch up with...

567
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,600
...let alone pass.

568
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,800
It shouldn't be hard to find
a horse willing to be passed.

569
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,300
Hello, Abigail!

570
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,300
That's old Whiskey Pete.

571
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,700
He ain't drawed a sober breath
in 30 years.

572
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,100
Fool's always trying to race somebody.

573
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,900
Old drunk!

574
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,200
Why don't thee let her out?
Don't fight her. Let her go!

575
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,200
I'm going to learn this consarned mare
she's got to be passed!

576
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,900
Put my hat on!

577
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,400
Pull it down!

578
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,800
Not that far!

579
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,100
What are you doing?

580
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,600
It's all right.

581
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,200
Easy, Lady. Easy.

582
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,100
Sorry, I kind of overreached myself,
grabbing the reins thataway.

583
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,200
Don't apologize.

584
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,500
For a man, it's suitable to beat
another man in a race on a public road.

585
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,000
Do you ever think about getting
thy girls a horse a mite more...

586
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,800
...maidenly-acting?

587
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,000
I've thought of it.

588
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,300
You've got a stylish animal.

589
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,900
Red Rover's a looker, all right.

590
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,100
Got racing notions?

591
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,500
Not that he can't pick up
his heels a bit.

592
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,500
But racing's a thing
he's got no stomach for.

593
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,800
You wouldn't consider a trade, I reckon.

594
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,600
I don't know.

595
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,000
A strong-minded animal like this
can be a plaguey nuisance.

596
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,100
A forceful man like yourself
could learn her better in no time.

597
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,200
If you's a mind to.

598
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,800
Seems a likely exchange.

599
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,900
Then let's shake on it.

600
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,500
Don't leave it hanging.

601
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,700
<i>A handsome young drummer
Came by in the spring</i>

602
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,400
<i>With beautiful laces</i>

603
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,900
<i>In cases</i>

604
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,100
<i>I'm sorry, she said</i>

605
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,700
<i>I can't buy anything</i>

606
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,900
<i>'Tis love that I need</i>

607
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,000
<i>More than laces</i>

608
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,200
<i>Won't you marry me</i>

609
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,100
<i>Marry me</i>

610
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,300
<i>Up to the altar please carry me</i>

611
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,300
<i>Give me combs for my curls
Made of silver and pearls</i>

612
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,500
<i>And a two-penny bridal bouquet</i>

613
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,400
<i>Say</i>

614
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,900
<i>Hurry up</i>

615
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,600
<i>Hurry up</i>

616
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,600
<i>Hitch that old horse to the surrey up</i>

617
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,300
<i>And I'll vow to be true
To no one but you</i>

618
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,500
<i>So marry me, marry me, do</i>

619
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,000
<i>Dear Lady,
The handsome young drummer replied</i>

620
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,700
<i>The whole situation's bewildering</i>

621
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,600
<i>Last winter the cough</i>

622
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,600
<i>Carried off my poor bride</i>

623
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,100
<i>If you want to take care</i>

624
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,500
<i>Of six children</i>

625
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,000
<i>Come and marry me</i>

626
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,500
<i>Marry me</i>

627
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,200
<i>Pack your valises and marry me</i>

628
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,300
They're coming!

629
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,000
They're coming!

630
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,700
I'm glad to have thee home.

631
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,300
- Thee'll break my ribs!
- I'll get the bags.

632
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,400
I'm glad thee's back.
I've missed thee.

633
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,700
I've missed thee.

634
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,400
Come, thee must be hungry.

635
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,200
- Where's Mattie?
- She'll be back soon.

636
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,000
Where'd thee get this horse?

637
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,900
Thee kept thy word.

638
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,700
Thee got rid of Red Rover.

639
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,100
Glad to see you.

640
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,100
Is this horse well?

641
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,300
There's nothing to fear on that score.

642
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,500
She's not much to look at.
But if thee doesn't mind that...

643
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,700
Mind!

644
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,800
This is the very horse
I've been praying for.

645
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,300
A good, plain animal that won't fill
every man on the pike with racing ideas.

646
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,800
Lady'll discourage racing ideas,
I promise thee.

647
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,700
Come in.
Thee must be starved.

648
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,100
We haven't had a good meal
since we left.

649
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,700
I'll be in in a minute.

650
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,000
I'll help thee unhitch, Enoch.

651
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,700
This looks like the place.

652
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Hello, there!

653
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,800
Good evening.
Certainly is good to see you again.

654
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,200
Here we are.

655
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,700
Good evening.

656
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,700
You know, it is certainly
a pleasure to see you.

657
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,600
This is a joy I've been waiting for.

658
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,800
I offer you...

659
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,500
...my salutations, my felicitations
and my congratulations.

660
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,400
What for?

661
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,400
Why, ma'am, this organ.

662
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,500
The world's finest!

663
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,300
You've got a treat coming to you.
Just hold your breath.

664
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,900
Now look at that.
Isn't that a beauty?

665
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,500
Genuine walnut. Not an inch of
unornamented wood in the entire cabinet.

666
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Good evening, Brother Birdwell!
Hello, there.

667
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,700
There must be some mistake.
This gentleman says thee's mixed up...

668
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,300
...with this musical instrument.

669
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,600
"Mixed" is scarcely the word for it.
It's gone beyond courting to marriage.

670
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,400
Your husband...

671
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,900
Thy husband is now the proud
and lucky owner of a Payson and Clarke.

672
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,600
This organ. This substitute on earth
for choiring angels.

673
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,400
Father Birdwell, why keep
the lady in suspense?

674
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,500
You just give me a hand
and we'll get it inside.

675
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,200
We must step delicately.
My wife is a Quaker minister.

676
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,900
You may know all about
Quaker ministers, but I know women.

677
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,200
What a woman wants is a good,
firm hand and a strong voice.

678
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,800
Not Eliza.

679
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Wait until you hear your husband...

680
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,700
...when he seats himself
at this console.

681
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,400
You know, you are married to an artist.

682
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I forbid thee to have this instrument!

683
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,400
"Forbid"?

684
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,100
For thy own sake, I forbid.

685
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,200
When thee asks...

686
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,900
...or suggests...

687
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,000
...I'm like putty in thy hands.

688
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,100
But when thee forbids,
thee is barking up the wrong tree.

689
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,800
- Come on, Quigley.
- I don't know what's come over thee.

690
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,800
Bringing a thing like this here.
And me a recorded minister!

691
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,500
Thee order that instrument back
to where it came from.

692
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,700
I bought it and I'm going to keep it.

693
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,100
I don't know what's come over thee.

694
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,400
I'm warning thee...

695
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,100
...if thee takes that instrument
into the house, I go out.

696
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,200
Make thy choice. Thee can have
that instrument or thy wife.

697
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,600
But both thee cannot have!

698
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,000
Come on, help me get it in.

699
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,700
Will thee please fetch my shawl...

700
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,800
...and my Bible?

701
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,500
What does thee plan to do?

702
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,900
If that...

703
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,800
...thing goes into the house...

704
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,000
...I go to the barn!

705
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,600
The barn?

706
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,800
Did thee have something to say to me?

707
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,300
Well, Jess!

708
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,400
Come on, Quigley!

709
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,100
Will thee see if there
is anything thy mother needs?

710
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,400
Stop it!

711
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,300
Will thee please stop playing?

712
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,700
Go sit over there.

713
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,000
Why?

714
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,200
I don't know why. Just sit.

715
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,000
Evening, Jess.

716
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,800
Come in, Sam.

717
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,100
Just felt like visiting.

718
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
- Evening, children.
- Evening, Mr. Jordan.

719
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,400
I heard you had a new horse.

720
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,200
Like to get a look at it.

721
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,100
It's kind of late.

722
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,500
Is this horse an early sleeper?

723
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,900
Oh well, anytime.

724
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,900
- How're you?
- Fine, thank thee.

725
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,900
Fine.

726
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,100
How's Eliza?

727
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,800
Mama's fine.

728
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,800
How does thee know?

729
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,100
She away from home?

730
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,300
Thee might say so.

731
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,000
Church work?

732
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,600
Thee could call it that.

733
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,600
Mother needs another comforter.

734
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,600
That oat straw goes
right through her blanket.

735
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,900
Hello, Mr. Jordan.

736
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,800
Hello, Josh.

737
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,600
Straw?

738
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,100
Blanket?

739
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,500
Thee may as well know it.

740
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,100
Eliza has taken up
residence in the barn.

741
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,200
The barn?

742
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,700
We had a slight difference of opinion.

743
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,900
Papa bought this
and Mama won't stay in the house...

744
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,200
...with it.

745
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,800
Excuse me.

746
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,900
I feel kind of responsible for this.
Let me take care of it for you.

747
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,000
Thanks very much.
I think I can take care of it myself.

748
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,100
Anything you say.

749
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,700
Good night, children.

750
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,700
Goodnight, Sam.

751
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,900
Goodnight, Jess.

752
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,900
Good night, everybody.

753
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,100
Upstairs to bed, all of thee.

754
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,600
May I come in?

755
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,400
Evening's cooling off a bit,
isn't it?

756
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,000
I find it very pleasant.

757
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,500
So do I.

758
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,100
And thee promises to put the organ
up in the attic right away?

759
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,100
Best place in the world for it.

760
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,700
The best place is back
at the organ factory.

761
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
Second best.

762
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,500
And no playing on First Day.

763
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,200
- Or when visitors are here.
- Never.

764
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,800
Let's go back there sometime.

765
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,100
Soon.

766
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,600
It's Sam Jordon!

767
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,600
Morning, Sam!

768
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,500
What's thee doing around so early?

769
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,400
What do you mean "early"? It's 6:30.

770
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,400
Where's Eliza? Still in the barn?

771
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,600
The barn?

772
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,400
You're getting rid of the organ.

773
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,500
Well, how'd you bring her around?

774
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,500
Reasoned with her.

775
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,000
Just reasoned with her.

776
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,500
Want to see my new mare?

777
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,300
That's what I come over for.

778
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,500
Here she is.

779
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,800
Over here.

780
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,900
What does thee think of her?

781
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,100
"Reasoned" with her?

782
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,400
"Just reasoned with her. "

783
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:05,800
Look her over.

784
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,800
You traded Red Rover for this?

785
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,500
I got a little to boot.

786
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,600
A little? For this crow bait?

787
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,700
The mare's name is Lady.

788
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,500
Lady!

789
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,200
What's so funny?

790
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,800
Excuse me.

791
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It's just the rift between
the name and the looks.

792
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,500
What is she? Half buffalo?

793
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,800
She's half Narragansett Pacer.

794
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,500
Which half?

795
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,900
I never laid eyes on a beast
of such dimensions!

796
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,800
What's this? Why aren't we
taking the surrey?

797
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,600
Enoch says the surrey's
missing a hub nut.

798
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,200
Hub nut?

799
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,500
Lost?

800
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,800
I didn't say "lost", ma'am.
It's just missing.

801
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,600
There's no room for the children.

802
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,600
That's right. They must stay home.

803
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,000
They can have their Meeting
in the parlor.

804
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,600
Thee too.

805
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,700
I suppose thee's right.

806
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,800
No nonsense!

807
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,100
Thank thee.

808
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,700
Wouldn't surprise me a bit.

809
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,500
God speed.

810
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,500
What does he mean, "God speed"?

811
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
He means good luck.

812
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,100
With this rickety rig we'll need it.

813
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,400
Something wrong?

814
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,300
I don't know.
I thought I better take a look.

815
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,400
- What is it?
- Nothing that I could see.

816
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,600
Come on!

817
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,800
Here comes Sam.

818
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:18,300
I wonder how a man church-bound
can have his mind so set on speed.

819
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,800
I don't.

820
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,200
Slow down!

821
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,200
Now, Prince!

822
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,700
Come on, Prince!

823
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,300
Giddap, boy!
What's the matter with you?

824
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,200
Easy, Lady.

825
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,900
Easy.

826
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,800
Come on, Prince!

827
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,500
Can't thee slow her down?

828
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,300
I'm trying to.

829
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,000
Look at this.

830
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,700
Josh, you ain't forgot
that cow's going to calf tonight?

831
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,700
Call me when it's time.

832
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,100
Look at this one.

833
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,700
Hello, Mr. Birdwell.

834
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,500
Gard, come in.

835
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,600
- Back from the war?
- Yes. It's good to see you.

836
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,800
How are you?

837
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,100
Thee wounded?

838
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,000
Good evening, Mrs. Birdwell.

839
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,500
Thee's wounded.

840
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,900
- It's nothing.
- Was it a cannon?

841
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,100
No, Little Jess.
It was just a rebel bullet.

842
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,700
Did it bleed a lot?
Did thee win a medal?

843
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,500
That'll do, Little Jess.
Won't thee sit down?

844
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,000
Thank you.

845
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,100
Thee didn't say a word
about it in thy letter.

846
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,500
Letter?

847
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,800
I didn't want to worry you.

848
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,400
- When did thee get home?
- This afternoon.

849
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,700
I heard about
that little race this morning.

850
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,700
Was Sam surprised?

851
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,000
Surprised? He was overcome.

852
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,700
The Elders!

853
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,600
The Ministry and Oversight Committee
from our church.

854
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,800
Paying us a call.

855
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,100
Go on up to bed.

856
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,900
Do as I say.

857
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,400
Wait.

858
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,100
Good evening, Griffith.

859
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,300
Friend Cope, Amos, come in.

860
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,900
Good evening, Friend Cope.

861
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,500
Griffith.

862
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,500
Good evening, Amos.
Won't thee sit down?

863
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,600
Natives.

864
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,000
Very educational.

865
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,000
So I started over the wall...

866
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,900
...and the next thing I knew,
I was flat on my back.

867
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,200
What does it feel like...

868
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,100
...getting shot?

869
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,300
Being kicked by a mule.

870
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,600
Did thee kill anybody?

871
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,000
I did a lot of shooting.

872
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
Thee won't go back now thee's wounded?

873
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,300
Not right away.

874
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,700
With the reb cavalry heading this way...

875
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,500
...I'm assigned to organize
the home guard.

876
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,800
Would they let me in the home guard?

877
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,100
Well, they need men.

878
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,900
Gard doesn't want to talk about the war.

879
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,800
Does thee, Gard?

880
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,300
No, Mattie.

881
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,000
If I went to Vernon...

882
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,900
We'll talk tomorrow.

883
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,600
All right.

884
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,100
We've got an organ!

885
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,800
An organ?

886
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:09,900
In your house?

887
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,900
What'd your mother say about that?

888
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,300
She made us put it up in the attic.

889
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,500
And what of thy son,
Friend Birdwell?

890
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,800
Has thee give him proper guidance?

891
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,200
With the help of God, our children
must make their own choices.

892
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,100
So before we talk any more
of war or blame...

893
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,600
...shall we seek wisdom
and strength in prayer?

894
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,800
Let us pray.

895
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,500
Watch thy head.

896
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,500
Must be the wind coming up.

897
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:15,300
Could be.
Today's acted like a weather breeder.

898
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,300
Friend, thee's got
a squeaky door upstairs.

899
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,200
My house needs attention.

900
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,500
And my soul needs repair!

901
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,200
Friends, let us lift
our hearts in prayer.

902
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,800
Father in heaven,
Creator of all good things...

903
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
...Author of harmony from birdsong
to thunder roll...

904
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
...restore harmony in our lives.

905
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,500
Amen.

906
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,900
Amen to that.

907
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,300
Behold thy servant who has
strayed from righteousness.

908
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,000
Behold thy unworthy creature
whose head was turned by...

909
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,300
...the ways of the flesh.

910
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:16,400
Forgive him for racing on First Day
and forgetting that the road to glory...

911
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,300
...is a slow road.

912
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,600
- And let not my sins
rest upon my children.

913
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,500
Above all, spare my wife, Eliza.

914
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,200
And I pray that she shall find,
in her kind...

915
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:31,900
...and loving heart, the grace and mercy
to forgive me my grievous shortcomings.

916
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,400
In the name of Adam...

917
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,800
...who ate the forbidden fruit,
of Abraham...

918
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,300
...whose sin was jealousy, in the name
of Moses, who lost the Promised Land...

919
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,100
...in the name of David who...

920
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,300
...of David who...

921
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,100
...hankered after
that which was forbidden...

922
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:49,500
...in the name of Jeptha,
Jeremiah, Obediah...

923
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,100
...Jonah...

924
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,600
...Micah...

925
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,000
...Habakkuk and Malachi...

926
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,400
...and Malachi...

927
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,900
Thee has been an instrument
of the Lord this night.

928
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,800
Thy prayer carried me so near
to heaven's gates...

929
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:30,500
...I thought I heard the choiring
of angel voices...

930
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,600
...and the playing of heavenly harps.

931
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,000
Thy prayer has answered our questions.

932
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,300
Thy flesh may be weak, Jess Birdwell...

933
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,200
...but thy spirit is as strong
as thy voice.

934
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,600
Amen.

935
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,700
Amen to that.

936
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,500
Thank thee for paying us
this call, Friend.

937
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,600
I'll play the melody up here.

938
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,700
- Ready?
- All right.

939
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,700
Sounds like a duet.

940
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,600
Duet?

941
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,300
Gard?

942
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,600
Leave them be.

943
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,100
Mighty quiet up there.

944
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,300
What does thee suppose they're...

945
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,500
...doing?

946
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,400
Silent prayer?

947
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,800
Like this?

948
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:56,600
What's thee doing?

949
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,700
Has thee forgotten we have company?

950
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:04,200
Don't thee care what people think?

951
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,200
It's all my fault.

952
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,100
I think we ought to go to bed
and let the young folks have the parlor.

953
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,500
Good night, children.

954
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,600
Good night, Mrs. Birdwell.

955
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,700
Goodnight, Mattie. Goodnight, Gard.

956
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,000
Thee ever see anything prettier, Enoch?

957
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,400
No.

958
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,000
Except for a little human baby.

959
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,400
Does thee have any children?

960
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,700
Leastwise I did.

961
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,100
I don't know where they are now.

962
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,600
Let's get him up.

963
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,800
It sure wanted to live, didn't it?

964
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,700
He'll live now, all right.

965
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,100
Wonder what it feels like to die.

966
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,900
Just stopping breathing, I reckon.

967
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,100
Just going to sleep.

968
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,400
I reckon.

969
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,800
I got orders to report
to the home guard.

970
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,800
I came to say goodbye.

971
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,500
Could I see Mattie?

972
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,000
She and Little Jess
are down by the swing.

973
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,600
Thank you, ma'am.

974
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,600
Dance?

975
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,300
No, I couldn't.

976
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,600
Oh, well, if you insist.

977
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,300
What?

978
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,300
Thee's doing it again.

979
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,800
Talking to thyself.

980
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,700
I'm not talking to myself.

981
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,800
Is thee talking to Gard Jordon?

982
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,100
He's so brave.

983
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,300
Heck!

984
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,700
If he's so "brave"...

985
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,100
...why didn't he win some medals?

986
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,400
Who cares about medals anyway?

987
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,000
Gard has a proud and learned face.

988
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,100
A face to remember.

989
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,500
His eyes are the color...

990
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:08,700
...of the sky...

991
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,600
...in the summer.

992
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,600
It pleasures me just to see him walk.

993
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,000
He walks just like anybody else.

994
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,000
Hello, little Jess.

995
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,800
How'd you like to have
the bullet they took out of my arm?

996
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,700
It's wrong to take bribes.

997
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,300
It's not a bribe. It's a gift.

998
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,100
Thanks. You want a polliwog?

999
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:46,200
No, thanks.

1000
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,900
Go on, now. Scoot!

1001
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,400
I'm going because I want to.

1002
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
- Come on out. I want to talk to you.
- I can't. I'm barefooted.

1003
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,400
What's wrong with that?

1004
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,600
I'm too big a girl
to run around barefooted.

1005
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,600
It mortifies me,
thee seeing me so unlady-like.

1006
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,400
Look, I'll shut my eyes...

1007
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,600
...and I'll pretend you have shoes on.

1008
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,600
Come on.

1009
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,700
Or I'll wade in!

1010
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:22,500
I've got to talk to you.
Come on out, please.

1011
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,700
I'm really nice, you know.

1012
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:29,100
I've got a nice walk.
And eyes the color of the sky.

1013
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,000
Thee heard?

1014
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,000
Thee heard!

1015
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:38,500
Thee eavesdropped!
Thee thinks I set my cap for thee!

1016
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:40,600
No, wait! Wait! Please wait!

1017
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,300
I was only joking.

1018
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,300
I never want to see thee again!

1019
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,100
Mattie, wait!

1020
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,800
Good evening, Mr. Birdwell.

1021
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,200
Getting ready to leave us again?

1022
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,400
Yes, sir. And I'm reporting
to the home guard tonight.

1023
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,400
I came to say goodbye.

1024
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,700
Come on down.
This is no way to treat a guest.

1025
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,700
Would thee please ask him to excuse me?

1026
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,300
I hurt her feelings.

1027
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,700
It's the last thing I wanted to do.

1028
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,000
I know how that is.

1029
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,000
I was clumsy.

1030
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,800
With women it's hard
not to be sometimes.

1031
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,500
The rebs are coming!

1032
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:05,500
Morgan's Raiders have crossed the Ohio.
1500 horsemen burning and pillaging.

1033
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,200
They're 30 miles from Vernon.
This time tomorrow they'll be here!

1034
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,400
No need to shout.

1035
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,400
- Did thee see their patrols?
- No, but I saw what they've done.

1036
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,100
Barns burned, houses looted.
Go towards Vernon and see for thyself.

1037
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,100
Did you see the militia?

1038
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:24,700
They want every man who can carry a gun.
They figure to make a stand at Vernon.

1039
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:29,100
Papa, our farm is going to be
overrun for sure!

1040
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:33,000
That's probably true.
You're on the south side of the river.

1041
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,700
You better take your family into the
woods tomorrow till the rebs have gone.

1042
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:46,200
This is our home.
This is where we'll stay.

1043
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,200
Mr. Birdwell, the Raiders don't draw
a line between soldiers and civilians.

1044
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,300
They're the toughest Confederate troops,
and there's no telling what they'll do.

1045
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,600
If they're going to come they're
going to come, like fire or flood.

1046
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:01,400
If it's the Lord's will,
there's nothing we can do.

1047
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,500
There's something I can do.

1048
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,400
Have you got an extra gun?

1049
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,200
Why, sure, Enoch.

1050
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,600
I hate to cross you like this.

1051
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,200
Don't seem grateful.

1052
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,800
You folks have been mighty kind to me.

1053
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,700
But you see, sir,
a runaway slave like me...

1054
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:33,200
...I wouldn't stand a chance
with those men.

1055
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,100
So if they're going to catch me...

1056
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:37,400
...I'm going down fighting.

1057
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,300
Thee's free.

1058
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,900
Free to choose.

1059
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,800
So am I.

1060
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,700
Thee can saddle up Tommy.

1061
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,500
Thank you.

1062
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,900
I'll go with thee.

1063
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,500
Without asking us, son?

1064
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,200
There's no need to go now.

1065
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,700
Morning's soon enough.

1066
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,500
I'll be in Vernon.

1067
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,300
I'll meet thee there.

1068
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:14,200
Better talk it over with your folks.

1069
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,400
Tell Mattie goodbye.

1070
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,600
Tell her when I get back, I hope to say
better what I was trying to tell her.

1071
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:29,500
God bless thee.

1072
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:26,000
It's true.

1073
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,400
It's true.
Everything thee heard is true!

1074
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,800
Thy walk does pleasure me.

1075
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,900
Thy eyes are like summer.

1076
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,300
Thee does have a proud, learned face.

1077
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,600
My sweet.

1078
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:43,000
My dear, sweet, precious girl.

1079
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:47,700
I love you.

1080
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,100
I love thee. I do love thee!

1081
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,000
Martha True Birdwell...

1082
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,900
...when I come back...

1083
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,600
...will you marry me?

1084
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:06,500
Will you be my wedded wife
forever and ever?

1085
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,600
Gardiner Jordan...

1086
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,600
...I will be thy wedded wife
forever and ever.

1087
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,900
Sit down.

1088
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,500
Thee'll feel better after thee eats.

1089
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,200
I'm not hungry.

1090
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,400
Might make thee a little calmer.

1091
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:09,300
And a little more courteous
to thy mother.

1092
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,700
Calm?

1093
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:16,100
Thee asks me to be calm when the whole
of Vernon's getting ready to fight.

1094
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,300
And Morgan's men may
break in here at any minute.

1095
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,300
Father, thee knows we must fight.

1096
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,400
If thee has a sword
in thy heart, son...

1097
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,600
...thee must pull it out and use it.

1098
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:38,200
But there's no sword in my heart.
No man is my enemy.

1099
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,600
Any man who kills innocent people
is my enemy.

1100
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,700
My mortal enemy.

1101
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,400
Thee's seen bad things today.
Thee's upset.

1102
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,800
We've got more than we need here.
It's high time we shared it.

1103
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,500
If thee gives all thee's got to
the enemy, thy friends will go hungry.

1104
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,500
What's good about that?

1105
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:13,300
Thee wants to go out and fight,
give thy life for what thee believes.

1106
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,200
Any of us here I'm sure
is ready to do that.

1107
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,400
But that's not what
thee'll be asked to do.

1108
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,100
What thee'll be asked to do now...

1109
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,600
...is to kill.

1110
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,300
I know that.

1111
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:32,500
I'll kill if I have to.

1112
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,700
Thou shalt not kill.

1113
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,200
Mother, I hate fighting.

1114
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,600
I don't want to die.

1115
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:45,100
I don't know if I could
kill anyone if I tried.

1116
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:50,400
But I have to try
so long as other people have to.

1117
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,700
No, Eliza.

1118
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,000
Don't let him go.

1119
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,800
Don't thee care
about his living or dying?

1120
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,700
I'm just his father...

1121
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,800
...not his conscience.

1122
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,100
A man's life ain't worth beans except
he lives up to his own conscience.

1123
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:26,200
I've got to give Josh that chance.

1124
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:03,100
Forever...

1125
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:05,100
...and forever...

1126
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,400
...and forever.

1127
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:37,800
Tucking thee in again. How many times
does thee think I've done that?

1128
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,600
I don't know.

1129
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,400
I understand thy being carried away.

1130
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,900
But our ways are ways of peace.

1131
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,200
And thee loves peaceful ways.

1132
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,700
I do.

1133
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:56,200
If thee turns thy back on everything
I've taught thee and prayed for...

1134
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,200
...thee turns thy back on me.

1135
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,900
No, Mother, not on thee.

1136
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,700
Yes, son.

1137
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,000
On me.

1138
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,300
But I have to do what's right.

1139
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,300
Thee will, son.

1140
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,700
God will give thee the strength.

1141
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,700
Dear God in heaven,
watch over Joshua.

1142
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:25,100
Make him a witness
for the peace on earth...

1143
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:27,600
...for which Thy Son died.

1144
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,700
In His name do I ask it.

1145
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,500
Amen.

1146
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:50,400
Before thee sleeps,
promise me thee'll pray.

1147
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:52,900
I promise.

1148
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,300
Good night, son.

1149
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,700
I have faith in thee.

1150
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,700
Thee promised...

1151
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,400
...to pray.

1152
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,000
I prayed.

1153
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,500
Goodbye, Father.

1154
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,200
Goodbye, son.

1155
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,900
God bless thee.

1156
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,300
My boy!

1157
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,700
God keep thee.

1158
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,400
Company, halt!

1159
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:48,100
This is the only shallow spot.
They have to cross here.

1160
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,900
All right, men. Dismount!

1161
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,400
Come on, then. Hurry!

1162
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:02,200
Spread out!

1163
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,000
Find cover!

1164
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,000
Get those horses out of sight! Fast!

1165
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:49,100
Jam a log between those trees!

1166
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:52,900
Get something solid in front of you.
That won't stop a bullet.

1167
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,200
You hold your gun that tight,
by the time the rebs get here...

1168
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,300
...your trigger finger will be numb.

1169
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,700
Who gave that rebel yell?

1170
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:47,800
I did, sir.

1171
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,100
Do it again and I'll shoot you!

1172
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,900
And the same goes for
any other man here!

1173
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,400
Chopping wood?

1174
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,700
We burn wood every winter, Purdy.

1175
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,900
Pretty soon thee'll have no house
to burn wood in.

1176
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,600
Some of Morgan's thieving men
burnt my barn...

1177
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,100
...stole my horses
and cleaned out my smokehouse.

1178
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:57,300
I'm sorry to hear that.

1179
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,200
Thee is welcome to anything I've got.

1180
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,200
No, thanks. If thee wants to help...

1181
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,300
...pick up a gun and fight...

1182
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,300
...the same as I'm doing.

1183
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:11,000
I'm not ready to do that.

1184
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,600
What does thee aim to do?
Sit here and turn the other cheek?

1185
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:18,200
That's what I aim to do...

1186
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,200
...if I can.

1187
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:24,900
Thee's got to face the fact that wartime
calls for another kind of thinking.

1188
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:28,200
Your thinking may have changed,
but you haven't.

1189
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,300
Last week, you told my son
he'd go to hell for fighting.

1190
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,300
This week you tell Jess to fight.

1191
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:37,100
Whatever's right for Purdy's got
to be right for everybody else?

1192
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,700
If you're so hell-bent to fight,
get going!

1193
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,800
If it's peace thee wants, Jess Birdwell,
thee won't get it chopping wood.

1194
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:00,900
Did they hurt thy place?

1195
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,600
No, Jess.

1196
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:06,600
Just thought I'd ride toward the river,
see how the boys are getting on.

1197
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,300
One more man at the fort
won't make a hoot of difference.

1198
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:15,600
If there's any fighting to be done,
I'll do it for both of us.

1199
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:21,100
I'd like to see someone hold out
for a better way of settling things.

1200
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:30,600
They're coming!

1201
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,900
What was that all about?

1202
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,300
Get down.

1203
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,700
You'll find out sooner than you think.

1204
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:22,500
Fire!

1205
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,600
It's Lady!

1206
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,500
Look, Papa!

1207
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:10,300
Is Josh hurt?

1208
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,700
Bring Lady to the house.

1209
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:09,900
Jess, no!

1210
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:52,400
Little Jess, thee's the man
on the place now.

1211
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:58,400
IKill a Johnny Reb for me.

1212
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,300
Never talk that way
about a man's life.

1213
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:00,700
Mama, look!

1214
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,000
They're rebs, they're rebs!

1215
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:45,800
Gentlemen!

1216
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,500
Gentlemen!

1217
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,500
Would thee like some food?

1218
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,600
There's meat in the
smokehouse by the barn.

1219
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,000
Right. Stevens, get those chickens!

1220
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,700
I'll get all them chickens.

1221
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:01,400
Fresh vegetables and fruit and more meat
are in the spring house there.

1222
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,200
Buster, Clem, go get it.

1223
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,400
You bet, boss.

1224
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:09,900
Cooked food's in the kitchen. If thee
and thy men will please follow me.

1225
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,300
Yes, ma'am!

1226
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,800
Take these horses!

1227
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:55,800
Boys, give me a hand.

1228
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:58,800
Roast goose tonight.

1229
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,400
Go get him, Buster.

1230
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,600
Peach pie!

1231
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,700
It's rattlesnake pie.

1232
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:17,600
Best rattlesnake pie I ever tasted.

1233
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,600
Stop it! Let her go!

1234
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,300
Let her go!

1235
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:36,400
Stop it! Let her go!
Let her go! Stop!

1236
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,400
Samantha's a pet!

1237
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:46,000
She's a pure pet!

1238
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:49,300
I wish I'd knowed that sooner.

1239
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:00,900
Much obliged, ma'am.

1240
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,000
Thank you very kindly, lady.

1241
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:09,800
Feel much better.

1242
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:11,500
Mount up!

1243
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,200
Boys, there's enough food here
to feed us for a whole week!

1244
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:27,300
Thanks for the chickens!

1245
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,400
I raised my hand in anger.

1246
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:41,700
I struck.

1247
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,100
What a whacking!

1248
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:49,000
If thy father ever knew...

1249
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,000
Thee must never tell him.

1250
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:53,500
Never!

1251
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,600
Whoa, Black Prince.

1252
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,800
Sam, what happ...?

1253
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,600
Reb Bushwhacker.

1254
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,000
He took...

1255
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:28,700
...Black Prince.

1256
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,500
I found him.

1257
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,400
Head for war...

1258
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,600
...and get mixed up with horse thieves.

1259
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:42,000
I was training Black Prince...

1260
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:44,800
...to beat you.

1261
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,700
Thee can beat me, Sam.

1262
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:53,200
Thee can beat me any day in the week.

1263
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:57,200
You finally admit it.

1264
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:05,700
Tell him when you see him.

1265
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,700
I'll tell him.

1266
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:20,800
I'll tell him.

1267
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,400
Now, go on.

1268
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:24,600
Go on, git!

1269
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,400
I'll not harm thee.

1270
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:10,600
Thank God I found thee.

1271
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
He's not very old.

1272
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,100
I killed him.

1273
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,500
Thee did what thee had to do.

1274
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:35,000
I must get thee home.

1275
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:35,100
I heard thee playing on the Lord's Day...

1276
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,500
Let me look at thee.

1277
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,600
Stand still.

1278
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:49,000
Let me see if thee
is in order for Meeting.

1279
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:51,700
Stay on the porch and keep clean!

1280
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,700
I don't need any help, thank thee.

1281
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:59,600
But it pleasures me to help thee, son.

1282
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:03,100
Do I pass inspection?

1283
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:07,500
Yes, Jess. Thee'll pass.

1284
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:10,300
My Bible.

1285
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:17,300
Come on, Samantha. Come on, pet.

1286
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:26,500
What's come over that bird?

1287
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:29,800
Little Jess has stopped
being mean to her, that's all.

1288
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,700
That's all, huh?

1289
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:35,600
Samantha's the one that was mean.
Till that reb...

1290
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,000
Thee's not my boss!

1291
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:39,800
Hush up, thee!

1292
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,900
A reb grabbed Saman...

1293
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:45,100
And he was wringing her neck...

1294
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:51,500
Mama whacked him over the head
with a broom until he let...

1295
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:53,500
Until he let her go.

1296
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,600
Mama? Whacked a reb?

1297
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,100
She sure did!

1298
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:01,900
With that broom.

1299
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:12,000
By sugar, that's news!

1300
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:20,800
Looks like thee needs a new broom.

1301
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Why, Jess?

1302
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:24,300
This one's seen lots of service.

1303
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:30,200
I tried to stop him.

1304
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,200
She shook it out of me.

1305
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,600
Come on, veterans.

1306
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,200
Good morning, Enoch.
