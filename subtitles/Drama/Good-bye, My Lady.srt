1
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,637
Dr Halder, Reichsleiter
Bouhler is waiting.

2
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,604
- You don't know what this is about, do you?
- What?

3
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,275
Uh... The letter I received...

4
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:48,034
It was marked "Reich Committee For
The Scientific Registration... "

5
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,700
"Of Severe Hereditary
Ailments. " That's correct.

6
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:54,332
It's just I have no idea what that
could possibly have to do with me.

7
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:57,250
Are you suggesting
there's been a mistake?

8
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,347
Heil Hitler.

9
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:38,804
Doctor Halder.

10
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:44,934
- Have we caught you at a bad time?
- Yes.

11
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:48,153
No, I did have to shuffle
a few tutorials, but...

12
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:53,487
Not every day one is summoned
to the Chancellery of the Führer.

13
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,949
Indeed.

14
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:56,541
Sit.

15
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:09,800
As Chairman of the Party's
Censorship Committee,

16
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:14,100
it's my job to keep a vigilant
eye on modern literature

17
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:18,563
to ensure that it embodies the
proper spirit of National Socialism.

18
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:27,122
I've asked you here to clarify your views on
a matter of personal concern to the Führer.

19
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,167
Your novel.

20
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:40,296
It raises controversial questions
on the theme of the right to life.

21
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,684
Some of your conclusions
are quite revolutionary.

22
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:46,148
Are they?

23
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,937
Well, I take it the views expressed
here are ones that you yourself hold?

24
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,481
It's been some years since I wrote it.

25
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,987
Of course, it's a work of fiction.

26
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:01,536
- Give it back!
- Give it back. Lotte! It's Eric's homework.

27
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:04,753
- But I know the answer, it's easy.
- Give it back to him.

28
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:10,293
You're an angel for cooking again.

29
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:14,725
Hm. Yes, I know I am.

30
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,392
Are you sure you don't mind?

31
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,064
No

32
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,525
- When I get going I can't seem to stop.
- Shh!

33
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:27,279
No, it's fine.

34
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,784
- Stop it!
- John!

35
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,989
God! Lotte, come here.

36
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:33,501
John!

37
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,247
Keep stirring this slowly, all right?

38
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,794
That's my girl.

39
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,929
- Johnnie!
- Coming, Mother!

40
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:50,101
There's someone at the door!

41
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:53,652
Theodore.

42
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:57,814
- Didn't you hear me knocking?
- Yes.

43
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,199
A mathematician! Just
the fellow we need.

44
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,038
Helen, your father's here.

45
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,625
- Oh.
- It's you I wanted to see.

46
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,076
- Hello, Father.
- Now, John... John!

47
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,623
Eric?

48
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:10,333
Help has arrived.

49
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:14,798
Now, John, I have told you this before.

50
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,098
- You have to shake yourself
out of this apathy. - Right.

51
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:20,552
I have just come from the Rector...

52
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:22,148
What are you making?

53
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:26,320
- Er... Some kind of vegetable...
- Goulash!

54
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:28,686
Yes.

55
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:33,403
There are changes coming at the
university sooner than you think.

56
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:36,540
Promotion will automatically
go to party members.

57
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,372
If you're not careful,
you'll be out of a job.

58
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:42,292
John!

59
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,465
Yes, Mother!

60
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,172
Mind the onions.

61
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,760
Coming!

62
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,972
- I'm here.
- Where were you?

63
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:56,724
- No, don't let them take me, Johnnie!
- It's Theodore.

64
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:59,066
You remember
- Helen's father.

65
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:02,400
I was sorry to hear you'd
been back at the sanatorium.

66
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,575
Helen, can you please come up?

67
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,831
- You need to go again?
- I couldn't hold it.

68
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,205
Oh, Mother.

69
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:11,961
"Dans une langue que nous savons,

70
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:17,214
"nous avons substitué à I'opacité
des sons la transparence des idées. "

71
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:23,056
Transparency of ideas,
relativity of perception.

72
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,104
Music and faith.

73
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:28,723
Memory and guilt.

74
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:33,024
The most potent memories are
those we recapture involuntarily.

75
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,948
A chance sound...

76
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:41,292
the tap of a spoon against a plate
as he waits there in the library...

77
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:46,328
and suddenly happiness
floods through him.

78
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:50,679
He is transported back in time to a train
stopped in the middle of the countryside.

79
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:54,970
He is watching the sun light up a
little row of trees in the distance.

80
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,428
Outside, a railway man

81
00:06:57,481 --> 00:07:01,943
is tapping a wheel with his hammer, and
it is an echo of this precise sound...

82
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,343
Lovely.

83
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:23,670
Better leave it there for today.

84
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:26,096
Go on, have a look.

85
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:27,768
Off you go.

86
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:35,605
Ah, Professor Mandelstam, we really should
do something about this, shouldn't we?

87
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,063
Go to the Rector?

88
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:42,448
Please, John, I don't
think that's a good idea.

89
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:44,242
For either of us.

90
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:47,709
In fact, I'm afraid I must go further.

91
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,499
As Head of Department

92
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:54,841
it is up to me to ensure that the works
of the proscribed authors are removed.

93
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,976
Not only from the library...
but also from your curriculum.

94
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,402
- Which authors did you have in mind?
- Proust for a start.

95
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:13,035
- Because he's French?
- John, please, don't be obtuse.

96
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,156
What if I refuse to comply?

97
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:22,123
Then I would have no
option but to dismiss you.

98
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,461
Shit!

99
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,430
Yes?

100
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,936
Isaw your light was on. I was just coming
out of the library. I need your advice.

101
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,935
I'm Anne, by the way. Anne
Hartman. I come to your lectures.

102
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:13,990
Yes, I've noticed you...
but you're not on my course.

103
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,907
Probably wondering who I was.

104
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:17,281
Or maybe you weren't.

105
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:21,163
History... that's what I'm supposed
to be doing but I don't know why.

106
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,417
I just can't see what it
has to do with anything.

107
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:27,710
Sitting all day in some stuffy lecture
theatre listening to some boring old...

108
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,007
That's not what I mean. Your lectures
- that's why I'm here.

109
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,264
You make them all come alive.

110
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:39,062
I heard what you said
to Professor Mandelstam.

111
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:41,730
I wish more people would stand
up for what they believe in.

112
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:45,195
- And what do you believe in, Miss Hartman?
- That's just it.

113
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,527
I know what I like, I know what's
good, I feel it passionately.

114
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:52,079
But when it comes to ideas,
they just don't seem real.

115
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:56,582
Maybe that's why you're
here. At university, I mean.

116
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,546
- To try and connect that passion.
- Did it work for you?

117
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:02,504
I hope so.

118
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:05,721
Yes, I think so.

119
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,768
This is what I believe in.

120
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:11,815
Books?

121
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,985
Does make me sound
rather fusty, doesn't it?

122
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,868
Perhaps you're right. What do a load
of old books have to do with life?

123
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:28,868
Who knows? It might be liberating
just to chuck them all out.

124
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,915
Make a fresh start.

125
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,423
And here I am writing another one.

126
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,174
Adding to the pile.

127
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:42,977
- What's it about? Your novel.
- Oh.

128
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:50,609
- A man who kills his wife.
- Oh!

129
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,495
Because he loves her,
you understand? Erm...

130
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:57,458
- She's incurably ill.
- How awful.

131
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:02,716
Yes, I know, really. Whoever is going
to want to read something so depressing?

132
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,048
How awful about the poor woman, I mean.

133
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:10,720
Of course people will want to read it,
it sounds so romantic. To kill for love...

134
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:22,282
<i># I crop by the
Neckar I crop by the Rhine</i>

135
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:25,031
<i># Now I have a sweetheart</i>

136
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,951
<i># And now I have none</i>

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,957
<i>- # What use is cropping if none is mine
- I love this song.</i>

138
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,297
The problem is I'm imagining it.

139
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,713
Really?

140
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,889
It's not funny, Maurice.

141
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,094
How long has this been going on?

142
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,058
Don't know.

143
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:52,690
- A few months.
- Three months, six months?

144
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,365
I don't know.

145
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:57,159
Could it be the end of January, say?

146
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:59,328
Thereabouts, I suppose.

147
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:02,210
Why? Do you think there
is some connection to...

148
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:05,705
Well, we put the country
in the hands of a lunatic...

149
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:11,762
Taking refuge in fantasy might be a
rational response to an irrational world.

150
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:14,298
- Why singing?
- I don't know.

151
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,603
No idea?

152
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,106
Why not?

153
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,903
To be honest, John,
I'm all out of ideas.

154
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:27,947
I've been cooped up in this little room all
day listening to the twisted sexual fantasies

155
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:31,862
of a bunch of the most unattractive
housefraus you could ever wish to meet.

156
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:39,922
Desperate for a cold beer and a nice shallow
conversation I don't have to read anything into.

157
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,840
The point is, Maurice, I'm her
teacher. It's a position of trust,

158
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:48,051
- like yours with your patients.
- Ah.

159
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,393
Or should I say, most
doctors with their patients.

160
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,522
That's not the point. The
point is, have you fucked her?

161
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:59,399
The question isn't whether or not I've slept
with Anne... which, for the record, I haven't.

162
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,362
- For Christ's sake.
- The question is why,

163
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,533
when the idea even crossed my mind,
Istarted hearing bloody Mahler.

164
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,918
- That's interesting you should choose
a Jew. - What gave you that idea?

165
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:11,665
She's as Aryan as they come. Not that
I don't find Jewish women attractive...

166
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:14,044
Mahler was Jewish.

167
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,801
- He converted.
- Still makes him Jewish.

168
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,184
- The thing is... - Please, do me
a favour, change the subject.

169
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:22,221
Don't drag me into your neurosis.

170
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:25,275
I get it. You're terribly
troubled, you hear music.

171
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:29,317
Some of us out here in the real world
have plenty to worry about ourselves.

172
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:33,447
You never seem to worry
about anything... much.

173
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,825
Don't I?

174
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,710
I mean, as a study in pathological
narcissism, the man's quite fascinating.

175
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:47,049
Trouble is, instead of strapping him to the
nearest couch and frying his fucking brains out,

176
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,256
everyone is taking him so literally.

177
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,303
Give it time, Maurice.

178
00:13:53,313 --> 00:13:55,141
Hitler's a joke.

179
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,529
He'll never last.

180
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:07,915
Would it surprise you to learn that the
Führer himself had examined your book?

181
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:12,835
- The Führer?
- Mm-hm.

182
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,542
I'd like you to read this.

183
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:23,549
One of our tasks here at the Chancellery

184
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:28,516
is to process the huge volume of letters
addressed to our leader by ordinary citizens.

185
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,561
They give, as you can see,

186
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:35,525
an unrivalled insight into the spirit
of renewal alive in our country today.

187
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:43,202
- It's very... affecting.
- Isn't it?

188
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:48,923
The Führer has received several
such letters from the relatives of...

189
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,754
unfortunates with incurable handicaps,

190
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,392
requesting his special permission
to ease their suffering.

191
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,558
- Hm.
- Which is where you come in.

192
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,521
- Me?
- We need a paper from you, Halder,

193
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:10,533
arguing, along the same
lines as you do in your novel,

194
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,374
the case for an enlightened approach to
mercy death on the grounds of humanity.

195
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:19,380
That's why you asked me here?

196
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,338
Why else?

197
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:27,933
I'm hardly an expert.

198
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:35,194
My mother has been
chronically ill. Tuberculosis.

199
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:39,402
Yes. Well, the Führer himself
said it was written from the heart.

200
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:42,868
- Dr Goebbels was also very impressed.
- Huh.

201
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:46,616
In fact, he thought it might make an excellent
basis for a motion picture on this theme.

202
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,375
Ah.

203
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:53,469
As for myself, I was very impressed
by the humanity of your writing.

204
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,264
Thank you.

205
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:02,978
So, that's really all
you want from me, a paper?

206
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,445
You will, of course, be
very well paid for your work.

207
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,441
But more than that, your
participation would be, for me,

208
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,359
a guarantee that the question
of humanity remains...

209
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,994
central to our whole approach.

210
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,288
Uh-huh. Yes.

211
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:23,670
I could perhaps draft
something out by next week.

212
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:25,841
Excellent. Er, just one more thing.

213
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:30,888
Before inviting you here we did, of
course, examine your record very thoroughly.

214
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:36,144
Er, front-line service in 1918,
your work at the university...

215
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,731
Everything... more or less in order.

216
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,863
Except for one oversight.

217
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,242
You never joined the Party.

218
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:51,621
I did discuss it, on several occasions,
with my father-in -law, Dr Brunau.

219
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:55,621
He's a prominent member
i- i-in our district.

220
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:57,219
But at the time...

221
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:01,592
You see... I've already
mentioned my mother's illness...

222
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:05,640
And my life was a little...

223
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,473
complicated.

224
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,124
I feel such an idiot. Ineeded to
talk to you, but you'd already left,

225
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,584
so I thought, "Why not come
here? You wouldn't mind. "

226
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:33,255
- The tram took forever and I started
thinking... - Give us your wet things.

227
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:35,882
<i>..."I can't just turn up
uninvited at this hour. "</i>

228
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,226
You probably didn't even
know I had your address.

229
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:42,651
So, I started walking up and down the road
trying to decide what to do and then...

230
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,021
Well, now that you're here...

231
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:47,694
Do sit down.

232
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,822
Oh.

233
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,619
Sorry.

234
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,211
There you are.

235
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,291
I'm sorry it's such a disaster.

236
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,469
Er...

237
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:08,261
We'd get a maid... if
we could afford one.

238
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,264
I'll just dry these here.

239
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:16,488
Maybe if that book of
mine ever gets published.

240
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,274
Want something to warm you up?

241
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:22,371
We should have a bottle of
sherry around here... somewhere.

242
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:27,283
Unless my father-in-law's
polished it off.

243
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:33,712
- I'm afraid we only have brandy.
- Yes, please.

244
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,227
My wife's gone to bed.

245
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,030
That's not to say it's late.

246
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:54,446
She-she... She likes
to go to bed early.

247
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:56,406
Catch up on her reading.

248
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,200
- Too much?
- Uh-uh.

249
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:00,747
Right.

250
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,630
Mm. Ah!

251
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:16,358
I've been thinking about what you said
about finding something to believe in.

252
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,689
And have you... found something?

253
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,079
- Yes, I think I have.
- Mm.

254
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,744
It hasn't solved my problem.

255
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,967
- Problem? With history?
- People. That's what I've realised.

256
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:42,350
People are what matter. They're so
much more fascinating than ideas.

257
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:49,643
Well... y-y-you could think of changing
course to something more vocational.

258
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,485
I want to be with you.

259
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,692
Hm.

260
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:03,331
Um, I wish all my students
were so... appreciative.

261
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,438
You couldn't get it up? Fuck!

262
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:26,485
- Shh! Maurice!
- What? Not at all? Not even a twitch?

263
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,072
Not... entirely.

264
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,998
Maurice! Maurice!

265
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,671
- Look, look, you'd had a lot
to drink, right? - Yes.

266
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,792
You're under a lot of pressure.

267
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,757
- I was a bit... overwhelmed.
- Well, there you go.

268
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,096
It's been a long time since
I'd done anything so...

269
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:53,436
impulsive.

270
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:03,534
- And there was Helen...
- Ah, yes, the lovely Helen. How is she?

271
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:12,713
I couldn't sleep. I
wanted to play something.

272
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,384
- Well, I was just on my way up.
- All right.

273
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:27,020
- It's... It's another one of my students.
- Ah.

274
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,776
She... Soaking wet, poor thing.

275
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:35,946
Can't very well go home on a night
like this. I've made up a bed.

276
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,035
Oh, will he be warm enough?

277
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:44,835
<i>"She. " I gave her a blanket, so...</i>

278
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:49,013
Erm... Who'll make breakfast?

279
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,975
I'll make her breakfast!

280
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,025
Are you all right?

281
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:06,782
- I've... I've had some brandy.
- Mm. Come here.

282
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,499
What is it, John?

283
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,716
Your father...

284
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:26,388
told me I'd never get anywhere
unless I joined the Party.

285
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:33,277
Normally, my father saying something
would make you do exactly the opposite.

286
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:38,785
What if he's right?

287
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:43,200
I hate to see you
agonise like this, John.

288
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,129
Have a little faith in yourself.

289
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,966
You'll do the right thing.

290
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:57,603
You always do.

291
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,152
Do I?

292
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,480
Look...

293
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:12,489
I can't deny it, I do find
myself attracted to you.

294
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:19,463
But in my circumstances as a
lecturer and a married man...

295
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:22,178
I simply can't.

296
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,387
What was that?

297
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:29,301
- Must be the start of the parade.
- Parade? What parade?

298
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,680
Isn't that why we're here?

299
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:34,403
No, this was the most
discreet spot I could think of.

300
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:37,197
They have to go and have another
one of their bloody rallies.

301
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:42,911
- Let's go and watch. - No, I really
can't stand that sort of thing.

302
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:47,868
- I'd rather slip away before we
get caught up... - Oh, come on!

303
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,463
What if someone sees us?

304
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:52,377
We'll say we bumped into
each other in the crowd.

305
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:56,471
- Why would we even be here? - To see
what all the fuss is about, of course.

306
00:23:56,514 --> 00:24:02,555
Oh, everyone looks so happy. Anything that
makes people happy can't be bad, can it?

307
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:08,028
Well, I do find some of it rather offensive.
The ideas behind it... or lack of them.

308
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,195
But feel this energy!

309
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,074
All it needs is a few good people to
help channel it in the right direction.

310
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,078
- Do you really believe that?
- Yes.

311
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,575
Burning all those books
- of course it's shocking, but then,

312
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:25,335
you said so yourself, wouldn't it be liberating to
just chuck them all out and make a fresh start?

313
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,960
Come on!

314
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:32,143
There's a considerable difference between
talking about something and actually doing it.

315
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:35,603
Exactly, men like you shouldn't be
shut up in their studies reading books.

316
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:40,989
They should be out there, helping to
build a better country for our children.

317
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:44,401
Come on, please. Please?

318
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:46,112
All right, just for a bit.

319
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:50,699
I did give serious thought
to joining the Party,

320
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:57,255
but somehow I just couldn't quite see
myself marching around and waving banners.

321
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,934
<i>What I mean is...</i>

322
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,641
I...

323
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:10,098
Perhaps you're right.

324
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:13,604
A man of your talents would
be wasted in the rank and file.

325
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:16,906
Sturmbannführer Dorbisch?

326
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:21,415
Bouhler here. There's
someone I'd like you to meet.

327
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:25,335
It's not every day we get a call
from the Chancellery of the Führer.

328
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,249
I don't work there, you understand?
I'm really just an academic.

329
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:33,633
Just an academic? Don't be ridiculous.
You served with the 24th Brandenburg!

330
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:38,845
Inever saw much action, I'm afraid.
I was only called up in 1918.

331
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,520
Ah, just in time for the last big push.

332
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,277
Great times.

333
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:47,735
- I hope you're hungry?
- No... Yes, yes.

334
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:51,617
Well, the Kaiser, as you know, had
his elite regiment, the Imperial Guard.

335
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:54,238
Well, now we have the Schutzsfaffel.

336
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:56,915
Hm. The Führer's bodyguard?

337
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:59,633
It's rather more than that.

338
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:03,721
I'm not suggesting you have to ride
around on a running board with a revolver.

339
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:06,090
No. No.

340
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:11,019
We're interested in recruiting
the better type of person.

341
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:15,230
The specialists in their
field, such as yourself.

342
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,609
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call myself a specialist.

343
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:23,575
See, that's what I like about you, Halder
- no showing off, no bragging,

344
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,078
just a quiet determination.

345
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,203
That's exactly the
type we're looking for.

346
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:33,842
I... I am flattered by your high
opinion of me, but my worry is that...

347
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:38,298
with my work at the university, I
might not be able to contribute...

348
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,978
The last thing we want is for you to
be distracted from your valuable work,

349
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:45,349
shaping the minds of
our next generation.

350
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:48,818
No, your position would
be an honorary one.

351
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:53,615
The greatest minds in the
land with us in spirit.

352
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:01,581
Helen, something rather
extraordinary has happened.

353
00:27:02,716 --> 00:27:06,050
It's all because of the
book, would you believe?

354
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:11,006
They really seem to love
it, for some unknown reason.

355
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:17,478
Helen... I'm trying
to tell you something.

356
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:20,484
Sorry? What did you say?

357
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:22,608
John!

358
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:25,575
Is that you, John?

359
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:28,492
Yes!

360
00:27:58,162 --> 00:27:59,787
Come back to bed.

361
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:39,507
Maurice?

362
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:46,221
There you are. I was beginning to think
she was playing a practical joke on me.

363
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:49,138
- Who?
- Helen. Sending me here.

364
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:54,525
- What's this all about?
- I needed somewhere I could work in peace.

365
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,357
- Who is it?
- Shh!

366
00:28:57,406 --> 00:29:01,322
Sorry, I'm a bit distracted.

367
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:06,329
Right, come on! You've got time
for a quick drink. I've had a...

368
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:09,580
- I've had a lot of cancellations. Come on.
- I'm afraid I really can't.

369
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,751
- Just one. There's always time for one.
- I can't, Maurice.

370
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,878
- You're not coming down?
- No.

371
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:19,261
- All right, let me in for a minute.
- No! I mean...

372
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,146
I'm... I'm working.

373
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,564
Jesus!

374
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,778
- You all right?
- Why shouldn't I be?

375
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:36,409
Well, you're here and Helen's... more
than usually abstract, shall we say?

376
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,084
My couch is free.

377
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:43,377
You know I can't afford you.

378
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,924
But you can afford the
rent on a bachelor flat?

379
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:50,221
Well, that depends if I ever get
to finish this paper I'm writing.

380
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:53,762
All right.

381
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:55,770
I know where I'm not wanted.

382
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:58,902
Maurice...

383
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:05,066
We'll get together when things have
calmed down a little. I promise.

384
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,615
Don't do me any favours.

385
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,834
I'd like you to meet Anne.

386
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,461
Delighted, Frau Professor, delighted.

387
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:19,253
- Oh no, we're not... Anne and I...
- What a wonderful place for a party.

388
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,297
- Freddie.
- Cheers.

389
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:25,561
John here is working on a secret assignment
for the Chancellery of the Führer.

390
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:30,019
It's a... brief paper that...
that had to be drafted.

391
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:32,026
I teach at the university.

392
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:34,148
Then you must know Theodore.

393
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:36,357
Of course.

394
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:43,244
Once it would have given me great satisfaction
to see you at a gathering such as this.

395
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:50,462
But accepting your duties as a National Socialist
is no excuse for shirking them as a husband!

396
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:55,389
I worry for the movement when it
embraces men of such moral weakness.

397
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:59,219
Ishould explain. Doctor
Brunau is my father-in -law.

398
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:02,725
- My wife and I are separated. - To think
you abandoned Helen for this whore.

399
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:07,488
There's no need to bring Anne
into it. The fault is mine.

400
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,984
If you'll excuse us. Anne?

401
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,878
Why should we leave? You're
not the one who's drunk.

402
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:21,090
- Bastard!
- Where do you think you're going?

403
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:24,670
Elisabeth, darling, would you mind
taking care of Anne for a few moments?

404
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,467
Ineed to have a quiet word with John.

405
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:29,055
- You don't have any children, do you?
- Not yet.

406
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:30,848
No, you're much too young.

407
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:32,974
If I have to listen to
one more proud mother

408
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:36,395
gushing about the orienteering
prize the little horse won at camp...

409
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:39,947
- I'm sorry... - I don't know
about you, I could do with a drink.

410
00:31:39,993 --> 00:31:45,285
No need to apologise. If you're in with
us, John, the old rules no longer apply.

411
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,621
Himmler...

412
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:53,923
He might look like a bank manager, but
you've got to give the man one thing -

413
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:56,757
very advanced views on sex.

414
00:31:56,806 --> 00:32:00,472
He wants us to go out, he wants us to
knock up girls left, right and centre

415
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,269
so that they can... donate
a child to the Führer.

416
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,603
- Well, it's our patriotic duty,
for God's sake. -

417
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:14,327
So long as it's the right sort of girl, that is.
Not that you've got any problems on that score.

418
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,573
She looks like a bloody Rhinemaiden.

419
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:20,709
She does, doesn't she?

420
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:25,634
Really, mother!

421
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:30,886
- I'm unpacking. No... - It's not time
to unpack. We haven't left yet.

422
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,141
But I've only just arrived.

423
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:37,649
No, Mother. You woke up
here this morning, remember?

424
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:42,190
You've been here a long time
and now you're going home.

425
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,699
The house is on fire.

426
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:45,949
The house isn't...

427
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,117
Oh, my God!

428
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,870
Carry on.

429
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:58,175
- What are you doing?
- I was going to fry the onions.

430
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,305
Do you have to do it this minute?

431
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,718
I want to do it while you're
here so you can put me right!

432
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:11,057
There was a time when I wouldn't have felt it so
much, you saying that you loved somebody else!

433
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:14,730
But a few weeks ago Istarted falling
in love with you all over again.

434
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:19,576
- It was as if you'd-you'd suddenly
come alive! - Yes, that's how it felt.

435
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,332
Ispoke to Father.

436
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:28,425
- Did he make an awful scene?
- I had it coming.

437
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,718
Oh! I can't bear the idea
of him thinking badly of you.

438
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,341
He has every reason to.

439
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,594
But he doesn't know what I'm like,
what you've had to put up with!

440
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:38,886
Helen! Don't...

441
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:41,063
Please, don't be nice to me.

442
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,398
I'm not being nice to you.

443
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,744
Mother, what happened?

444
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,868
I was trying to come downstairs.

445
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,165
Ow!

446
00:33:57,213 --> 00:34:00,583
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

447
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:04,627
- What have you
done? - Oh-oh!

448
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:16,147
- Couldn't you have waited for me?
- I can't wait around all day.

449
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:18,604
The piano is driving me mad!

450
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,864
- Wait, Mother, wait!
- Come on, come on.

451
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:27,203
Come on. Come on.

452
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,957
- Are you sure you are all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

453
00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:32,212
You scared me.

454
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:34,631
- We're on our way.
- At last!

455
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,340
You're really leaving?

456
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:40,058
Helen, please...

457
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:42,890
Chat, chat, chat. Don't
know what you've got to talk about.

458
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:45,098
- You told me you were finished with her.
- Stop it.

459
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,775
Look, if I asked you one more time,
please stay, would it make any difference?

460
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:55,238
I'll come back tomorrow. We'll
talk about it then, I promise.

461
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:57,577
If we don't get Mother to
the car now, we never will.

462
00:34:57,624 --> 00:35:01,410
- He won't come back.
- Please, stay out of it!

463
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:03,337
If you'd have been a proper wife to him

464
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:05,458
- this wouldn't have happened.
- How dare you?

465
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,180
She's a wonderful wife in
ways you'll never understand!

466
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:10,298
So, why are you leaving?

467
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,719
Ineed to go to the toilet.

468
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:15,728
Bloody hell!

469
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:20,563
Good idea, Mother.

470
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,115
Before we get going.

471
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:29,696
What is this place?

472
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,873
You said you were thirsty.

473
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:35,123
A glass of water to take my pills.

474
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:37,297
I'm sure they serve water.

475
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,053
There we are.

476
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:55,657
Erm... A glass of beer for me.

477
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:58,908
And for you, Mother?

478
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,200
Mother?

479
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,996
Water.

480
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:09,583
Now that we've sat down, at least
have a cup of coffee, a little cake?

481
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,716
Remember what the doctor said
- you've got to build yourself up.

482
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,563
Beer and water, please.

483
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:23,984
That's all. Thank you.

484
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:31,697
Lovely here, isn't it?

485
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:37,961
Give me all of them.

486
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:40,543
Put me out of my misery.

487
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:45,303
- Don't talk like that. - Why not?
There's nothing left for me but pain.

488
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:53,138
The doctors say your lungs are
clear. That's why we're going home.

489
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:55,315
You just want us out of the way.

490
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:58,777
- Me and the children.
- They're at camp.

491
00:36:58,824 --> 00:37:02,774
Anne and I will have them for
the weekends. It's all arranged.

492
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:08,040
Oh, of course, you don't
want me in your love nest.

493
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:14,378
I've told you a hundred times, Mother. Come
and live with us, if that's what you want.

494
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:18,379
You expect me to live under
the same roof as your whore?

495
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:23,682
No, not if you don't want to.

496
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,149
We can find you an apartment nearby.

497
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:36,282
I've got my own house,
thank you very much.

498
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:50,598
I always thought this
would make a nice bedroom.

499
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,140
You won't have to worry about stairs.

500
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,897
Thank you.

501
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:04,740
Thank you for all you've done.

502
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,620
Don't say that.

503
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:11,206
Perhaps I don't say it enough.

504
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:20,010
I can come as often as you like.
I've spoken to Frau Troller,

505
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:23,970
- she'll be in every day to make you
lunch... - Always a good boy, Johnnie.

506
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,892
Such a good boy.

507
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:10,318
- What are you talking about? - Just
reliving our glory days, dodging bullets.

508
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:14,618
- When were you dodging bullets?
- In the war. We were in the army together.

509
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:18,796
- When?
- About 20 years ago now.

510
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:21,756
You'd have been what, three, four?

511
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:25,008
- I didn't know you'd been a soldier, John.
- Johnnie!

512
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:27,629
- Just for a while.
- You should have seen him in a uniform.

513
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:29,143
- Very, very sexy.
- Stop it.

514
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,678
- Very popular with the ladies.
- Maurice...

515
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:35,267
- I'm going to go and get changed.
- We can hold towels up, if you like?

516
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:43,699
Hm!

517
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,538
So how is domestic
bliss with the student?

518
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:54,800
- Anne. Can we call her Anne, please?
- Anne.

519
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:57,550
And she's not my student any more.

520
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:03,852
Very upright of you, Dr Halder, to wait
until she graduated before doing the dirty.

521
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:06,271
Don't think I would have
restrained myself so long.

522
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:09,355
- Oh, you approve?
- Very nice.

523
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:12,491
She obviously has a terrible
"father figure" complex.

524
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:15,370
- Are we jealous?
- Absolutely.

525
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,580
- Think she needs a good psychoanalyst?
- No.

526
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,296
You're not getting anywhere near her.

527
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,049
- Don't take this the wrong way but, erm...
- Hm?

528
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:28,170
I didn't think you had it in you.

529
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:31,718
Neither did I.

530
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:34,436
So what happened?

531
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:37,434
What made you... seize the day?

532
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,645
I don't know. I just...

533
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:44,404
have a spring in my step lately.

534
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:48,829
Isuppose the promotion didn't do any
harm. I mean, I'm just happy, you know?

535
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:50,747
What promotion?

536
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,498
Didn't I? Oh.

537
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:58,878
- Oh, it's nothing really...
- No, no, no. Come on, come on.

538
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,803
You can tell Uncle Maurice.

539
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:08,013
They've made me head of department.

540
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:11,067
- That is fantastic. Congratulations.
- Yeah.

541
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:15,488
I thought you said there was no way
they would promote you unless you...

542
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:19,245
Oh, fuck.

543
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:24,036
- Not you too, Johnnie?
- Well, it's just...

544
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,512
Tell me it was pure self-interest.
That I can understand.

545
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:34,631
Please, don't tell me
you agree with them.

546
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,135
It doesn't matter if I agree with them.

547
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:42,103
The fact is they're in power.
At least I'm doing something.

548
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,821
If we want to change anything,
steer them in the right direction,

549
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:46,737
we can't stay sitting on the sidelines.

550
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:49,273
We? Who the fuck is "we"?

551
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:53,575
I don't think I'll be steering anyone in the right
direction because I don't get a vote any more.

552
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:56,661
In case you haven't noticed, I'm
not a citiz... Actually, legally...

553
00:41:56,711 --> 00:42:01,006
I'm not a full fucking human being.
So I'm stuck on the sidelines!

554
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:06,214
What are you gonna do? Give 'em a
list of edifying fucking books to read?

555
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:07,511
Look...

556
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:14,854
if you're really so pessimistic, why don't you go
abroad for a year or two until things settle down?

557
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:19,067
There are many countries where you
could practise. You've no ties here.

558
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:22,452
No ties?

559
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:24,906
I was born here.

560
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:29,042
I fought for this fucking
country! I am as German as you.

561
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:30,546
How dare you?

562
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:34,793
Why should I leave? That's
exactly what those bastards want.

563
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,680
Sorry... you bastards.

564
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:47,056
Maurice!

565
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:51,855
Here's something to
help you sleep, my love.

566
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:02,250
It tastes so bitter, my darling.

567
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,507
Take my hand.

568
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:08,715
I love you.

569
00:43:10,098 --> 00:43:11,926
I love you.

570
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:13,848
Cut!

571
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:20,650
- Right, gentlemen, that's...
- Bravo!

572
00:43:28,414 --> 00:43:34,085
Without your vision, none of us would
be standing here, Professor Halder.

573
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:37,334
Or, do you prefer "Hauptsturmführer"?

574
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:44,849
- "Professor" is fine, Reichsminister.
- So much of what we make here is fluff.

575
00:43:44,894 --> 00:43:49,058
Pretty daydreams for the masses.
I should know - I vet every script.

576
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,979
But Halder here really
has a message for us.

577
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:59,239
You're very kind. Allow me
to present my wife, Anne.

578
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:04,039
Truly the picture of Aryan motherhood.

579
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:06,043
- My compliments.
- Thank you.

580
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:08,959
We must find another outlet
for your talents, Halder.

581
00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:16,973
<i># The two bluest eyes</i>

582
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:20,970
<i>- # Of my dear love
- What?</i>

583
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:28,818
<i>- # They now have sent me away
into the world -</i>

584
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:32,236
Darling?

585
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:38,462
- That was beautiful.
- What are you talking about?

586
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,546
Come on.

587
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:44,634
- Didn't you?
- No.

588
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,961
The song...

589
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:55,561
I always knew you were brilliant, but to hear
such praise from the Reichsminister himself...

590
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:59,859
- I can't believe I shook his hand.
- I'm so proud of you.

591
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:06,667
- Please take my wife home.
- Where are you going?

592
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,951
I promised I'd drop in
on Helen and the children.

593
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:11,412
- Now?
- Just for a moment.

594
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:14,835
- Eric's having trouble at school.
- John, you're not going to see...

595
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,713
No, no.

596
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:20,130
- Look, I've got to go.
- Please!

597
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:21,931
Anne...

598
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:00,358
Good, you got my note.

599
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,082
- You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble. - It's no trouble.

600
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:14,330
Sit down. An old favourite.

601
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:16,793
Ah!

602
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:22,087
Amy's night off, is it?

603
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:27,808
- Amy's long gone, I'm afraid.
- Oh.

604
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:36,192
- If it's money you need...
- It wasn't that.

605
00:46:38,202 --> 00:46:40,326
Please, tuck in.

606
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:58,477
- So what was it then, with Amy?
- I can't employ Aryans under 45.

607
00:46:59,438 --> 00:47:00,850
Of course, yes.

608
00:47:03,443 --> 00:47:06,648
Don't worry, I didn't get
you here to harangue you.

609
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,358
There's no point.

610
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:15,119
Some of the petty stuff is
almost funny, it's so ridiculous.

611
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,243
They just took my typewriter.

612
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:22,461
I don't know how they expect me to manage.
You know what my handwriting is like.

613
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:26,425
Totally illegible. Even for a doctor.

614
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:29,809
It's been a long time.

615
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:32,764
I didn't think you'd come.

616
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,439
If I'd known you were making
dinner, I might have reconsidered.

617
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,279
Sorry, it's fucking awful, isn't it?

618
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,361
- No, no, no. I'm joking.
- No, no, no. Don't.

619
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:43,989
Let me get rid of it.

620
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:46,997
I don't know what I'm doing.

621
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:51,661
But...

622
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:54,467
I have something you
won't be able to resist.

623
00:47:55,053 --> 00:47:56,595
Are you ready?

624
00:47:58,557 --> 00:48:02,888
- Epstein's? - Is there any
other cheesecake in the world?

625
00:48:04,357 --> 00:48:06,812
Pass your plate.

626
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:15,693
Little bit of plum
brandy to wash it down.

627
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,226
Enjoy.

628
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,321
Good?

629
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,651
Mm.

630
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,497
Heaven.

631
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:01,507
What do you want?

632
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,052
Ineed exit papers.

633
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:13,060
- Trust me, you don't have to leave
the country. - It was your suggestion.

634
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:17,407
Well, if you've made
up your mind to do it,

635
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:22,364
- there are proper channels...
- They'll strip me of everything I have.

636
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:26,201
Do you know how much they'll let
me take out of the country? Do you?

637
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,746
Have you any idea?

638
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,294
Ten marks.

639
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:35,345
Ten marks to show for
everything I've ever worked for.

640
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:40,308
Now, if you pulled a few strings...

641
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:44,193
It's a bit... different now...

642
00:49:44,236 --> 00:49:49,659
- If I could, I would.
- You're in the fucking SS, for fuck's sake!

643
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:58,751
It's purely an honorary rank.

644
00:49:59,506 --> 00:50:03,207
They like to have a few academics around
to give them a veneer of sophistication.

645
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:07,212
Put it like that, I'm a
purely honorary fucking Jew!

646
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,841
Why don't you try telling
that to your comrades?

647
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,356
Jesus, you're fucking incredible!

648
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,190
- This is hard for me, you know?
- Yes.

649
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,239
I can put up with any of the
shit I get thrown at me daily,

650
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:29,374
any of the inhumanity, but this... this
is very hard to take, you understand?

651
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:32,336
Johnnie...

652
00:50:32,382 --> 00:50:34,291
I am...

653
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:38,301
begging you now.

654
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:44,559
- You've every right to ask.
- Oh, don't be so fucking reasonable!

655
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:50,606
I can't bear to listen to any
more of your rationalisations.

656
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:54,904
Just get me a ticket to Paris.

657
00:50:54,953 --> 00:50:59,118
- It's not quite that simple.
- You think it's simple for me?

658
00:51:06,676 --> 00:51:08,919
I'll pay whatever it costs.

659
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,515
Keep your money, Maurice.

660
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,469
Allow me...

661
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,514
just a shred...

662
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:19,317
of dignity, please.

663
00:51:39,344 --> 00:51:42,346
You can put your ring
back on now if you like.

664
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:10,466
Hey, you! John Halder!

665
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,632
Johnnie? What the hell
are you doing here?

666
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,011
You know Johnnie Halder? He's
our top man at the university.

667
00:52:20,063 --> 00:52:24,691
You see, this is typical of him... such humility.
Just queues up with the rank and file.

668
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:27,193
But, really, this is taking it too far.

669
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,073
- Stand aside. Please stand aside.
- No, it's all right, Freddie.

670
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,498
Hauptsturmführer Halder is travelling
on urgent business with the Reich.

671
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:40,502
Please give the man a ticket... wherever he'd
like to go - and I will sign for it, first class.

672
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:42,174
- I don't mind paying.
- We all do it.

673
00:52:42,217 --> 00:52:46,715
You're part of the elite, you don't
have to pay like everyone else. Where to?

674
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,309
Paris, please.

675
00:52:52,355 --> 00:52:53,850
Excuse me?

676
00:52:53,899 --> 00:52:58,729
Is it possible to buy a ticket
to Paris? Leaving tomorrow.

677
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:02,826
Well, I'd have to see the
appropriate exit papers.

678
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,872
You've seen the travel
warrant. That should suffice.

679
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:11,671
- As I said, a single to Paris, please.
- You're not planning to return?

680
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:16,255
- No, no... Yes!
- You had me there.

681
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:20,468
That's another thing I love about
this fellow, it's his sense of humour.

682
00:53:20,517 --> 00:53:22,890
Y... Yes, a r... return.

683
00:53:22,937 --> 00:53:25,429
A return to Paris, please.

684
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:28,603
- I can pay cash.
- You joke about deserting the Reich?

685
00:53:29,529 --> 00:53:31,522
Johnnie...

686
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,318
Johnnie, this isn't clever.

687
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:40,326
No. No, I-I meant Brandenburg.

688
00:53:40,377 --> 00:53:42,536
Return to Brandenburg, please.

689
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:45,290
What takes you there?

690
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:51,712
My mother.

691
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:07,698
Mother?

692
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:14,168
Frau Troller?

693
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:18,089
Mother, it's me, John.

694
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,184
How long have you been like this?

695
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:29,768
Where's Frau Troller?

696
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,225
On... On holiday.

697
00:54:32,278 --> 00:54:36,442
On holiday? For God's sake,
Mother, why didn't you tell us?

698
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:41,111
- Bloody hell!
- You don't want me any more.

699
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:44,367
Don't say that.

700
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:48,417
There you are.

701
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:51,921
Let me come back and
live with you and Helen.

702
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,844
I'm not with Helen any more.

703
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:59,721
- When did this happen?
- Six months ago, Mother, you know that.

704
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:03,140
No! Don't go...

705
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:05,269
You need to drink something.

706
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:10,612
- Are you going to put me in a home? - I'm
not going to put you in a home, I promise.

707
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:24,546
- You need to see a doctor.
- No, I just need my pills.

708
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:30,969
You'll have to let me go if
you want me to get them for you.

709
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:39,606
I'll fetch you some water.

710
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:47,953
Damn.

711
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,125
Ugh!

712
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,133
I'll see about that
light in the kitchen...

713
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:06,142
Mother!

714
00:56:09,779 --> 00:56:11,155
No.

715
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:15,531
No, Mother, no!

716
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,173
No! I won't let you...

717
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:34,135
Maurice, please!

718
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:42,359
Please, take it.

719
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:55,952
- I'm... I'm sorry, I...
- You look like shit, you know?

720
00:56:57,716 --> 00:56:59,793
You really look terrible.

721
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,716
Mother tried to kill herself.

722
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:11,643
- Is she OK?
- Luckily, I was there.

723
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:15,145
Actually, it was my fault. Ishouldn't
have left the pills in her reach.

724
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,900
Yeah. And if you were there,
she didn't really mean it.

725
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:20,198
Mm.

726
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:28,084
You don't know what she's been through.
Memory gone, dignity gone, everything... gone.

727
00:57:28,131 --> 00:57:30,753
- She can hardly breathe.
- Hm!

728
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,925
At least she isn't Jewish.

729
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:44,607
It's... It's all right, it's all right.

730
00:58:01,174 --> 00:58:03,001
You missed a bit.

731
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:28,077
There you go. This was for you.

732
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:36,005
Thank you.

733
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:44,384
Ah!

734
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,152
Where are you gonna get
proper Jewish cheesecake

735
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,991
when you've locked up all the Jews, eh?

736
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:57,285
Unless you give a special
dispensation to Epstein's.

737
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,885
I can't stand them in there.

738
00:59:10,723 --> 00:59:13,096
Go in every day, give them my money.

739
00:59:13,143 --> 00:59:17,272
Don't get a "hello",
"thank you". Nothing.

740
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:20,227
Fucking Jews, eh?

741
00:59:25,618 --> 00:59:28,191
No one's talking about
locking anybody up.

742
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,627
We probably met him, you know?

743
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,755
When we were at Ypres,
October of that year.

744
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:43,556
16th Bavarian were in
the line next to us.

745
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,184
He'd have been running
dispatches back and forth.

746
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,511
Hm!

747
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:55,232
- You may have sent him on an errand.
- Hm!

748
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:58,526
"Oi, you. Lance Corporal.

749
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:02,579
"Yes, you, short arse. Get over here. "

750
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:08,206
- And he'd have saluted you. Imagine that.
- Hm!

751
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,672
So, that's it. You're
not getting me a ticket?

752
01:00:14,556 --> 01:00:18,804
- I can't.
I tried. - Mm-hm?

753
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:25,267
- You'll be all right. You're a war veteran.
- That doesn't help any more.

754
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,870
- Look...
- It's OK.

755
01:00:33,914 --> 01:00:36,585
I'm a Jew, you're a Nazi.

756
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,121
End of story.

757
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:08,788
I don't think Mother
appreciated what you did for her.

758
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,245
Well, I wasn't a very good nurse.

759
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:20,055
Sometimes I used to play mazurkas all afternoon,
just so that I couldn't hear her yelling.

760
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:33,699
I don't know why I put her
through it. Now that she's... gone.

761
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:37,872
What...

762
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,582
What good did it do?

763
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:43,704
What are you saying, John?

764
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:48,218
I made her suffer until the end.

765
01:01:49,597 --> 01:01:51,424
Why?

766
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,013
Because you're her son.

767
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:57,265
Because that's too much to ask of a son.

768
01:01:59,192 --> 01:02:01,684
Of a husband, perhaps.

769
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:06,446
- I'm sorry.
- Oh no, I'm fine.

770
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:08,403
You don't need to worry about me.

771
01:02:09,497 --> 01:02:11,704
- Busy giving piano lessons.
- Are you?

772
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:16,165
Mm. Everyone wants to learn classical
music again, for some reason.

773
01:02:16,214 --> 01:02:19,466
- Hm.
- I even learned to cook.

774
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,677
Yes, the children told me.

775
01:02:22,723 --> 01:02:26,555
I don't know
what but they eat it all up.

776
01:02:26,602 --> 01:02:28,430
No, no, they...

777
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,435
They say it's quite good.

778
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:35,902
They tell me all your news, too.

779
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,359
They're very proud of you.

780
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:50,925
- I let them down.
- No, you didn't.

781
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,293
- Yes, I did.
- No.

782
01:02:53,346 --> 01:02:58,638
Perhaps they don't always allow themselves to
show it but they are proud of what you're doing.

783
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:02,189
We all are.

784
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:33,137
So, we'll start off with a general tour.
You can get an idea of our facilities here.

785
01:03:35,484 --> 01:03:37,561
I read your paper, by the way.

786
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,405
- What did you think of it?
- A competent grasp of the ethical issues.

787
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:51,378
I'd assumed, of course, that the inspector would
be a medical man, but your field is literature?

788
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:57,506
The Reich Committee approached me after they
chanced upon a book I'd written on the subject.

789
01:03:57,554 --> 01:03:59,631
A work of fiction, was it?

790
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,053
Anovel, yes.

791
01:04:05,148 --> 01:04:08,315
On the strength of it, I was invited
to draft the paper you've read.

792
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,860
Which led, in due course,
to my current role.

793
01:04:11,906 --> 01:04:13,698
Which is?

794
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:20,955
Not so much an inspector,
more of a... consultant.

795
01:04:22,545 --> 01:04:23,791
Consultant?

796
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:31,131
Consultant in humanity,
Isuppose you could say.

797
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:37,013
Well, you do have to ask yourself,
what sort of life is this?

798
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,570
Don't you?

799
01:04:49,705 --> 01:04:52,162
Lis and I finally had some tests.

800
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:55,793
We hardly needed to redecorate
at all, did we darling?

801
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:02,008
- No, the house goes with the job.
- Where did you get this furniture?

802
01:05:02,054 --> 01:05:06,386
It was here. Poor Mandelstam left in
such a hurry he hardly took a thing.

803
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:11,563
Come and see the bathroom.
It's bigger than our old flat.

804
01:05:18,785 --> 01:05:19,984
Cheers.

805
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:23,457
Please.

806
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:29,465
Tests?

807
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,960
Do you want to hear the verdict?

808
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,966
Well, the verdict is...

809
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:40,262
we can't have kids.

810
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:44,266
Oh, Freddie, I'm sorry.

811
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:47,401
They keep on at me at headquarters.

812
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:54,738
"When are you going to start breeding?
Perfect Nordic pair like you and Lis. "

813
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:57,626
They're obsessed with fucking breeding.

814
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,339
At this rate I'll be stuck
a Sturmbannführer forever.

815
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,891
That's not why we want kids, of course,
but it doesn't make things any easier.

816
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:12,479
No.

817
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:19,484
I had to go to Lis's uncle's doctor in
Wiesbaden in case they tracked my records.

818
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:23,693
Maybe... that doctor's wrong.

819
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:25,821
I haven't slept for weeks.

820
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:31,747
I lie awake all night. I imagine
all sorts of crazy things.

821
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:39,430
Well... we all imagine things.

822
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,969
With me it's music.

823
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:46,643
I can just be sitting
there talking to someone...

824
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:58,245
Excuse me.

825
01:07:01,419 --> 01:07:05,583
Heil Hitler. Urgent communication
for Sturmbannführer Dorbisch.

826
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:08,128
Freddie.

827
01:07:10,806 --> 01:07:13,642
You're to report to
headquarters immediately, sir.

828
01:07:26,368 --> 01:07:29,156
If you were desperate for
your wife to have a kid...

829
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,408
would you get someone?

830
01:07:32,459 --> 01:07:35,080
You know, like that lad there?

831
01:07:36,923 --> 01:07:39,462
What is it? What's happened?

832
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,555
Oh, the Jews have shot Vom Rath.

833
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:48,645
Who the hell is Vom Rath?

834
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:52,984
Some third fucking secretary in the Paris
embassy with a bullet in his abdomen.

835
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,234
Poor sod.

836
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,650
- Well, he's ruined my evening.
- Why?

837
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:04,041
Well, put it this way, if Vom Rath dies,
I wouldn't want to be a Jew tomorrow night.

838
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:09,872
I'd better go and make my apologies.
Shit! I haven't had duck for ages.

839
01:08:15,181 --> 01:08:17,340
Well, alas, duty calls.

840
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:20,597
I must tear myself away from
the most delightful of hostesses.

841
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:25,560
Oh, Freddie... I'll
just smell that duck. This is torture.

842
01:08:25,612 --> 01:08:27,486
No peace for the wicked.

843
01:08:29,282 --> 01:08:31,821
Is it all right if I
leave Lis here with you?

844
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:34,906
- Of course. - You didn't say
where you were going, Freddie.

845
01:08:34,956 --> 01:08:38,373
Oh, I've got to burn down a few
synagogues. I could be all night.

846
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:40,911
You said they'd stopped all
that stuff with the Jews.

847
01:08:40,964 --> 01:08:43,373
Yes, that's what I thought.

848
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:46,097
Not really going to burn down
synagogues, are you, darling?

849
01:08:46,138 --> 01:08:47,965
No.

850
01:08:48,015 --> 01:08:50,008
No, first thing is a briefing

851
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:55,400
to organise a spontaneous demonstration
of popular indignation for tomorrow night.

852
01:08:59,154 --> 01:09:00,483
Cheerio.

853
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,394
He can take care of
himself, you know he can.

854
01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:33,937
It's just that... poor Freddie,
he hasn't been sleeping.

855
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,342
I...

856
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:04,568
I just realised... I
- I've left something at work.

857
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:09,156
Papers I need...

858
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,198
for my lecture tomorrow.

859
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:12,364
I'm so sorry.

860
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:26,262
Heil Hitler.

861
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:30,144
Return to Paris, please.

862
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:32,851
I'll need to see some exit papers.

863
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,153
I'm sorry, I have to follow procedures.

864
01:10:40,495 --> 01:10:43,283
- Your name, please?
- Beckermeier.

865
01:10:43,332 --> 01:10:47,746
Tell me, Beckermeier, do you
enjoy working on the railways?

866
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,710
Yes, sir.

867
01:10:49,757 --> 01:10:53,376
Then would you like to further
your career in transportation?

868
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:58,553
Say, digging autobahns?

869
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,352
One return ticket to
Paris coming up, sir.

870
01:11:13,913 --> 01:11:15,373
Maurice!

871
01:11:30,184 --> 01:11:33,637
"Come house tomorrow. "

872
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:45,535
No! No, no. Thank you.

873
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:47,778
Hello.

874
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,539
Halder speaking.

875
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:57,670
Understood.

876
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,001
What is it?

877
01:11:59,055 --> 01:12:01,594
- Vom Rath died.
- Who?

878
01:12:01,642 --> 01:12:04,181
- Secretary at the Paris embassy.
- Did you know him?

879
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:08,014
What? I've been ordered
to report for duty tonight.

880
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:12,398
- But I thought your rank was honorary?
- All reserves have been mobilised!

881
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:29,008
- I've never seen you like this.
- I know, forgive me.

882
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:34,013
- I just... I don't know what to do.
- I know what you're thinking.

883
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:38,058
You're a man of letters, you shouldn't
be out there patrolling the streets.

884
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:43,852
- I never thought it would come to this.
- Of course you didn't.

885
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:47,739
Just think about it, what exactly
are you going to be doing tonight?

886
01:12:47,786 --> 01:12:49,695
- Yes.
- Keep the peace.

887
01:12:49,746 --> 01:12:52,321
Stop the mob from
getting out of control.

888
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,665
- Is that really all it is?
- Yes.

889
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:57,879
You're not going to be in any danger.

890
01:12:57,924 --> 01:13:01,508
It's not me I'm worried about,
I'm thinking about Maurice.

891
01:13:01,554 --> 01:13:04,176
- I promised him he'd be all right.
- It's not your fault.

892
01:13:04,223 --> 01:13:07,890
- Any Jew with any sense left years ago.
- Exactly!

893
01:13:10,482 --> 01:13:15,644
- I should have helped him while there
was time. - He can take care of himself.

894
01:13:15,697 --> 01:13:20,277
He hasn't got a family. Would you
risk everything we have for him?

895
01:13:27,087 --> 01:13:30,005
- He may come here while I'm gone.
- John...

896
01:13:36,432 --> 01:13:38,141
If he does, give him these.

897
01:13:38,185 --> 01:13:42,313
- What have you done?
- You must... You have to do this for me!

898
01:13:42,356 --> 01:13:44,765
Are you all right? Did I hurt you?

899
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,980
Look at yourself.

900
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,368
Just look at yourself.

901
01:14:14,273 --> 01:14:15,601
Anne...

902
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,422
Maurice!

903
01:15:30,289 --> 01:15:32,662
Please! Help me!

904
01:15:38,132 --> 01:15:39,295
Wait!

905
01:15:39,842 --> 01:15:41,218
Maurice!

906
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,856
Gluckstein!

907
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:53,308
- Is there a Maurice Gluckstein?
- Don't worry, sir.

908
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:57,858
- None of them will slip through the net.
- I have orders to bring him in.

909
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:00,316
- What did you say the name was?
- Gluckstein.

910
01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:03,205
Gluckstein. Do we have a Gluckstein?

911
01:16:03,248 --> 01:16:04,956
Gluckstein!

912
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,164
I am Gluckstein.

913
01:16:14,888 --> 01:16:16,430
That him?

914
01:16:19,812 --> 01:16:21,686
Yes.

915
01:16:27,822 --> 01:16:30,278
OK, move them out!

916
01:16:30,325 --> 01:16:34,158
<i># The world</i>

917
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:41,000
<i>#Is deep</i>

918
01:16:45,428 --> 01:16:49,806
<i># And deeper</i>

919
01:16:53,063 --> 01:16:57,525
<i># Than the day</i>

920
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,057
Anne?

921
01:17:27,107 --> 01:17:28,981
Anne...

922
01:17:29,026 --> 01:17:31,103
Has he been here?

923
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:32,946
Who?

924
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,533
Maurice.

925
01:17:35,493 --> 01:17:36,656
No.

926
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:39,705
No, come to bed.

927
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:51,673
There is a reference here to your friendship
with a Gluckstein. Maurice Israel Gluckstein.

928
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,801
Mainly a professional
relationship, as my doctor.

929
01:17:56,854 --> 01:17:59,773
A psychoanalyst, it says here?

930
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:02,982
- Yes.
- According to our records,

931
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:08,404
you continued to associate with him
after he was prohibited from practising.

932
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:11,822
Did I?

933
01:18:13,376 --> 01:18:15,285
This would have been 1938.

934
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:22,669
He did approach me. Now I remember.

935
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:27,389
To ask for my help in
leaving the country.

936
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:30,105
I, of course, referred him
to the proper authorities.

937
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:32,893
You've written on the Jewish question.

938
01:18:34,362 --> 01:18:37,898
- My field is literature.
- Oh, I mean from a racial point of view.

939
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:40,523
We have reports on your lectures.

940
01:18:40,578 --> 01:18:45,122
Your work at the university
is valued by the leadership

941
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:50,080
but in times of war, you understand,
we all have to give that little extra.

942
01:18:50,132 --> 01:18:51,959
Of course.

943
01:18:52,009 --> 01:18:56,139
Now, we're currently engaged in a major
resettlement programme in the East.

944
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:59,812
Resettlement? Of the Jews?

945
01:18:59,853 --> 01:19:02,261
Among others. Transports are underway.

946
01:19:02,314 --> 01:19:05,814
We need to ensure that reception
facilities are fully operational.

947
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:08,067
We need reports we can trust.

948
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:11,783
When would you like me to start?

949
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:15,365
With immediate effect.

950
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:21,336
Was there something else?

951
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:26,214
This... resettlement...

952
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,802
obviously it's a colossal undertaking.

953
01:19:30,852 --> 01:19:36,310
I was just wondering, is it still
possible to keep accurate records?

954
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:39,985
I'm rather proud of this.

955
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,198
I had a special punch card
and sorting system designed.

956
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:45,236
State of the art.

957
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:48,324
Everything's there. Cross-indexed.

958
01:19:58,721 --> 01:20:00,596
Very impressive.

959
01:20:01,892 --> 01:20:03,766
Can you find anybody?

960
01:20:05,313 --> 01:20:07,935
Might... Might we try a little exercise?

961
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,402
By all means.

962
01:20:11,446 --> 01:20:15,030
Say that doctor you
mentioned... erm, Gluckstein.

963
01:20:15,868 --> 01:20:19,998
Would your records be able to tell
us where he ended up, for instance?

964
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:24,755
- We need to check a record.
- Yes, sir.

965
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:28,544
Gluckstein.

966
01:20:29,553 --> 01:20:33,089
The full name's... Maurice Israel.

967
01:20:38,356 --> 01:20:41,062
- Year of birth?
- 1899.

968
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:46,066
Or thereabouts.

969
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:52,539
Well, I wish I could wait and see
the outcome of our little experiment,

970
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:56,534
but you wouldn't believe the paperwork
that ends up on my desk. Good luck.

971
01:20:56,588 --> 01:20:58,297
Thank you, sir.

972
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,475
Gluckstein, M.I.

973
01:21:15,154 --> 01:21:17,230
Evacuated to Silesia.

974
01:21:18,742 --> 01:21:20,984
Does it say when he was picked up?

975
01:21:35,931 --> 01:21:37,390
Thank you.

976
01:21:51,868 --> 01:21:53,778
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

977
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:59,539
- I know what you did.
- What are you talking about?

978
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:02,375
- He came to the house that night.
- Who?

979
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:06,711
You turned him in.

980
01:22:08,599 --> 01:22:10,675
How can you think that?

981
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:19,522
One thing you can say for the Gestapo,
they keep extremely thorough records.

982
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:22,230
Drive on.

983
01:22:22,283 --> 01:22:25,653
Oh, John... John! Please!

984
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:26,903
Please!

985
01:23:18,064 --> 01:23:19,523
Heil Hitler.

986
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:23,688
- Heil Hitler.
- Hauptsturmführer Halder?

987
01:23:25,574 --> 01:23:27,448
I prefer "Professor".

988
01:23:28,494 --> 01:23:30,451
Step this way, Professor.

989
01:23:31,164 --> 01:23:33,038
Thank you.

990
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,290
I trust you'll find everything in order.

991
01:23:36,128 --> 01:23:39,712
Obersturmbannführer Eichmann
will be pleased to hear it.

992
01:23:39,758 --> 01:23:43,924
In fact, he asked me to
carry out a little experiment.

993
01:23:45,474 --> 01:23:49,520
To check that his records
office is fully operational,

994
01:23:49,563 --> 01:23:53,147
he wanted to see if it is possible
to locate a particular individual.

995
01:23:53,193 --> 01:23:55,945
A fascinating exercise,
I'm sure you'll agree.

996
01:23:57,657 --> 01:24:02,404
The name, selected at
random, is Gluckstein.

997
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,163
Maurice Gluckstein.

998
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:10,078
Our records show that he
should be here somewhere.

999
01:24:10,131 --> 01:24:15,589
Sorry to disappoint you, Professor, but at any
given time we've got up to 30,000 items here.

1000
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:18,309
And the turnover is considerable.

1001
01:24:18,351 --> 01:24:21,388
Moreover, on arrival, each
item is allocated a number,

1002
01:24:21,438 --> 01:24:24,310
which becomes its sole
means of identification.

1003
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:28,108
So all we have to do is
find Gluckstein's number?

1004
01:24:28,155 --> 01:24:31,110
- In theory, yes.
- But?

1005
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:34,118
Let me put it this way, Professor,

1006
01:24:34,163 --> 01:24:38,625
I'm sure from Head Office
everything looks neat and tidy,

1007
01:24:38,668 --> 01:24:41,374
- but out here...
- Can you find this man or not?

1008
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:44,092
Frankly, not a chance in hell.

1009
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:47,383
Nine out of ten are
processed on arrival.

1010
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:50,052
No one is here for more
than a month or two.

1011
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:54,730
Isee.

1012
01:25:04,744 --> 01:25:06,120
Stop!

1013
01:25:20,807 --> 01:25:22,087
Move!

1014
01:25:28,525 --> 01:25:30,399
Come on!

1015
01:25:39,164 --> 01:25:41,241
Keep moving!

1016
01:29:13,276 --> 01:29:14,936
It's real.

1017
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,479
Move it! Come on, there!
