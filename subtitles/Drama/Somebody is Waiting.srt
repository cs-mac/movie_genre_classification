00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,951
Hey!

2
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:36,806
Hi!
How are you?

3
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:57,154
Welcome to "Bring Your Daughter To Work
Day" here at STARKe Pharmaceutical.

4
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:00,744
[Man] Very nice.
Home movies and family photos.

5
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:03,202
That's.... nice.
It's novel.

6
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:06,662
Pat, this is just a first cut,
of course. It's--

7
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:10,252
I was wondering how next month's
Good Chemistry video is coming along.

8
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:14,493
- I can have it by Thursday.
- Pagel wants a look by Wednesday.

9
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,501
- Gee, Wednesday would be--
- Perfect! Gotta run!

10
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,903
This might be a good time to talk
about that promotion of mine.

11
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,067
Or those
basketball tickets?

12
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,577
All right.
We'll do it some other time.

13
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:31,011
Okay, then.

14
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,052
No.

15
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,464
Hey, let me give you a hand.
Just hand me your staple gun.

16
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,661
- The... what?
- The staple gun.

17
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:30,072
- It's right behind you.
- Oh! Staple gun.

18
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,940
Thank you.
You are really saving me here.

19
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,809
You're welcome. I love this whole
"Choose Happiness" thing.

20
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,715
Yeah. It's based on the
classic philosophical concept...

21
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:43,016
that happiness is a choice,
not a condition.

22
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,990
Maybe they're getting it
on a subliminal level.

23
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:56,968
It's Joe, isn't it?
Joe... Scheffer.

24
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:59,435
- Yeah.
- Meg Harper.

25
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,996
You did that great video
for my department last summer.

26
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,703
I know--

27
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,873
[Laughs]
It actually, um-- It made me cry.

28
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,975
Why?
'Cause it was so--

29
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:16,816
[Clattering]

30
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:20,847
- Bad?
- Not at all. Because it was so good!

31
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,121
Thanks.

32
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:27,325
- How have you been, Joe?
- I got a divorce, actually.

33
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,890
Oh. Oh!

34
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:33,495
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no. That's okay.

35
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:37,599
- You all right?
- Yeah. You know, it's weird.

36
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,871
No, but I'm doin' great.
I stay busy.

37
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:43,039
During the week, it's all about
my daughter Natalie. She's 12.

38
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:45,743
On the weekends, schedule's totally
whacked. I work out all the time.

39
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:48,945
- Me too!
- I got concerts, plays.

40
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,182
I hike now.
Got some Vibram sole boots.

41
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,724
I do a little trekkin'.
I travel extensively.

42
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,625
- Sounds like you win.
- I dance! Yeah.

43
00:04:56,695 --> 00:05:00,324
Not professionally, mind you, but
I do go to clubs with other-- others.

44
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,663
Geez, Joe, get off your ass
and do something!

45
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:05,498
- I'm thinking about
getting a pilot's license.
- I was kidding.

46
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,663
- Oh! [Laughs]
- [Laughing]

47
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:11,835
I'm not gonna take lessons.
Not gonna fly. I was joking too.

48
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,845
Hey, I should buy you
an almond-spiced latte.

49
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:17,541
It's the least I can do
for helping me with this--

50
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:22,519
this whole--
with the banner.

51
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:26,045
I got this work to do.
I should just finish my lunch.

52
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,251
I understand completely.

53
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,761
- Okay?
- Okay.

54
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,261
[TV Announcer] Volomin,

and in extremely
rare cases... death.

63
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:05,387
Volomin. Making you better
than you really are.

64
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,976
[Natalie]
Daddy!

65
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:20,978
Hey, Nat!

66
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,611
Hi, Dad!

67
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,346
- Yea!
- Oh! Mmm.

68
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,583
Did you have fun?

69
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:34,625
Weekend from hell.

70
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:39,460
They took me to another
silly-ass hippie restaurant.

71
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,625
- With the most absurd one-man play ever produced.
- "Silly-ass"?

72
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,329
- Dad!
-Just find an alternative.

73
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,338
Geez.

74
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,172
Everything on the menu
was made with curd.

75
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:54,007
Curd this, curd that.
I ordered a hamburger,

76
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,309
and I got a ten-minute lecture
on animal rights from the waitress.

77
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,315
And the guy in the play
was half naked.

78
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:01,216
- What? Which half?
- Dad!

79
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:04,050
Did you get the T'wolves tickets?

80
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:08,889
No, I didn't this time. The list
for company tickets is real long.

81
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,224
- You know, I'm gonna get a promotion--
- Dad!

82
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,856
The best view
is on TV anyway.

83
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,833
- [Man Doing Voice Exercises]
- Rick's here.

84
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,030
Mah, mah, mah, hah-mah.
Hah-mah, may, mee, mo, moo.

85
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:23,802
Hey! There he is.
Hah-mah.

86
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,776
You become a farmer?

87
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,804
No, Joe, I'm an actor
dressed as a farmer for an audition.

88
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,248
- Sorry.
- Come on, Nat, let's go.

89
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,650
Hah, yah, yah, yah.

90
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,883
- Hey, Joe.
- Hi, Callie.

91
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,391
We had a great weekend.
Did she tell you about the play?

92
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,394
Yeah.
The actors were naked.

93
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,521
- So were the ushers.
- They were not!

94
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:48,225
Callie, Beauty and the Beast is in town.
What's the matter with that?

95
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,236
We're just trying to expose
Natalie to serious theater.

96
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:56,206
- Bye, sweetie. Here's for lunch today.
- [Rick] Ooh-ahh.

97
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,902
Thanks, Mom.

98
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,876
Oops.

99
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,811
[Rick]
I love your hair down. So sexy.

100
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:11,254
- Stop. Really?
- So soft.

101
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,848
We should probably get going.

102
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,359
- Come on, Dad.
- Bye, Joe.

103
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,760
- Bye.
- See you next weekend, sweetie.

104
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,264
We're gonna see an authentic
Indonesian dance troupe.

105
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,427
It's a dream come true, Mom.

106
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,701
Dad.

107
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,870
Why do I have to spend
weekends with them?

108
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:38,040
Can't we just drive by
every Saturday and wave?

109
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:42,746
Your mom's a little eccentric.
Think of her as an exotic flower.

110
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:46,951
- And that made you what? Dirt?
- Nat, she's your mom.

111
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:52,895
[Natalie] Let's get started on this
"Take Your Daughter to Work"thing.

112
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:55,455
I'm supposed to interview you,
and then write a report for school.

113
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,798
All right, let her rip.

114
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,894
Okay. Ah--

115
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,065
Did you always know you wanted to be
a video communications specialist?

116
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,575
Actually, at first
I wanted to be Batman.

117
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:08,169
But he had no powers.
AndAquaman-- I don't like water.

118
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,908
So Spider-Man--
That's what I always wanted to be.

119
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:14,816
- Dad, this is supposed to be serious.
- I really don't know what to say.

120
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:17,354
I have a really great job.

121
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,823
But to be honest, it's not the job
I've always dreamt about having.

122
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:24,157
- I thought you wanted to be a writer.
- You're the writer, okay?

123
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:28,689
I've read your play ten times. It's
amazing! How come you only wrote one?

124
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:32,703
Writing was a dream I had
when I was a kid. And then I grew up.

125
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,365
But dreams are important
to hold on to! Come on!

126
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:40,969
You're gonna be a great writer.
You have that special spark.

127
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:45,506
I knowthat, but that spark is gonna
go out unless you write. Now write this.

128
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,694
- [Horn Honking]
- Hey, watch it, ass... guy.

129
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,845
Nice save.

130
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:09,776
- [Joe] You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

131
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:12,646
- What's his hurry?
- He's just a lunatic.

132
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:19,448
- It's so crowded.
- I think they manufacture people here.

133
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:21,617
Below, in the basement,
they make people.

134
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:25,424
- Look, look.
- Oh, wait, she's pulling out.

[Horn Honking,
Brakes Squealing]

136
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:35,702
- Hey! That guy's an ass-wipe!
- Natalie.

137
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:38,765
Sorry.
I meant "ass-guy."

138
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,868
That's Mark McKinney.

139
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:43,106
He's a seven-year employee.

140
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:45,115
What's he doing
in the ten-year lot?

141
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:48,584
Maybe he's gonna stand around
for another three years.

142
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:51,918
No, he's not.
I'll be right back.

143
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,894
- Excuse me. Mark?
- Yeah?

144
00:10:56,961 --> 00:11:00,158
Yeah, this is a ten-year lot.

145
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:03,223
And you're not a
ten-year associate, are you?

146
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,701
- [Laughs] You're kiddin', right?
- No.

147
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,931
No, this is actually
the ten-year lot.

148
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:10,600
And this is the last space,
and if I don't park here...

149
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:14,270
my daughter and I will have
to come way over from the west lot.

150
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:17,075
- You actually brought
your daughter to work?
- Yeah.

151
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:20,379
I thought only the mothers
were doin' that.

152
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:24,251
I'd just appreciate it
if you'd park someplace else.

153
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,552
You know
what I think, um--

154
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:30,116
- What's your name again?
-Joe Scheffer. I work--

155
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:32,924
Joe, I think walking
from the west lot...

156
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:36,524
is probably better than getting your ass
kicked in front of your little girl.

157
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:40,560
Wait a minute!
Are you like threatening to hit me?

158
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,799
Tell you what, Joe.

159
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,401
Uh-huh?

160
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:49,139
I'm gonna give you to five
to get back in your car.

161
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,703
No. I'm not gonna-- No.

162
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:54,081
- No, this is the ten-year lot.
- One.

163
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:58,054
- Two.
- Do you have any idea
of the crap I've been through--

164
00:11:58,122 --> 00:12:01,182
- Daddy!
- Stay in the car!

165
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,092
Turn around,
and get back in your car.

166
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:06,926
- That's my space!
- Daddy!

167
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,433
Daddy! Daddy!

168
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:15,666
- Leave him alone, dirtbag!
- Don't call anyone a dirtbag.

169
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,937
- Daddy, you okay? You're bleeding.
- I'm good. I just tripped.

170
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,877
I'm okay. Let's go.

171
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:20,736
I think maybe I'm just
gonna take you to school.

You've reached the Scheffers.

[Natalie On Answering Machine]
Wait for the beep.

176
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,754
[Natalie]
Dad, pick up.

177
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,195
Dad, it's been two days.

178
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,867
- Hey!
- Dad?

179
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,527
Are you okay?

180
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:56,198
- Yeah, I'm great.
- You don't sound great.

181
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,538
Mom and Rick have friends
over for yoga.

182
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:02,170
So I can sneak out
and be home in no time.

183
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:06,046
No, Nat.
Um, I got, um--

184
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:08,381
Friends from--
We got a bunch--

185
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:12,048
- We're gonna edit--
- Dad, just tell me something.

186
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:15,286
Is it you don't wanna see me?
Or is it you don't want me to see you?

187
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:19,629
Yes, to the second one.

188
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,688
Dad, please just let me
come over,

189
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,633
-just for a little while.
- It's okay. Everything's all right.

190
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:28,160
I'm just sittin' here
drowning my sorrows in a--

191
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,969
a quart of Ben and Jerry's
Chunky Monkey.

192
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,704
So, let's see.

193
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,077
Either you're lying
or you've grown an ovary.

194
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:40,584
How old are you again?

195
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,518
Dad, I'm scared.

196
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:46,887
What are you scared of?

197
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,860
I'm not sure.
I just miss you.

198
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:55,160
It's gonna be okay, Natalie,
I promise. It's gonna be fine.

Okay.
Your turn.

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:04,433
What are you scared of?

201
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,479
Disappearing, I think.

202
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,173

Hi.

[Sniffing]
Are you smoking?

207
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:32,397
Please. Like the coordinator of the
company wellness program would smoke!

208
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,199
Right!

209
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:37,400
You should've come with me
to the Human Resources Conference.

210
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:42,708
Hawaii... was amazing.
I brought you a little... something.

211
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,739
"George Kahumoku, Jr.
Sings Hawaiian Love Songs."

212
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,615
- You don't have it, do you?
- No!

213
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:53,589
I'm gone for three days and employees
are fighting like schoolkids in the lot.

214
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:57,253
This McKinney, I know everybody hates
that big jerk. But this Joe "Shepherd"--

215
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:59,990
- Scheffer.Joe Scheffer.
- Scheffer.

216
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,794
He did the video
for the wellness program last year.

217
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,926
- Remember?
- Oh, he's the A-V guy.

218
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:08,836
- Video communications specialist.
- Ooh! That's very different then.

219
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:13,104
Actually, Jeremy,
he's a good guy.

220
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:17,273
I ran into him the other day.
He's quiet, hard-working.

221
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:19,908
Maybe a little shaky right now.
He's going through a divorce.

222
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:23,442
It's really sad.
He kept telling me how great--

223
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,354
Any work-related problems
prior to the incident?

224
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,416
He was promised a promotion
almost a year ago, and never happened.

225
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:32,360
So, basically,
he's a schmuck.

226
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,024
The guy's a devoted father,

227
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,760
a hard worker
with nothing but positive reviews.

228
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,768
That makes him a schmuck?

229
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:41,396
His wife left him.
He was passed over for a promotion...

230
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:43,463
and he just got bitch-slapped
in the company parking lot.

231
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,704
I'm gonna go with...
yeah!

232
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:50,276
So, what are we doin' about it?

233
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,784
Well, "we" have left him several
messages. I'm waiting to hear back--

234
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,376
Whoa. That's not enough.
It's been three days.

235
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:59,150
We're under review.
The efficiency Nazis are all over us.

236
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:02,351
Employees fighting in the
parking lot sort of undercuts...

237
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,860
the company wellness program,
if you know what I mean.

238
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,831
-Do you think I'm not doing my job?
-It doesn't matter what I think.

239
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,629
But what if he decides to sue?
What if he sues the living daylights...

240
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:14,830
out of the company for failure
to create a safe work environment,

241
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:18,397
or, uh, uh, emotional distress?

242
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:22,640
But you and me, Meg...
Megs, we're on the same page.

243
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:25,011
We're the "A" team. We can
make this go away. I know we can.

244
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,642
- I'll call him again.
- Nope. That time has passed.

245
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,845
- You go get Joe "Schlepper."
-Joe Scheffer.

246
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,650
- Go get him? At his house? Go--
- Go get him. At his house.

247
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:36,181
Go get him at his house and bring him
back to work. I know you can do it.

248
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,920
- Megs? Yeah, go get him.
- Yeah? Yeah.

249
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:43,228
Bye-bye.

250

[Fly Buzzing]

251
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,057
Hi, Joe.

252
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:20,433
Have you, uh, left the house at all
in the past three days?

253
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:24,065
- I had some cleaning to do.
- Mm-hmm. I can see that.

254
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:26,939
Is that--
It's bleach, huh?

255
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,411
It's the only thing
that really gets the stains out.

256
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,577
- Would you hold that for a minute?
- Sure. Um, Joe.

257
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:37,416
We'd really like for you
to come back to work.

258
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,547
You and I can work through
this thing together.

259
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:42,319
Do you think this will dry
darker than the rest of the ceiling?

260
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:46,090
If this drys darker,
then I'm gonna notice this stain.

261
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,097
I'm always gonna look at this stain.

262
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,895
I'd have to paint the whole ceiling.
I might as well do that right now.

263
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:54,734
Joe, could you please
slow down for a minute?

264
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:58,332
I would really like
to talk to you about this.

265
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,344
- What's in the bag? Is that bottles?
- No!

266
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:07,081
Oh!
I'm gonna need more bleach.

267
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:10,279
- [Vacuum Whirring]
- I would really like to help you.

00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:20,460
Please...Joe.

269
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:28,032
He took something from me.

270
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:31,268
Your parking space.

271
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:36,837
But it's not exactly your parking
space that he took, is it, Joe?

272
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:40,680
Yes, it's exactly that.
It's my parking space.

273
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:44,346
How 'bout when you come back to work,
we give you an assigned space, huh?

274
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:46,788
- I can't go back.
- Why not, Joe?

275
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:49,189
Would you mind not saying
my name so much?

276
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,251
Maybe you could just come in
for a couple of hours--

277
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,762
I'm sorry... I can't.

278
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:57,198
- McKinney's been suspended, Joe.
- You said my name again.

279
00:19:57,268 --> 00:20:02,365
Fine! Okay, fine. I will never
say your name again... ever.

280
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,308
Look, McKinney's not coming
back for a few weeks, Joe.

281
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:10,507
Then he has to attend my five-step anger
diffusion workshop called"RELAX."

282
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,904
- That stands for Releasing--
- It doesn't matter.

00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:18,039
No. Regulating Emotional
Levels And-- "X." What the hell is "X"?

284
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:21,414
- I'm not comin' back.
- Do you think--

285
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:25,114
-It doesn't matter what you say.
-Oh, geez! What do you want?

286
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,520
Oh.

287
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,926
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:37,496
Did you say,
"What do you want?"

289
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm taking this too personally.

290
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:46,102
Things have been really difficult
in our department, and I need--

291
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:49,577
What do I want?
[Muttering]

292
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:52,479
I need you to come back.

293
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,074
- [Panting]
- Joe?

294
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:60,684
- [Hyperventilating]
-Joe?

295
00:20:60,757 --> 00:21:03,282
You're having a panic attack.

296
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,523
Joe, do you know
what that means?

297
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:09,497
It... sounds...
pretty self-explanatory.

298
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:14,003
Okay. It's just--
It's a chemical misfire.

299
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,772
You're not dying, Joe.

300
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,037
Ten years in
a goddamn cubicle.

301
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:24,205
Then you wake up one day,

Nothing.

See, this--
This is way out of my league.

And what I do have
is the number of a great psychiatrist.

No, I'm cured!

- Meg! Oh, this is-- You cured me!
- I cured you?

Yes! When you asked me that
question that scared me so much
that I almost passed out.

For the first time since I can remember,
I have an answer. I know what I want!

come back for seconds?

McKinney smacked him all over
the lot, for Christ's sake.

- Well, that's sensitive.

It's a choice that'll affect

00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:27,984
Right? Three weeks,
the ten-year parking lot at 8:00 a.m.

456
00:31:28,057 --> 00:31:30,355
- You got it?
- [Mark] Bring it on.

457
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:34,294
No, no, M-Mark?
Mark? Wow.

458
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,796
[Horn Honking]

459
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:20,834
You comin' or goin', dude?

460
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,348
I was just driving by to take--
you know-- To find out more--

461
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:29,043
- Somethin' bad happen to ya?
- No, no, no, no, no.

462
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:33,919
I thought it just is a great time
for me to take a self-defense class.

463
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:36,685
- You got your ass kicked, huh?
- Who told you?

464
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,818
- You didn't read about it in the paper?
- What?

465
00:32:38,894 --> 00:32:41,761
Front page.
Daily Wuss.

466
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,095
Come on. Guys who get their asses
kicked, that's 90%of my business.

467
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,362
Come on in.
Come on.

468
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,907
- Is this you?
- Yeah.

469
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:58,503
Maximum Punishment.

470
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:00,913
- That looks good.
- No,

471
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:03,645
maximum punishment
was watching the damn thing.

472
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,154
- Tom Sawyer?
- Loose adaptation.

473
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:15,425
Tom played a rival ninja.
I killed him.

474
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:18,295
- What happened?
- I don't know.

475
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:21,302
The producer had foreign distribution--
35% he'd charge:

476
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,895
"Oh, I need the money for my wife!
I have a house in Las Brisas."

477
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:26,339
No, no, I mean, you know.
What happened?

478
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:28,569
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

479
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:34,077
Come on, I wanna hear
a really sad story.

480
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:36,083
Yours.

481
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:39,052
I, um-- I got beat up...

482
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:42,648
in front of my 12-year-old daughter
and a bunch of coworkers.

483
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:46,527
[Sighs]
Damn.

484
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:50,156
- Yeah.
- I was really hoping to give a shit.

485
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:52,996
Yeah.

486
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:55,002
- What?
- You got your ass kicked.

487
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,598
Now you wanna get all Bruce Lee
and stuff. You're losin' me.

488
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:02,610
Hey, I didn't come over here
to have my angst reviewed...

489
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,612
by some has-been movie star.

490
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,343
Ooh! 'Angst reviewed, "
"movie star"in the same sentence.

491
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:10,476
You must be very proud
of yourself...

492
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:13,112
for a man who just got made
into a wimp in front of his daughter.

493
00:34:13,188 --> 00:34:16,783
Why don't you
just shut up?

494
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,327
Why don't you
come over here and make me?

495
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:21,989
[Sighs]

496
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:23,827
Huh?

497
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,233
Come on.

498
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:35,034
- I figure I got it comin'.
- You don't think I'll do it, do you?

499
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,313
- [Yells]
- [Groans]

500
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,576
- Geez, I'm sorry.
- [Gagging]

501
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,983
I'm really torqued, man.
I didn't mean that to hurt.

502
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:47,648
Are you all right?
Take a deep one, man.

503
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:51,284
That's it.Just draw it in, dude.
You'll be all right.

504
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,263
- [Coughing]
-Jesus. I'm really sorry, man.

505
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:57,765
Let me give you a free lesson.

506
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,733
My way of saying,
"Don't press charges."

507
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,789
Mr. Scheffer?
Welcome to Club 13.

508
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,622
Follow me.

509
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:28,219
- Did you bring your own equipment?
- Was I supposed to?

510
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,595
No, not a problem.
We've got everything you need.

511
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,328
[Joe]
Great. Load me up.

512
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:45,872
Holy crap! Dude,
the hockey rink's next door.

513
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:48,746
Yet somehow
it works for ya.

514
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:51,877
- Hey, it's my partner you're
talking about. Joe Scheffer.
- Hey, Cade.

515
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:53,888
- I'm Peter.
- Hello, Peter.

516
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:55,890
- I'm Peter too.
- Two Peters.

517
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:59,291
- Actually it'd be four peters.
- [Men Laugh]

518
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:01,886
- All right, Joe. We're serving.
- Good, okay.

519
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,956
- Over here.
- Right. From here in the red thing.

520
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:17,339
I haven't played
since, you know...yesterday.

521
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:34,123
- [Shouts]
- You okay?

522
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:36,994
Yeah. It's a little longer
than I'm used to.

523
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,761
All right.

524
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:45,032
- I think it's dead.
- That's pretty funny.

525
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:47,200
Maybe I should serve first.

526
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:50,268
All right, gentlemen,
here we go. Let's get it on.

527
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:01,117
Okay, that's six-one.

528
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,055
Your Zen approach
is really workin'.

529
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:07,323
Don't be fooled now. First he gets
inside your head, then it's all action.

530
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:12,066
Ow! Ow! Oh!

531
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:14,500
&&Give the past the slip &&

532
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,870
Ooh! Nice stop, Joe.

533
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:22,877
- You must have balls of steel.
- [Clinking Sound]

534
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:27,743
&&Now whip it
into shape &&

535
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:29,647
&&Shape it up &&

536
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:32,516
&&Get straight
Go forward &&

537
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:35,421
&&It's not too late
to whip it &&

538
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,982
&& Whip it good &&

539
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:45,259
Looks like you need some
work on your forehand.

540
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:50,067
But I do have that "balls of steel"
thing goin' on, right?

541
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:52,197
Scheffer,
you are one funny guy.

542
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:55,266
You think that's funny? Wait till
they bill us for that display case.

543
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:58,177
- [Everyone Laughing]
- Come on, let's play.

544
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:02,716
&&I say whip it &&

545
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:05,753
&& Whip it good &&

546
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:11,952
- They're killin' us.
-Joe, game point. Let's do this.

547
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:35,313
Yeah!

548
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:38,410
Did you see that?

549
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:46,784
- Great shot!
- That was amazing! Good save.

550
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:48,796
We gotta do this again.

551
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:06,307
- [Cade] Abby Manheim.
- Yeah.

552
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:09,350
- I'll be seein' you Friday night.
- Friday night?

553
00:39:09,418 --> 00:39:11,978
Yeah, we're celebrating Abby's
five-year anniversary with the company.

554
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:14,852
A little karaoke thing.
Countin' on you bein' there.

555
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:18,654
- You are?
- You kiddin' me? You're Joe Scheffer.

556
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,198
And finally, how does it feel...

557
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:27,702
to have created one of the most
vibrant theaters in Minnesota?

558
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,465
Suffice it to say,

559
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:34,728
the first time I sawthat
118-year-old curtain go up,

560
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,998
a curtain went up
in my heart.

561
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,336
- Thank you so much.
- Amy, thanks.

562
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:41,341
- Great to meet you.
- Thanks.

563
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:50,378
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Hey.

564
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:54,047
I got a call from Natalie's counselor.
Seems our gifted child...

565
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:56,613
has been hiding her light
under a bushel.

566
00:39:56,691 --> 00:40:00,286
She was asked by the theater club
to write a play, and she declined.

567
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:02,455
What?
Wait, wait.

568
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,624
- Natalie, what's this about?
- It's so nothing.

569
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,464
It's so something.
And you're gonna do it.

570
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,731
- Says who?
- Says me.

571
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:13,899
How was I?

572
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:16,603
[Rick] When you said the curtain
went up in your heart, it was so sexy.

573
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:19,442
- What a line!
- Was I okay?

574
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:23,541
Hey, Rick, do you mind not doin' that
in front of me? Huh?

575
00:40:23,618 --> 00:40:26,917
Callie, could we talk outside?

576
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:30,116
[Callie]
So what is it?

577
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:33,683
Could you please keep Natalie
a little while longer?

578
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:36,697
- Sure.
- Thanks.

579
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:39,063
Hey, have you been
working out?

580
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:44,231
Um, I played squash
with some of the executives at work.

581
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:46,933
Squash at work!

582
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,600
- You?
- Yeah, me.

583
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:50,735
Huh.

584
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:53,110
Bye.

585
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,954
Hmm.

586
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:06,193
I'm ready.
I'm very excited.

587
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,126
I've given it a lot of thought,

588
00:41:08,196 --> 00:41:10,164
and I know exactly what I want
to do to that guy.

589
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,358
New gi?

590
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:14,197
- Yeah.
- Cool.

591
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:18,638
- Okay. I wanna psyche the guy out.
- Okay.

592
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:21,869
- This is like half mental, right?
- Yeah.

593
00:41:21,943 --> 00:41:24,969
So we go with Clint Eastwood.
That stare of his.

594
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:28,110
Okay?

595
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:32,517
- "You talkin' to me?" I won't say that.
- I gotcha, I'm followin' ya.

596
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:36,648
Okay, okay.
Then I cut loose. A lot of moves.

597
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:41,184
You teach me that Crouching
Dragon, Hidden Tiger stuff.

598
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:44,629
I'm sure the run across the buildings
is a bit advanced, but we can get to it.

599
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,293
Then go to the Matrix stuff.
A lot of movement.

600
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:50,394
This stuff's
gotta be unsettling.

601
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:52,804
Then you go into a pose.
Hah!

602
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,967
What do you think?

603
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:57,409
- Well, not good.
- Why not?

604
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:02,041
That's why. Okay?

605
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:05,985
- Okay.
- All right. Let's go.

606
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:08,181
Look!
