00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,511
<i>Episode 23</i>

2
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,595
Baek Dae Gil.

3
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:30,234
Long time no see. Yi In Jwa.

4
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:32,254
Is it your doing?

5
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,345
Enough. Give up now.

6
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,144
Here. Hurry up.

7
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:41,515
You lost most of the supplies
and food for the soldiers.

8
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:48,685
Half of your soldiers are held
back with upset stomachs.

9
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,424
It's almost impossible for you
and your soldiers to advance.

10
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:57,005
No, it's too early to give up. (<i>Yi In Jwa</i>)

11
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,695
<i>Prince Milpung (Yi Tan, Crown
Prince Sohyeon's great-grandson)</i>

12
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:11,885
This is His Highness, Prince Milpung.

13
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,344
Are you Baek Dae Gil?

14
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:20,085
The royal court will commit all
military forces to block the treason.

15
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:27,184
They say the army general will
really lead 50,000 soldiers, right?

16
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,424
The central soldiers from the five
military departments will join forces

17
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:33,704
and gather at Anseong. Isn't that right?

18
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:37,954
You must be feeling anxiously urgent,
because you even planted a spy.

19
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,424
The justification of the Great
Cause is still thriving,

20
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:44,174
and there are still more
than 10,000 soldiers left.

21
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:49,944
Also, 100,000 rising solders from Gyeongsang
Province and Jeolla Province will join us.

22
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,975
So block us to the death.

23
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,594
I'll look forward to it.

24
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:57,974
Please give up.

25
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:01,204
Are you going to send all
these people to their deaths?

26
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:07,674
They are the comrades of the Great Cause who stood
up on their own and volunteered for service.

27
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:09,884
How dare such a bastard like you...

28
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:12,904
Soon, all of them will come to know

29
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:19,364
your true colors, Yi In Jwa, who would
exhaust every means to sit on the throne,

30
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:23,425
and who would sacrifice the
people for his ambition.

31
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:28,454
I'll block you.

32
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:33,675
Without fail, I'll send you
to join your ancestors.

33
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:57,115
<i>Leaving the wounded, women, and
children here, we are advancing.</i>

34
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:03,795
<i>Instead of horses, let the
strong men pull the wagons.</i>

35
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:11,165
<i>Keep sending the pigeon posts to ascertain the situation
and movements in Gyeongsang and Jeolla Province.</i>

36
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:33,714
Dae Gil, I was really worried.

37
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,775
Let's organize quickly.

38
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:42,324
Well... Since others'
eyes are watching me...

39
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,924
I'm thinking of carrying a sword...

40
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:51,035
Gramps, don't think useless
thoughts, help over there.

41
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,594
Is it enough for you alone to wear a sword?

42
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,754
Well! Let's gather here.

43
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:03,494
I'll give you food now.

44
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:05,774
All of you! Grab it and go home!

45
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:08,864
Don't uselessly break your leg or bleed.

46
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,814
Hurry to come here. You people who sink down
on the ground, get up quickly and come here!

47
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:17,334
All of you! Let's gather here! Come here!

48
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:20,274
Boil down these medicinal
herbs and take them.

49
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,695
Hurry and take it before
you become dehydrated.

50
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:26,034
Come here!

51
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,885
Here, some.

52
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,705
Boil them down well and take them.

53
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,655
Here.

54
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,744
Are you going to give
some to your wife too?

55
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,785
Was your part cut off?

56
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,125
Where did you come from?

57
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,135
Dae Gil!

58
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:57,664
The stomach upsets have subsided.

59
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:00,404
Even though we gave out a lot of food,

60
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:03,094
we still have a lot of food left.

61
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,004
It's a relief.

62
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:08,205
Go outside. Everybody is waiting for you.

63
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:14,904
What will happen to us now?
We joined in the treason.

64
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:19,284
I heard the people who joined in
the treason will be beheaded.

65
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:24,494
Since all of you dropped your spears and
swords like this, that won't happen at all.

66
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,034
Is it true?

67
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,154
The King promised

68
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:32,874
to forgive whoever drops
their weapons at any time.

69
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,785
He said it clearly.

70
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:41,224
Therefore, everybody, all of you
have to do is to take the food

71
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,715
and go to your hometowns.

72
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:54,105
Is it true? Did the King really say that?

73
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:03,484
The Army General, his 50,000 soldiers and
5,000 central solders joined together,

74
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:06,855
and passed the Gwacheon area just now.

75
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,324
However, to block Jeong Hee Ryang, Park Pil
Hyeon, and their 100,000 rebel soldiers,

76
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:16,005
our numbers are far from
sufficient, aren't they?

77
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:20,255
If we are not able to block Anseong,

78
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,135
it's a matter of time
before the capital falls.

79
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:26,425
Your Majesty!

80
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,555
It's a message from Mokcheon.

81
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:44,735
Baek Dae Gil broke down
half of the rebel army.

82
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:52,425
Of 30,000 Yi In Jwa's soldiers, he reorganized
barely half of them and advanced to Anseong.

83
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:57,154
Although his army has been cut in half,

84
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:02,205
if we miss the chance, in the
end we will cede Anseong.

85
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:09,495
Since the central army
also arrives in two days,

86
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,915
we can't waste a moment.

87
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,274
I'll go myself.

88
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:20,584
But, Your Majesty. If you go there
yourself, it's too dangerous...

89
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,814
When the bastards are close at hand,

90
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:27,595
do you mean that after everything, I should
just watch and give them the palace in the end?

91
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:34,024
Each moment is urgent, so
everybody hurry to get ready.

92
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:36,645
Yes. Your Majesty.

93
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:59,474
We need to send a message to Dae Gil.

94
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,414
You don't need to.

95
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,804
What do you mean we don't need to?

96
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:05,354
Regardless the movements in the capital,

97
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,854
Dae Gil will move as planned.

98
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,545
Planned?

99
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:14,415
Right now, the rebel army
is probably passing here.

100
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:19,684
But the rebel solders who
didn't eat are getting tired.

101
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:24,765
So they will stop by this
town before going to Anseong.

102
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:44,345
My Liege, the soldiers
are getting very tired.

103
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,014
It's hard to advance the date by two
days for a four-day march.<i>(Hwang Jin Gi)</i>

104
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:51,335
Without food and horses,

105
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:57,685
if we force ourselves to keep going like this,
all of us will collapse before we reach Anseong.

106
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:03,295
Let's unpack at the nearby town.

107
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:12,384
<i>It is possible that they
might pillage this village.</i>

108
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:17,585
The rest of you should take the remaining
provisions and head to this village.

109
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,405
It's a letter sent by your master.

110
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:37,895
<i>I found Jeong Hee Ryang's station.</i>

111
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:41,714
<i>I will keep my promise to you.</i>

112
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:46,045
<i>I will make sure that no one gets hurt.</i>
(<i>Kim Che Geon</i>)

113
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:50,705
In terms of the South, there's nothing
we can do but trust in Master.

114
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:56,415
- Then, now what?
- We have to move on to the next part of the plan.

115
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,724
Three-step strategy?

116
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:04,894
First, smuggling the military
horses and provisions,

117
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:07,244
to slow down the attack
of the rebel forces.

118
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,384
Eh, do you think that's an easy matter?

119
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,824
There rebel forces have a weakness.

120
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:16,254
Coming across the eight provinces, they haven't been
together long, so they do not know each other's faces.

121
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:21,004
I just received notice. It
seems they were successful.

122
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:22,985
Are you serious?

123
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,914
Let's have just a bit more strength.

124
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:37,015
We are almost there.

125
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,444
<i>It seems around half the
soldiers have fallen away.</i>

126
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:47,244
Then what's the second part of the plan?

127
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:52,544
It's trampling on the boosted confidence the rebel
forces acquired after winning Cheongju City.

128
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,264
"Yi In Jwa's rebellion has failed."

129
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,654
We will spread this rumor.

130
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:01,225
Wow, that's spectacularly good.

131
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,054
Since the truth of rumors
cannot be verified,

132
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:08,014
those who sought to join the rebel forces,

133
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:11,545
can't help but be very careful.

134
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:22,284
How is it that there are
no soldiers in sight?

135
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,904
Hmmm.

136
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:27,124
A rumor is circulating at the marketplace

137
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,175
that Great Commander Yi In Jwa
has been defeated at Anseong.

138
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:37,295
How could you be so dense? (<i>Park Pil Hyeon</i>)

139
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,714
You wouldn't...

140
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:44,054
believe that baseless rumor?

141
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:49,035
It's unbelievable, but I
can't dismiss it either.

142
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,964
I am sorry that I cannot be of help to you.

143
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:55,875
How about we say that our promise never...

144
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:59,054
What are you doing?

145
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:03,594
If you decide to withdraw from the situation in
this manner, it looks like you'll betray me,

146
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:05,294
so I can't send you away.

147
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,394
You bastard...

148
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,994
Is a traitor in the end a traitor?

149
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,884
Arrest these bastards this instant!

150
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,845
Yes!

151
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,155
Stop them!

152
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:27,475
Did you have them concealed?

153
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:32,534
On general principle, I
tend not to trust those

154
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:35,125
who receive their pay from the government.

155
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,745
Let's observe for a bit longer.

156
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:45,175
Dae Gil.

157
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:49,035
It appears the forces of five military
departments have left the palace.

158
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,505
<i>I'll give you five days.</i>

159
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:02,124
<i>If there is no news even
after five days have passed,</i>

160
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,204
<i>the central army will be mobilized.</i>

161
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:08,094
Grandfather, the situation
has become urgent.

162
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:11,474
I'll move first, so you take
care of the remaining people.

163
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,234
Where are you going alone?

164
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:17,234
To Anseong. Before something happens,

165
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,815
I must meet the King.

166
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:40,254
My Liege, we've already gone
half a day without food.

167
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,004
At this rate, we'll...

168
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,894
Everyone gather up the
last bit of your strength.

169
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,634
According to our news from the Yeongnam (current Gyeongsang
Province) and Honam (current Jeolla Province) regions,

170
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:51,355
two days from now. In two days' time,

171
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:57,275
the 100,000 troops who are marching
for us will join us at Anseong.

172
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:03,195
We will complete the Cause
we have been working for.

173
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:08,064
I'm feeling hungry

174
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:10,414
and I don't have any strength.

175
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:12,734
Look, My Liege.

176
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:17,435
Two days? I don't think we'll
last more than half a day.

177
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:22,834
Look! Isn't that something edible?

178
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:24,094
What is that?

179
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,504
<i>Let go.</i>

180
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:28,024
Let's share it.

181
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,764
Oh, radish stems? Give it here. Oh my,
oh my. None of us have been able to eat.

182
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:33,274
Give it here. Give it up!

183
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:36,964
It's mine! Let go!

184
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:40,265
Pick 20 good soldiers.

185
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,565
What are you guys doing?
Why aren't you hurrying?

186
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,234
My Liege.

187
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:02,705
Don't you think it's wrong of us to
pillage the people's provisions?

188
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:08,375
It is only the bare minimum that
is needed on our march to Anseong.

189
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:13,905
Are you suggesting we give up the
Great Cause over a few sacks of rice?

190
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,294
Have them moved.

191
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:23,474
Look here.

192
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,475
Who did it?

193
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,624
You bastards! You can't!

194
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,664
Do you know what this rice means to us?

195
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:33,655
Aigoo, aigoo, Elder, are you okay?

196
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,275
Elder...

197
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,885
You bastards, deserving of death!

198
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:39,294
You have nothing to take so you
take from lowborn tenant farmers?

199
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,905
This a**. Hey, you piece of...

200
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,454
If you're going to take the provisions
here, take our heads first!

201
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:52,344
I'm telling you, kill
us first then take it!

202
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,024
Because even if we must die, we will never
give it up! Try to have it your way then!

203
00:16:56,025 --> 00:17:00,165
That's right!

204
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,565
Then, I have no other choice.

205
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:13,504
You lock them up inside there,

206
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,605
and the others move the rice.

207
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,724
What are you doing now?!

208
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:25,314
From now on, whoever blocks or
prevents me from getting to Anseong,

209
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:28,624
I will mercilessly cut their hand off.

210
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,904
What... What did you say?!

211
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:32,304
Whoever that may be.

212
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:35,334
What?! Then are you saying you want a go?!

213
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:36,634
Are you saying you want to fight?

214
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:40,405
What is your reason for
imprisoning all these people!?

215
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:45,765
It is a sacrifice for the Great Cause.
Just know it as that.

216
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:01,795
Are you crazy?!

217
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,544
I will surely make a prosperous
country and raise a strong army

218
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,235
that will befit their holy sacrifice.

219
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:15,445
Watching innocent people
die, I can't do that!

220
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,354
Are you planning on
ruining the Great Cause?

221
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:23,445
Do you really not know it is all
sacrifice required for salvation?

222
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:38,675
<i>Jukju Mountain Fortress</i>

223
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,214
How many soldiers have gathered in all?

224
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:00,234
Though they number 35,000 as of now,

225
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:04,425
20,000 more from Suwon and
Yongin will soon join us.

226
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,954
Approximately where are the rebel forces?

227
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:15,134
They have not yet reached Anseong.

228
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:18,094
According to the recon troops, a
fellow by the name of Baek Dae Gil

229
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:21,094
has stolen Yi In Jwa's war
horses and provisions.

230
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:26,655
We hear that rumors are circulating in Jeolla Province
that Yi In Jwa failed to incite the soldiers.

231
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,945
It must be the doing of this
fellow called, Baek Dae Gil.

232
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:39,264
<i>Is there a reason that you are so
confident that you will block Yi In Jwa?</i>

233
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,674
<i>I am asking if you have a plan.</i>

234
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:46,374
<i>Going after his weaknesses,
I will slow down his march</i>

235
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,285
<i>and cut his numbers in half.</i>

236
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,224
Second,

237
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,804
what is scarier than a sword is

238
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,834
a rumor.

239
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:58,424
Rumor?

240
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,124
Yes, Your Majesty.

241
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:04,205
Using rumors, we will cut off
Yi In Jwa's arms and legs.

242
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,455
<i>Then what's the plan after that?</i>

243
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,485
<i>The third plan is...</i>

244
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:17,424
There will be 100,000 rebel solders coming up
from Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province.

245
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,825
If we fail, we are done for.

246
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:30,045
- Aigoo.
- Have some strength.

247
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,575
<i>Hwang Jin Gi</i>

248
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:40,865
You all must be exhausted,

249
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:43,934
but just have a bit more strength.
(<i>Yi In Jwa</i>)

250
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:46,635
They look terrible.

251
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,714
How about <i>(Prince Milpung, Yi Tan,
Crown Prince Sohyeon's great-grandson)</i>

252
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,434
quitting around this time?

253
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:59,284
Why are you saying such weak words?

254
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:01,704
Commander-in-Chief,

255
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:05,175
This is not the kind of
world that I imagined.

256
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,695
I heard you looted.

257
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:16,354
It was a choice that could not be avoided.

258
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,464
That choice...

259
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:21,155
Do you think that it was right?

260
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,025
Follow me.

261
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:40,225
Nobody touched the food.

262
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:44,524
They are commoners before
they are soldiers.

263
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:48,794
To make the country prosperous and
create a country for the people,

264
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:51,424
they threw themselves into
this matter with enthusiasm.

265
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:55,194
How could they eat this looted food?

266
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:59,395
It's not looted, it's sacrificed.

267
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:03,734
If the people are sacrificed
for me to sit on the throne,

268
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:06,414
what meaning would it have?

269
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:09,454
Anseong is just in front
of us, Your Highness.

270
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:15,364
In half a day, the throne
will fall into your hands.

271
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:20,494
Saying those things, you hurriedly ushered
all those commoners here, didn't you?

272
00:22:20,495 --> 00:22:26,175
In the end, didn't you plunder a
village and even kill people, too?

273
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,064
Why did you do that?

274
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,984
If I happen to starve, I'll starve.

275
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:47,255
But did we say we should take
it away from innocent people?

276
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:52,864
I told you repeatedly not to talk glibly.

277
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:55,204
I

278
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:58,064
Followed His Highness Prince Milpung,

279
00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:00,374
not you, Sir.

280
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,035
What?

281
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:12,414
If you value your own life,

282
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:15,504
be careful with what you say!

283
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:21,445
You... You! How could you, without
even batting an eye, dare to kill...

284
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:25,414
Your Highness,

285
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:29,235
I beg of you to please
believe in me, Yi In Jwa.

286
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:33,974
This lowly subject will deliver the
throne, Your Highness, without fail,

287
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:35,574
into your hands.

288
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:38,415
You did not need to KILL!

289
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:47,545
Bury them in a sunny place.

290
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,885
I want to be alone.

291
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,355
I am sorry.

292
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:42,224
Your Majesty, why didn't
you keep your promise?

293
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:46,114
Didn't you say you would give your
lowly servant five days' time?

294
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:49,374
Today would be the fifth day.

295
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,964
As for you,

296
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:55,625
have you brought Yi In Jwa's head to me?

297
00:25:57,565 --> 00:26:00,935
Of course your achievement is great.

298
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,624
You cut the number of the
rebel forces in half,

299
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:08,134
and smuggled the war horses and
provisions, slowing down the march.

300
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,374
However,

301
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:13,395
your role will only go that far.

302
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:17,464
From now on,

303
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:20,514
I will suppress the rebellion myself.

304
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:25,034
Are you planning on drawing
your sword against the people?

305
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:28,354
These are your subjects, Your Majesty.
They are your children!

306
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:31,624
Since they have given up
on being my subjects,

307
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,495
I will punish their
wrongdoings with the sword.

308
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:39,394
Your Majesty, how do you think that
I, without even once using the sword,

309
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:43,225
was able to cut Yi In
Jwa's supporters in half?

310
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,215
It's faith.

311
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:54,194
<i>Here, take one.</i>

312
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,934
<i>It is having faith in the common people.</i>

313
00:26:55,935 --> 00:26:57,864
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

314
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,365
<i>Take it and live well!</i>

315
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,534
They number as many as 15,000.

316
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,704
That many soldiers have
thrown away their swords.

317
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:10,245
What do you think that signifies?

318
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,924
I can do it.

319
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,234
Without raising a sword or shedding blood,

320
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:22,295
we can stifle this uprising.

321
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:26,355
Soon that bastard will arrive here.

322
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:31,695
If this place falls, then they can reach the Four
Gates of the Capital without shedding any blood.

323
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:35,534
No matter how many government
troops there may be,

324
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:38,744
it will be hard to block them. So I

325
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:43,195
definitely plan on beating an iron
bludgeon right into this place,

326
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:46,744
on the rebellion,

327
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,625
to put it into complete disarray.

328
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,355
Your Majesty!

329
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:58,985
The rebel forces have arrived.

330
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:28,114
In the end, you came here.

331
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:30,014
To Anseong.

332
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:33,994
Is there no news from
Yeongnam and Honam regions?

333
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:36,704
As for Yeongnam, they have
just taken off from Jincheon.

334
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:40,184
We received notice that Honam
just passed Pyeongtaek.

335
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,594
A quarter of a day must
pass for them to arrive.

336
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,814
If the government troops
should attack in the meantime,

337
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:49,155
it will be over.

338
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:52,455
Don't worry.

339
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,234
Inside there,

340
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,305
I have hidden a card.

341
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,865
Look.

342
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,975
Those soldiers...

343
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:14,175
Do they look like my subjects to you?

344
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:19,234
Slaughter the rebel forces.

345
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,035
Your Majesty.

346
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:44,294
Yi In Jwa, Prince Milpung, and all others
who have taken part in the act of treason

347
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:46,124
Do not leave a single one out—!

348
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,424
Step aside!

349
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:49,654
No, Your Majesty, you mustn't!

350
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,534
Do you dare? Go against me?

351
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:54,044
They are your subjects.

352
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:55,304
They are the enemy.

353
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:56,764
Please bestow your mercy upon them.

354
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:59,234
They are people who do
not know about kindness,

355
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:01,144
so I will pass judgment through the sword.

356
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:03,634
As for me.

357
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,524
Will you throw me away too?

358
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:08,824
If you are going to ally with the enemy,

359
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:11,054
I will gladly cut your neck.

360
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:12,315
Your Majesty.

361
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:17,914
I have promised His Majesty, the former King,
that I will surely protect Your Majesty.

362
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:22,654
However, that oath! From
this moment forward,

363
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,255
I cannot keep it.

364
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,385
What are you doing?

365
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:56,675
You, bastard, really!

366
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:08,824
King!

367
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,455
Now, die!

368
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,034
What did you say? Still left there?

369
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:21,774
Since the royal court has become rotten as possible,
wouldn't it be even stranger if no one left there?

370
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:26,315
Right after the Dowager Queen joined me,

371
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:31,785
the commanders from Su Eo Defense Department and Fireworks
Military Department turned their backs on the King.

372
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:36,964
Since the foolish King came this far,

373
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:41,855
after all, it looks like he is
rushing to end his life soon.

374
00:31:55,595 --> 00:32:00,355
Finally, the King is dead!

375
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:20,014
Soon, the fortress gate will open! Our
great dream we have held will come true!

376
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:27,265
Now, we are going to advance
on the capital this way!

377
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:30,805
- Everybody! Are you ready?
- Yes!

378
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:40,205
Your Highness! You go in first.

379
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:45,345
Advance!

380
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:26,395
Baek Dae Gil.

381
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:32,504
Retreat!

382
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,525
Retreat!

383
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:05,524
You! From now on, you are not
the insurgents any more.

384
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:10,144
That fellow Yi In Jwa doesn't
have the Great Cause!

385
00:35:10,145 --> 00:35:14,785
He only has his ugly self-interest.

386
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:22,475
Your Highness. We're waiting for you.

387
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:40,375
<i>Were you looking for me?</i>

388
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:51,095
<i>I asked what your last, third strategy is.</i>

389
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:55,175
<i>If the rebel army from Honam region and
Yeongnam region are Yi In Jwa's two arms,</i>

390
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:58,975
<i>the sword in Yi In Jwa's
hand is Prince Milpung.</i>

391
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:03,105
<i>The dagger that he holds to his chest
is the spies that hide in the palace.</i>

392
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:08,275
<i>Prince Milpung and the remnants from
the military officials faction...</i>

393
00:36:09,695 --> 00:36:12,124
<i>How do you plan to cut off those two?</i>

394
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:17,354
<i>I'll let the rebel army led by
Prince Milpung march in here.</i>

395
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:21,305
<i>You're going to set a trap by
using Prince Milpung as a bait?</i>

396
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:28,244
<i>How can you reveal the remnants from
the military officials faction?</i>

397
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:34,925
<i>I... will... point the knife
at Your Majesty's neck.</i>

398
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,065
<i>I never thought it possible!</i>

399
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:54,085
<i>As many as two of them!</i>

400
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:59,845
<i>I can't believe this even with my two eyes!</i>

401
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,875
Throw away your weapons!

402
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:40,905
His Majesty promised to let all
of those who surrender live!

403
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:04,515
Before my mind changes,
lay down your swords!

404
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,644
Don't be afraid!

405
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:17,715
Soon the rebellion will be over and all of you
will be able to go back to your hometowns.

406
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,334
You saved 7,000 people again.

407
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:35,214
However, your role only goes this far.

408
00:38:35,215 --> 00:38:39,214
I'll punish the rest.

409
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:39,895
Your Majesty.

410
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:46,775
Prince Milpung, I'll punish you
after suppressing the rebellion.

411
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:55,615
Your Majesty!

412
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:02,154
Your Majesty, please put your sword down.

413
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:06,344
Soon, 100,000 insurgents will gather here.

414
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:11,914
If we miss this chance, from here to the capital it's
an ownerless (deserted) mountain, so we'll be finished.

415
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:19,724
If we don't attack first, the capital,
following Anseong, will fall as well.

416
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:23,575
I'll make sure to succeed
with the second strategy.

417
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:31,974
Did you receive a message?

418
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:38,375
Did you confirm that they blocked Park
Pil Hyeon and killed Jeong Hee Ryang?

419
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:45,285
Tonight is the last night.

420
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,665
We set up a rough camp.

421
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:08,345
Prince Milpung rejected the
throne so simply offered to him.

422
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:13,984
My Liege, it's hard this way.

423
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:18,935
Already not enough when the number was cut in
half, our number has been cut in half again.

424
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,795
Gather the leader-level soldiers.

425
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:27,595
I have something to say.

426
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:34,914
Your Majesty, please reconsider it again.

427
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,904
What can you gain with any sacrifice?

428
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:41,744
How can you force the people
to sacrifice themselves?

429
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:46,694
After subduing the rebellion,
I'll ask for forgiveness.

430
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,795
I will arrange their funerals and continue
to care for them generation upon generation.

431
00:40:52,205 --> 00:40:55,445
Did you say I'm forcing their sacrifice?

432
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:58,735
I also

433
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:03,796
have made up my mind to suffer the
disgrace of being called a tyrant.

434
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,055
Your Majesty!

435
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:15,004
- Why are they doing this to us?
- We just stand here for a moment?

436
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:18,974
- Here!
- Do we all stand here?

437
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:24,324
- What do we do with this?
- Do we stand here?

438
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:26,634
Do you mean they all die?

439
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:30,135
We still have more than 8,000 soldiers.

440
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:36,824
If we resist and endure, Park Pil Hyeon and
Jeong Hee Ryang's big army will join us.

441
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:40,144
The Central Army is five
times bigger than ours.

442
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:42,195
Are you saying that because you don't know?

443
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:47,194
My Liege, this is not it.
I'm telling you it's not.

444
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:49,584
This far!

445
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:52,535
Do you know how we came this far?

446
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:55,974
The victory is in front of our noses.

447
00:41:55,975 --> 00:42:02,845
Did you forget the thousands or tens of
thousand of comrades who were sacrificed?

448
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:09,485
Tonight,

449
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:13,495
there will be a surprise attack.

450
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:19,124
Tonight,

451
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:22,585
I'll conduct a surprise attack myself.

452
00:42:47,915 --> 00:42:51,595
The royal troops attacked us.

453
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:57,215
Finally...

454
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:25,184
Are you ready?

455
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,555
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:29,925
Attack!

457
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:29,265
Please halt!

458
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:41,334
Your Majesty, please halt!

459
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:43,175
It's already too late.

460
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:48,104
Those standing over there
are only a shield.

461
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:51,035
They are traitors here
with traitorous minds.

462
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:56,915
Wipe them out, to the last man!

463
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:21,375
Fire!

464
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:09,034
Aigoo! My son!

465
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:12,325
Wake up! Open your eyes!

466
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:25,095
Come to your senses!

467
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:37,375
Stop!

468
00:46:38,185 --> 00:46:40,495
Please stop!

469
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:45,444
Look at it clearly with those eyes.

470
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:51,124
Is this really... Is this truly
the Great Cause you wanted?

471
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:54,215
Where is the Great Cause
without a sacrifice?

472
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,834
Regroup

473
00:46:57,835 --> 00:47:00,435
and block the royal army!

474
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:16,755
Aim!

475
00:47:29,715 --> 00:47:31,755
Your Majesty!

476
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:40,805
Halt! Halt! Halt!

477
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:50,485
Don't shoot! Don't do this!

478
00:47:51,465 --> 00:47:53,984
Please save them!

479
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:56,335
Cease fire!

480
00:48:04,785 --> 00:48:07,085
Seol Im!

481
00:48:13,995 --> 00:48:18,815
Your Majesty, please trust me.

482
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:23,635
<i>Though your intention is admirable,</i>

483
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:28,874
<i>I don't intend to watch the insurgents
who joined the rebels at all.</i>

484
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:32,934
<i>Then I'll show you</i>

485
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:36,964
<i>whether they are traitors
or innocent people.</i>

486
00:48:36,965 --> 00:48:38,994
<i>What?</i>

487
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:41,795
<i>Please watch them.</i>

488
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:49,345
This humble subject will show you.

489
00:48:58,055 --> 00:49:00,435
Whole army!

490
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:04,405
Halt the attack!

491
00:49:54,395 --> 00:49:59,064
Baek Dae Gil, it's still not over.

492
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,045
You are finished now.

493
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:06,945
However... you still choose.

494
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10,665
The people's lives

495
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:14,765
all depend on your choice.

496
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:25,654
If I held my life dear, I
wouldn't have even started.

497
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:33,075
I, Yi In Jwa, with those around me,
will bury my bones in this place.

498
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:39,245
I will... ally myself with you.

499
00:50:42,595 --> 00:50:46,914
Having come now, you will ally with me,

500
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:49,294
you Baek Dae Gil, will do so?

501
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:53,464
All the commoners who followed
you have fallen away,

502
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:56,504
and even Prince Milpung has
turned his back on you.

503
00:50:56,505 --> 00:51:00,564
Now you don't even have a
reason to take over the throne.

504
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:02,495
So?

505
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:06,785
I will pledge against my own life

506
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:12,774
that if you prove that
you're right, I'll do it.

507
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:18,624
Proof? How do we go about proving it?

508
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,995
Leave it to the heavens.

509
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,625
What did you say?

510
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:31,065
Your Majesty. It's not a situation
where we can just wait and see.

511
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:33,994
Your Majesty.

512
00:51:33,995 --> 00:51:35,995
Wait.

513
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:52,815
Do you remember? This coin?

514
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:02,184
<i>For this mere coin, I wagered my life</i>

515
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:05,005
<i>and I was able to protect it too.</i>

516
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:11,815
This brass coin changed my life.

517
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:20,735
So I'm saying your fate and mine—this country
Joseon's fate—I'll wager on this round.

518
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,675
Sure.

519
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:34,794
I will.

520
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:37,344
Let's make this one thing clear.

521
00:52:37,345 --> 00:52:40,234
Promise in front of all
the people standing here

522
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:42,325
that if I win,

523
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:46,335
you'll cleanly give up.

524
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:51,174
If by chance you win,

525
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:54,205
I'll give up the Great Cause.

526
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:24,175
Choose.

527
00:53:26,145 --> 00:53:30,645
I choose heads.

528
00:53:31,495 --> 00:53:34,184
Then I'll choose tails.

529
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:36,385
I'm curious.

530
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:45,624
Whether heaven will select
you or me, Yi In Jwa.

531
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:52,015
You know what? If it's not
certain I don't place a bet.

532
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:16,715
As you promised, give up everything
and docilely accept being tied up.

533
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:33,264
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm
going to be able to keep my promise.

534
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,824
Yi In Jwa.

535
00:54:35,825 --> 00:54:43,825
After this night passes, the troops
from Yeongnam and Honam will join us.

536
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:51,204
Would 100,000 troops be unable to cross
that measly Jukju Mountain Fortress?

537
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,835
I knew it would be this way.

538
00:54:55,595 --> 00:55:00,595
Jeong Hee Ryang and Park Pil
Hyeon are already finished.

539
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,464
What are you talking about?

540
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:09,855
It's already over, I said.

541
00:55:24,765 --> 00:55:29,635
Honam's Park Pil Hyeon's
hands are already bound.

542
00:55:36,685 --> 00:55:41,495
From the looks of it, you're not men
who've only held hoes in your hands.

543
00:55:43,205 --> 00:55:46,595
Same with Yeongnam's Jeong Hee Ryang.

544
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:53,445
I received word from them that
they will surely be arriving soon.

545
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,874
Did you by chance...

546
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,455
Do you think I only stood in their way?

547
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:20,455
When you enter the afterworld,
sincerely repent your wrongdoings.

548
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:28,545
Then... Even Park Pil Hyeon?

549
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:45,964
That bastard Yi In Jwa, sprays
blood everywhere he goes.

550
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:49,304
A Great Cause that kills the people.

551
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,974
I guess that's the Great Cause
that you keep bringing up.

552
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:57,975
It's not a name that any
dog like you can bring up.

553
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:06,065
I'll be sure to see whether your mouth will
still be that lively after you lose your head.

554
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,775
Then I leave the aftermath to you.

555
00:57:22,245 --> 00:57:27,014
There are no reinforcements.
So why don't you give up now?

556
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:31,234
Yi In Jwa, your selfish ambition is over.

557
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:33,415
What did you say?

558
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:39,115
What are you doing, not
tying this rascal up?

559
00:57:53,915 --> 00:57:55,905
Warrior Hwang.

560
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:16,384
What are you doing?

561
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:19,674
You said it yourself:

562
00:58:19,675 --> 00:58:22,074
"A country for the people,"

563
00:58:22,075 --> 00:58:25,304
and that you would establish a King
who would look after his people.

564
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:30,904
But not only were you unable to even
fill the stomachs of the hungry people,

565
00:58:30,905 --> 00:58:36,885
you made the flesh of the
people into cannon fodder!

566
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:40,835
I contemplated it a lot.

567
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:49,014
Shall I let you live, or
shall I die with you?

568
00:58:49,015 --> 00:58:53,745
Still, since you were a
nobleman I served as my master,

569
00:58:54,685 --> 00:58:59,305
shouldn't I be the one to send you off?

570
00:59:01,385 --> 00:59:04,595
Let's not be shameful towards each other.

571
00:59:07,705 --> 00:59:09,775
You can't!

572
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:18,965
This fellow's life is the people's.
The time is not now.

573
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:28,524
Throw down your hoes and kneel.

574
00:59:28,525 --> 00:59:31,275
All of you, lay down your weapons.

575
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,565
- Arrest him.
- Yes, Sir!

576
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:55,375
Yi In Jwa. It's over now.

577
00:59:56,565 --> 00:59:59,405
You bastard, Baek Dae Gil.

<i>Today I have come to kill you.</i>
