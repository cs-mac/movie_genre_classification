1
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:43,491
Good morning Tanya.
-Hello.

2
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,919
I'm Connor Mead. 
You look ravishing.!

3
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,199
Oh well, thank you.

4
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,444
Stand here please.

5
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:50,379
Oh wow!!!

6
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,889
Let's get started. Get rid of the green screen.

7
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:59,579
Let's cosy up this key light.
- Excuse me. What are you doing?

8
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:04,231
And also keep the set on cue just
in case. Can I have the um...

9
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,538
Apples.
- This is my wardrobe.

10
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:10,208
Just the one. Ode and ode to Billy Tell.

11
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:13,680
I just want to let you know
that I'm a huge fan.

12
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,046
Oh, likewise.

13
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:18,552
I'm not 12 years old and tonedeaf. I
don't like your music but I really...

14
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,152
...dig your look.

15
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,689
Hey can we come in here and
strengthen up these eyebrows a touch?

16
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,491
Stay right there. Just stay right there.

17
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:27,074
So uh... this is it?

18
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:29,622
This is the picture?

19
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm half naked with an apple on my head.

20
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,332
Yes, you are.

21
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,671
This is the cover of Vanity Fair
from the great Connor Mead?

22
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,271
Oh not quite.

23
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:43,643
I'd like to introduce you to Keiko
Tatsumi, she's a Japanese archery...

24
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:45,941
...champion, she's gonna be
helping us out today.

25
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:49,878
You have nothing to fear.
She's placed 6th in Beijing.

26
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:53,002
Are you joking?

27
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:55,021
Is he joking?

28
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,094
Somebody tell me his joking.

29
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,127
Don't move.

30
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:04,323
Keiko, on my count.

31
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,192
She didn't even move.

32
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,664
Just listen to my music.

33
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:20,013
I am more than my look.

34
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:21,413
I am.

35
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,482
Sweetie, you are already gorgeous.

36
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:26,152
Why do you need to be
good at two things, huh?

37
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:28,052
Connor.

38
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,156
Now?

39
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:33,727
I'm juggling three of your parties
on i-chat.

40
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,794
She knock?
- Sorry.

41
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,064
We need to make sure you're on
the road by two.

42
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,030
Why?

43
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,101
Your brother's wedding in Newport.

44
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,968
That's today?

45
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,071
Gonna have some dinner tonight cause
your Uncle Wayne ordered steak.

46
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,631
Oh God, I got to get up there.

47
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:51,912
And I have Kiki, Charlece and Nadja
on your i-hand. They keep calling.

48
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,713
Nadja. Remind me who Nadja is again.

49
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,313
Nadja was dinner Friday night.

50
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:57,967
Right. Very pretty girl. Didn't say much.

51
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,587
She's Romanian, barely speaks English.

52
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:01,953
Oh, that explains it.

53
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,858
Scan these to Mark right away and I am
a touch busy so if you could take...

54
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,025
...the other calls for me
I'd appreciate it.

55
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,564
Nope. No way. I'm not breaking up
with girls for you Connor. That's...

56
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,766
...where I draw the line.
I believe in karma.

57
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,063
OK.

58
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,247
Conference it.

59
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:17,794
Conference them?

60
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,434
Oh no, you wouldn't.

61
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:20,830
Oh yes, I would.

62
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,178
They're conferenced. Click here
to disconnect.

63
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,545
Hullo ladies, it's Connor Mead.
- Hullo.

64
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,016
Is there anyone else on the line?

65
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:34,888
Listen, I'm sincerely pressed for time
right now, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

66
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:37,550
...have to do this in bulk.

67
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:40,425
It's not gonna work out for us.

68
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,394
What?
- Wait, wait, tell me you're not...

69
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:46,533
...breaking up with me on a conference
call. I thought things were going great.

70
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:49,803
You are women hatred. Dominic hates woman.

71
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:52,840
No, no, no, I love woman. I mean women.

72
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,807
I love all women. That's the problem here.

73
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:59,212
No, the problem is you date a girl
for two weeks, get her to fall in...

74
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,078
...love with you.

75
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:05,107
You take the love and you horde
it like a remiser.

76
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:07,921
...anyone who's trying to
have fun anymore.

77
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,287
I like to have fun.

78
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:12,490
Then don't listen to these ladies.
They're crazy.

79
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,061
Connor, we can still hear you when
you cover the camera you know.

80
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,360
Oh, right.
- You are amazingly retarded.

81
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:22,769
Ladies, sounds like you have an
awful lot to discuss, OK? So I'm gonna...

82
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:26,304
...jump off, but feel free to
keep talking, OK?

83
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,245
Kiki, Nadja, Charlece, I had an amazing
time with each one of you.

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,543
I wish you all the best.

85
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,407
You really are as bad as they say.

86
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:43,087
Oh, Nadia, I am just a little bit worse.

87
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,825
Of course you'd never treat
me that way, right?

88
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,159
No, I just did that for you.

89
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:50,526
Leaving my plate for the main course.

90
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,516
You're the biggest jerk ever.

91
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,044
But you're so famous for it.

92
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,503
No really, why am I doing this?

93
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:01,775
That usually has something
to do with your father.

94
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,378
Oh please, I've never even met my father.

95
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,812
Well, come to papa.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,992
OK, here we go.

97
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:09,509
So we'll have gone like plaque words.
So at 15:29, I will say you may...

98
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,142
...kiss the bride.

99
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,338
Oh, we should practice that, shouldn't we?

100
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:15,631
Oh God.

101
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,781
Paulie.

102
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,647
Connor. Go around.

103
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,084
He came.

104
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,889
He came.

105
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:25,652
What's wrong?

106
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,597
He can't be that bad, right?

107
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:31,963
No.

108
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,989
Jenny, Susan...
- It's alright.

109
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,864
Hey.

110
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,303
You made it.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,874
Wow, you look great.

112
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,272
Man, look what we did to
Uncle Wayne's karate dojo.

113
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:51,632
I psyched you came. I didn't think you
were going to make through rehearsal.

114
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:55,283
Yeah, now listen I wanted to get here
early, make sure you had time to...

115
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:00,059
You know the one about marriage, love,
looking her in the eye and falling...

116
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:00,725
...in love...

117
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,628
I definitely thought about it.

118
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:02,560
You did?
- Yeah, I did.

119
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,587
Listen, if you're having second thoughts.
Here's the key to my Jag.

120
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,356
You give me the way, I'll bog.

121
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,535
Oh my God, you're serious?

122
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,306
Damn right I'm serious,
I'd do anything for you.

123
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,274
Who's got your back, huh?

124
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,807
Me. It's you and me against
the world, right?

125
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,146
Why is he giving him keys?

126
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:22,364
I think he's giving you a car.

127
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,548
Wow, let me just go check on that.

128
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,752
Connor, we talked about this.

129
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,821
I want to get married. I love Sandra.

130
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,592
You say that now.
- Are you OK guys? Because we're still...

131
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:34,425
...you know rehearsing.

132
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,297
Jenny Perotti.
- Connor Mead.

133
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,499
I'll be damned.

134
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,631
It's probably true.

135
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,101
The bride's unsupervised.
- I'm on it.

136
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:44,537
Hey, we're gonna talk about this, huh?

137
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:46,528
Been talking about what?

138
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,201
Options.
- Options.

139
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,112
Listen to me Connor, this is the biggest
weekend in Sandy's life. If you...

140
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:56,383
...do anything to detract her from her
wedding, I will sneak into your...

141
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:59,619
...room in the middle of the night and
cut off your favourite appendage.

142
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:01,419
Our first party sounds nice.

143
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,389
I can make it look like an accident
honey. Don't push me.

144
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:08,761
Just try to be supportive. Normal.
Just not a train wreck for once.

145
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:10,163
I'll be on my best behaviour.

146
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,062
That's what worries me.

147
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,199
What? I'll be supportive. Whatever.

148
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,434
Really?
- Yes.

149
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:15,867
Come on.

150
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:19,554
See, I knew there wouldn't be any
maintenance on you two, huh?

151
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,073
Connor, you remember Sandra?
- Yes, I do. How are you Sandra?

152
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,740
You know it's not too late to
get out of court.

153
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,346
He's joking.

154
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,713
And you know the bridesmaids.

155
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:34,787
Deena, Donna, how are you? And...
- Denice.

156
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,869
Nice to meet you Denice.
- Me too, how are you?

157
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:40,916
My groom's men.
Guys, this is my brother Connor.

158
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:45,832
We've heard the stories man.
- An honour to be serving with you.

159
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,164
And with you.

160
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:49,300
It's nice to meet you. Damn it, I blew it.

161
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:52,972
Sorry to break up the moments guys, but
kind of need you right here where...

162
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:54,963
...I can keep my eyes on you.

163
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,708
Are we ready?

164
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,376
Yes, right, Sarge.

165
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,712
Sarge, what are you married by a cop?

166
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:07,778
Sergeant Major Volkom, United States
Marine Core. I am not a cop.

167
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,029
...game right after the war.

168
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:21,733
The war called Korea. Perhaps
you've heard of it slick.

169
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:25,855
Lost more men than Nam. Didn't get
a wall. We didn't get our movie...

170
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,943
...We got a sitcom with hell and all,
which was all non-stop laughing...

171
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:32,011
...unless you were the one
watching his friends die.

172
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:34,646
The war's over dad. It was a tie.

173
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,673
You know what we should probably try and
keep going on schedule.

174
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:44,622
Bowing the kiss at 1530 hours on my mark.

175
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:49,462
Groom will take brides left forearm.
Rotating 180 degrees orientating...

176
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,195
...north by north west.

177
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,332
And I will annouce you as
husband and wife.

178
00:10:54,367 --> 00:11:03,036
Vow in which... vow in which you will
live happily ever after.

179
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:12,185
I'm surrounded by huggers.

180
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,709
I look cool.

181
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,230
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

182
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:36,437
The world's a lot less strong
without you buddy.

183
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:47,213
Oh no, oh no, no decorations in here, no.

184
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,384
No, no, and yes.

185
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,423
No... No!

186
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,721
What?

187
00:11:58,798 --> 00:11:59,730
Something wrong?

188
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,604
You got over 30 scented
candles in my room.

189
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,104
Oh, the wedding scent is lavender.

190
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,742
The wedding scent? And people
wonder why I'm not married.

191
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:10,742
Not really.

192
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:14,714
And seriously, my Uncle Wayne is
rolling over his grave right now.

193
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,749
Oh come on, Wayne liked a good party.

194
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,283
Party yes, but Wayne no.

195
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:22,989
Back in the days, that man used this
place for a mind numbing, clothing...

196
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:25,156
...optional weekend of orgies.

197
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:29,996
You and Dean Martin slept in that
bathroom, he drank from the day and...

198
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:33,796
...sang the Canadian national anthem...

199
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,335
Now that, that was a party.

200
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,303
Not this.

201
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,302
You know people are taking that
back to where they're not eating...

202
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:46,577
See that's what I said.

203
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,949
The whole asshole in you is just
to get women to sleep with you.

204
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:52,051
Deep down you're a big sweetheart.

205
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:53,885
Oh, look who's got me pegged.

206
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,390
There's the side calender to cover
up the accidental display of affection...

207
00:12:57,425 --> 00:12:58,224
...for Paul.

208
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,851
Hey.

209
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,584
I'm not covering anything up.

210
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:07,859
And I'd be more than happy to take
off the rest of my clothes to prove that.

211
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,464
And there's the cheap sexual innuendo.

212
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,134
Don't worry, your secrets safe with me.

213
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,935
I won't tell anyone you have feelings.

214
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,921
OK, didn't work still nervous.

215
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,493
Ooh, Sandy, what the him?

216
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,561
Dan, married.

217
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:36,794
Kids?

218
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,764
What? They're not really married
unless they have kids.

219
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,926
Heard, understood, acknowledge.

220
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,002
Sandy, come on.

221
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:46,873
Try and save some liquor for
the rest of the guys.

222
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:49,398
Bye.
- Miss you soon my real pledge.

223
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,378
Slow down, slow down.

224
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:00,953
Hey, you keep those coming all night.

225
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,354
Thank you. And now we're off.

226
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:08,494
Excuse me Mr. Mead, I just want to
tell you I'm a huge fan of your work.

227
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:09,227
Thank you.

228
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:11,664
So you're gonna photograph
the bride's wedding?

229
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,800
No, no, I'm not a wedding photographer.

230
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,003
Right, but it's your brother.

231
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:18,202
Right.

232
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:21,400
He's not good at taking pictures
of people with their clothes on.

233
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,174
Look who's funny.

234
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,733
It's not his specialty.

235
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,802
Turn your phone off.

236
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:29,814
Connor Mead.

237
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,215
No, I would not like to cut my cord.

238
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,900
Look, just tell him to go screw himself.

239
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:37,383
Yeah, I said go tell him to screw himself.

240
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,019
...Got to go, got to go.

241
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:44,030
Sit down sweetie.

242
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,463
Oh my God.
- What?

243
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:48,499
What is this?
- A salad.

244
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,695
No, no, no, no, the salad I ordered had fix.

245
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,341
This is a disaster.

246
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:02,148
My friends didn't come over here to
be met with some lacklustre salad...

247
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:03,849
...where are the figs?
Excuse me, where are the figs?

248
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,351
Sweetie...
- OK, I want some figs.

249
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,520
Sweetie, sweetie, hi.

250
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:10,655
Hi, hi.
- Hi.

251
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,095
OK, you're right, you did order figs.
But everyone seems to be loving the...

252
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,620
...salad, right? Anybody missing figs?
- No, no.

253
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,503
Sorry.

254
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:29,308
There she is. Alright. She's back.
- I'm sorry everyone, I just...

255
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:32,539
It's my wedding and I'm not
usually a bitch.

256
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,569
There it is.

257
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:40,686
I just want everything to stay up... I
mean I only planned on getting married...

258
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:43,189
...four or five times tops.

259
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:44,383
Oh sweet.

260
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:48,160
Which reminds me Connor, Sandy and
I wanted to know if you would make...

261
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:49,128
...a toast tomorrow?

262
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,229
What?

263
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,130
Yeah, we'd like that.

264
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:57,203
I know it's not really your thing but
it's kind of a tradition for the best...

265
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:58,421
...man to give a toast.

266
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,570
You could keep it short.

267
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,765
Shoot the bomb, whatever you want.

268
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:02,174
Are you kidding?

269
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,175
Yes.

270
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,047
No, no. No, you're the only family I
got here so I thought you could say...

271
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:08,913
...something.

272
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,883
I don't think this is the best idea
you've ever had Paul.

273
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:12,016
Hey, I'm with Jenny on this one.

274
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,651
I'm sure you could describe a cousin.

275
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:17,423
No. No, no, no, you're my brother, you're
funny, you're articulate, you're...

276
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,122
...smart.

277
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,159
True, true, and true.

278
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:22,126
I'm flattered really.

279
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:24,561
If you're not gonna take pictures,
it's the least you can do.

280
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,399
Who the hell is this guy?

281
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:27,033
Who's that?

282
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:27,665
Jeff.

283
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,138
I'm not toasting anyone tomorrow, OK?

284
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:34,072
I can't toast this.

285
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:36,607
Come on.

286
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,976
This always happens. All scotch, no carbs.

287
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:42,415
Is there a bread basket or... you know
what let's talk about something else.

288
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,749
So, when do you catch your flight?

289
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:47,151
Paulie, you know where I come
out in all of this buddy.

290
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:51,824
To me marriage is an archaic oppresive
institution, it should have been...

291
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:53,991
...abolished years ago.

292
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:58,863
It's magical comfort food for the
weak and the uneducated.

293
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:02,368
Yeah, it makes you feel all warm and
relevant but in the end love leaves...

294
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:05,496
...you weak, dependant and fat.

295
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,574
Yeah, that might not make the best toast.

296
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,241
Are you saying I'm fat?

297
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,244
No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, sweetie...

298
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,412
...he's being funny, I think.

299
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,249
Better hold your next words
real close paco.

300
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:22,521
Believe me, for Paul's sake, I wish
I could believe in all this crap...

301
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,155
...I do.

302
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,824
I also wish I could believe in
the Easter bunny.

303
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,428
The missle shield and strippers
with a heart of gold.

304
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:36,902
Unfortunately, I am condemned to see
the world as it really is and love...

305
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:37,902
...love is a myth.

306
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:42,101
Oh good, I was afraid you were going
to make a really long cynical speech.

307
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,031
Truth hurts baby.

308
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,810
Why don't you go?

309
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,244
Yeah, why don't I do that?

310
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,310
I'm going to take my salad with me.

311
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,918
Some figs would be nice.

312
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,522
This is gonna be tougher than I thought.

313
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,626
You got that right kid.

314
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,238
Uncle Wayne.

315
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,568
Uncle Wayne.

316
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,517
You're dead.

317
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:25,677
Please.

318
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,181
Don't waste your life like I did.

319
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,914
What are you talking about?

320
00:18:56,949 --> 00:19:00,476
You had a great life man. You're a legend.

321
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,313
The money, the parties, the women.

322
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:07,493
The music stops, you lick a few slacks,
none of that stuff matters with...

323
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,193
...the few links.

324
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:15,417
Well, there was this one party, New
Year '68 Philippines, me, Stevie...

325
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:21,607
...McQueen, 17 stewardess' and a
pile of blow the size of a toaster...

326
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,768
...now that was a good night.

327
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,342
Sounds like a great night.

328
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:29,348
I got a few laughs, I chase some tail,
but trust me Dutch, you don't want...

329
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:30,481
...to end up like me.

330
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:31,682
What are you talking about?

331
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:35,521
No, no, no, I've seen it for the sandman
kid. I've been watching you.

332
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,684
And you are definitely turning
out like me.

333
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:44,192
Frankly who could blame you. But
tonight, tonight things are gonna change.

334
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:50,162
Tonight you're gonna be
visited by three ghosts.

335
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,770
You've got to be kidding me.

336
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:57,610
And you're gonna be forced to feel
things you haven't felt in a long time.

337
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,945
Things like feelings for example.

338
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,295
And remember not matter how much
it hurts, it's all for your own good.

339
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,610
And the stuff that's not for your own
good, it's or my entertainment.

340
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,858
Look, Uncle Wayne...

341
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,025
Where did he go?

342
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,531
I don't believe this happened.

343
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,146
Uh-oh.

344
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,714
Melanie.

345
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:41,420
Melanie where are you?

346
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,953
I need you up here.

347
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:46,151
You are my assistant and
I need assistance.

348
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,021
Blue label and give it weed brother.
Call me.

349
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,146
You feel so real.

350
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:09,732
Well, I am honey.

351
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,248
A hundred percent.

352
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:16,084
I'm not sure what you heard about me,
but I usually like drink first.

353
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,623
You and I thought you were.

354
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:22,944
Vonda Volkom, mother of the bride.

355
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,231
Connor Mead. Brother of the groom.

356
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:29,689
Please sit, Vonda Volkom.

357
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:31,502
Thank you.

358
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:33,596
Yes ma'am. Champagne for the lady.

359
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,034
Lovely.

360
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,242
So how long have you been divorced?

361
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:38,609
I beg your pardon.

362
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,678
I mean you're ravishing.

363
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:44,205
No married woman your age
keeps her form this fine.

364
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:49,250
I've been divorced eight years now.

365
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:53,190
Sarge and I aren't just talking just yet.

366
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:57,062
It's juvenile and sad.
- Honey you stop right there. It's not...

367
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:57,895
...your fault.

368
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,889
Again marriage is a corrupt
and hateful institution.

369
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:05,762
I've given all of this at another table.

370
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:09,499
I want to ask you something.
When did casual sex become a crime?

371
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:14,179
Really. I mean nowadays being single
means what? You've lost your way...

372
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:16,180
...or something is missing?

373
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:20,985
...every night I swim in a lake of sex.

374
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,854
And they fall asleep in each
others arms spooning.

375
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,692
Connor, spooning is nice.

376
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,362
Yeah, but not as nice as fucking.

377
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,598
You know what the owner of
this place once told me.

378
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:41,367
He said keep it light Dutch.
Keep it light.

379
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:47,272
I never understood why he
called me Dutch but...

380
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:50,513
That's nice.

381
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:52,683
I like that.

382
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:59,391
Listen darling, before we take this to
the next level, are we off limits?

383
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,794
I mean technically we're not
family until tomorrow.

384
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:04,456
I am extremely flattered.

385
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,133
But yes, we are definitely off limits.

386
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:12,433
That's a shame. I bet you know your
way around the bedroom.

387
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,338
You always talk to women like this?

388
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:16,869
Yes.

389
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,844
Does it work?

390
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,106
Yes.

391
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:26,116
Well, while I can't be of service
to you, I am sure that she can.

392
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,886
Blonde, 6 o'clock.

393
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,156
Blue dress, legs up to her chin.

394
00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:32,322
That's the one.

395
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:35,527
She's been eye the whole
time we've been talking.

396
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:37,029
It's been a plesure talking to you.

397
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:38,762
Likewise.

398
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:41,231
You are truly an inspiration.

399
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,233
Hi.
- Just for a second.

400
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,942
Oh, you remember that guy I was
telling you about, Brad.

401
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:55,180
No, no, no, I told you I do not want to
be set up again. I've been through it...

402
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,416
...too many times. Please don't make me.

403
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:59,247
That's Brad.

404
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,614
OK, this is the last time.
How are my teeth?

405
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:06,448
Clear.

406
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,159
Just play it cool. No big deal.

407
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:14,457
Brad. Here's Jenny.

408
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,767
Right, hot single doctor.

409
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:18,196
Hi.

410
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,970
Sandra has been talking
about you non-stop.

411
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,674
Yeah, I already know what kind of car
you drive, where you went to med school...

412
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:23,902
...how many dogs you have...

413
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:29,508
So glad this is not...

414
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,514
Brad loves to run travel inns too.

415
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,148
Do you want to go anywhere else?

416
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:38,380
Yeah, I thought you'd never ask.

417
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:42,294
Bye.
- You guys have a good time, you crazy...

418
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:42,817
...toots.

419
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,120
Hey Connor.
- Hey.

420
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:47,925
How you been?

421
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,599
Well, I'm at a wedding.

422
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,202
I'm seeing ghosts in the john.

423
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:54,265
I've been better.

424
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:58,900
What were you and Sandra's
mom talking so intensely?

425
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:00,335
Casual sex.

426
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:06,285
What's your stand on casual
sex bridesmaid?

427
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,343
On top.

428
00:25:07,586 --> 00:25:09,349
I mean I'm for it.

429
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,284
Speaking of which, I think
I owe you an apology.

430
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:18,025
I've enjoyed the company of all the
other bridesmaids except you.

431
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,661
I mean you must feel terribly left out.

432
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,835
I do hope there's some way
to rectify this injustice.

433
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:32,572
Well, you know what I always say
to think globally, act locally.

434
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:37,473
Listen, before I commence launch codes.

435
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:43,322
Are you the one my brother slept with
because I don't like to cross sword.

436
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:44,789
Wait, what?

437
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,857
Your brother slept with one
of the bridesmaids?

438
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,417
Oh I guess it wasn't you.

439
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:55,534
Alright, from now on, I don't cross
swords... listen, forget I even brought...

440
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:59,422
...it up anyway, why don't you scamper
up to my room, boil some water...

441
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,275
...get the chicken claw out of my
suitcase, do some light stretching and...

442
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,640
...I'll be up in five.

443
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:08,908
Chicken claw, OK.
- Chicken claw.

444
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:16,583
And that's how it's done.

445
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,820
Does it work on guys?

446
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,058
Probably.

447
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,660
Excuse me, do you mind if we
take these seats?

448
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,358
No please.

449
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,397
Hullo there, friend.

450
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,398
Connor Mead, brother of the groom.

451
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,127
This is Brad.

452
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,830
Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

453
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:38,499
Must be the wedding sex they
flew in for Jenny here.

454
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:42,606
And you must be the wedding sex
they brought in for everyone else.

455
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,147
Look, he's getting his little
joust splashed.

456
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,717
He's gotten it ever since he was
a little kid. Adorable.

457
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:53,125
Oh, honey if I was jealous, why am I at
this very moment heading upstairs...

458
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,855
...at my hattrick of bridesmaids.

459
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:01,700
Maybe because you're terrified of being
left alone with your empty hollow...

460
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:03,099
...soul for even a minute.

461
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:05,395
Ooh, you've got a live one here Brad.

462
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:08,830
Look, maybe I'd better go.
- No, Brad, you're staying.

463
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:15,236
Running along Connor, there's a bridesmaid
waiting to be partially satisfied.

464
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:16,106
Absolutely.

465
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:20,273
Brad's pleasure. I hope you enjoy pillow
fights, talking about our feelings...

466
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:23,113
...and sharing massages with
your clothes on.

467
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:24,479
Jenny.

468
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,449
Connor.

469
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:47,676
That's more like it.

470
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:54,881
How is my little sex button mixture of
gin and long haired blue eyed happy...

471
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,922
...meal of a bridesmaid?

472
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:57,581
Hi Connor.

473
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:58,886
Have you missed me?

474
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,055
Who are you?

475
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:02,722
You don't remember?

476
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,474
Allison Vandermeersh?

477
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:19,109
Connor, it's me.

478
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:23,342
Remember it's me. Oh, I could die now.
I'm just kidding. I'm totally kidding.

479
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:24,582
What are you doing here?

480
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,649
Oh, I'm like a ghost now.

481
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,414
Yeah, yeah, the ghost of past.

482
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:34,055
It tickles.

483
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:37,823
Connor.

484
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,867
Don't want to go.

485
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:53,373
We could do this all day dude.

486
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:56,046
You're not real.

487
00:28:56,081 --> 00:29:00,518
You can't be. You're just repressed
memory activated by all the booze...

488
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:03,619
...and the trauma... but you are not real.

489
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,949
Alright well, then miss you.

490
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,521
See you next fall.

491
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,732
Isn't it real enough for you?

492
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,461
What? Be cool.

493
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,459
What are you gonna do?

494
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:22,696
I am going to take you back to all of
your past girlfriends and hopefully...

495
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:25,570
...you and I can figure out how you got
your head so far up your own ass.

496
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:26,672
Ready?

497
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:38,411
Ta-da.

498
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:40,852
Alright, what the hell is going on?

499
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:46,064
We're still at your Uncle Wayne's only
now we're in 1982 which is of course...

500
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,055
...the summer of your first relationship.

501
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,394
Connor.

502
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:57,741
Oh, how cute you were. I want
to squeeze you.

503
00:29:57,943 --> 00:29:59,774
Oh, we knew who she was of course.

504
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:01,607
Jenny Perotti.

505
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:03,311
I win.

506
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:05,249
126 for you, 120 for me.

507
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:06,983
I beat you by 6.
- No way.

508
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:10,845
It's your birthday. I let you win,
it's your gift.

509
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:12,780
Then what's that?

510
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:17,517
Can they see us?

511
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,594
No, we're ghosts.

512
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:26,101
Do you like it?

513
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:27,637
Yeah, it's great.

514
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,173
You're the best Jenny.

515
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,634
Really? What else do you think of me?

516
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,904
I don't know.

517
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,247
You see how young we start.

518
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:46,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, line it up
buddy. Get in there.

519
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:12,410
This doesn't even look like you.

520
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:14,414
You look like a girl.

521
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:17,246
What Connor?

522
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:19,687
Let's wait for your part.

523
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,618
I'm gonna keep it forever.

524
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:25,361
I'm gonna keep it forever.

525
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:26,995
I don't think I said that.

526
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:29,060
Did you edit this?

527
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,228
I'm gonna keep it forever.

528
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:34,097
Are you sure it wasn't my brother?
He always said fruity stuff like that.

529
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,632
I'm gonna keep it forever.

530
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,743
Forever... forever.

531
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:39,835
OK, I get it.

532
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:41,012
I said it.

533
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:42,846
I'm gonna keep it forever.

534
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:45,707
Not as dumb as he looks folks.

535
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,062
Mom and dad.

536
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:06,929
This was the summer before
their car accident.

537
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,367
Look how happy they were.

538
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,987
Uncle Wayne, Paul and Jenny
were all you had left.

539
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:29,421
She knew you before you became you.

540
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,459
Alright.

541
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:37,861
Alright, what's next?

542
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,943
New school, really?

543
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,044
You remember this, right?

544
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,380
Pretty sure I intentionally
brought it down.

545
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,183
I'm sure that we don't have
time for this, do we?

546
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:05,897
So as you and Jenny got older, you
tried to make that super top transition...

547
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:09,355
...from being best friends to maybe
being boyfriend girlfriend.

548
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:11,669
This dance is so lame.
- Totally.

549
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:17,401
I don't why but there's something creepy
about the whole white glove thing.

550
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:23,843
Nice move.

551
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,284
Who's going groove Franklin Middle School.

552
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:34,793
I'm gonna slow it down... guys grab that
special girl and head on out...

553
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:35,817
...to the dance floor.

554
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:43,197
Ask her to dance buddy. She's
asking for it. Ask her.

555
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:44,936
So...

556
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:45,402
Jenny.

557
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:49,341
Oh my God, Jenny. Neil just told Suzie
that Pete Hastings wants to floor...

558
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:50,140
...dance with you.

559
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:52,769
Pete Hastings is totally gorge.

560
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:57,682
No, Pete Hastings is now bald and
doing civil war reenactments on the...

561
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:58,448
...weekends.

562
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:01,518
Yeah, and he's gonna want to make out.

563
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:05,121
Yeah, and he's a ninth grader
so that means tongue.

564
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:08,523
Oh my God, I can't believe
how lucky you are. Pete Hastings.

565
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,803
OK, I guess.
- Yes.

566
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:29,242
That dude used to get boners in
the gym shower. Don't sweat it.

567
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:32,415
Well, at least he didn't choke.

568
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,180
Hey, I didn't choke, alright?
I could close if I wanted to.

569
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,989
I was being a gentleman.

570
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:43,550
I can't breathe.

571
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:53,526
You know what, you don't want to
hit that anyway little man.

572
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:13,658
Hey kid, what's with the water works?

573
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:16,252
Jenny.

574
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:17,595
Pregnant.

575
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,494
No.

576
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:21,359
Crabs?

577
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,999
No.

578
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:25,603
Took her to the coat check room, found
out she had a tin pinned up her chest?

579
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:28,868
Don't worry, happens to all of us.

580
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,802
Wait, what?

581
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:33,945
Nothing, nothing. So what happened?

582
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,614
Jenny kissed Pete Hastings tonight.

583
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,775
Her first kiss.

584
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,719
Now everything is ruined and I don't
even know if we're gonna get married...

585
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:42,552
<i>:::anymore:</i>

586
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:46,921
Trust me kid. You dodged a bullet. You
don't want to be anybody's first kiss...

587
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,359
...or their last.

588
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:53,164
Say what you will, that man
was a visionary.

589
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,688
You know he invented the word Milf.

590
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,235
What am I gonna do? I've
never felt this way before.

591
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,840
I feel like somebody has punched me
straight in the stomach and I feel...

592
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,375
...like I'm gonna throw up.

593
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,172
I hate girls.

594
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,704
That's sissy talk.

595
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,783
Never talk like that in the
Stabbing Wagon.

596
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,056
Uncle Wayne, where are your seatbelts?

597
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:20,024
Again with the sissy talk.

598
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,627
He never wore seatbelts. Never.

599
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:32,437
Look, kid I'm sorry I raised my voice
at you. Being a parent ain't exactly...

600
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:33,768
...my chosen profession, you know.

601
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:40,444
I mean I can't teach you algebra or
camping or even ethics.

602
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:47,951
But when it comes to dames,
I've got a gift.

603
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:49,312
Really?

604
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:56,986
Because I will do anything you say.
I never want to feel like this again.

605
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:58,428
Ever.

606
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:03,730
OK, Dutch. Never again. Hang on.

607
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,542
Are we in a bar?

608
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,807
Think of it like classroom.

609
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:40,803
Hi ya Tommy. Two jacks up please.

610
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,104
Dutch, try that old saddle up for size.

611
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,805
Rule number one, don't look at 'em.

612
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:54,519
Dames, they're like horses.
They spook easy.

613
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,453
Cheers Dutch.

614
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,594
Rule number two, never sorry
to be wingman.

615
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:03,925
Sorry.

616
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:11,160
...if you're actually out chasing tail
tonight, I'd turn your gaff into a funny.

617
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:14,105
Girls, they love to laugh.

618
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,771
Especially at men.

619
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:19,644
Makes them feel more powerful which
in turn makes them feel more comfortable.

620
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,814
Which in turn makes them crawl into
massive errors ofjudgement like...

621
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:27,385
...having sex in with a complete
stranger in a bathroom.

622
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,253
But I'm not even supposed to
talk to strangers.

623
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:33,358
That's good, that's good. No talking
is good. No phone numbers...

624
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,893
...no last names. Hey no first names
if you could swing it.

625
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:39,030
Will somebody please call the...

626
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,130
Quiet, the prophet speaks.

627
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:46,337
See kid, an ugly broad, you might as well
take her behind the shed and one...

628
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:47,470
...broom behind the ear,
that dog won't hunt.

629
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:52,744
But any dude with ajohnson,
because cool come from the inside.

630
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:55,411
God, I miss that man.

631
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:57,213
See, here's a couple of tips.

632
00:38:57,248 --> 00:39:01,602
When you first meet a girl, you give
her two compliments above the neck...

633
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:05,957
...you tell her she's got nice lips, nice
eyes, nice hair, intelligent, her...

634
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:09,425
...moral ethics, whatever crap
comes to your mind.

635
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,998
Then, just when she begins to think
that you're another vanilla nice guy...

636
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:18,764
...she can tool around all night
without getting naked, you insult her...

637
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:23,496
...foot the power of dynamic, and you
let her know you're here to play.

638
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:25,777
Jenny said she doesn't like games.

639
00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:28,211
Forget about that broad.

640
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:30,348
But I thought I was supposed to
get her back.

641
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:30,847
That's why you got to forget about her.

642
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:35,546
If you have feelings for her then
your killing your game.

643
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,591
If there's one thing that you learnt
tonight, it's this the power of a...

644
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:43,856
...relationship lies with whoever
cares less.

645
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:52,168
One day you're gonna wake up with
some chick spooning, you know...

646
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:55,723
...thinking about love and at that
moment, you have got to get up, you do...

647
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:58,768
...not walk, you do not get your
shoes, you run the hell out of there...

648
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:01,779
...because maybe not the next day or
next week but sometime in the future...

649
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:04,907
...you're gonna get crushed again.

650
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,947
Now you don't want to feel
that way, do you?

651
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:14,054
OK, so let's get down to brass text here.

652
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:20,331
Say I wanted to pick up on that ice
cold blonde at 8 o'clock.

653
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:20,763
8 o'clock?

654
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:23,399
How did you even see her?

655
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:26,369
We'll deal with reflective surfaces
another time.

656
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:30,898
Should I get a handful of daisies and go
hi do you want to go to a disco with me?

657
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,544
Uh, no.
- No.

658
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:37,115
No, cause I might as well say I'm
a fag, let's be friends.

659
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,948
So what could be a smart play?

660
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,975
Have some fun with it. What do you think?

661
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:48,826
Maybe you could talk to the
girl next door.

662
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:51,056
Maybe make her feel jealous.

663
00:40:53,898 --> 00:41:01,270
Hand of God kid. I never felt like you
were my son until now.

664
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:08,513
Oh man, I don't know why we didn't have
this conversation years ago huh?

665
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:11,449
That enough for one night! Let's have a break?

666
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:13,246
What about the wain?

667
00:41:13,384 --> 00:41:15,419
You gotta put smaller bag!

668
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:16,716

01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:44,166
You know, for years, I keep trying
to convince myself there's something-

1123
01:13:44,201 --> 01:13:44,932
redeemable in you.

1124
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,101
I'm done here. There isn't.

1125
01:13:47,136 --> 01:13:51,640
I was just trying to get you back
in there, Ok? Instead-

1126
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:52,842
It's you and me against the world,
right?

1127
01:13:52,877 --> 01:13:55,345
You don't wanna be here.

1128
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,813
And nobody wants you here.

1129
01:13:57,848 --> 01:13:59,695
Please go.

1130
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,542
Just please.

1131
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:03,549
Sandy!

1132
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:10,891
I know I've got one more ghost
sleep on my contract.

1133
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:15,297
But right now I'll leave the premises.

1134
01:14:15,332 --> 01:14:17,094
So if you want me, come on.

1135
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:23,337
Of course, I wouldn't mind seeing
my future ghost.

1136
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:27,409
Because that was the ghost that
I'm really looking forward to.

1137
01:14:27,444 --> 01:14:28,137
But whatever.

1138
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:45,994
Whoa!

1139
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:54,002
Are you my future girlfriend?

1140
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:01,203
Would you like to be?

1141
01:15:54,163 --> 01:15:57,690
Oh no, I getting married?

1142
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:09,536
Ok, this girl look-

1143
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:16,815
As a matter of fact,
this may be alright.

1144
01:16:17,486 --> 01:16:18,885
Brad? No.

1145
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:21,989
No...

1146
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:23,957
No!

1147
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:28,119
And now if anyone here know any reason
why these two should not be wed?

1148
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:31,525
I do.
- You better speak now or-

1149
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:32,666
You're suppose to be with me.

1150
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:33,929
No, she's always suppose to
be with me.

1151
01:16:34,236 --> 01:16:37,606
No! Don't you risk this walk!

1152
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:40,006
No! I'm here! I'm here!

1153
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,638
Paulie.

1154
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:23,774
No wedding ring.

1155
01:17:26,322 --> 01:17:27,289
He didn't get married?

1156
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:30,757
Why?

1157
01:17:35,998 --> 01:17:37,590
What did I do?

1158
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:42,531
You don't say much, do you?

1159
01:18:32,688 --> 01:18:35,623
Looks like we're all here.

1160
01:18:36,692 --> 01:18:37,590
Let's begin.

1161
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:43,597
Before we gather here today to
lay the rest of Connor Mead.

1162
01:18:43,832 --> 01:18:47,598
Connor Mead was a great man and
great friend of the church.

1163
01:18:47,903 --> 01:18:49,204
Is that the only person at my funeral?

1164
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:51,866
That's the way it works, Dutch.

1165
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:54,432
Guys like us...

1166
01:18:55,978 --> 01:18:57,880
We don't get a big funeral.

1167
01:18:57,915 --> 01:18:59,472
I didn't expect big...

1168
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:01,444
Uncle Wayne but this is-
this is ridiculous.

1169
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:04,209
Yeah, I don't know how to solve this
for you, Dutch.

1170
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,523
Nobody's really gonna miss you.

1171
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:14,325
Before the burial, would you like to
say a few words about him?

1172
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:31,472
Connor Mead was a lot of things
to a lot of people.

1173
01:19:31,914 --> 01:19:35,315
Not all those things
but to me he was a great brother.

1174
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:43,525
I guess it's just me
against the world now.

1175
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,828
No, it's not, Paul.
No it's not.

1176
01:19:45,863 --> 01:19:47,557
Look, hey.

1177
01:19:47,696 --> 01:19:47,896
It won't have to happen like this.

1178
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:48,762
It's not gonna happen.

1179
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:49,195
There's nothing you can do
about it, Dutch.

1180
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:53,961
You made your bet and you gotta bear
whatever calls into it.

1181
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,672
That's what I keep trying to tell you.

1182
01:19:56,707 --> 01:19:57,738
What can I say?

1183
01:19:57,773 --> 01:20:01,709
Life, you know, is like a-
quick cup of coffee.

1184
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:04,780
You end with a cup and love someone
and love with all you got.

1185
01:20:04,815 --> 01:20:05,337
You never drink it alone.

1186
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,748
No, I wouldn't-

1187
01:20:07,783 --> 01:20:09,545
Sorry, kid. Party's over.

1188
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,308
Ladies, let's take it away.

1189
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:41,548
I'm alive!

1190
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:42,140
Are you there? Young man.

1191
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:43,317
Well what day is it?

1192
01:20:43,352 --> 01:20:44,284
It isn't Christmas?

1193
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:47,182
No, it's Saturday, you moron.

1194
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,421
That's the day of my brother's wedding.

1195
01:20:52,661 --> 01:20:53,491
Alright. I'll just have to think-

1196
01:20:57,466 --> 01:20:58,455
Yes! We're now ready for this hop.

1197
01:21:03,505 --> 01:21:05,374
Hey... Paul.

1198
01:21:05,409 --> 01:21:06,898
Hey.

1199
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:09,273
Did I miss the wedding?

1200
01:21:09,308 --> 01:21:10,270
No. You got your wish.

1201
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:12,807
Sandra call it off.
- What?

1202
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:14,540
Why?
- What are you saying?

1203
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:17,575
The day I took up Donna?

1204
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:18,652
Yeah.
- No...

1205
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:20,678
No, you can split it up.

1206
01:21:21,056 --> 01:21:23,992
Alright. The two of you are meant to
spend the rest of your life together.

1207
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:25,559
You're gonna be miserable without her.
Trust me.

1208
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:27,494
You know, you can be a real
sarcastic prick sometimes.

1209
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:29,391
I'm not being sarcastic, Ok?

1210
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:31,265
So who was taking her?

1211
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,368
Sir is taking her and the bridesmaid
to the airport.

1212
01:21:33,403 --> 01:21:35,097
It's over.

1213
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:38,032
No!

1214
01:21:55,724 --> 01:21:56,850
Sandra!

1215
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:23,077
What are you doing?

1216
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:36,894
No seatbelt!

1217
01:22:42,971 --> 01:22:43,835
Sandra!

1218
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:46,068
Hey!

1219
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:49,137
Sandra you better get to a side.

1220
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:51,510
Is that Connor?

1221
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:55,572
Sandra!

1222
01:23:10,098 --> 01:23:13,795
Oh shit!

1223
01:23:15,937 --> 01:23:16,169
Whoa!

1224
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:16,431
You better kill us right there.

1225
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:18,468
Sandra!
- Get away.

1226
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,767
I'm trying to stop your daughter.

1227
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:23,845
Over my dead body, papo.

1228
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,075
Alright? Relax.

1229
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:30,399
I was real sorry, sir.

1230
01:23:30,434 --> 01:23:31,915
You've just come too far.

1231
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:34,700
Did he just walked us-

1232
01:23:34,735 --> 01:23:35,445
Will you listen to me?

1233
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:37,387
Hey, first off.

1234
01:23:38,627 --> 01:23:41,391
I'm sorry about destroying
your wedding cake.

1235
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:44,197
Going second base with your mother.

1236
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:45,534
Knocking your dad unconscious
and tried it there.

1237
01:23:45,569 --> 01:23:48,401
And basically-
brighten up your wedding.

1238
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,704
Sorry.

1239
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:52,639
But the thing is that I am begging you,

1240
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:56,943
begging you, don't run away, alright?

1241
01:23:56,978 --> 01:23:59,970
You and Paul have something so rare
that's just so powerful.

1242
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:01,783
Don't you get out now.

1243
01:24:01,818 --> 01:24:02,651
Chicken out? He cheated.

1244
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:04,169
You'll get over it.

1245
01:24:04,204 --> 01:24:05,653
It was years ago.

1246
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:09,858
Alright. With one of that
slutty friend of yours.

1247
01:24:09,893 --> 01:24:10,916
Yeah that's true.

1248
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:13,862
A friend who you've never
even mad at.

1249
01:24:13,897 --> 01:24:14,861
And you know why?

1250
01:24:14,896 --> 01:24:15,385
Because you're the one he care.

1251
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,936
You loved Paul so much you forget
at the second you're hurt.

1252
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:21,960
And that's what scares you.

1253
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:25,040
You have no idea how I feel. No idea!
- Yes, I do.

1254
01:24:25,075 --> 01:24:28,203
I've been in your shoes.

1255
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,040
You know what did scare the hell
out of me too?

1256
01:24:32,013 --> 01:24:33,105
What if she hurts me?

1257
01:24:34,015 --> 01:24:35,751
You know, what if she love me?

1258
01:24:35,786 --> 01:24:36,513
What if she died?

1259
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:40,255
Lt'll be the end of me.

1260
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:42,189
So I cut it short.

1261
01:24:42,224 --> 01:24:44,059
Before she ever got it.

1262
01:24:44,094 --> 01:24:45,321
And you know what?

1263
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:47,452
That was the biggest mistake
I have ever made.

1264
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,098
And you're making the same mistake
right now...

1265
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:52,566
and I'd be God dead
if I'm just gonna sit by and watch.

1266
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:56,237
You're in the risk club.
Risk it.

1267
01:24:56,905 --> 01:24:57,894
I didn't.

1268
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,239
Look at me.

1269
01:24:59,274 --> 01:25:03,210
I'm the only ghost of a man.

1270
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:07,012
It doesn't mean that you're not
gonna get hurt.

1271
01:25:07,616 --> 01:25:09,516
I can guarantee you this.

1272
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:12,951
Any pain that you feel,

1273
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:18,090
will never ever compare to the regret
that comes from walking away from love.

1274
01:25:19,261 --> 01:25:22,230
So is that what love's about?
Trust me.

1275
01:25:22,265 --> 01:25:23,162
Pain...

1276
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,293
beats regret everyday in a week and twice
on Sunday.

1277
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:32,099
Don't run away.

1278
01:25:32,941 --> 01:25:33,930
Don't do it.

1279
01:25:38,914 --> 01:25:40,677
I don't think I'm saying this but-

1280
01:25:49,057 --> 01:25:50,854
You wanna get married?

1281
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:53,653
I do.
- You do.

1282
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:55,621
Yes!

1283
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:14,011
Oh baby.

1284
01:26:17,419 --> 01:26:19,046
Flowers. Check.

1285
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:20,185
Cake, check.

1286
01:26:20,388 --> 01:26:21,067
Dinner, check.

1287
01:26:21,102 --> 01:26:21,746
Photographer.

1288
01:26:23,024 --> 01:26:25,083
I know a pretty good photographer.

1289
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:05,359
It was cold and dark.

1290
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:06,859
We've been taking fire for hours.

1291
01:27:07,836 --> 01:27:09,633
Took an incoming mortar yet.

1292
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,376
All I end up with jacketless and
insight and fell out.

1293
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:15,673
In my head is bloody guts in my hand.

1294
01:27:18,046 --> 01:27:19,570
Feel warm and mushy and squishy.

1295
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:26,286
And I pushed him right back with body
cavity and wisdom to live with my tears.

1296
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:29,854
And that is what true love is.

1297
01:27:31,059 --> 01:27:34,051
To love.
- To love.

1298
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:46,197
I guess now is a good time for me
to make the best man's toast.

1299
01:27:47,008 --> 01:27:48,976
I've never gotten one of this before. So-

1300
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:50,672
So bear it with me.

1301
01:27:52,414 --> 01:27:56,785
Someone once told me that the power
of all relationships lies with...

1302
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:03,091
whoever cares less
and he was right.

1303
01:28:03,126 --> 01:28:03,557
That's-

1304
01:28:03,592 --> 01:28:06,925
and nobody proves that better
than my kid brother Paul.

1305
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:22,672
Buddy you give love...
to everyone.

1306
01:28:24,379 --> 01:28:25,812
And you require none in return.

1307
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:29,150
And this day on,

1308
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:29,976
I wanna be more like you.

1309
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:35,414
I want you to be proud of me again.

1310
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:37,115
Yeah.

1311
01:28:38,793 --> 01:28:41,387
And here's to my new sister.

1312
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:46,293
All I can really say here all that
I know for sure.

1313
01:28:50,005 --> 01:28:51,734
As to mom and dad.

1314
01:28:54,476 --> 01:28:56,476
They who loved you.

1315
01:28:56,511 --> 01:28:59,139
I'm glad you become our family.

1316
01:29:00,248 --> 01:29:00,907
This is to Paul and Sandra.

1317
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:19,389
Look here. Look right here. Ok.
How old are you?

1318
01:29:20,835 --> 01:29:23,269
Oh what's the matter?
Don't bite your hand.

1319
01:29:23,538 --> 01:29:24,402
Alright. I'm done.

1320
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:29,776
We're really worried about you.

1321
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:33,076
Let me remind you as man's heart
resident.

1322
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:34,680
You're serving duties
for the single ladies here tonight.

1323
01:29:34,883 --> 01:29:36,942
That is very tempting.

1324
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:39,244
Yes, it is. But-

1325
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:42,419
I'm out.

1326
01:29:43,124 --> 01:29:45,558
Ladies, thank you but
no thank you.

1327
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:48,721
Hey, I think it will all work
if you eventually give in.

1328
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:54,563
Hey!

1329
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:19,726
Hey.

1330
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:20,785
Congratulations.

1331
01:30:23,164 --> 01:30:24,654
You do... pull off the wedding.

1332
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:27,962
We pulled off the big wedding.

1333
01:30:29,237 --> 01:30:32,297
Of course I would've broken it
and you'd fix it.

1334
01:30:32,507 --> 01:30:33,269
I do.

1335
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:39,211
Ok, I have to know.

1336
01:30:40,548 --> 01:30:42,248
What happened to you last night?

1337
01:30:42,283 --> 01:30:45,887
It was just yesterday you were
just usual and awful self.

1338
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:49,516
And then today you became
the guy I used to know.

1339
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:53,891
Well I always thought
deep down you actually were.

1340
01:30:54,763 --> 01:30:59,132
I honestly don't know what the hell
happen to me last night.

1341
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:03,001
You know. But I do know that I'm seeing
things more clearly today than-

1342
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:06,638
anytime that I can remember.

1343
01:31:06,673 --> 01:31:08,838
How good I feel about you.

1344
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:12,675
That's something that has never changed.

1345
01:31:16,384 --> 01:31:17,351
I wish I could believe.

1346
01:31:19,053 --> 01:31:23,823
We've just been through this before.
It's like-

1347
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:26,728
And all I know is that it's not just
another line...

1348
01:31:26,763 --> 01:31:28,286
from the me and family playbook.

1349
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:45,303
Look at that.

1350
01:31:51,252 --> 01:31:52,276
You keep it.

1351
01:31:53,188 --> 01:31:53,847
Yeah.

1352
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,849
Yeah, I'm missing the days actually.

1353
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:02,291
L-
I can't believe it.

1354
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:03,989
Give me one more chance.

1355
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,129
I'll do better.

1356
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:08,960
More than all the things.

1357
01:32:10,438 --> 01:32:12,269
The rulings, I'm all in.

1358
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:15,338
Your moustache verticle is on.

1359
01:32:17,612 --> 01:32:19,341
No. Not a chance.

1360
01:32:23,084 --> 01:32:24,881
I promise you this.

1361
01:32:25,987 --> 01:32:36,363
When you wake up in the morning,
I'll be there. Everyday.

1362
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:00,614
What?

1363
01:33:01,589 --> 01:33:02,385
What is it?

1364
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:03,949
Nothing.

1365
01:33:06,027 --> 01:33:09,394
I just recognize this song.

1366
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:11,726
Oh yeah.

1367
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:16,333
May I have this dance?

1368
01:33:16,504 --> 01:33:17,368
Finally.

1369
01:33:17,739 --> 01:33:20,469
He hates this. You too are now.

1370
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:27,939
That's how it should.

1371
01:33:31,953 --> 01:33:34,615
What do you say? Let's get naked.

1372
01:33:38,626 --> 01:33:40,617
Dry. I love it.

1373
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:43,961
You know, I've interviewed before
a new secretary.

1374
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:47,726
How good is your dictation?

1375
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:51,436
Again"dick-tation"

1376
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,375
I'm actually at this party.

1377
01:34:18,566 --> 01:34:19,157
Looks like it's just you and me,
sweetie.

1378
01:34:22,103 --> 01:34:25,470
I love those squirshy.

1379
01:34:28,509 --> 01:34:29,533
I'm only 16.

1380
01:34:30,478 --> 01:34:31,638
We're ghost, baby.

1381
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,003
We're ageless.

1382
01:34:36,624 --> 01:34:39,658
