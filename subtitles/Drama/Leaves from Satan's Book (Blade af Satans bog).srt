2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:18,396
Four stories by Edgard Hoyer
Adapted for film by Carl Th. Dreyer

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:30,831
directed by Carl Th. Dreyer
cinematography by George Schneevoigt

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,433
So goes the legend of Satanas:

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,952
And God said to Satan,
the fallen angel:

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:49,989
"You fell because you wanted
what even I did not want.""

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:01:01,156
"In your pride you tempted men..."

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,469
"Satan, you shall continue your
wicked work amongst humanity."

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,789
"Go out among them,
take their shape.""

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,274
"And whoever yields to your
temptation shall be judged by me.""

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:36,836
"And whenever your temptations
are resisted, -

12
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:51,512
- you shall be relieved of
1000 years of your punishment.""

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,871
The first story.

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,709
Thirty years
after the birth of christ.

15
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,992
It happened during the last days -

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,352
- of the wanderings of christ
upon this earth.

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,480
On the second day before aster -

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,231
- the priests and the scribes were
gathered in the house of caiphas.

19
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,155
The teachings of christ had offended
the scribes, and Satanas, -

20
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,708
- who found the ground prepared
for his evil seeds, -

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,391
- took the form of a Pharisee
and went to caiphas.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,149
Satanas - Helge Nissen.

23
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,359
Caiphas.

24
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,075
On the same evening, Jesus
and is disciples were guests -

25
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,470
- in the home of Simon the leper.
Jesus - Halvard Hoff

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,839
But Satanas found easy ears with
the priests and the scribes, -

27
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:29,915
- who feared the favour Jesus had
won with the people for is miracles.

28
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,110
I am just out of Bethany,
where everybody speaks of Jesus.

29
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,998
After the raising of lazarus
from the dead, -

30
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,830
- Jesus is hailed everywhere
as if he were a king.

31
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:43,917
but Satanas is secretly grieved to see
that the seed he has newly sown -

32
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,955
- is already beginning to bloom..

33
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,358
If we let him go on in this manner,
everybody will believe him in the end -

34
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,033
- and our temples will stand empty.

35
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,798
The anointment of Jesus.

36
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,959
and the woman poured ointment
on the feet of Jesus -

37
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,958
- and dried them with her hair.

38
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,149
Why was this ointment not sold
for three hundred pence -

39
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,955
- and the money given to the poor?

40
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,828
but Jesus reproved Judas, saying:
"Let her alone.""

41
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:14,357
"For the poor ye have always
with you, but me ye have not always.""

42
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,676
but the scribes claimed
with one voice -

43
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,797
- that caiphas should let Jesus
be seized and slain.

44
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,876
Your will shall be satisfied.

45
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,757
Woe to him, who opposes us.
He must die!

46
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:22,599
Why do you believe in him?
God's son is what he calls himself.

47
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,275
The devil"s son is what he is.

48
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:41,357
and you have been tied
by the power of the devil.

49
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,711
We shall meet tomorrow at noon-tide
outside the Golden Gate.

50
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,198
I know you will come.

51
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,438
The next day was the first day of the
festival of the unleavened bread.

52
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,989
Judas had spent a sleepless night, -

53
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,476
- harassed by the doubts
put in his head by the Pharisee.

54
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,550
But towards noon he felt -

55
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,515
- as if a will
stronger than his own -

56
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,397
- directed his steps
towards the Golden Gate.

57
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,393
I mean no ill by you.
only the salvation of your soul.

58
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,835
But on this day the disciples
had come to Jesus and asked im:

59
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:36,679
"Where wilt thou that we prepare
for thee to eat the pass-over?""

60
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:44,191
and Jesus answered: ""Go into
the city, and there you shall meet -

61
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,829
- a man carrying a pitcher of water.
follow him.""

62
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,075
You suffer, and it is his fault.
he promised you a Messias ingdom.

63
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,789
but he is not God"s son,
only a man. An impostor.

64
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,559
He is doomed.
He must die.

65
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,630
and Israel's God has chosen you
for his tool.

66
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,115
I cannot do it.
I will not do it.

67
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,558
Swear not. I know you will.

68
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,833
I shall expect you at the well -

69
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,750
- when the Romans sound the
second change of the watch.

70
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,877
And when the hour had come, -

71
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,518
- he sat down to eat,
and the disciples with im.

72
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,710
and when they were eating, he said:
""Verily I say unto you, -

73
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,311
- one of you will betray me.""

74
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,518
Master, is it I?

75
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,469
and he broke the bread, dipped it,
and gave it to Judas, saying:

76
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,913
"That thou doest, do quickly.""

77
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,479
and Jesus blessed the cup.

78
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,279
the hymn.

79
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,432
and having sung the hymn. -

80
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,031
- Jesus and the disciples
went out to Gethsemane.

81
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,829
but at the same hour, -

82
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,434
- men of the Jewish temple guard
went out at the bidding of caiphas -

83
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,115
- to seize Jesus, and
Roman soldiers accompanied them.

84
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:11,031
Lord, where are you going?
We are tired. et us stay here.

85
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,997
and Jesus rose from is prayer
and went back to the disciples, -

86
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,275
- but found them asleep
with sadness.

87
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,591
How am I to know Jesus?

88
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,392
The kiss of friendship
shall be the sign.

89
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,390
and Jesus prayed:

90
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,913
"Abba, my ather, if it is possible,
take away this cup form me.""

91
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,755
but Jesus said:
"The hour is near -

92
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,919
- when the Son of Man will be
betrayed by the sinner.""

93
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,318
and Jesus asked:
""Who are you searching for?""

94
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,559
but Jesus asked once again:
""Who are you searching for?""

95
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,353
and Jesus said:

96
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,759
"Judas, are you betraying me,
the Son of Man, with a kiss?""

97
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,278
but Satanas, the fallen angel,
whose whole heart was set -

98
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,795
- upon finding favour again
in the eyes of the lmighty, -

99
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,994
- he was grieved to see
his evil work completed.

100
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:17,308
and his grief was deeper,
because it had fallen to his lot -

101
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,710
- to deliver the son of God
into the hands of human tormentors.

102
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,436
but the Lord"s voice was heard:
"Continue thy evil doings."

103
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,520
Setting: Seville in Spain.

104
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,318
Setting: Seville in pain.

105
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,399
Time: 16th century.

106
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,913
In the 16th century, the Spanish
Inquisition was at the height of its power.

107
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,992
countless are the reports
from those days -

108
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:15,835
- about the horrors of the torture
chambers of the Inquisition.

109
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,075
the noble don Gomez de castro,
who, much to his own satisfaction, -

110
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:43,359
- was a diligent student of the modern
sciences, astronomy and astrology.

111
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,314
don Gomez de castro -
Hallander Hellemann.

112
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,349
his daughter Isabella, receiving
instruction in mathematics and history -

113
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,351
- by the learned monk
don Hernandez y Argote

114
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:17,275
Isabella - Ebon Strandin
don Hernandez - Johannes Meyer.

115
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:59,590
José, the butler.
José - Nalle Haldén.

116
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,668
My nephew, count Manuel,
intimates that -

117
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,796
- he has been granted leave
from his duties in the war -

118
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,710
- and will pay us a visit.

119
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,432
In vain, don Hernandez subjects
himself to the strictest penances.

120
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:27,558
his thoughts always dwell
upon Isabella.

121
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:46,030
the Grand Inquisitor.
Satanas - Helge Nissen.

122
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,792
don ernandez has become so
engrossed by his desire for Isabella -

123
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,439
- that even the holy saint
at the foot of the cross -

124
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,112
- to his eyes assumes the figure
and expression of Isabella.

125
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:30,393
My son, why do you not put yourself
at the service of the Inquisition?

126
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,958
Remember: for the Inquisition,
nothing is unattainable.

127
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,276
a few days later.

128
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,359
count Manuel de errera.
count Manuel - Hugo Bruun.

129
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,152
circumstances that I cannot explain -

130
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,035
- have compelled me to
take this decision.

131
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:33,591
It is with grief that I leave this house, -

132
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,354
- whence I take the
most cherished memories of my life.

133
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,595
for Isabella and Manuel the weeks
passed as if in children"s play.

134
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:46,037
and the day came when Manuel
must resume his duties in the war.

135
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,355
At the same time, -

136
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:23,157
- don Hernandez swore unqualified
allegiance to the Inquisition.

137
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,309
Swear that you will be ready
to serve God ...

138
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,871
... and will be prepared
to give up anybody, -

139
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,712
- even your father and mother,
sister or brother, -

140
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,995
- to the holy punishment
of the Inquisition.

141
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,395
the horoscope.

142
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,353
Look, Saturn is opposite
its own sign - in the death house.

143
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,030
My last hour is near!

144
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,798
In the antechamber
of the Grand Inquisitor.

145
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:23,549
Be not surprised. José is a
faithful friend of the Inquisition.

146
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,155
You are right, José.

147
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,993
He who pretends to read God"s will
in the stars is a heretic.

148
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,238
You have heard José"s evidence.
don Gomez is a heretic.

149
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,560
and a heretic"s daughter
is a heretic, too.

150
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,435
It will be your first task
to bring them both -

151
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,632
- safely behind the walls
of the Inquisition prison.

152
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:25,396
Is your belief no greater?
have you already forgotten your oath?

153
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,312
When the shadow on don Gomez"
sundial showed -

154
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,150
- that the day was drawing
to its end ...

155
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,357
he torture chamber
of the Inquisition.

156
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,590
untie him.
the trial is over, for the present.

157
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,752
the trial is over for ever.

158
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,512
God, have mercy on the poor sinner.

159
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,518
the Inquisition Prison.

160
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:07,189
I order you to continue the trial
in the torture chamber.

161
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:37,358
I am not master of myself
in the presence of this woman.

162
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:09,149
What is the body of a heretic to me,
as long as her soul be saved?

163
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,474
How strange!

164
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:35,038
Next morning, the sun rose
like on any other morning.

165
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:35,355
... the court sentences Isabella
to be burned at the stake ...

166
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,469
But the lord left Satanas
no time for contemplation.

167
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:38,234
With inexorable severity,
the words of doom rang in his ears:

168
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,194
continue thy evil doings.

169
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,631
Setting: Paris.
Time: utumn 1 793.

170
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,513
On the 21st January, 1 793, -

171
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:07,431
- Louis XVI was beheaded as a
victim to the Republic of iberty.

172
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:14,398
Many hands were now busily
erecting the guillotine -

173
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:20,197
- for Queen Marie Antoinette.

174
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,835
during the night between
the 1st and 2nd August 1793, -

175
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:47,034
- the unfortunate queen was
removed from the prison -

176
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,516
- in the temple to the conciergerie, -

177
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,234
- called
""the Prison of the condemned"".

178
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,352
Marie Antoinette - Tenna Frederiksen.

179
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,917
and the queen was made
to sign a receipt -

180
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:32,797
- evidencing that
she had been duly handed over -

181
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,630
- to the prison ward
of the conciergerie.

182
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:05,076
one month later,-
on the 5th eptember 1 793, -

183
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,956
- the Paris convent
enacted the sinister law -

184
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,391
- instituting
the Army of the Revolution.

185
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,991
accompanied by guillotines,
this army in small detachments -

186
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,034
- was to make a circuit
of the French provinces -

187
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,119
- to incarcerate and execute
""all suspicious characters"".

188
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:58,710
The music room of chambord castle.

189
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:17,158
count de chambord - Viggo Wiehe.

190
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:23,754
countess de chambord -
Emma Wiehe.

191
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,518
carefree youth.

192
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,511
Lady Geneviéve de chambord -
Jeanne ramcourt.

193
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:26,790
The guillotine is coming!
The guillotine is coming!

194
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,077
In times like these,
each man is nearest to himself.

195
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,712
these itinerant tribunals -

196
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,711
- with authority to pass and execute
death sentences on the spot, -

197
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:09,031
- were presided over
by a people"s commissar, -

198
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:16,237
- whose only qualification was that
he must know and show no mercy.

199
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,353
the people"s commissar -
Emil Helsengreen.

200
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,879
Joseph, I know you will grant
your master his last wish.

201
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:38,030
Promise that you will lead
my wife and daughter into safety, -

202
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:45,032
- and that you will for ever
remain a loyal friend to them.

203
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,313
Joseph - lith Pio.

204
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:15,036
""here is thus indisputable evidence
that the count the chambord -

205
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:22,078
- has been the actual leader
of a conspiracy -

206
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:28,310
- to help the former Queen of rance,
the Widow capet, -

207
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,035
- to flee the country.""

208
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,913
an escape in the night.

209
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,359
In the conciergerie.

210
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,913
After a wearisome
couple of days" travel, -

211
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,955
- the fugitives from chambord were
approaching their temporary goal:

212
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,358
Paris.

213
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,710
Joseph had succeeded
in obtaining a forged passport -

214
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:23,996
- made out to citizeness Grandet
and her son and daughter, -

215
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:32,153
- by which they hoped to be
admitted undetected into Paris.

216
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,158
In the taproom of the Parisian
"Taverne Pitou"", -

217
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,636
- Michonnet, the popular singer, -

218
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:08,712
- was admired and applauded for his
rendering of ""a Marseillaise"", -

219
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:15,234
- which in those days had just
become popular in Paris.

220
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,357
Old Pitou - Viggo indstrom.

221
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,033
On the high road.

222
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,673
At the city gates.

223
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,232
Erneste durand, -

224
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,309
- up to quite recently a footman in
the service of count de chambord, -

225
01:19:54,520 --> 01:20:01,278
- is now heart and soul engrossed
in the new political ideas.

226
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,472
Satanas - Helge Nissen.

227
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:49,680
I deserve no thanks,
for I merely did my duty.

228
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:01,433
But if you wish to make me glad,
then please bestow upon me -

229
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:07,112
- the medallion with your daughter"s
image as a keepsake, -

230
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,949
- which I know you always wear.

231
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,872
I give it to you gladly, -

232
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,312
- for you have the right
to claim the best from me.

233
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,630
Have no fear! I promise
that I will not give them away.

234
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,994
They have always been kind to me.

235
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:10,035
Why should I return evil for good?

236
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,753
They are the coming men, -

237
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:42,753
- and meet here every night
to discuss the political news.

238
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,432
In the conciergerie.

239
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:57,392
Nothing at that time was abused
as much as the motto:

240
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:06,190
Liberté - Egalité - Fraternité
( Freedom - quality - brotherhood)

241
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:12,999
It was printed everywhere.
Even the tattooer used it for his art.

242
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,793
Believe me:
hat fellow will go a long way.

243
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,754
With his gift of the gab -

244
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,718
- he is certain to reach the
highest posts in the state.

245
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,115
What was I two months ago?
A servant like yourself.

246
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:55,908
Now I belong to the inner circles
of the Jacobin club -

247
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:04,312
- and am on the point of
securing a seat in the convent.

248
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:14,910
You may go as far,
if you will.

249
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:40,270
his card admits you to the
sessions of the Jacobin club.

250
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:44,632
Be there tomorrow, -

251
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:51,837
- when I shall introduce you
to some of my political friends.

252
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,755
At the conciergerie -

253
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,988
- the dregs of the imprisoned women
gathered almost daily -

254
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:21,797
- below the window
of Marie ntoinette"s cell, -

255
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,394
- whence they hurled the
lowest insults at the poor queen.

256
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:56,358
That wicked witch
is the cause of all our misery.

257
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:04,399
Why don"t they make her
a few inches shorter?

258
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:24,035
Here I have kept the latest
issue of ""Pére duchesne"".

259
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:30,190
I suggest we give it to her Majesty.

260
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:38,592
By now she must be fed up with
the history of the Passion of christ.

261
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,511
PÉRE dUcHESNE

262
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,111
The tyrant is dead, but his wench
and cursed brood are still alive.

263
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:18,871
You will not have peace
before they are destroyed.

264
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:23,756
Watch out! Freedom is at stake!

265
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,349
Some time has elapsed.

266
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,712
Through Erneste"s influence -

267
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:47,392
- Joseph already belongs to the most
trusted henchmen of the Jacobins.

268
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:50,469
Why don"t you pluck up the courage
to propose to her?

269
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:09,269
You forget that you have
means and ways to force her.

270
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:15,589
do you think she wants herself
or her mother adorned -

271
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,794
- with the collar of the guillotine?

272
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,717
At the conciergerie.

273
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:39,314
For Marie Antoinette all
secular ties have been severed -

274
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:45,959
- save the one which forever
will bind a mother to her child.

275
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,473
At her bosom she kept her son"s
portrait and a lock of his hair, -

276
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:27,631
- both successfully smuggled
into the prison -

277
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:34,757
- in an old yellow glove.

278
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,878
Although Joseph now belongs to
the Revolution with all his heart, -

279
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:08,997
- he does not for one day fail
to visit his former masters, -

280
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:14,797
- who, thanks to him, have been
accorded tolerable conditions.

281
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:28,476
This period of terror
so brutalized the human mind -

282
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,719
- that even children
devoted themselves -

283
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,151
- to playing with the guillotine.

284
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,398
The accused.

285
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,837
The public prosecutor.

286
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,358
The audience.

287
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,593
The judge.

288
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,870
citizen cat is guilty of
contempt of the Republic -

289
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:12,393
- by having worn in public
the white colour of the court, -

290
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:18,436
- and so he must catch it in the neck!

291
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,631
In the meantime Joseph
had a long interview -

292
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,070
- with the countess de chambord.

293
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:31,070
The subject matter
was known to no one, -

294
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:35,114
- and no one must know.

295
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,877
On the way to the guillotine.

296
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:49,434
You have given ample proof
of your loyalty -

297
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:54,919
- and endangered your life
for our sake.

298
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:02,879
Joseph, you know I hold you in great
esteem as a generous friend.

299
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,271
But you know, too, -

300
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:16,112
- that anything more than friendship
between us is impossible.

301
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:41,593
Long live liberty!

302
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:47,478
But on the same evening
a poor cripple, -

303
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:54,233
- whom an evil fate
had even made deaf and dumb, -

304
01:36:54,440 --> 01:37:02,154
- paid a visit to Fouquier-Tinville,
the public prosecutor.

305
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:09,038
Fouquier-Tinville -
Vilh. Petersen.

306
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:21,159
Countess de chambord
and her daughter Geneviéve -

307
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:28,789
- are hiding under the name of
Grandet in t. Antoine Street, -

308
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:36,554
- and are on the point of
fleeing the country.

309
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:11,154
Meanwhile,
preparations for the flight -

310
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,591
- were in progress
in t. Antoine Street.

311
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:41,039
The cripple had achieved his object, -

312
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:44,915
- but there was no exultant joy
of victory in his eyes.

313
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:52,470
For he was Satanas, disguised
in the cripple"s poor clothes.

314
01:39:52,680 --> 01:40:00,598
Satanas who must tempt mankind
in obedience to the divine doom.

315
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:23,552
With Fouquier-Tinville.

316
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:43,310
You ask about our names.
Read them in our passports.

317
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,637
My child,
I am too old to tell lies.

318
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:05,592
Yes,
I am the countess de chambord, -

319
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:13,480
- and the young lady at my side
is my daughter, Lady Geneviéve.

320
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:32,958
But you, citizen ...

321
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:44,188
... you whom we
all considered a good patriot ...

322
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:51,158
You wanted to help
the aristocrats flee, did you?

323
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:05,754
countess de chambord
and her daughter Geneviéve -

324
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,475
- are hiding under the name of
Grandet in t. Antoine treet.

325
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,952
Now I understand.

326
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:29,030
You are the real informer
who sent the letter.

327
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,996
There are problems
which are hard nuts to crack, -

328
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,432
- even to a Fouquier-Tinville.

329
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:19,829
Now, speak up.

330
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:23,589
did you or did you not
send the letter?

331
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:56,596
You shall not in vain have shown
devotion to the Republic.

332
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:04,798
The office of police prefect falls
vacant in the immediate future, -

333
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:11,792
- and I shall see
that it is given to you.

334
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:34,516
Judas' reward falls to Judas.

335
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,590
On the 14th October 1793 -

336
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:14,396
- Marie Antoinette was taken
before the Revolutionary ribunal.

337
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:18,275
The trial lasted two days.

338
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,517
When she returned to her cell -

339
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:25,395
- during the night between
the 15th and 16th, -

340
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:32,278
- the jury had unanimously sentenced
the Queen of the French to death.

341
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:22,156
On concorde Square -

342
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:29,198
- the executioner and his assistants
dressed Marie Antoinette"s death bed.

343
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,913
While the day was slowly dawning, -

344
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:52,275
- Marie Antoinette wrote her
famous, tear-stained letter -

345
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:58,555
- to her sister-in-law,
Princess Elisabeth.

346
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:02,833
The letter
which has passed into history as -

347
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,635
- ""Marie Antoinette's Testament"".

348
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,433
October 16th
4:30 a.m.

349
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:30,919
This letter to you, my dear sister,
will be my last.

350
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:34,874
I have just been sentenced,
not to a disgraceful death, -

351
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:38,072
- for it is disgraceful
only to criminals, -

352
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:43,991
- but to leave this earth
to join your brother, -

353
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:48,751
- innocent like him ...

354
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,996
In another cell, not far off, -

355
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,159
- another woman was writing.

356
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:28,956
To Joseph Gilvert
from Lady Geneviéve de chambord

357
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:46,752
At this moment I can hear the
death-cart rumble into the yard -

358
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:52,114
- to take my mother to the scaffold.
These lines are my last appeal to you.

359
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:56,233
Erneste is the soul of a conspiracy
to liberate the queen.

360
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:01,958
Help him and I shall forgive you,
and bless you in my last moment.

361
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:41,156
Take this to Joseph,
with my final farewell.

362
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:14,070
Of the miserable clothes
left to Marie Antoinette, -

363
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:17,397
- at one time the most
beautiful lady in France, -

364
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,910
- she had dressed this morning
as if for an occasion.

365
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:24,874
It is her you have to thank -

366
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:29,710
- for me making a traitor
of myself to the Republic.

367
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:42,113
Yes, I remember the young
woman well. Where is she now?

368
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,112
She has been beheaded?

369
01:52:55,440 --> 01:53:02,630
Who was callous enough to hand that
child over to the executioners?

370
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,637
Be quick! The way is clear.

371
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:44,353
Remember your promise
to Genevieve, -

372
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,552
- and do not think of yourself.

373
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:06,953
But of wounded vanity,
in the flare of a moment"s anger, -

374
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:15,033
- Joseph forgets his solemn vow
to Geneviéve and the queen, -

375
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:21,315
- whose fate
had been entrusted to him.

376
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:37,155
Now she is being prepared
for death out there.

377
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:40,989
Is that good enough for you?

378
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:45,239
Three women"s faiths
have been betrayed by you.

379
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:48,557
Three lives you have wasted.

380
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:14,397
Murderer is your true name,
just like Satanas is mine.

381
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:19,037
Eternal damnation to you, -

382
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:23,472
- who dragged me into your ruin.

383
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,358
eternal damnation!

384
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:13,078
In the agony of despair,
Satanas pauses in his wanderings, -

385
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:16,670
- which, paved as they are
with dashed hopes, -

386
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,714
- seem to carry him further away
from his eternal salvation.

387
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:26,756
For him there is no mercy.
Anew is heard the voice from above:

388
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,316
continue thy evil doings!

389
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:48,278
Setting: Finland.
Time: Spring 1918.

390
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:52,917
Everyone knows the marvellous
picture of Finland -

391
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:56,669
- symbolized by a young woman,
fighting the Russian eagle.

392
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,271
Was not fresh life given to
this picture -

393
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:08,158
- when the Red insurrection
made its way from Russia -

394
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:12,717
- across the Finnish frontier?

395
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:43,273
Our last story takes place
in the little town of Hirola, -

396
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:52,434
- which was partly occupied
by the Reds in the spring of 1918.

397
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,117
The White eadquarters.

398
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:46,871
corporal Matti receives orders
from his commander -

399
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:51,312
- to lay telephone
and telegraph wires -

400
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:55,957
- across to the
railway station of Hirola.

401
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:59,232
corporal Matti - christian Nielsen.

402
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:45,715
If you will not be mine, -

403
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:50,357
- I shall inform on your husband
to the Red tribunal.

404
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:37,470
Next day.
corporal Matti on his way to Hirola.

405
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,952
Thank God you came.

406
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:55,790
That means we shall get real coffee
again soon, doesn"t it?

407
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:05,036
Siri goes into the woods
to gather bark -

408
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:07,993
- for baking with flour.

409
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:31,916
Matti and his men proceed to Hirola.

410
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:48,074
hat"s Mother.

411
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:51,511
Go and meet her - hurry up.

412
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:53,400
The Red tribunal.

413
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:01,631
In this story from our own time, -

414
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,197
- Satanas is represented by the
Russian monk Ivan, -

415
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:12,396
- who has rushed to the aid
of his Finnish ""Red"" brothers -

416
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:18,789
- against the
"Bloodhounds of the White Guard"".

417
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,470
Satanas - Helge Nissen.

418
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:43,511
I am afraid
we shall have to acquit him.

419
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:06,470
Let him have a bullet
when you get into the woods.

420
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:22,431
And now for a bite to eat.

421
02:10:55,160 --> 02:11:00,598
Ivan has turned the schoolroom
of Hirola into a lecture hall, -

422
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:07,273
- and there is always
a devout audience -

423
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:13,271
- when he gives his social lectures.

424
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:04,992
Rautaniemi has fought a fierce battle
with his own conscience, -

425
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:11,230
- but it is as if a power beyond
his own control drags him -

426
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:17,754
- towards the school house
of Hirola.

427
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:14,792
Now I know how to avenge my father.

428
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:20,711
Take me to your commander at once.

429
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:25,630
I want to join the Finnish army.

430
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:45,677
The Red catechism

431
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:55,351
You need only fear one God:
your own will

432
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:02,758
You need only obey one law:

433
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:07,829
The one you make yourself
with the blood of the rich.

434
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:50,352
Where do you live?

435
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:58,517
I no longer have a home.

436
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:05,436
You must give an address anyway, -

437
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:11,078
- where the body may be sent
if you are killed.

438
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:19,437
It makes no difference to me -

439
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:23,713
- as long as I am buried
in Finnish soil.

440
02:15:55,800 --> 02:16:04,708
May the pact you are making now
be a blessing to you.

441
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:22,557
One evening, about a week later, -

442
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:28,471
- just after the last train
had left Hirola.

443
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:49,712
In the Red headquarters -

444
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:55,552
- important discussions were
in progress on the same night.

445
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:03,794
I"ll tell you. The Whites have
established a connection -

446
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,913
- by telephone and telegraph,
to the station.

447
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:12,113
We must catch Paavo off his guard -

448
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:19,158
- and force him to draw the Whites
into an ambush.

449
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:13,758
The Reds.

450
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:55,834
I must be off to the inn,
and get hold of the boys.

451
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:27,272
oftly!
It is not time yet.

452
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:39,953
Red outpost.

453
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:23,237
Send that telegram to the Whites.

454
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:35,315
The Reds have occupied
the railway line.

455
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:40,719
You can waylay them -

456
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:46,677
- if you go by the main road
through the wood along the river.

457
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:04,075
The Reds ...

458
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:56,910
If you don"t obey my command,
your husband will be shot.

459
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:14,192
don"t do it, Siri.

460
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:45,591
You are now going to die, -

461
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:49,236
- but even the worst of sinners
has a claim -

462
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:52,477
- to be comforted by religion.

463
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:46,159
The inn.

464
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:13,476
Naimi cannot wait for Matti any longer
and goes over to the station, -

465
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:20,233
- well armed with hand grenades,
to meet a contingency.

466
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:40,518
does she now belong to me?

467
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:47,472
Not yet.

468
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:41,033
In a few seconds, your husband
will have drawn his last breath.

469
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:45,552
Will you not reconsider,
while there is still time?

470
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:59,237
dear God! Give me the strength
to resist the temptation.

471
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:39,076
Your husband"s life
can no longer be spared ...

472
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:09,756
... but there is still time to
save the lives of your children.

473
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:29,030
This is my last warning.

474
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:37,511
If you refuse, your children
will be dead in the next instant.

475
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:44,678
Well?

476
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:21,559
do your duty.

477
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:09,109
Forgive me, Paavo.

478
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:14,269
I did it only ...
for Finland"s sake.

479
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:35,909
Siri"s simple heroic deed
released Satanas -

480
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:40,272
- from a thousand years
of his doom.

481
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:43,438
But the doom
pronounced by the ord -

482
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:46,916
- was written with the
characters of eternity, -

483
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:51,591
- and its words urge Satanas on
to new goals, new fates.
