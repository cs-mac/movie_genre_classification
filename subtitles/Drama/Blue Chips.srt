1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,736
You gotta bust him out.

2
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:22,411
All right. come on. now.

3
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,626
How bad can it get?

4
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,961
Just how goddamn bad can it get?

5
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:48,403
This is by far the worst team
that has ever sat in this locker room.

6
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:52,466
You son of a bitches.
you don't deserve a locker room.

7
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,940
You don't deserve a locker room.
the way you're playing this year.

8
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,704
You should be playing
without uniforms.

9
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:00,439
You should be playing
in your jockstraps.

10
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,618
Goddamn it!

11
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:07,448
Every time we get ready to play.
l just wanna throw up.

12
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:10,387
l'm goddamn sick
of watching you guys play.

13
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:14,188
There's not one of you. not one of you.
that's learned how to win.

14
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:20,063
We got hammered the last four games.
and it stops right now!

15
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:23,963
lf you keep playing
the way you're playing.

16
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:26,540
we're gonna get our ass
beat again tonight.

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,770
l'm so depressed
l don't even wanna talk about it.

18
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:33,338
l'm through fighting.
you sons of bitches!

19
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,882
You're the dumbest team
l ever coached.

20
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,988
You guys think of something.

21
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,295
All right. guys. The guards--

22
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:57,303
Honest to Christ. l just wanna go home
and cry when l watch us play.

23
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,498
Don't you boys understand?

24
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:03,008
Don't you know how bad
l wanna see this team play?

25
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:07,240
l wanna see this team play
so fucking bad. l can taste it.

26
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,940
Honest to Christ!

27
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,746
You boys. the only joy
l have right now

28
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:15,550
is l only have to watch you guys
play two more games.

29
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:18,119
Goddamn it!

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,068
All right. guys. let's start thinking
about the game.

31
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:35,836
Let's start thinking about
what we're gonna do out there.

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,849
l can't tell you how sick l am
of basketball right now.

33
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:43,712
l never thought l'd see the day

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,787
when Western basketball
is in the state it is right now.

35
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:52,694
lf l never see another game in my life.
that's just fine by me.

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,960
Dwayne. you can get through
college half-assed.

37
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:04,298
Richard. you can get
through life half-assed.

38
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,307
But l'll guarantee you boys one thing.
Sure as hell. l'll guarantee you this:

39
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:11,412
You cannot win half-assed!

40
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,811
l wanna win this ball game!
Let's go!

41
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:19,904
Yeah!

42
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,365
And welcome to the Dolphin Dome
for tonight's game

43
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:49,477
between the Texas Western Cowboys
and the Western University Dolphins.

44
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,204
Coach Pete Bell for Western
is on the hot seat.

45
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:55,077
He's in danger of having
his first losing season ever.

46
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:59,015
but a victory tonight would ensure
a winning season for Coach Pete Bell.

47
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:02,658
lt's gonna be tough. though. because
Texas Western is tournament bound.

48
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,656
They are well-coached
by Rick Pitino.

49
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:08,695
They've got a dynamic backcourt duo
with Sam Crawford and Rex Walters.

50
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:12,959
and they should get up-front court help
from Chris Mills and George Lynch.

51
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,603
lt should be a great game.
First-half action coming up.

52
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:22,444
D- up. man. Play him up.
Hands up. Hack.

53
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,135
Deny those leads!

54
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,281
Dwayne. pick up the ball!

55
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,382
Hands up. baby.

56
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:30,452
He's going to his left.

57
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,587
Get in front of him.

58
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,555
Two shots.

59
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:36,987
Screen across.

60
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,888
Pick him up. pick him up!

61
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,188
- Play yourself. Mitch.
- Help on the ball.

62
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,262
- Mitch. use your feet!
- Come on. Ed. come on.

63
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,865
- That's a foul.
- Personal foul...

64
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:46,660
Oh. for chrissakes!

65
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,803
What the hell's the matter with you?

66
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:52,463
Goddamn it. we're not moving the ball.
Just standing around. for chrissake.

67
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:54,108
Let's go to the four-man motion.

68
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,709
lf they go to their one man.

69
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:58,437
don't worry about the big guy.
he's not gonna handle it.

70
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:03,483
Don't trap four and five.
Only trap one. two and three.

71
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:09,252
Take him to the hoop!

72
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,229
What the hell is this?

73
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,057
Great call. You're the best.

74
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:19,234
What in the hell is this? What.
have you got blinders on tonight?

75
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:20,993
l mean. you haven't
made a call all night.

76
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:23,337
Look out.

77
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,139
That's why you're a good official.

78
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:30,109
Now look. now look.
Up and under. George. Up and under.

79
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,140
Move. George. move.
Move. George.

80
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,149
Nice move. We got it.
Stay with it. Stay with it!

81
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,480
What the hell is that kind of a call?

82
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,056
- Explain that to me.
- You've got your last warning.

83
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,318
You sit down.
You've got your last warning.

84
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,462
- l'll ring you up.
- Horseshit!

85
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:50,930
Get back. get back. get back!
Full speed.

86
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:56,631
Son of a bitch.

87
00:06:58,741 --> 00:06:59,935
Three.

88
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,010
Now. now. now. now.

89
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:06,042
There it is.

90
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:08,646
Good job. Rebound. let's go!

91
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:13,187
Go slow. Stay in it. Stay in it!

92
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,184
They're getting tired.
They're breaking down right now.

93
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,486
They are not in great shape.

94
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:22,987
Come on. fill the lanes. Let's go.

95
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,331
- George! There it is.
- Did you see that?

96
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:27,162
That's it. take away the middle.
Dunk it.

97
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,164
He fouled! Foul!

98
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:32,434
Rebound it. Rebound it. yes!

99
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:35,310
Rotate.

100
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,978
Watch. he's coming!

101
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:41,481
- They're fouling me every time!
- l don't give a shit!

102
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:42,810
The tempo is ours.

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,385
Go strong. Rick.
He got killed.

104
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,251
Plug up the middle.
Plug it up.

105
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:02,233
Nigel. goddamn it.
get over on his left foot!

106
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,599
Ray Charles could've made
a better call. for chrissake.

107
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:05,899
Call that in the box!

108
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,508
You're standing over.
and you know he didn't touch him!

109
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,271
- Goddamn it!
- l'm here! He's over there!

110
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,214
l didn't call it.

111
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:17,079
l swear to God...

112
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,714
That's the third fucking time
you did that!

113
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,021
- What do you want me to do?
- You son of a bitch!

114
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,291
You son of a bitch!

115
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:34,995
You get out of here!
Get out of here!

116
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:36,999
l got it! l got it!

117
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,640
Am l wrong? Was l wrong or what?

118
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:43,369
- He had a different angle than you.
- Bullshit! Am l wrong or what?

119
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:45,809
Piss it.

120
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:50,711
Coach Bell is ejected from the arena.

121
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,296
Yo. coach.

122
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,871
lt's your friendly athletic director.

123
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:13,371
Thought l'd better stop by

124
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:16,409
and officially comment
on your behavior out there tonight.

125
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:19,080
Well. goddamn it. Vic.
lf l have to get on these kids

126
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,842
as hard as l did tonight
just to get them to play good.

127
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,042
l don't know if l can take
another goddamn game.

128
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:25,515
Coach. relax. will you?

129
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,281
lt's the end of a long season.
You know how it works.

130
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,686
You'll feel better about it
in the morning.

131
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,156
There's no goddamn way l'm gonna
feel better about it in the morning.

132
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:37,491
You know l'm gonna feel worse.
l'm just gonna get angrier and angrier.

133
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,225
Take all day.
You'll feel better by tomorrow night.

134
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:43,064
You know. if we keep losing.
you're gonna be out of a job.

135
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:44,933
God. tell me something l don't know.

136
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:52,305
My congratulations to Texas Western
and their wonderful coaching staff.

137
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:54,642
They played a terrific game.

138
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:59,680
That's about all l have to say on that.
Any questions. stupid or otherwise?

139
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,322
- All right. Allan?
- Yeah. coach.

140
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:05,153
We'd like to hear your side
of the basketball-kicking incident.

141
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:08,954
The basketball-kicking incident.
All right. next question.

142
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:11,463
Allan. you used up your question.
That was stupid.

143
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:12,827
Ed?

144
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,195
Do you think it's fair to say

145
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,496
that your inability to get
the program back on track

146
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:19,971
is strictly related to recruiting problems
that started four years ago

147
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:21,939
after the alleged
point-shaving incident?

148
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:25,170
How long you gonna
keep this bullshit up. Ed?

149
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,941
You know goddamn well
there was no such incident.

150
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,381
There was an alleged incident
which you invented.

151
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,647
in the same way that if l assert
that you sleep with sheep.

152
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:37,849
then it is alleged
that you sleep with sheep!

153
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,085
- That's out of line. coach.
- What do you mean?

154
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,991
lf you can't take the heat.
get out of my face.

155
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,428
Goddamn it. you know nothing
like that happened here.

156
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,225
Listen. l didn't say that it happened.

157
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:50,201
l merely asked you if you thought
that the allegations hurt recruiting.

158
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:51,600
l didn't say it happened.

159
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:54,275
lf this is the level of questions
l'm gonna get here tonight.

160
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:56,104
this press conference is over.

161
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,975
He's a beauty. huh?

162
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,268
Did you see the game?

163
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,171
No rebounding.
You got beat on the boards.

164
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,912
Yeah. no rebounding.

165
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,474
We're not aggressive enough.

166
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:36,651
Actually. l thought the kids
played their hearts out.

167
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:39,685
Yeah. they did.
They did the best they could.

168
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,413
Don't put the game tapes
in the VCR.

169
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:44,650
- We'll just watch this tonight.
- Not tonight.

170
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,325
All right.

171
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:52,057
You should've pressured
the guards more.

172
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,536
Yeah. we should've pressured
their guards.

173
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,103
but we're not quick enough.

174
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,671
That's the good stuff. coach.

175
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:02,640
You're gonna drink like a fish.
there's some cheap stuff in the kitchen.

176
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,713
Now you're trying to slow me down?

177
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,439
Always.

178
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,510
- How was your day?
- My day?

179
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:15,585
l had 20 first-graders
making valentines.

180
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,960
Yeah. hearts are tough to cut out.

181
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:23,154
Easier than pumpkins.

182
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,335
Yeah. well...

183
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,177
Honey. you okay?

184
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,037
Yeah.

185
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:41,079
You sure?

186
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:46,410
Oh. that damn Ed Axe.
He'll be in on the Daily News rider.

187
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:52,193
He brought up
the alleged incident again.

188
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,294
That's bullshit.

189
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:58,658
l'm looking at my first losing season.
l just can't handle it.

190
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,063
Don't you think it's a bit much
for a 50-year-old man

191
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,568
to be kicking basketballs
up into the stands?

192
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:06,605
- l hope it didn't hit anybody.
- No.

193
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:12,638
l just-- l don't do well
with losing. do l?

194
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:14,440
You've won two
national championships.

195
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,708
Go on.

196
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:17,818
This is two more
than most coaches dream of.

197
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,080
You've won eight conference titles.
l don't call this losing.

198
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,689
You've got great kids.

199
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:25,622
The cleanest program in America.
They all graduate.

200
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:28,729
You make a lot of money doing exactly
what it is what you wanna do.

201
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,762
- l could go on and on.
- No. do. Do.

202
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,093
l'm not going to.
because l'll get angry.

203
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,702
Do you like it when l'm angry
because it turns you on?

204
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,372
- You think it's sexy?
- l do.

205
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:38,835
- Do l look sexy?
- Yes. you do.

206
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,532
Suppose you wanna do
a little one-on-one?

207
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:43,075
Can l stay here tonight?

208
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:44,974
No.

209
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,240
- Oh. come on. What do you say?
- No. Come on. let's go.

210
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:55,417
Come on. come on. Let's go.

211
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:09,871
Why are we divorced. again?

212
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:11,664
Because you're impossible
to live with.

213
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:14,240
- Besides that.
- Good night.

214
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,617
Texas Western 74,
Western University 59.

215
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,224
The Dolphins out of it, now at.500

216
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:07,418
and in danger of their first
losing season under Pete Bell.

217
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,498
ln closing, it is time to tell Coach Petey
Bell of the Western University Dolphins

218
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,099
to take a hike.

219
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:15,634
He has clearly lost the touch
he once had.

220
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,601
This year's team
is the least disciplined,

221
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:20,673
the least fundamentally sound squad
we've seen in years,

222
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:24,437
and his sideline antics are becoming
boorish and embarrassing.

223
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:28,549
To the alumni, to the chancellor,
to the athletic director Vic Roker,

224
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:32,312
it is time to tell Coach Petey Bell
to take a hike.

225
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,648
Move it. move it. move it!

226
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,824
Keep your spacing.
Keep your spacing there. Phil.

227
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,491
Widen out.
Where's the goddamn spacing?

228
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:45,926
When l'm coming down here
and l'm setting this screen.

229
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:48,535
give it here.
Lock him off. Lock him off!

230
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:50,398
Don't get lazy on us. Come on. Rick!

231
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:52,733
Set it. Roll. Tony!

232
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:56,672
Tony. when you get on this screen.
you've gotta get this foot locked here.

233
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,042
lf your footwork is here and this
is open. you're trying to rotate.

234
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,717
he's got all the room in the world.
But if you lock here...

235
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,613
Now try to go this way. Steve.

236
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,449
See? But if you got this foot back.
here. set the screen like this.

237
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:10,852
now l'm trying to rotate.
l can't get there.

238
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,961
But if l set this foot in here
and l rotate. l'm here.

239
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:16,027
Tony. son. it's footwork.

240
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,994
All right. let's go. Let's go.

241
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,661
Got that?

242
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,894
Spin and roll.
Hit and spin.

243
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,936
Move right to the basket.

244
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,335
Free throws!

245
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:34,109
- Tony! Tony. come here.
- What's up. coach?

246
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:36,113
You've been looking down lately.
What's going on?

247
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:38,980
- How you doing in your classes?
- Well. actually. l'm flunking a class.

248
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:40,883
- You're flunking a class? What class?
- TV.

249
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,115
TV? How can you be flunking TV?

250
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:46,317
Coach. that's a tough class.
You don't just watch the tube.

251
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:48,291
How's it going with that little girl?

252
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:51,227
Oh. man. she's cool. She's not
pregnant after all. lt's all right.

253
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,401
Now. remember.
you've got a responsibility there.

254
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:55,001
so you take care of her. all right?

255
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:57,001
- All right. go on back in.
- All right. coach.

256
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:58,605
Mel. come here.

257
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:01,640
Get a tutor for Tony for TV. all right?

258
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:03,835
Freddie. take Tony.

259
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:06,742
Take him to a pharmacy
and get him some prophylactics.

260
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,578
Coach! Come on. baby.
what's wrong? Coach.

261
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,323
When other teams used to come in
and see these banners.

262
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,859
it scared them to death.

263
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,461
All these banners were worth. what.
eight points anyway.

264
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,738
But everything changes. huh?

265
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:31,530
Everything changes. coach.

266
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,005
Yeah. there's very little in life
that man's got a control over.

267
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,370
Things just happen.

268
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:39,172
so when you got a chance to
make a statement. you gotta do it.

269
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,076
We haven't been
making a statement.

270
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:43,774
When we were winning conference
titles and going to the Final Four.

271
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,476
we were making a statement.

272
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:48,053
The kids are working
as hard as they can. you know.

273
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,088
They just don't have the talent.

274
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,283
Yeah. well. l can't beat anybody
with banners.

275
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,985
l need players. l need horses.

276
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:58,489
You got horses.
What you need are thoroughbreds.

277
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:02,733
Well. everybody in the country is
buying these kids out of high school.

278
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:08,604
giving them cars and money
under the table. God knows what.

279
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:11,503
Don't you ever miss?

280
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:16,710
That's the idea of the game.
put the ball in the hole.

281
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:21,378
There's two reasons l'm incapable
of cheating. Wanna hear them?

282
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,989
Tell me.

283
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,624
One. if l break the rules...

284
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,961
...and l get caught.
l'll get kicked out of coaching.

285
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,700
And what's the second reason?

286
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,705
l might not get caught.

287
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,937
Miss the goddamn ball once.
will you?

288
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:43,373
Jesus Christ.

289
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:48,707
You can't even miss left-handed.

290
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,121
All right. does anybody know
what this is?

291
00:18:58,327 --> 00:18:59,624
- A heart.
- That's what it is.

292
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,762
lt's a goddamn heart.
That's what it is.

293
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:04,899
Boy. l'm beginning to think there's
some intelligence in this room.

294
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,091
Now. if you guys show me
you got one of these.

295
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:09,167
we're gonna win this game tonight.

296
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,601
- Tony. you got one of these?
- Yes. sir.

297
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,832
Tony. do you know
what we're trying to do on defense.

298
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,670
- how it triggers our transition game?
- Yes. sir.

299
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:20,178
Do you think the entire team
understands what we're trying to do?

300
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:23,078
Good. because l'm holding you
personally responsible

301
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:25,480
for this whole team
understanding this philosophy.

302
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,212
- Do you accept that responsibility?
- Yes. sir.

303
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:35,052
Phil. get in for Dwayne.

304
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:36,887
Byron. come here.

305
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,432
Nice pass. Tony.

306
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:46,165
Play it all the way through. let's go.

307
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,502
Good steal. Mitch. Good steal.

308
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:53,442
Post him up. Richie.
Post him up. baby. Post him up.

309
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,412
Yeah. take him. take him.

310
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,981
Nigel. get back! Full speed!

311
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:01,917
Pick up the open man. Richard!
Oh. shit!

312
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,419
- Protect the ball!
- Shit!

313
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,860
Get your hands up. Man. come on.

314
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:18,605
Hey. coach. you better
get a new day job.

315
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:23,773
Have you given it any thought

316
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:26,106
you may be 20 minutes away
from your first losing season?

317
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:29,443
These kids have played their heart out.
l'm not answering that bullshit.

318
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:32,176
l don't mean to ruffle feathers.
Good luck in the second half.

319
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:34,787
- Pick up your man.
- Move out on the ball!

320
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,756
Move out on the ball!

321
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:46,225
Pick up on the point guard. make
the point guard have to work in there.

322
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:47,902
Whoever's got the point guard.

323
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:51,470
pick him up high and keep him
going to his left in there.

324
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,567
Set her up. Tony. Nice move.

325
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,836
Take it. Take it. Tony. Take it.

326
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,604
Yeah. yeah. got you!

327
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,079
All right!

328
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,078
That's what we need.

329
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:18,925
- Better get them rebounds.
- Do it!

330
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:21,500
Too many offensive rebounds.
Let's go.

331
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,171
Come on. guys. come on.

332
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,708
Move the ball.
Lay it out. lay it out.

333
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:31,943
- Get back! Full speed!
- Somebody gonna block out Rogers?

334
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:34,445
Somebody gonna block out
Rogers tonight?

335
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:37,846
His tenth dunk tonight. guys. let's go.

336
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:42,654
Get around on him. Ricky!
Full speed!

337
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:44,655
Stop the ball!

338
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,356
Come on. now. don't quit on me!

339
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,158
You call me. now. All right.

340
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:25,560
Guys. Guys. listen up. Listen up.

341
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:29,434
l just wanna thank you all again
for a hell of a season.

342
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:32,004
l want you to remember one thing.
goddamn it.

343
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:34,641
When we leave this locker room.
we're not losers.

344
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:37,869
We're winners. okay?

345
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,642
We're losers.

346
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:42,373
We're an absolutely
mediocre basketball team.

347
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,415
Yeah. but these kids
are a great bunch of guys.

348
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:46,246
l know they're a great bunch of guys.

349
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:47,979
but not one of them
can play basketball.

350
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,750
Except Tony. and he's flunking TV.

351
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,228
What the hell happened?
How did we sink so low so fast?

352
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,296
Kids are going east to play.
They want the television exposure.

353
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,727
Well. that's part of it. Freddie.

354
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,494
but goddamn it. l think what it is
is we've been sitting on our butt.

355
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,364
We haven't been going out there.

356
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:05,597
We expected the kids to come here
out of tradition.

357
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,331
That's not happening anymore.

358
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,975
What the hell happened
to the Jones kid?

359
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:11,202
- He was in our back yard.
- Cedric Jones. l remember.

360
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:13,711
- l had six meetings with his family.
- What happened?

361
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:15,974
We lost him to the East.
to a big bag of dough.

362
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:19,176
l mean. come on. guys. maybe it's time
we should start anteing up.

363
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:22,652
No. goddamn it. We ain't doing that.
We ain't opening that Pandora's box.

364
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:23,847
Ask Freddie.

365
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,289
l don't recommend
under-the-table recruiting.

366
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,156
lt's a personal hell you're in for.

367
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:30,593
Let's get these guys. Goddamn it.
let's get on the phones.

368
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,790
and let's stay here all night
if we got to.

369
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:37,598
All right. tell us about Cornelius Brown.
6- foot-7 power forward.

370
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,330
By way of Pluto.
he's a major headcase.

371
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,304
He can stick it from anywhere.
but. l mean.

372
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,034
l think he's committed
to Western Nebraska

373
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:45,770
with a phony job from
an alumnus congressman.

374
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:47,778
All right. Willy Hutchinson.

375
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:50,975
We heard this guy was on the verge
of signing a letter of intent to Eastern.

376
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:53,279
And his old man's been seen driving
a Mercedes-Benz

377
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:55,479
- since the day he signed the letter.
- Lot of rumors.

378
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,385
There's a lot of rumors.
Do yourselves a favor.

379
00:23:57,592 --> 00:24:00,459
Chop off the bottom eight names
on your list. They are irrelevant.

380
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:02,129
The top two guys
are the ones you want.

381
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,061
Okay. that's Butch McRae.

382
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:08,099
- Chicago?
- Yeah. he's from St. Joseph's.

383
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:11,795
And Ricky. Ricky Roe.
We got him there.

384
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:13,907
- 6'8'' power forward.
- Butch and Ricky show.

385
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:17,670
You get those two guys.
you are in the Final Four next year.

386
00:25:35,857 --> 00:25:38,155
What do you think. guys?
He looks pretty good. huh. Tark?

387
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,988
He's a great player. but l don't think
we can get him in academically.

388
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,960
- You don't think so?
- l don't think so.

389
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,500
- What do you think. Jim?
- l don't think he can play for you.

390
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:51,262
- You don't?
- Too many bad shots.

391
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:53,441
- Can he play for you?
- Well. maybe.

392
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:54,973
Yeah. that's what l figured.

393
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,906
- His mother's a pain in the ass.
- Yeah. his mother's a pain in the ass.

394
00:25:58,113 --> 00:26:01,082
What has he got?
He's got 27 points now?

395
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:07,719
You guys looking
for a Rhodes scholar?

396
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:10,083
Yeah. a Rhodes scholar
who can dunk.

397
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:14,794
- Will you tell Father Dawkins l'm here?
- l sure will.

398
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:17,590
And we can send
these ugly guys home.

399
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,700
Father Dawkins. Coach Pete is here.

400
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:30,839
There's blood in the water.

401
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,742
Must be a point guard on the block
around here somewhere.

402
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:35,745
All right. gentlemen.
what are my bids?

403
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,645
Give me $50
for this strapping young boy.

404
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,582
Seventeen and getting bigger
every day.

405
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:42,188
Dig deep in your pockets. gentlemen.

406
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,984
They say he's a potential
all-American.

407
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,991
And he can read and write.
The boy can actually read and write.

408
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,687
He got 1250 on his SATs.

409
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,391
Ain't no problem. either. His name ain't
Abdul Ahmad X or nothing like that.

410
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:56,695
The boy's actual name is Butch.

411
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,839
With a name like that.
he ought to have freckles.

412
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,409
Now. what are my bids. gentlemen?
Dig deep in your pockets. Dig deep!

413
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:10,449
Hey. Pete. step inside.

414
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:14,687
We're in trouble.

415
00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:16,379
- l think we're in trouble.
- Yeah.

416
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:17,990
How's Tony?

417
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:20,457
Tony's fine. Tony's fine.

418
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:23,187
- ls he going to class?
- Yeah. he's going to class.

419
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,593
He's trying. lt's a struggle. though.

420
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,961
l love him. but if he flunks.
he deserves it.

421
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:29,397
Oh. l'm not gonna let him flunk.

422
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,333
You're here because
of Butch McRae. aren't you?

423
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,166
Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:36,242
- He's something. huh?
- Yeah. he's the best we've had.

425
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:38,605
And he's smart too.
He's got his head screwed on straight.

426
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:40,007
Doesn't make any mistakes.

427
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,979
- His father's not around. right?
- No.

428
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:45,778
l hear his mother is a piece of work.

429
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:48,515
ls a powerful piece of work.

430
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:52,590
l hear she wants money.
She wants money just to talk.

431
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:55,490
She only charges the schools
she doesn't like.

432
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:57,358
Well. did she like us?

433
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:59,465
She likes your science department
a whole lot better

434
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,259
than she likes
your basketball program.

435
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:03,903
l don't blame her.
They have a better record lately.

436
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,539
l can get her to waive the grand.

437
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:11,410
but if you try to bullshit Lavada McRae.
she will eat you alive.

438
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,126
- Coach Bell.
- Mrs. McRae.

439
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:33,527
Lavada McRae.
You have any trouble finding us?

440
00:28:33,768 --> 00:28:35,827
No. No problem whatsoever.

441
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,338
- Come on in.
- All right.

442
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,135
- This is my son. Butch.
- Good to meet you. Butch.

443
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,937
- Thanks a lot. A pleasure to meet you.
- Wonderful game.

444
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:47,845
This is my mother. Miss Dorothy.

445
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,313
Oh. how do you do?
lt's good to meet you.

446
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:53,248
- My daughter Qiana.
- Hello. Qiana. how are you?

447
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:56,356
My baby. Britney. This is Alicia.

448
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,651
- All right. Britney.
- That's Alicia.

449
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,796
Alicia. good to meet you.
Britney. it's good to meet you.

450
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:04,259
lt's nice to meet you too.

451
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:07,299
Mrs. McRae. your children
are well-mannered.

452
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:09,697
That's good Catholic upbringing.

453
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:11,963
You know what. l'm Catholic too.

454
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,435
l'm not.

455
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:16,103
l just send them all to St. Joseph's

456
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:18,336
because the priest and nuns
don't take no shit.

457
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:21,040
Butch. is there anything
you wanna ask Mr. Bell?

458
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,410
l don't know. Mom. L.A.?

459
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:25,848
- L.A. is a long ways from here.
- Yes. it is.

460
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:27,282
That's part of going to school.

461
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:30,083
Getting away from home.
meeting new friends.

462
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,260
We'd love you to come out
to Western and visit the campus.

463
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:35,895
l don't know. coach. l'll think about it.

464
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:38,725
l'm kind of scared
to take the college courses.

465
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:40,895
That's normal. Butch.

466
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,832
l mean. Dr. George Howe.
the head of our science department.

467
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:46,233
he's world-famous.
He loves basketball.

468
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:49,035
Are you implying that classes
are rigged for athletes?

469
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:54,971
Mrs. McRae. my players
take real classes.

470
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:57,048
My players do graduate.

471
00:29:57,252 --> 00:30:00,312
l think the thing that l really wanted
to ask you is. will l start next year?

472
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:03,184
Well. you'll get the opportunity
to start. Butch.

473
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:07,088
l mean. our whole offense is gonna be
geared around the point guard.

474
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:10,025
And that's the position
we'd love you to come in and play.

475
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:13,962
l've been doing some thinking
about this. and...

476
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:16,897
Let me show you.

477
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:19,903
Mrs. McRae. do you mind if l do this?
Kids. come on over here.

478
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:22,133
l got something.
You guys are gonna have a lot of fun.

479
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:24,038
Stand right here for a second.

480
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:27,510
Can l use this lamp?
ls this lamp-- ? Yeah.

481
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:30,377
Oh. Grandma. can you
come on over and help us?

482
00:30:30,585 --> 00:30:33,816
Yeah. come on over here.
l want you to guard this chair.

483
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,717
Now. put your arms out
like you're guarding.

484
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:38,893
Qiana. l want you to guard
this lamp right here.

485
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:40,560
Come on. this will be fun.

486
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:42,229
Now. you're the off guard.

487
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,866
This pillow. this is the ball.
Here you go. Butch.

488
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,968
Okay. you pass it to your mom
over there. That's it.

489
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,195
Now. you pass it him. Mrs. McRae.
Pass to Butch.

490
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:52,737
Pass the ball over here.

491
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,670
Butch. you cut around right there.

492
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:57,868
Throw it in to your brother.
Lay in it there.

493
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,377
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
- Yes.

494
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:05,208
- l have a family to consider.
- Oh. of course.

495
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:08,950
And if Butch chooses
to become a Dolphin.

496
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:12,285
l plan on moving to a new
and better job.

497
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:13,892
l have references.

498
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:15,528
Well. there are rules.

499
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,460
l would also like a house
with a lawn.

500
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,463
My children have never had a lawn.

501
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:25,105
Mrs. McRae. do you know how
the NCSA regulations work?

502
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:29,868
Mr. Bell. l don't know a great deal
about basketball. but l do know this:

503
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:34,673
A foul is not a foul
unless the referee blows his whistle.

504
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:38,049
Mrs. McRae. do you really want
your son to start out life

505
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:40,550
by learning how to bend
and break the rules?

506
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:45,191
What's he gonna be when he grows up.
and then he's out in the world?

507
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:49,489
Now he's responsible
and the leader of other young men.

508
00:31:49,697 --> 00:31:51,221
What's he gonna become?

509
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,593
A millionaire?

510
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:57,524
A white farm boy with a basketball?

511
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:01,398
Oh. l don't know. son. l don't think
you're ever gonna make it.

512
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:04,196
Can't run. can't jump.
bad back. pathetic.

513
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:06,202
- How's it going. Pete?
- l'm doing good. Larry.

514
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:09,501
l was just driving around. l was in
the neighborhood. l thought l'd stop by.

515
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:12,077
Yeah. you and every other coach
in the country.

516
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,181
Well. you know. all those years l spoke
for free at your basketball camp.

517
00:33:15,383 --> 00:33:16,850
those stock tips l gave you?

518
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,643
Cut the B.S.. Petey.
What do you want?

519
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:20,343
- Ricky Roe. You know him?
- Yeah.

520
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:22,580
- Will you call him for me?
- When?

521
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,724
- Whenever you got time.
- Let's go.

522
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,867
Hello.

523
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:35,729
- Hi.
- Welcome to French Lick. Mr. Bell.

524
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:39,134
Thank you. thank you very much.
How are you. Mr. Roe?

525
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,035
- Fine.
- Fine. You can call me Pete.

526
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,472
l'd just as soon keep it businesslike.
if you don't mind.

527
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,839
- My wife. Lucille.
- Hello. Lucille. how are you?

528
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:47,241
- My son. Ricky.
- Yes. hi. Ricky.

529
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:48,972
- What's up. coach?
- Come on in.

530
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:54,553
Dear Lord. we thank you
for the blessings you've given to us.

531
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:55,745
We thank you for this food.

532
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:57,822
please bless it to the nourishment
of our bodies

533
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:00,994
and our bodies to thy service.
These things we ask in Christ's name.

534
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:03,629
- amen.
- Amen.

535
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:07,062
Well. this looks wonderful.
Oh. meat loaf. great.

536
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,766
So. what direction do you see your
college studies taking you. Ricky?

537
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:13,202
Actually. l haven't given it
much thought.

538
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:16,774
Well. there's no reason you have
to decide now. you have plenty of time.

539
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,570
He'd like to take over
the farm someday.

540
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,304
- l would?
- Yes. you would.

541
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:23,945
The truth is. l haven't even decided
if l wanna go to college at all.

542
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:27,953
Well. what are you interested in?

543
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:30,317
You really wanna know what
l'm interested in. coach?

544
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:32,220
Girls.

545
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,960
lt's girls and just playing basketball.
you know.

546
00:34:35,163 --> 00:34:36,858
- Girls and hoops.
- Those are good interests.

547
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:38,429
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- You know?

548
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,498
But. you know. Ricky.
let me tell you something.

549
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:43,101
You know. you got an opportunity
to use your basketball skills

550
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:46,569
to get into school.
and you gotta take that opportunity.

551
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:49,208
l mean. now. don't get me wrong.
we got a lot of girls at Western.

552
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,641
- Hell. we got a million of them.
- They'd like what l can do out there.

553
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:54,678
l think l could go out
to California and just.

554
00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:56,645
you know. show them
what l got out there.

555
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:59,183
Yeah. well. take this opportunity.
get your education.

556
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:01,378
you know. even if you don't
come to Western.

557
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:04,786
You know. the girls are gonna wait.
They'll be there.

558
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,859
- Boy can shoot.
- Yes. he can.

559
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,535
But does he wanna go to college?

560
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,263
Oh. yeah.

561
00:35:18,472 --> 00:35:21,908
And l still have
some influence over that.

562
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:26,144
You know. it's a very funny thing.

563
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:28,315
A lot of coaches have been by here.

564
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:30,916
asking me what l needed.

565
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:34,986
l told them l need a new tractor.
Look at that thing over there.

566
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:39,250
Old Farmall.
44 years old this month.

567
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:42,324
Hard work making it
with a small farm anymore.

568
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,499
All them big combines.

569
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,930
- Tractor. huh?
- Yeah.

570
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:50,069
Now. l didn't ask for nothing.

571
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:53,672
l just keep getting offered farm
equipment by this school and that.

572
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:58,702
Whether it's bending the rules or not
don't bother me none.

573
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:00,574
because they ain't my rules.

574
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:04,740
So. what you're saying is.
somebody's gonna give you a tractor?

575
00:36:04,952 --> 00:36:07,921
That's what l'm saying.

576
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:13,287
Well. l want my boy. if he was
to decide to go on to college.

577
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:16,759
to be with a coach
that's gonna watch over him.

578
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:20,058
Well. maybe it's time
to let him go a little.

579
00:36:20,268 --> 00:36:22,236
Maybe.

580
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:27,567
But in that case. l'd like him
to be with someone who's a...

581
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,573
Well. a churchgoing type.

582
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:37,215
Well. for whatever it's worth. Mr. Roe.
l was raised a Baptist.

583
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:41,119
First Baptist or Southern Baptist?

584
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:45,148
First Baptist. of course.

585
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:50,188
Well. thank the good Lord. Pete.

586
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:54,061
We don't think too much
of Southern Baptists around here.

587
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:56,862
if you catch my drift.

588
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,518
And now a special treat.

589
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,178
Riding with our own Ricky Roe
is the grand marshal of the parade.

590
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,291
the man who went from the
Blackhawk black. white and gold

591
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,757
to the silver-green
of the Boston Celtics.

592
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:24,557
French Lick's very own Larry Bird.

593
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:27,165
Let's give them all
a big French Lick welcome.

594
00:37:56,364 --> 00:37:57,490
Welcome home. coach.

595
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:00,326
- Slick. What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. Pete.

596
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:01,660
- Me?
- Yeah.

597
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,359
l got a hot one for you. baby.
come here.

598
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:05,539
And you're telling me nobody's
ever heard of this guy?

599
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,230
Well. l've been
watching him for a while.

600
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:10,001
Hell. the kid never even played ball
in high school. He went to Army.

601
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,873
played in Europe.
He grew eight inches in two years.

602
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,638
He got too big for Army regulation.

603
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:16,714
And he played a little JC ball
in New Mexico.

604
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:20,148
But when he finally stopped growing.
he got all his coordination back.

605
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:23,881
He showed up at a gym recently
with some pros. kicked butt bigtime.

606
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:25,786
Why are you bringing him to me?

607
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,655
Even though this kid is still a project
with a lot of rough edges.

608
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:30,758
l know your program's
so screwed up right now.

609
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:32,830
my boy will move
in the starting lineup.

610
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,467
You wanna take a plane ride
to meet him?

611
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:36,101
- Plane ride?
- Yeah. see if l'm right?

612
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:37,702
- Where is he at?
- Algiers.

613
00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:39,232
Algiers?

614
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,260
- For chrissake!
- Oh. come on.

615
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:09,163
This guy better pan out.
or l tell you.

616
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,136
you're never gonna come to any more
games at Western. goddamn it.

617
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:06,125
Did you see that?
He went:

618
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:13,798
He ain't just big. Pete.
he's quick. he's got big hands.

619
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:15,969
Watch how he moves
away from the ball.

620
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,105
He's totally raw.
He's never been coached.

621
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:23,970
Jesus Christ.

622
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,773
Oh. man.

623
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:30,217
l'm not gonna bullshit you. Pete.
He ain't no brain surgeon. all right?

624
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:33,818
Took the SAT recently.
scored 520 out of a possible 1600.

625
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:37,684
520? You get 400 for just
spelling your name correctly.

626
00:40:37,892 --> 00:40:40,053
That's it. He messed up
on his name.

627
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:47,898
Slick. what up. man?

628
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:50,127
Coach Bell. Neon Bodeaux.

629
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:52,362
- Hey. bro. how you doing?
- Fine.

630
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,734
Neon. did you ever think about
going to college?

631
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:56,204
l've thought about it a few times.

632
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,311
All right. there's a thing
called Proposition 48.

633
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,743
which says that if your grades
aren't up to par.

634
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:03,109
you can take the SATs.

635
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:06,081
and if you score 700 or more.
you can get into college.

636
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:07,980
Would you be willing
to take the test again?

637
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:10,180
l don't know. man.
Them tests are culturally biased.

638
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:12,222
Well. everything is culturally biased
in the end.

639
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,417
l'm just trying to get you in college.

640
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:17,893
lf l couldn't play basketball. would you
be trying to get me in college?

641
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:22,596
- No.
- At least you're honest.

642
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:24,532
Fill my soul with the Holy Ghost

643
00:41:24,738 --> 00:41:26,729
Please fill my soul
With your precious Holy Ghost

644
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:28,340
What kind of church is this?

645
00:41:28,676 --> 00:41:30,109
Assemblies of God.

646
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:33,371
Pentecostal? Hell. l grew up
in the Pentecostal Church.

647
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:37,381
Please fill my soul
With your precious Holy Ghost

648
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:40,053
Oh, yeah

649
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:44,156
Receive that saving power
Receive that saving power

650
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,926
l promise you boys this.
if you come to Western University

651
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:49,994
you will enjoy the finest
athletic facilities in the country.

652
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:54,361
We got 45.000 students.
60 percent of them are girls. Ricky.

653
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,433
Sports are a way of life here.

654
00:41:56,637 --> 00:42:00,334
Football team's been in the top ten
consistently for the last 20 years.

655
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:03,271
Baseball team is in the
College World Series this year.

656
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:04,944
Track-and-field team...

657
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:08,603
Track-and-field team. eight gold
medals in the last Summer Olympics.

658
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:12,411
And look at this weather. l mean.
look at this. No more cold weather.

659
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,420
Beats the hell out of those cold. harsh
winter nights in Chicago and lndiana.

660
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:17,716
l mean. look at this.

661
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,358
There it is. gentlemen.

662
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,120
Students used to wait all night long
just to get tickets.

663
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:24,923
- Be back in a minute.
- We're on the verge of that again.

664
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:28,329
Have you gentlemen ever heard
15.000 people cheering for you?

665
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:31,993
- Of course. all the time. All the time.
- Twenty. About 20 every game.

666
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:50,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

667
00:42:50,324 --> 00:42:53,122
the starting lineup for the
Western University Dolphins:

668
00:42:55,496 --> 00:42:59,330
At guard, 6-foot-9,

669
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:03,128

672
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:15,542
And from New Orleans, at center,

00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:19,276
number 50,
standing 7-foot-4-inches tall,

674
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:22,944
Neon Bodeaux.

675
00:43:26,794 --> 00:43:28,819
Hey. that's great. coach.
but l'm not 6'9''.

676
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:30,587
l'm no 6'11 '' either.

677
00:43:30,798 --> 00:43:32,561
- l am 7'4''.
- You are 7'4''.

678
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:36,202
Now. listen to me. guys. that's how tall
you're gonna be when you play here.

679
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:40,371
When l first came to this land

680
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:44,533
l was not a wealthy man

681
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:47,305
So l built myself a shack

682
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:49,243
Jenny. Jenny.

683
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,918
l did what l could

684
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:53,386
Neon.

685
00:43:53,587 --> 00:43:56,613
And l called my shack
Break my back

686
00:43:56,824 --> 00:43:58,951
That's Jenny right there.
She's the greatest tutor.

687
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:01,127
But the land was sweet and good

688
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:04,695
l did what l could

689
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,394
Great. that was so good.
We'll do it again in a minute.

690
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:13,164
and you can play for a while...l Spy.
Good. Really. really good. Great.

691
00:44:13,374 --> 00:44:15,365
- Jenny. l want you to meet someone.
- No way.

692
00:44:15,576 --> 00:44:17,373
- No way.
- No. this is Neon Bodeaux.

693
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:19,239
- Neon. nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

694
00:44:19,446 --> 00:44:22,540
l am very sorry. Neon. but l haven't
tutored college students in years.

695
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,116
not since Tony. That's what
you're about to ask for. isn't it?

696
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,116
She's the greatest tutor
in the conference.

697
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,449
The '84 team. she got
the whole front line into school.

698
00:44:30,657 --> 00:44:33,148
And l kept them in school for
four years. but that was then. Neon.

699
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:39,060
Jenny. this is special.
This is unusual.

700
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,028
Can he play with the kids?

701
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:44,761
- Of course. Neon. go play with kids.
- Yeah. go on.

702
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:46,735
- You sure?
- Yes.

703
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:51,900
Look at him. what do you think?
l've never seen anything like this guy.

704
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:53,875
- This guy is phenomenal.
- This is outrageous.

705
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:56,072
What happened to Butch McRae
and Ricky Roe?

706
00:44:56,283 --> 00:44:57,341
Well. l'm working on them.

707
00:44:57,551 --> 00:44:59,041
l never even heard
of Neon Bodreaux.

708
00:44:59,253 --> 00:45:02,711
Bodeaux. Neon Bodeaux.
Nobody has. He's a project. like Tony.

709
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:05,687
Look. you got Tony admitted.
and look how wonderful he's doing.

710
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:07,588
l thought Tony was flunking TV.

711
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:10,923
Well. he's having a little trouble.
but that's a tough class.

712
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:13,691
You know. you don't
just watch the tube.

713
00:45:16,603 --> 00:45:18,628
Neon. please try and not step
on the children.

714
00:45:19,173 --> 00:45:20,470
Okay. all right.

715
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:24,703
Jenny. come here.
Come here. come here. Now. listen.

716
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:29,474
Listen. l found this kid in the sticks
in New Orleans. okay?

717
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,207
He's had a tragic life.

718
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:34,353
l mean. his father was a gar fisherman.
He had a boating accident.

719
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:37,490
he got eaten by an alligator.
l know that sounds funny.

720
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,386
but he doesn't have
any relatives or a sister.

721
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:41,220
and nobody knows
what happened to his mother.

722
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:42,520
Oh. cut the crap. Pete.

723
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:47,159
- Can he rebound?
- He's the next Olajuwon.

724
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:49,164
What are his SATs?

725
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:50,461
- Six...
- Pete.

726
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,161
- 520.
- Oh. God.

727
00:45:52,372 --> 00:45:54,033
Well. those tests
are culturally biased.

728
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:56,141
Oh. now you're a sociologist?

729
00:45:56,343 --> 00:46:00,302
Oh. just this once. Jenny. You know.
l'll never ask you again. please?

730
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:03,483
He is incredible.
He can rebound. huh?

731
00:46:03,684 --> 00:46:06,778
Look at him. He owns the paint.

732
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:08,154
- For you?
- Yeah.

733
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:09,947
No.

734
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:14,393
For Neon. maybe.

735
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:18,691
For Tony. yes.

736
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:21,800
Maybe l'd like to see Tony have a little
help on the boards his senior year.

737
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:23,663
- That's just--
- Don't you kiss me.

738
00:46:23,871 --> 00:46:25,566
- All right. l'm sorry.
- This is not for you.

739
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:26,966
lt's for the ball club.

740
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:29,199
- Now. get out of here.
- Okay.

741
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:30,569
- Take him with you.
- What?

742
00:46:30,777 --> 00:46:33,974
- Take him with you. Thank you.
- Oh. yeah.

743
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:39,509
Happy. where the hell
have you been?

744
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,484
- You know. here. there. everywhere.
- There's a table ready and waiting.

745
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:46,523
Yeah. just one second. l got somebody
over here l want you to meet. Come on.

746
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,260
Pete.

747
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,822
l want you to meet
two big Dolphin fans.

748
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:54,227
This is Wendy. this is Karen.
This is Coach Bell.

749
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:56,664
- How are you? Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

750
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,771
Let me tell you something. that was a
great job you did on that sportswriter.

751
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:02,908
They're all a bunch of jerks.
you know.

752
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:09,408
Hey. why don't you go over to the table.
l'll be right with you. okay?

753
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,645
Let me ask you something. Pete.

754
00:47:13,854 --> 00:47:16,618
Why do you hate me so much?

755
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:20,823
Because l think you
and the 50.000 alumni

756
00:47:21,028 --> 00:47:23,724
you represent are a bunch
of obnoxious slobs.

757
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:25,262
Oh. you're pissed off. that's good.

758
00:47:25,465 --> 00:47:28,059
You're a better coach
when you're pissed off.

759
00:47:29,136 --> 00:47:30,728
Good night.

760
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:35,941
Going home. coach?

761
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:40,344
Why are you walking away
from me. coach?

762
00:47:40,547 --> 00:47:42,879
You never walk away from anything
in your life. l know you.

763
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:45,108
- You don't know shit.
- l know everything.

764
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:47,651
l know what Butch McRae's
mother wants.

765
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:49,549
l know you got a kid named
Neon Bodeaux

766
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:51,724
being tutored by your ex-wife.

767
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:54,223
l know what Ricky Roe
is gonna want.

768
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:57,261
l know the amount of money that it's
gonna take to buy out your contract

769
00:47:57,464 --> 00:48:00,558
is the same that it'll take to get Butch
and Ricky to sign letters of intent.

770
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,098
We don't buy athletes.

771
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:04,270
Let me tell you something.
in case you don't know.

772
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:07,907
Our football team ranked in the
top ten for the last eight years

773
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:11,339
has got a linebacker.
a tailback. an offensive tackle.

774
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:14,343
two safeties and a quarterback
all recruited by friends of the program.

775
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:17,073
- l don't like football.
- They're all graduating this year.

776
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:20,014
We're clean.
My money is untraceable.

777
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,417
lt's been washed. scrubbed.
laundered within an inch of its life.

778
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:27,355
You got a future in politics. asshole.
Why don't you run for office.

779
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:30,923
These athletes generate millions
of dollars for the university.

780
00:48:31,131 --> 00:48:32,860
What do they get? Nothing!

781
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:35,694
What do you get?
You get a multiyear contract.

782
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:39,338
You get a six-figure shoe deal so your
team can be a walking billboard.

783
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:40,938
and that is all legal.

784
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:44,474
And then you get another
six figures for that lousy TV show.

785
00:48:44,678 --> 00:48:46,111
Get out of my face.

786
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:51,810
We owe them this money.

787
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:56,382
We owe it to them!

788
00:48:57,424 --> 00:49:02,589
Okay. Neon. tell me the country located
immediately north of the United States.

789
00:49:02,796 --> 00:49:04,058
Spain.

790
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:08,062
Tell me the country located
immediately south of the United States.

791
00:49:10,404 --> 00:49:13,032
- Canada.
- All right. l'll give you $50

792
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,403
if you will tell me the country located
immediately south of the United States.

793
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,736
- Fifty dollars?
- Fifty.

794
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:21,446
Mexico. followed by Guatemala.
Belize. Honduras.

795
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:25,277
Nicaragua. El Salvador
and Costa Rica. Where's my $50?

796
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:28,318
- Oh. l was lying.
- Crazy.

797
00:49:28,522 --> 00:49:30,717
Yeah. l was married to Pete.
What's your excuse?

798
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:33,854
You start off insulting me with these
third-grade geography questions.

799
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,655
You think you're liberal.
but you're nothing but a racist.

800
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:40,662
- Why'd you score 520 on your SATs?
- Because l wanted to.

801
00:49:41,902 --> 00:49:43,597
That makes a lot of sense. Neon.

802
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,394
When l was young.
my 'hood was so dangerous

803
00:49:45,605 --> 00:49:48,438
l joined the Army. and we invaded
the Persian Gulf for a vacation.

804
00:49:48,642 --> 00:49:49,836
l make my own sense.

805
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:52,344
So why are we here?

806
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:55,140
We're here because maybe l wanna
go to college and maybe l don't.

807
00:49:55,348 --> 00:49:58,647
l won't know until l get in and find out
how much bullshit it really is.

808
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:02,083
Okay. l'll make you a bet for real.
l bet you $100

809
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:05,349
that you can't score 700 points
on your SATs.

810
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:09,757
l'll score 700 in my sleep.
For $100. l'll score 800.

811
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:13,692
Be right back.

812
00:50:19,773 --> 00:50:21,070
- Hello.
- How's he doing?

813
00:50:21,274 --> 00:50:22,741
- He's interesting.
- Good.

814
00:50:22,943 --> 00:50:24,672
Yeah.

815
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:28,771
- How's it going. Neon?
- Your old lady's tough. bro.

816
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:31,974
- My ex-old lady's tough.
- Now l see why you left the bitch.

817
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:35,018
He doesn't need tutoring.
he needs a good kick in the butt.

818
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:36,280
There's a test in two weeks.

819
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,253
- He should sign up and take it.
- Great.

820
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,255
Get your money ready.
l'm gonna win that bet.

821
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:43,429
- Come on. baby. let's play.
- Play him hard.

822
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,589
l got him. l got him.
Yo. man. why don't y'all help out?

823
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,634
Jesus. what a mismatch.

824
00:50:54,374 --> 00:50:58,538
- Listen. let's take some pride. y'all.
- l got him. l got him. l got him.

825
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:01,079
This is like streetball. man.

826
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:02,805
Hey. come on. play some defense.

827
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,847
Let's see what these guys have got.

828
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,650
Come on. make him work.

829
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,497
All right. there's Calbert Cheaney.

830
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:22,963
- Right.
- All right?

831
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:26,571
Okay. so we don't even want him
to get the ball. right?

832
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:28,798
- Deny him the ball.
- So let's shut him down.

833
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:30,499
and we gotta double-team
Cheaney. right?

834
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,338
- So we'll cut Reynolds loose?
- Yeah. let's cut Reynolds loose.

835
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:35,208
and then Graham out here.

836
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:38,043
he's gonna take shots.
so we gotta shut him down.

837
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:39,912
You gotta get up on him.

838
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,610
All right. Yeah?

839
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:43,517
- Hi. coach.
- Hey. how you doing?

840
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:47,124
- Can l talk to you a minute?
- Yeah. come on in. Bring a chair over.

841
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,817
- What's up?
- How you doing. Rick?

842
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:50,860
- How are you guys doing?
- Played good out there.

843
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:53,760
Oh. thanks.
That was a good workout.

844
00:51:54,835 --> 00:51:58,202
These girls out here. l look at them.
l gotta shake my head.

845
00:51:58,405 --> 00:52:01,067
l mean. l'm blown away.
l mean. these girls are amazing.

846
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:03,299
l just shudder at it. but...

847
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,740
lt's great. and l think l'd like
to come to college.

848
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:08,676
- All right. Good. Rick.
- Hey. that's great. Good.

849
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:11,273
So l guess that leaves
a little bit of business

850
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:13,418
we have to discuss. though. l think.

851
00:52:16,122 --> 00:52:17,111
Business?

852
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:21,317
l figure a white. blue-chip athlete
like myself deserves something extra.

853
00:52:23,763 --> 00:52:25,856
So. you know.
this is what l'm looking for.

854
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:28,793
is about 30 grand.

855
00:52:30,437 --> 00:52:32,302
l'd like to have it in cash.

856
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:35,497
and. you know. just toss it
in one of those gym bags you got.

857
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:39,245
You know. l've seen a lot of things now.
l've been around a lot.

858
00:52:39,813 --> 00:52:42,577
You know. they've offered me
this much money already.

859
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:47,713
lf you guys can match my offer.
l'm yours. coach.

860
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:57,227
Get the hell out of here. Ricky.

861
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,126
Goddamn it. get the hell
out of here. Ricky. Get out of here!

862
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,994
Get back in that gym. get your stuff.

863
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:04,500
get the hell out of here
and go on home.

864
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:08,196
Take off that damn uniform!
You don't deserve to wear it.

865
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,638
Get out of here!

866
00:53:10,844 --> 00:53:12,903
Son of a bitch.

867
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:16,174
l wanna know nothing.

868
00:53:16,783 --> 00:53:20,116
You know about your football team?

869
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,015
- l know nothing.
- Oh. for chrissake. Vic.

870
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:24,053
come on. tell me something.
Don't give me--

871
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:28,284
What the hell does
''l know nothing'' mean? Jesus.

872
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,393
Listen to me.

873
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,566
Maybe if just once...

874
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,399
...you get the ball players.

875
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:42,405
we just get things back
the way they were.

876
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:44,372
and we'd never have
to touch it again.

877
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:49,605
How many times do l have to tell you?
l don't want any part of this.

878
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,195
Coffee?

879
00:55:18,535 --> 00:55:20,127
Just tell me how it works.

880
00:55:20,771 --> 00:55:22,602
You don't wanna know how it works.
Let's just say

881
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:25,070
there are friends of the program
who'll take care of everything.

882
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:27,971
l hate friends of the program.

883
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:30,806
Yeah. but you hate losing more.

884
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:34,677
Relax. we're gonna be
on top again.

885
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:36,819
l got a little confession to make too.

886
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,683
l screw a hell of a lot better
when we're winning. don't you. huh?

887
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:30,395
Mr. Bodeaux?

888
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:33,404
- Yeah. what's up. bro?
- Congratulations.

889
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,168
You're the owner
of a brand-new Lexus.

890
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:36,536
l didn't ask for this.

891
00:56:36,747 --> 00:56:38,339
l just deliver them.
l don't know nothing.

892
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:42,616
This one goes to the right
of the blue couch in the living room.

893
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:45,686
This one goes opposite wall nearest
the den. and please wipe your feet.

894
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:46,981
Yes. ma'am.

895
00:56:47,524 --> 00:56:49,048
Are you guys gonna
be hungry soon?

896
00:56:49,259 --> 00:56:52,194
- Yeah.
- Girls. are you hungry?

897
00:56:57,567 --> 00:57:00,468
- Who wants to play tennis?
- l do.

898
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:10,240
- You Rick Roe?
- Yeah.

899
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,382
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

900
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,919
Yeah.

901
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:31,024
Okay. lt's done.

902
00:57:31,234 --> 00:57:33,134
Right.

903
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:52,217
Letters of intent
from Butch McRae and Ricky Roe

904
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:53,889
to attend Western University.

905
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:55,786
He bought them. Charlie.
l know he bought them.

906
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:58,483
- No way. Ed. not Pete Bell.
- Are you shitting me?

907
00:57:58,695 --> 00:58:00,526
He paid for them. baby.
l can smell it.

908
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,794
- Yeah.
- l have a surprise for you.

909
00:58:06,002 --> 00:58:07,902
Mr. Bodeaux?

910
00:58:09,606 --> 00:58:11,938
960.

911
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:15,204
- All right.
- He improved 440 points.

912
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:18,279
- Somebody owes my ass $100.
- Way to go. Neon.

913
00:58:18,482 --> 00:58:21,315
- Way to go. Congratulations.
- Oh. look at this. What do l see?

914
00:58:21,518 --> 00:58:24,385
Somebody take him down to
Administration and show him around.

915
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:25,987
Jenny. l'm gonna--

916
00:58:26,189 --> 00:58:27,918
Hold up. hold up.
You didn't hear what l said.

917
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,059
Somebody here
owes my ass $100.

918
00:58:32,863 --> 00:58:35,354
And as the razor-sharp blade
of the sword of Sir Gawain

919
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:37,829
descends a mighty blow
on the neck of the Green Knight.

920
00:58:38,034 --> 00:58:40,400
through the amazement of the steed
of verdant hue.

921
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,004
and the head of the Green Knight.
thus lopped off cleanly.

922
00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:45,003
- What's he talking about?
- is kicked around

923
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:47,870
like a soccer ball
by Arthur's noble warriors.

924
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:51,241
Whereupon the headless
Green Knight strolls casually among

925
00:58:51,448 --> 00:58:55,578
Arthur's best and brightest.
reaches down. picks up his own head

926
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:58,152
and places it back upon his shoulders.
where. magically.

927
00:58:58,355 --> 00:59:00,118
it becomes part of his body
once again.

928
00:59:00,323 --> 00:59:02,848
And there they dallied and drank
and deemed it good sport

929
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,527
to enact their play anew
on New Year's Eve.

930
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:08,163
But Gawain asked again
to go on the morrow.

931
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:11,129
- The time until his trip is not two days.
- You see these legs. man?

932
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:14,167
The host hindered that
and urged him to stay and said.

933
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:16,168
- Where you going. man?
- ''On my honor. my oath.

934
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:18,807
here l take that you shall
get to the Green Chapel

935
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:21,739
to begin your chores
by dawn on New Year's Day.''

936
00:59:23,346 --> 00:59:25,473
This is a lecture. Mr. Bodeaux.
not a discussion.

937
00:59:25,682 --> 00:59:27,673
- May l speak?
- lt's not your place to speak.

938
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:30,250
Well. l'm making it my place
to speak.

939
00:59:30,454 --> 00:59:33,582
l just wanna point out to this class
that this course is culturally biased.

940
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:37,551
Culturally biased?
What do you mean by that?

941
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:40,730
How come we ain't talking about
African folk tales or something?

942
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:43,126
Well. this is a course
in English literature.

943
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,301
How come we're not
talking about African literature?

944
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,026
Well. because we're not.

945
00:59:47,237 --> 00:59:50,263
l suppose you did read the course
description before you took this course.

946
00:59:50,974 --> 00:59:54,375
l gotta take this up with my coach.
You told me to take this.

947
00:59:54,578 --> 00:59:57,479
- That's certainly your privilege.
- Got me listening to this crap.

948
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,842
- l'm gonna keep my eye on you.
- All right. man.

949
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,245
Thank you. Appreciate it.

950
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:03,948
Now. let us continue.

951
01:00:04,788 --> 01:00:07,723
That's Butch's mom
in front of their new house in Chicago.

952
01:00:07,924 --> 01:00:11,451
The house is in her name with
a co-signer. who we can't locate.

953
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:13,959
The bank officer
who approved the loan

954
01:00:14,164 --> 01:00:15,563
is an alumnus of Western U.

955
01:00:15,765 --> 01:00:17,198
- Friends of the program.
- You got it.

956
01:00:23,406 --> 01:00:26,534
Thataway.
Way to go. Butch. Way to go.

957
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,210
Just go for the front of the rim. now.

958
01:00:29,412 --> 01:00:32,210
All right. let's do
some crossover. Butch.

959
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:35,144
Nice form. Butch.

960
01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:37,513
That's Ricky's dad
in front of his new tractor.

961
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:40,019
Now. we can't prove anything
except Mr. Roe had bad credit.

962
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:42,851
Too bad to be purchasing
new equipment.

963
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:45,823
Now. the biggest distributor of
farm machinery in the state of lndiana

964
01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:48,930
was Happy Kuykendall's classmate.

965
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:52,033
All right. Ricky. use the reverse.

966
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:55,400
Attaboy.

967
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:57,698
That's it. get square.

968
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:00,202
Thataway. Ricky.

969
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,344
That's the Lexus
they tried to give Neon.

970
01:01:02,546 --> 01:01:05,071
He didn't ask for it.
They tried to give it to him anyway.

971
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:12,152
Stay low. don't come up.

972
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:17,321
Extend that ball.
Protect it with your body.

973
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:20,963
Now use your left.
Point the lead foot. unlock the left hip.

974
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:23,189
All right. now take it in strong.

975
01:01:25,635 --> 01:01:29,571
These violations are flagrant.
but the paper trail is well covered up.

976
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,832
We could never prove anything
against the football team.

977
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:35,068
Hey. Charlie. we gotta keep digging.
lt's all right here.

978
01:01:35,278 --> 01:01:37,508
We're gonna get this guy.

979
01:01:38,014 --> 01:01:39,743
We're gonna get
the great Pete Bell.

980
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,612
- l know. it's unbelievable.
- Right this way. Good to see you.

981
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:44,810
- How are you doing?
- Good to see you.

982
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:46,955
Okay. All right.

983
01:01:47,157 --> 01:01:48,715
Looks like you're
back in business. coach.

984
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:51,359
- With you?
- Don't get carried away.

985
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:52,994
- Hi. coach. Hi. Mrs. Bell.
- Hi.

986
01:01:53,196 --> 01:01:54,629
Hi.
So. what did you do.

987
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:58,289
sell them on your recent losing
tradition so they know they'll start?

988
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:00,526
Well. there's an advantage
to having a losing season.

989
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:02,762
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

990
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,440
Well...

991
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:07,842
- l just wanted to say congratulations.
- Thanks.

992
01:02:08,044 --> 01:02:10,012
Getting the players you wanted
without selling out.

993
01:02:10,213 --> 01:02:13,580
You know. the rules. they don't make
much sense. they're hypocritical.

994
01:02:13,783 --> 01:02:16,684
There's a lot of people on the take.
and l can't blame them.

995
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,513
- Why are you getting defensive?
- No. l'm not defensive.

996
01:02:19,723 --> 01:02:22,590
- Coach. may l have your autograph?
- Sure. you may. What's your name?

997
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:24,487
- Andre.
- Andre. Okay.

998
01:02:24,694 --> 01:02:26,787
Saying you're not defensive
is defensive.

999
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:31,127
Well. saying that l am defensive
means l am defensive.

1000
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:34,701
So if l say that l'm not defensive.
then l am defensive. and if l say--

1001
01:02:34,904 --> 01:02:37,702
Thank you.
You know. l'm screwed either way.

1002
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,833
Wait a minute.
look me straight in the eye.

1003
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:44,309
- What?
- Did you cheat?

1004
01:02:47,217 --> 01:02:50,709
No. l did not cheat. Swear to God.

1005
01:02:53,323 --> 01:02:55,291
- You were getting so nervous about it.
- Excuse me.

1006
01:02:55,492 --> 01:02:56,720
- Yes.
- l hate to interrupt.

1007
01:02:56,926 --> 01:02:58,621
Do you think my son
could have your autograph?

1008
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:00,420
- Sure. sure. What's your name?
- Mark.

1009
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,565
Mark? Okay. you a
basketball player. Mark?

1010
01:03:03,767 --> 01:03:05,029
- Yeah.
- Oh. good.

1011
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:08,762
Just a couple of
divorcees out on a date. right?

1012
01:03:09,072 --> 01:03:10,061
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1013
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,331
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1014
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:14,738
Yes. we got a lot to celebrate.
l got a new basketball team.

1015
01:03:14,944 --> 01:03:18,812
And we're not screaming at each other.
Not yet. anyway.

1016
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,417
You know. Jenny.
l'm crazy about you.

1017
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,145
l always have been.
ever since we first met.

1018
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:28,347
Did you know that?

1019
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:32,494
Okay. l just wanted you to know.

1020
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:34,563
Okay.

1021
01:03:34,764 --> 01:03:37,892
Come on. come on. Slide. slide. Move
your feet. move your feet. Let's go.

1022
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:40,797
Let's go. let's go. Come on.
Stay low. stay low. stay.

1023
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:43,905
Move your feet. come on. come on.
Move your feet. move your feet.

1024
01:03:44,107 --> 01:03:46,769
Move your feet.
slide. slide. slide. side. slide.

1025
01:03:46,976 --> 01:03:51,072
Right. left. left. forward.
Come on. boys. come on.

1026
01:03:51,281 --> 01:03:56,548
Come on. Back. back. back.
Forward. forward. forward. Let's go.

1027
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:58,380
All right. let's go.

1028
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:00,886
Two lines. Let's go.

1029
01:04:03,793 --> 01:04:05,522
Get that ball. Get the ball.

1030
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:07,424
Here we go. Get that ball.

1031
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,360
All right. now. spin baseline.
There it is. there it is. there it is.

1032
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:13,331
All right. try it the other way.
Now spin to the middle.

1033
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:15,800
That's it. That's it. Neon. That's it.

1034
01:04:16,005 --> 01:04:18,530
lf you feel his body going on
this side of you. spin that way.

1035
01:04:18,742 --> 01:04:20,903
lf you feel this side...
Feel him. Feel him.

1036
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:23,807
Think. think. think.
lt's a thinking man's game.

1037
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:28,676
All right. hold. hold. Butch.
Butch. wait a minute.

1038
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:31,410
You gotta take that screener.
you gotta make that fake.

1039
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:32,986
You gotta bring the screener...

1040
01:04:33,189 --> 01:04:36,488
You gotta bring that man down here
so the screen can be set on him.

1041
01:04:36,693 --> 01:04:40,424
l mean. you gotta take Mitchell...
Turn around. Mitch.

1042
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:44,225
Take him this way so that this screen
can come around and be set on him.

1043
01:04:44,434 --> 01:04:47,597
Look. Butch. l'll tell you something.
You can even take a shot fake here.

1044
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,500
You can take a shot fake.
lf you get the man going up.

1045
01:04:50,707 --> 01:04:54,973
you can go in this side here. You can
roll this way and come this way.

1046
01:04:55,178 --> 01:04:57,271
But you gotta make a fake
before you move.

1047
01:04:57,914 --> 01:04:59,404
Fake there.

1048
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:03,316
There it is. There it is.
there it is. There it is.

1049
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,546
See what that does? That takes that
man down. Now that pick can get set.

1050
01:05:06,756 --> 01:05:08,485
- l thought that's what l was doing.
- No. no.

1051
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:10,716
You took the ball.
you just took off around that way.

1052
01:05:10,927 --> 01:05:13,987
Play this two-man game.
Son. play the two-man game.

1053
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:15,630
For chrissake.
between you and Neon.

1054
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:18,801
it's gonna be a great two-man
game. okay? All right. let's do it.

1055
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,594

1056
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:23,295
- Hit the board.
- Give it up. Give the ball up. big man.

1057
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:25,406
There you go.

1058
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:29,438
Hold it. hold it.

1059

Butch. get that shirt off.

1060
01:05:32,882 --> 01:05:35,146
Phil. take Butch's place.

1061
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:37,683
You're not going back on blue
until you get it right.

1062
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:38,854
Come on. let's go.

1063
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:40,613
That may be
the whole goddamn season.

1064
01:05:58,641 --> 01:05:59,938
- Coach.
- Yeah.

1065
01:06:00,143 --> 01:06:01,701
- l need to talk to you.
- Okay. All right.

1066
01:06:01,911 --> 01:06:05,039
Hey. Freddie.
can you go run Dennis?

1067
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:07,216
Come on in. Butch.

1068
01:06:07,584 --> 01:06:09,484
What is it. Butch?

1069
01:06:10,086 --> 01:06:13,487
- Coach. l need to talk to you.
- Sure. sure. Go ahead.

1070
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:16,887
- Coach. l'm homesick.
- You're homesick?

1071
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:19,721
Homesick. huh?
Well. let me tell you something. Butch.

1072
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:21,453
every year. a couple of guys
come in here

1073
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:24,132
and tell me they're homesick.
Now. everything is gonna be fine

1074
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,961
once this season starts. You'll see.

1075
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:29,605
No. coach. l don't belong here. l mean.
l've never ran the motion offense.

1076
01:06:29,806 --> 01:06:31,865
That's not my style.
l need to be in a one-four offense.

1077
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:34,270
where l can handle the ball
and dish to other people.

1078
01:06:34,477 --> 01:06:37,469
Butch. let me tell you something.
l don't know if it's the right way.

1079
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,513
- but goddamn it. it's my way.
- Coach. l don't belong here.

1080
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:43,277
l guess what l'm really trying to say is.
if l left school.

1081
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:45,454
would my mom lose
her house and job?

1082
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:53,653
Butch. you know.
l don't know anything about that.

1083
01:06:53,863 --> 01:06:56,923
Coach. l think you're gonna have to
know something about this.

1084
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:59,658
Coach. this is my mom.
this is a life situation.

1085
01:06:59,869 --> 01:07:02,235
l don't know. you know.
but if your mother...

1086
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:05,134
lf you made some arrangements
that l don't know about.

1087
01:07:05,341 --> 01:07:09,607
then l think you're gonna have to live
up to those responsibilities. that's all.

1088
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:12,474
What responsibilities are you talking
about? l'm talking about my mom.

1089
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,843
Well. l don't know. You're the one
that's brought them up.

1090
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:17,019
so you're really talking
to the wrong guy. Butch.

1091
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,381
No. l'm talking to the right guy.
and l'm not leaving here

1092
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:21,147
until you tell me an answer.

1093
01:07:21,357 --> 01:07:26,158
Well. l told you. Butch.
l really don't have any answers for you.

1094
01:07:26,362 --> 01:07:28,990
- l don't know anything about it.
- You have to have some answers.

1095
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,467
Look. Butch. l don't know what kind
of arrangements you've made. so--

1096
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,138
ls there someone you can call
to see if l left school.

1097
01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:38,364
my mom would keep
her house and job?

1098
01:08:02,498 --> 01:08:05,160
Hey. coach. how you doing?

1099
01:08:05,702 --> 01:08:07,329
Butch?

1100
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:12,298
Arrangement? Arrangement. my ass.
lf that son of a bitch is unhappy.

1101
01:08:12,508 --> 01:08:15,170
it's your job to make him happy.

1102
01:08:15,378 --> 01:08:17,608
Listen. you can sell ice
to the Eskimos.

1103
01:08:17,814 --> 01:08:20,840
You can sell this spoiled brat
on how happy he really is.

1104
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,608
l don't even wanna have
this conversation.

1105
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:26,346
Butch's mother has got a new job
and a new house with a lawn.

1106
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:29,389
That is happy enough, you got it?

1107
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:38,133
Better be at practice on Monday.

1108
01:08:49,445 --> 01:08:55,873
Ladies and gentlemen. your coach.
my coach. our coach. Petey Bell.

1109
01:09:11,134 --> 01:09:14,763
- Mel. How are you?
- Good. good. How you doing?

1110
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:17,804
Good. look. Pete left
these tapes at the house.

1111
01:09:18,007 --> 01:09:19,201
Could you give them
to him for me?

1112
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,376
- Sure.
- Okay. great.

1113
01:09:20,576 --> 01:09:23,409
Listen. we're going to the Belgrade
after the show to have some drinks.

1114

01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:41,261
- Hey. coach. what's up. man?

1122
01:09:41,464 --> 01:09:44,900
- He'll be a hell of a player.

1123
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:49,094
- He's a friend of the program.
- Happy is a friend of the program?

1124
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,741
Come on. Jenny.
l mean. you know how things are.

1125
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:02,711
Mel. l don't think l'll have that drink.

1126
01:10:05,154 --> 01:10:07,554
l don't give a damn who does it.
somebody called me on it.

1127
01:10:07,757 --> 01:10:10,282
- lt's all up to Neon and Butch.
- What the hell are you doing here?

1128
01:10:10,493 --> 01:10:12,757
- Hey. That was a--
- What the hell are you doing here?

1129
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:15,487
- What did l do wrong. coach?
- What are you doing here?

1130
01:10:15,698 --> 01:10:17,723
Don't you think we ought
to talk about this in private?

1131
01:10:17,934 --> 01:10:20,368
- Yeah. l better get out of here.
- Oh. there you go.

1132
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,060
- What is this?
- What?

1133
01:10:22,271 --> 01:10:25,035
What is this?
Did you give him a car?

1134
01:10:25,241 --> 01:10:28,540
- Did he give you a car?
- Just a loaner. coach. l'll give it back.

1135
01:10:28,744 --> 01:10:31,440
He's gonna give it back. relax.

1136
01:10:33,349 --> 01:10:36,580
Get the hell out of here. Ricky.
You get home. l'll call you later.

1137
01:10:36,786 --> 01:10:40,483
You son of a bitch.
l do not want you around my kids.

1138
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,318
Oh. your kids? You sound like
Jerry Lewis. for crying out--

1139
01:10:43,526 --> 01:10:47,018
- Get your finger out of my face.
- l did not authorize a car for Ricky.

1140
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:50,597
But you did authorize the friends of
the program to do what had to be done.

1141
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,997
Listen. l'm gonna tell you something
right now. Ricky is a farm kid.

1142
01:10:54,203 --> 01:10:56,899
He's gonna take that car.
he's gonna blab all over town.

1143
01:10:57,106 --> 01:10:59,597
Tell him to shut up.
You're the coach.

1144

Listen. you gotta
understand something.

1145
01:11:01,677 --> 01:11:05,875
The friends of the program are
my friends. and they are friends for life.

1146
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:09,347
What they've done is untraceable.
What l've done is unprovable.

1147
01:11:09,552 --> 01:11:14,012
There will be no smoking gun.

Now. relax. lt's all working.

Happy. you're a scumbag.

1150
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:34,907
l didn't break any laws. You did.

1151
01:11:35,111 --> 01:11:36,806
You broke the collegiate
athletic laws.

1152
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:39,038
lt's your career that's on the line.

l've lived through accusations.
l walked away from them.

1156
01:11:49,525 --> 01:11:53,393
The alleged point-shaving incident?
Think again. that thing happened.

1157
01:11:55,765 --> 01:11:57,733
Get out of here.

l bought one of your boys. coach.

1161
01:12:12,048 --> 01:12:14,744
No kid of mine
would ever fix a game.

1162
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:17,545
Why don't you just go

Happy's full of shit. coach.

1173
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:33,726

1180
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:51,807
- Should've won 20 that year.
- No. this was a rebuilding year. man.

1181
01:13:52,014 --> 01:13:54,209
All these guys were freshmen.

1185
01:14:09,965 --> 01:14:13,128
Guy just blew right by him. Standing
there with his thumb up his ass.

1186
01:14:13,336 --> 01:14:14,928
He pulled a hamstring
at practice that week.

1187
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:17,264
- Shouldn't have been playing.
- He was tough. though.

1188
01:14:17,473 --> 01:14:19,031
What was he doing
playing with a hamstring?

1189
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:20,538
Tough-ass kid from Chicago.

1190
01:14:22,611 --> 01:14:25,205
Now. who the hell did he-- ?
See. there's nobody there.

1191
01:14:25,414 --> 01:14:27,439
Come on. we averaged 17 turnovers
as a team that year.

1192
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,175
Everybody was
throwing the ball away.

1193
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:33,314
Hell. he averaged 20 points
a game that year. man.

1194
01:14:33,522 --> 01:14:35,149
Shit. he was all-conference
as a freshman.

1195
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:37,121
Yeah. on offense.

1196
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:39,327
Run a clean program here. man.

1197
01:14:39,528 --> 01:14:42,292
We worked hard
to keep this program clean.

1198
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:47,428
l guarantee you didn't cover
the spread that night.

1199
01:14:47,636 --> 01:14:52,437
There must have been heavy action
in Vegas. Somebody got rich.

1200
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:56,636
The worst case of ballhandling l've
seen in the two years l've been here.

1201
01:14:56,846 --> 01:14:59,713
Look. he was a freshman. Freddie.
He was making freshman mistakes.

1202
01:14:59,915 --> 01:15:04,909
- He had a bad leg too. don't forget.
- All night. All night. Mistakes all night.

1203
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:07,416
Look at coach on his ass.

1204
01:15:07,623 --> 01:15:10,387
Coach is still on his ass
four years later.

1205
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,089
No way. No way.

1206
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:18,929
Looking at the clock again.

1207
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:22,401
That's a good kid. man.

1208
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:27,235
Now. what kind of shot's that?
What kind of shot?

1209
01:15:29,445 --> 01:15:32,039
- There's another bad pass.
- Shut up. Freddie.

1210
01:15:32,648 --> 01:15:36,049
All right. Tony was my guy.
All right? My guy.

1211
01:15:37,386 --> 01:15:38,978
Tony.

1212
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:53,494
Tony.

1213
01:15:53,702 --> 01:15:57,103
Tony. open the door. lt's me.

1214
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,236
Tony!

1215
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,272
Coach. what's up?

1216
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:04,446
You've gotta tell me the truth.
You tell me the truth.

1217
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:07,241
- What's up with you. man?
- Did you or did you not shave points?

1218
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,782
Coach. man. it's me. Tony.
l didn't do something like that.

1219
01:16:09,985 --> 01:16:13,079
Cut the bullshit.
Did you take money?

1220
01:16:13,289 --> 01:16:17,885
- Did you shave points?
- No. l didn't. l swear to God. no.

1221
01:16:23,265 --> 01:16:24,755
Son of a bitch.

1222
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:28,095
- Come on. coach. l would not--
- You tell me the truth!

1223
01:16:28,304 --> 01:16:30,636
- What's wrong with you. man?
- You tell me the truth!

1224
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,536
Just once! Man. just one.

1225
01:16:33,742 --> 01:16:36,711
l mean. we won
the damn game. right?

1226
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:41,713
We didn't cover the goddamn spread.
l mean. who cares about the spread?

1227
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:44,181
That's just for the damn gamblers.
ain't it?

1228
01:16:44,386 --> 01:16:46,217
Coach. man. l'm sorry.

1229
01:16:55,498 --> 01:16:58,023
l'm sorry. coach.

1230
01:17:03,606 --> 01:17:07,565
Son. haven't l always
been there for you?

1231
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,871
Whether your girlfriend
got pregnant

1232
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:12,809
or you're flunking TV
or whatever the hell it is.

1233
01:17:13,382 --> 01:17:16,010
Are you a better basketball player
because of me?

1234
01:17:16,218 --> 01:17:17,845
Are you a better man?

1235
01:17:18,053 --> 01:17:20,487
Yes. Yes.

1236
01:17:20,689 --> 01:17:23,180
You lied to me. Tony.

1237
01:17:23,559 --> 01:17:27,325
Son. you took the purest thing
in your life.

1238
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:32,263
and you corrupted it.
And for what? For what?

1239
01:18:06,602 --> 01:18:08,263
Jenny.

1240
01:18:18,747 --> 01:18:20,942
Jenny. l gotta talk.

1241
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:24,717
- lt's 1:00 in the morning.
- Well. come on. it's me.

1242
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,083
- That's another reason.
- Why? What's wrong?

1243
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:30,485
You looked me straight in the eye.

1244
01:18:30,693 --> 01:18:33,161
and you lied to me...

1245
01:18:33,562 --> 01:18:38,022
...without a hesitation.
And l believed you.

1246
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:42,226
God. Jenny. l'm sorry.

1247
01:18:42,705 --> 01:18:44,366
l'm so sorry.

1248
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:49,010
So l don't trust myself
around you anymore.

1249
01:18:49,211 --> 01:18:54,410
because l thought l knew you
and l don't. so you can't come in.

1250
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,517
- Jenny. wait.
- Don't.

1251
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,847
No. wait. Listen to me.
Three years ago...

1252
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:03,149
Three years ago.
Happy bought Tony.

1253
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:09,428
The alleged incident is true.
Happy owns Tony. He owns me.

1254
01:19:09,632 --> 01:19:12,100
- l coached a fixed game.
- No. you didn't.

1255
01:19:12,301 --> 01:19:15,293
No. l coached a fixed game.
l talked to Tony. for chrissake.

1256
01:19:15,504 --> 01:19:17,802
Tony admitted it to me.

1257
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,374
- Can we just have a drink?
- No.

1258
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:32,144
l know you're feeling abandoned. but
l can't help you with anything anymore.

1259
01:19:32,354 --> 01:19:34,515
Lock the door before you leave.

1260
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:37,209
All right. boys.

1261
01:20:40,489 --> 01:20:45,153
We got a job to do. We got a job.

1262
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,488
Now. goddamn it. we're not
going out there to make a good show

1263
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:51,029
or just put up a good fight.

1264
01:20:52,234 --> 01:20:53,360
We're going out there to beat

1265
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:56,732
the best goddamn team
in the country right now.

1266
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:02,538
Now. let me tell you something. boys.
You may not know this. but l know it.

1267
01:21:02,745 --> 01:21:03,871
l've been there before.

1268
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,276
There is the talent in this room
to do just that.

1269
01:21:07,483 --> 01:21:09,747
To beat lndiana.

1270
01:21:11,487 --> 01:21:13,580
All right. Butch. the ball is yours.

1271
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:18,791
And our first option
is to get the ball in to Neon.

1272
01:21:18,994 --> 01:21:22,896
And. Neon. goddamn it. you take it
to the basket and you take it hard.

1273
01:21:23,098 --> 01:21:25,293
Now. they're gonna make
an adjustment.

1274
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:29,130
and when they adjust and
double down and triple down on Neon.

1275
01:21:29,338 --> 01:21:30,999
we're gonna move the ball
out to Ricky.

1276
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,269
And. Ricky. you can put it up
from where you're at all night long.

1277
01:21:35,477 --> 01:21:39,413
The basket is the same height as it
was at your father's barn in lndiana.

1278
01:21:40,783 --> 01:21:43,809
Boys. lndiana is over there
in the other locker room

1279
01:21:44,019 --> 01:21:46,317
wondering what the hell
we're gonna do.

1280
01:21:46,522 --> 01:21:48,490
Well. l'll send a note over
to Bobby Knight.

1281
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,681
and l'll tell him exactly
what we're gonna do.

1282
01:21:50,893 --> 01:21:53,191
l'll give him our offense.
l'll give him our defense.

1283
01:21:53,395 --> 01:21:57,126
Because it's not what you do.
goddamn it. it's how you do it.

1284
01:21:57,332 --> 01:21:59,027
Now. we're gonna go
nose-to-nose with them.

1285
01:21:59,234 --> 01:22:01,293
and we're gonna beat them
at both ends of the court.

1286
01:22:01,503 --> 01:22:03,937
And you're gonna play better
than you ever dreamed of

1287
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:07,438
because. goddamn it.
that's what l demand of you.

1288
01:22:07,643 --> 01:22:09,008
All right. let's go.

1289
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:29,125
Hi. everybody. l'm Dick Vitale.

1290
01:22:29,331 --> 01:22:31,424
Tonight is the night
we've been waiting for.

1291
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:36,297
Basketball fever. Unbelievable. baby.
Kicking off the new season.

1292
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:38,973
Western University.
coached by Pete Bell.

1293
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:41,039
two national championships.

1294
01:22:41,243 --> 01:22:44,440
coming off a subpar year. against
the number-one team in the nation.

1295
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:46,204
the lndiana Hoosiers.

1296
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:49,179
Yes. Pete Bell wants to start winning.
What did he do?

1297
01:22:49,384 --> 01:22:51,944
He recruited the best
freshman class in America.

1298
01:22:52,154 --> 01:22:54,315
Three dynamic diaper dandies.

1299
01:22:54,523 --> 01:22:58,050
headed by Neon Bodeaux.
the 7-footer.

1300
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:01,457
scintillating and sensational.
from Louisiana.

1301
01:23:01,663 --> 01:23:03,927
And then he went and got--
You ready for this?

1302
01:23:04,132 --> 01:23:08,432
That's right. Butch McRae.
a 6'7''. silky-smooth guard.

1303
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:10,764
And then he went
and he got Ricky Roe.

1304
01:23:10,973 --> 01:23:14,238
from French Lick. lndiana.
a 6'8'' forward.

1305
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:17,003
Yes. they are ready
to take on the Hoosiers.

1306
01:23:17,212 --> 01:23:19,510
with Calbert Cheaney
and Bob Hurley.

1307
01:23:19,715 --> 01:23:22,275
lt's gonna be awesome. baby.
with a capital A.

1308
01:23:22,484 --> 01:23:24,509
l'm so excited. l can't wait.

1309
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,188
We got an unbelievable matchup.
Heavyweights.

1310
01:23:27,389 --> 01:23:29,687
Pete Bell against Bobby Knight.
the General.

1311
01:23:29,892 --> 01:23:31,951
This place will be
rocking 'n' rolling.

1312
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,957
The Hoosiers are
number one in the nation.

1313
01:23:34,162 --> 01:23:37,723
Western University. quite a
turnaround this season from last year.

1314
01:23:37,933 --> 01:23:40,527
Pete Bell's excited.
Bobby Knight's excited.

1315
01:23:40,736 --> 01:23:42,863
Hey. baby. this place
is gonna rock 'n' roll.

1316
01:23:43,071 --> 01:23:46,472
lt's gonna be awesome. baby.
with a capital A.

1317
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:52,273
Let's go. baby. Heads up. now.

1318
01:23:56,485 --> 01:23:59,147
Let's go. Thattaboy. Thattaboy!

1319
01:23:59,354 --> 01:24:02,050
- Hit the boards. hit the boards.
- Rick.

1320
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:05,489
Come on. Kevin.
you gotta get on him.

1321
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:10,030
Pick up the ball.
Move out of there. Kevin.

1322
01:24:10,232 --> 01:24:12,598
Screen. Screen.

1323
01:24:15,871 --> 01:24:17,998
Nice pass. Butch.

1324
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:20,140
All right. Way to move. guys.

1325
01:24:24,379 --> 01:24:26,404
Beat those cutters.

1326
01:24:26,782 --> 01:24:29,774
Move. Joe. don't stand.

1327
01:24:30,619 --> 01:24:33,110
Rebound! Rebound!

1328
01:24:33,322 --> 01:24:34,289
All right. all right.

1329
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:36,889
Let's get some movement going.
Like if the guard--

1330
01:24:37,092 --> 01:24:42,359
Say. Bob dribbles the ball off.
step up. reverse it. step out and go.

1331
01:24:42,564 --> 01:24:44,964
And then just get some
back-picking going.

1332
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:49,160
Put them in some situations
where they gotta switch.

1333
01:24:49,371 --> 01:24:52,602
We've gotta be alert for the back pick.
They're back-picking us like crazy.

1334
01:24:52,808 --> 01:24:54,708
So when they come up
and set that back pick.

1335
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:57,276
make sure that back man steps up.

1336
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:00,004
Now. listen. On offense.
let's force them to switch.

1337
01:25:00,215 --> 01:25:01,341
You force them to switch.

1338
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:04,951
And set some screens. goddamn it.
We haven't been doing that all night.

1339
01:25:08,323 --> 01:25:11,451
Get out on the ball. Ricky.
Close out quicker.

1340
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:15,193
- Play some defense. Greg.
- Run the motion. let's go.

1341
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:18,660
- Come on!
- Goddamn it.

1342
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:22,997
- Kevin. get out on the ball.
- Beat the cutter. Butch.

1343
01:25:23,772 --> 01:25:25,034
Attaboy.

1344
01:25:26,908 --> 01:25:30,400
- That's nice. Butch.
- Oh. no.

1345
01:25:30,612 --> 01:25:32,773
And one. baby.

1346
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:35,411
Way to go. Butch. Way to go. Butch.

1347
01:25:35,884 --> 01:25:38,546
Weak side. rotate. rotate.

1348
01:25:38,754 --> 01:25:40,244
Blow your goddamn whistle.

1349
01:25:41,023 --> 01:25:44,857
He got that ball on the way up. What
the hell call is that. for chrissake?

1350
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,357
Oh. shit.

1351
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:48,688
l got ball. No help. no help.
Where you at? Where you at?

1352
01:25:48,897 --> 01:25:51,764

1353
01:25:53,402 --> 01:25:54,733
Get one shot. now.

1354
01:25:57,839 --> 01:25:59,602
- Come on. catch the ball.
- Oh. man.

1355
01:25:59,808 --> 01:26:01,366
Outlet! Outlet!

1356
01:26:01,576 --> 01:26:03,373
Give it back. Phil.

1357
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:07,048
Yeah!

1358
01:26:08,216 --> 01:26:10,844
Whole new look. baby.
Whole new look.

1359
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:12,513
Get that stuff out of here.

1360
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:18,585
Let's go. set up the lanes.
Let's go.

1361
01:26:20,195 --> 01:26:21,924
- Set it up. Butch.
- Let's go.

1362
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:24,530
- Look inside.
- Patience. baby. Little patience.

1363
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:27,361
Take it up strong. Neon.

1364
01:26:35,277 --> 01:26:38,713
Bobby starts across with it.
Keith. you're over here.

1365
01:26:38,914 --> 01:26:40,814
Scottie. you step out.

1366
01:26:41,016 --> 01:26:44,315
Calbert starts across.
back cut. lob. dunk shot.

1367
01:26:47,055 --> 01:26:48,022
Good dish.

1368
01:26:48,223 --> 01:26:51,784
All right. Ricky. l want you to fake out.
go along the baseline

1369
01:26:51,993 --> 01:26:53,585
and curl around that screen.

1370
01:26:53,795 --> 01:26:57,788
Walker. you bring it back to Phil. Phil.
dribble it on down. hand it off to Ricky.

1371
01:26:57,999 --> 01:27:00,991
Ricky. you come out to the foul line.
You should have a shot right here.

1372
01:27:01,203 --> 01:27:03,467
Hands. hands. hands. hands.

1373
01:27:03,672 --> 01:27:06,106
- Right through.
- Right there. Phil. hand it off.

1374
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:07,803
Let it fly.

1375
01:27:10,045 --> 01:27:13,105
Basket by number 42, Ricky Roe.

1376
01:27:13,315 --> 01:27:15,613
Move the ball on the perimeter
and screen.

1377
01:27:15,817 --> 01:27:18,684
- Come on. Little defense.
- He's got the ball now.

1378
01:27:18,887 --> 01:27:22,948
Gotta help him. gotta help him.
Nice. nice. nice.

1379
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:24,955
Fast break.

1380
01:27:32,968 --> 01:27:35,402
lf you haven't got the ball.
roll. for chrissake.

1381
01:27:35,604 --> 01:27:37,595
Let's just don't play
this throw-it-up game.

1382
01:27:37,806 --> 01:27:40,536
When you guys are on top.
you guards. make a move inside.

1383
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:43,267
Don't stand there looking
for somebody. get it moving.

1384
01:28:02,164 --> 01:28:05,361
Stop the ball! Stop the ball!

1385
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:08,331
lf he's over his back. that's a foul.

1386
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:11,068
- What?
- l can't see it from the tram.

1387
01:28:11,273 --> 01:28:13,298
- l can't--
- That's bullshit!

1388
01:28:13,508 --> 01:28:15,373
Well. you can sure as hell
see the guy over him.

1389
01:28:15,577 --> 01:28:18,239
Then move your fat ass
down where you can see.

1390
01:28:19,614 --> 01:28:21,411
Stop the ball.

1391
01:28:21,883 --> 01:28:24,818
Basket by number 50, Eric Riley.

1392
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:28,080
He's going all night like that
if you don't stop the ball.

1393
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:30,258
Good hands. Good hands. Phil.

1394
01:28:32,127 --> 01:28:33,754
All right.

1395
01:28:35,063 --> 01:28:36,394
Stop ball! Stop ball!

1396
01:28:36,598 --> 01:28:38,532
Go. l got it. l got it. Get out the way.

1397
01:28:39,301 --> 01:28:41,098
By yourself.

1398
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:51,374
Watch the clock. and we get down
into the last ten or 12 seconds.

1399
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,706
we can take the shot.

1400
01:28:52,914 --> 01:28:55,041
But let's make them work
to play defense now.

1401
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,276
No quick shots
unless it's off the break. period.

1402
01:29:01,256 --> 01:29:04,657
- Jump. jump. jump
- Pump fake.

1403
01:29:07,162 --> 01:29:09,255
Come on. cut him off.

1404
01:29:10,465 --> 01:29:13,366
Basket by number 34, Dan Godfried.

1405
01:29:13,568 --> 01:29:15,365
Here we go.

1406
01:29:17,005 --> 01:29:19,872
That leaves us with, l think, a little
business that we need to discuss.

1407
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:24,208
You know, this is what l'm looking for,
30 grand. l'd like to have it in cash.

1408
01:29:25,647 --> 01:29:28,309
Why don't you just go
to the videotape, coach.

1409
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:30,313
l own you.

1410
01:29:30,518 --> 01:29:33,282
You looked me straight in the eye,
and you lied to me.

1411
01:29:34,189 --> 01:29:35,781
And l believed you.

1412
01:29:40,829 --> 01:29:42,057
Call a timeout.

1413
01:29:45,934 --> 01:29:47,663
Butch. dribble on over here.
Mitch. come back.

1414
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:49,268
get the pass back from Butch.

1415
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:52,372
Give it right back to him
and go down to the low post.

1416
01:29:52,574 --> 01:29:54,769
Neon. as soon as you see
Butch going over.

1417
01:29:54,976 --> 01:29:56,466
you flash out to the foul line.

1418
01:29:56,678 --> 01:29:59,306
Mitch. l want you to come right up
on Neon's man.

1419
01:29:59,514 --> 01:30:02,483
l mean. screen him.
Pin him hard. Pin him.

1420
01:30:02,684 --> 01:30:06,484
Neon. you reverse. go to the
weak side. go up for the lob.

1421
01:30:06,688 --> 01:30:10,283
We've got 12 seconds. Butch. when
you get it in to Neon. you get it in high.

1422
01:30:10,492 --> 01:30:12,357
Finish it. big man.

1423
01:30:13,128 --> 01:30:14,652
This is the number-one team
in the nation.

1424
01:30:14,863 --> 01:30:18,128
We can beat their ass tonight.
We're in this game. Let's go. All right.

1425
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:19,960
One. two. three. Western!

1426
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:21,969
All right.

1427
01:30:22,837 --> 01:30:24,202
Let's go.

1428
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:32,041
Come on. Right now. right now.

1429
01:30:33,915 --> 01:30:36,884
Here we go. Here we go.

1430
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:40,847
No foul. No foul.

1431
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:48,021
Move the ball. Push the ball.

1432
01:30:48,229 --> 01:30:50,891
Now. Mitch. now. Pin him. pin him.

1433
01:30:55,103 --> 01:30:56,661
Yes!

1434
01:31:01,176 --> 01:31:02,541
Yeah. baby.

1435
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:18,517
Good game. coach.

1436
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,265
Way to go. Western!

1437
01:31:40,682 --> 01:31:42,741
We did it. boy!

1438
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:00,699
Quiet down!

1439
01:32:00,902 --> 01:32:03,063
Everybody down. Quiet down.

1440
01:32:03,271 --> 01:32:05,239
Good job. though.

1441
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:14,810
Yo. Neon. Chill. baby.

1442
01:32:15,016 --> 01:32:16,984
- Way to board. man.

1443
01:32:17,185 --> 01:32:19,551

1444
01:32:19,754 --> 01:32:22,450
- Way to go. coach.
- Great game.

1445
01:32:29,798 --> 01:32:32,028
Boys...

1446
01:32:33,268 --> 01:32:36,101
...the rules don't make much sense.

1447
01:32:39,674 --> 01:32:42,336
But l believe in rules.

1448
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:47,044
Now. some of us broke them.

1449
01:32:53,054 --> 01:32:54,851
l broke them.

1450
01:33:01,129 --> 01:33:05,122
l can't do this. l can't win like this.

1451
01:33:07,235 --> 01:33:13,037
So tomorrow. l'll talk to you all
individually about your futures here.

1452
01:33:37,632 --> 01:33:39,827
l love you all very much.

1453
01:33:41,603 --> 01:33:43,867
A hell of a game you played.

1454
01:33:58,987 --> 01:34:01,717
Coach? Coach?

1455
01:34:02,524 --> 01:34:04,219
How did you like
my spin move?

1456
01:34:05,093 --> 01:34:07,994
You did real good. Neon. Real good.

1457
01:34:08,763 --> 01:34:11,926
Thanks. man. See you later.

1458
01:34:31,886 --> 01:34:35,344
W. U.! W. U.!

1459
01:34:35,557 --> 01:34:39,186
W. U.! W. U.!

1460
01:34:39,394 --> 01:34:42,989
W. U.! W. U.!

1461
01:34:43,197 --> 01:34:46,496
W. U.! W. U.!

1462
01:34:55,877 --> 01:34:57,811
Number one. Pete!

1463
01:35:00,048 --> 01:35:02,642
You know. l'll tell you something.

1464
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:06,342
You know. 900 million Chinamen
couldn't give a damn.

1465
01:35:06,554 --> 01:35:08,647
They couldn't care less.

1466
01:35:09,757 --> 01:35:12,157
Not about this press conference.

1467
01:35:14,596 --> 01:35:16,655
But l love basketball.

1468
01:35:17,632 --> 01:35:19,259
l'm a Dolphin and l just love it.

1469
01:35:23,371 --> 01:35:25,703
You know. sometimes the world

1470
01:35:25,907 --> 01:35:28,068
doesn't make
a whole lot of sense to me.

1471
01:35:30,478 --> 01:35:32,776
Except on the basketball court.

1472
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:37,885
And that's good enough for me.

1473
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:41,916
- Coach?
- Yeah. Ed.

1474
01:35:42,123 --> 01:35:45,183
l gotta ask this question.
or l wouldn't be doing my job.

1475
01:35:45,827 --> 01:35:48,557
Would you care to comment
on the rumor that you arranged

1476
01:35:48,763 --> 01:35:52,324
for an automobile to be purchased
for Neon Bodeaux?

1477
01:35:55,536 --> 01:35:57,436
You know--

1478
01:35:59,273 --> 01:36:04,210
You know. Ed. you've just gotta get
your mind out of the gutter.

1479
01:36:04,412 --> 01:36:07,006
You know. you just gotta start
thinking straight.

1480
01:36:07,215 --> 01:36:09,308
l mean. it's right there
in front of you.

1481
01:36:09,517 --> 01:36:14,250
For chrissake. it wasn't an automobile.
l mean. it was a fully loaded Lexus.

1482
01:36:17,158 --> 01:36:20,127
The damn car had everything.
lt had everything. didn't it. Happy?

1483
01:36:20,328 --> 01:36:22,455
l mean. that car was fully loaded.
wasn't it?

1484
01:36:22,664 --> 01:36:27,658
No. no. coach. lt was
a nuclear surfboard. remember?

1485
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:31,004
And the damn thing of it is. Ed. is.

1486
01:36:31,205 --> 01:36:34,732
you know. Neon. he didn't want it.
He didn't want the car.

1487
01:36:34,942 --> 01:36:37,103
He didn't want a-- He didn't ask
for anything. but--

1488
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:39,211
You know. he wasn't for sale.

1489
01:36:39,414 --> 01:36:41,939
But we got it for him anyway.

1490
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:43,811
l mean. and l think. personally.

1491
01:36:44,018 --> 01:36:46,384
that it would've been a hell of a deal.
a good price.

1492
01:36:46,587 --> 01:36:49,681
l mean... l mean. what did Neon
do tonight? Does anybody know?

1493
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:52,189
How many boards
did Neon have tonight?

1494
01:36:52,393 --> 01:36:55,089
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen boards? Well. there you are.

1495
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,764
lt would've been a hell of a deal.
Can you imagine?

1496
01:36:57,965 --> 01:36:59,660
Can you imagine what Neon
would've done

1497
01:36:59,867 --> 01:37:02,597
if we had tried to give him a Ferrari?

1498
01:37:02,804 --> 01:37:07,366
l mean. for chrissake.
he might've scored 40 or 50 points.

1499
01:37:07,575 --> 01:37:11,602
l mean. who knows. Who knows
what he would've done for a Ferrari.

1500
01:37:13,981 --> 01:37:16,313
Now. you know. Neon.

1501
01:37:16,517 --> 01:37:19,680
he didn't take anything.
He didn't want anything.

1502
01:37:19,887 --> 01:37:21,821
But some of the others did.
didn't they. Happy?

1503
01:37:22,156 --> 01:37:25,125
Wasn't there some of the other kids?
What did we give them?

1504
01:37:25,326 --> 01:37:30,559
What. cars? Tractors?
Gave a kid a tractor?

1505
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:34,132
Another kid we gave a house.
Didn't we give him a house?

1506
01:37:34,335 --> 01:37:37,065
You know. bags of cash.
l don't know what we gave these kids.

1507
01:37:37,271 --> 01:37:39,762
You know. they asked for things.
we gave it to them.

1508
01:37:40,308 --> 01:37:44,301
l mean. you guys asked me to win.
and l gave that to you. Right?

1509
01:37:44,946 --> 01:37:47,244
And the alumni are all jerking off
over this win.

1510
01:37:47,448 --> 01:37:50,781
which is the only time the alumni
ever jerk off. right. is when we win.

1511
01:37:51,185 --> 01:37:54,416
Because this ain't about education!
lt ain't much about winning.

1512
01:37:54,622 --> 01:37:57,216
and it sure as hell ain't
much about basketball!

1513
01:37:57,592 --> 01:37:59,025
lt's about money!

1514
01:37:59,227 --> 01:38:01,957
Just goddamn money!

1515
01:38:04,132 --> 01:38:06,157
That's what it's about. Ed.

1516
01:38:07,068 --> 01:38:08,865
And l bought into it.

1517
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:11,561
l bought into it bigtime.

1518
01:38:11,773 --> 01:38:13,638
l'm a big part of the problem.

1519
01:38:16,444 --> 01:38:20,107
Stick a fork in this creep.
because he's done! He's dead meat!

1520
01:38:20,314 --> 01:38:24,478
You're finished! You will never coach
in America again. you got that?

1521
01:38:24,685 --> 01:38:26,585
Why don't you try Bulgaria.

1522
01:38:26,788 --> 01:38:29,382
Hear they're looking for wimps
like you! Whiners!

1523
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:31,649
- Give it a rest.
- No. goddamn it!

1524
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:34,692
Get your hands off me! l can walk!

1525
01:38:34,896 --> 01:38:39,492
Loser! You lost three years in a row!
Gave you everything you wanted!

1526
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,827
There goes Happy.
heading for the cash machine.

1527
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:45,065
Oh. yeah. he's gonna get himself
a middle linebacker.

1528
01:38:45,273 --> 01:38:48,470
That guy's got the best players
money can buy!

1529
01:38:49,076 --> 01:38:52,170
The best players money can buy!

1530
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:58,483
You know. l'll tell you
something else.

1531
01:39:00,154 --> 01:39:02,054
You know. someplace--

1532
01:39:02,256 --> 01:39:06,124
Someplace in America right now.
there's some 10-year-old kid.

1533
01:39:06,327 --> 01:39:08,591
He's out there on that playground.

1534
01:39:08,796 --> 01:39:11,230
And he's playing.
He's dribbling between his legs.

1535
01:39:11,432 --> 01:39:13,900
He's going left. he's going right.

1536
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:18,037
He's already above the rim.
he's stuffing it home.

1537
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:21,174
You know what's gonna happen to
this kid? Five minutes from now.

1538
01:39:21,375 --> 01:39:26,540
he's gonna be surrounded by agents
and corporate sponsors and coaches.

1539
01:39:26,747 --> 01:39:29,238
l mean. people like me
just drooling over this kid

1540
01:39:29,450 --> 01:39:32,476
because he holds our future
employment in his hands.

1541
01:39:35,323 --> 01:39:37,723
l mean. that's what we've made
this game.

1542
01:39:39,627 --> 01:39:41,754
That's what we've done.

1543
01:39:44,232 --> 01:39:46,291
You know. the best coaching job
l ever did.

1544
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,367
that wasn't tonight.
lt was last season.

1545
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:53,028
You know. when we were 14 and 15.
We had a losing season.

1546
01:39:53,241 --> 01:39:56,176
But goddamn it. those kids.
they gave me their heart!

1547
01:39:56,377 --> 01:39:57,867
They gave me everything they had!

1548
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:00,980
They played up to the maximum
of their ability!

1549
01:40:01,182 --> 01:40:03,150
They gave it everything!

1550
01:40:03,351 --> 01:40:06,514
And. you know. it wasn't good enough.
Wasn't good enough for me.

1551
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:10,623
Wasn't good enough for you.
Wasn't good enough for anybody!

1552
01:40:14,795 --> 01:40:16,786
That's pathetic.

1553
01:40:18,699 --> 01:40:20,792
l mean. it's really pathetic.

1554
01:40:24,805 --> 01:40:27,501
l've become what l despise.

1555
01:40:32,179 --> 01:40:34,306
l cheated my profession.

1556
01:40:36,083 --> 01:40:38,074
Cheated myself.

1557
01:40:40,688 --> 01:40:42,451
l cheated basketball.

1558
01:40:46,327 --> 01:40:50,127
There's two words l didn't think
would ever come out of my mouth.

1559
01:40:50,831 --> 01:40:54,096
l didn't think l'd ever be able
to say them.

1560
01:41:01,642 --> 01:41:02,768
l quit.

1561
01:41:04,045 --> 01:41:05,478
Oh. my God.

1562
01:41:21,128 --> 01:41:23,153
To our coach!

1563
01:41:23,364 --> 01:41:25,696
Great game. Coach Bell!

1564
01:41:51,892 --> 01:41:53,985
Come on. pass the ball.

1565
01:41:54,929 --> 01:41:56,897
Come on.

1566
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:01,728
Cover him.

1567
01:42:01,936 --> 01:42:04,370
Pass it. l'm open.

1568
01:42:04,572 --> 01:42:06,597
That's how you do it.

1569
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:09,198
Come on. right here.

1570
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:11,401
Go in. go in. You got it.
Take the shot.

1571
01:42:11,612 --> 01:42:13,079
- Watch this.
- Yes!

1572
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,611
Yeah!

1573
01:42:15,783 --> 01:42:17,512
Come on.

1574
01:42:20,821 --> 01:42:22,186
Stop him.

1575
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,249
What are you doing?

1576
01:42:27,428 --> 01:42:28,656
Pass it.

1577
01:42:28,863 --> 01:42:31,229
Son. throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball. Come here.

1578
01:42:31,432 --> 01:42:34,060
Come here a second. Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

1579
01:42:34,268 --> 01:42:37,169
Son. look. Come here. listen.

1580
01:42:37,371 --> 01:42:40,636
You're too good a basketball player
to shoot that two-handed jump shot.

1581
01:42:40,841 --> 01:42:43,833
You know. has anybody told you how
the mechanics of a jump shot go?

1582
01:42:44,045 --> 01:42:45,672
- No.
- Let me tell you something.

1583
01:42:46,147 --> 01:42:48,138
You know. when you go up
for your jump shot.

1584
01:42:48,349 --> 01:42:50,408
get your shooting hand
behind the ball.

1585
01:42:50,618 --> 01:42:54,179
Get that behind the ball. Get your other
hand right along the side of it. right?

1586
01:42:54,388 --> 01:42:57,755
And when you go up-- And then
release the ball and follow through.

1587
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:01,553
Drop that arm down.
Now. look. get your legs into the shot.

1588
01:43:01,762 --> 01:43:03,286
That's a way. That's it. That's it.

1589
01:43:03,497 --> 01:43:06,830
All right. now. son. let me see you.
Let me see you fake left. go right.

1590
01:43:07,034 --> 01:43:09,594
out to the top of the key
and take a shot. Okay.

1591
01:43:09,804 --> 01:43:11,635
That's it.

1592
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,732
That's a boy. Let's play a little game.
Come on. guys. Take it out. Let's go.

1593
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,210
All right. get loose. Let's go.
All right. move the ball. Move the ball.

1594
01:43:22,416 --> 01:43:24,441
Move without the ball.
