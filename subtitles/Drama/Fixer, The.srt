1
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,752
<i>Okay, my idea is, we find someone</i>
<i>like a Jo Wilf, or an Arthur Taub</i>

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,072
<i>and we get them to buy about</i>
<i>$300 million of debt</i>

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,475
<i>and then pay 80-90 cents on the dollar.</i>

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,232
<i>And let's say it's Jo Wilf,</i>
<i>he walks away with $30-40 million.</i>

5
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,916
<i>This is good.
I've thought it through, I know.</i>

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,196
<i>I just got to find someone</i>
<i>who can actually do this.</i>

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,629
<i>I take my seven percent.</i>
<i>You set it up, you get a finder's fee...</i>

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,319
<i>It's a lot of money.</i>

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,914
<i>And everybody wins.</i>

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,839
<i>Isn't this the scale?</i>

11
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,794
The kind of deal that
Jo Wilf is looking for right now?

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,876
Yeah...

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,710
Yes, but I don't have direct contact
with Wilf. You know that, right?

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,553
Yeah, but you have friends there. Don't you?

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,679
I mean, this is your circle, right?

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,830
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,349
Yeah. Bill Kavish. You know him?

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,954
He works for Wilf. He is a friend.

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,032
- Yeah.
- Do you know his name?

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,440
- Maybe.
- You know his family.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,715
His father was Henry Kavish.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,753
You remember him?
He got into some kind of trouble.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,190
Yeah.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,715
He was caught taking some money.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,871
I don't know exactly
what happened there, but...

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,950
He was fired.

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,155
His wife left him.
Kids turned their backs on him.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,314
He died alone and penniless.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,713
- Bill is his youngest son.
- Introduce me to Bill.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,314
I can give you his e-mail,

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,279
but I prefer not to send
a formal introduction, you know?

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,078
We represent clients
that do business with them...

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,152
I don't want to look like
I'm asking him for a favor.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,390
Can I say that we're related?

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,759
- Can I say that I'm your uncle?
- No.

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,391
No. No. Don't make it a family thing.
It doesn't sound good.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,072
It might not be a good idea
to mention my name.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,276
Okay, you can say you know me.

39
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,555
Yeah, but please don't tell him
you got his address from me.

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,910
- Okay?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,755
Look, I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
It's tough.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,594
You're like a drowning man
trying to wave at an ocean liner.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,754
Jo Wilf is an ocean liner.
He doesn't see any of us.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,795
But I'm a good swimmer.

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,070
- Yeah.
- Don't forget that.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,112
As long as my head is above water...

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,795
Good morning, Bill.

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,310
Norman Oppenheimer.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,959
What the fuck? Are you stalking me now?

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,918
No, I just need
a couple of minutes of your time.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,150
I know you're busy.

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,230
Philip Cohen might have mentioned me.

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,879
No. This is my private time.

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,992
Please respect that. Call the office.

55
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,360
Does Philip know you're here?

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,876
- How did you even find me?
- It's just a business opportunity.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,555
Look, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't time-sensitive. Let me explain.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,994
- Give me one minute.
- No.

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,518
A very high official...
I can't mention his name right now.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,071
Made me an offer
to sell his country's tax receivables

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,753
to a third party for 80 cents
on the dollar...

62
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,514
Excuse me. I have to leave.
This is unacceptable, please.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,791
Bill. Bill, no, I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was worth Jo's time.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,835
Don't trust me, trust Philip.

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,836
Good things come in surprising ways.
You never know.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
You never know, right?

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,996
I mean, what, worse comes to worse,
he kicks me out the door.

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,072
No! Worse comes to worse,
he kicks me out the door.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,595
It is my job to keep people like you away.
Don't you get that?

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,990
- Yes.
- So please, respect my position.

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,350
Stop.

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,870
Please.

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,952
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.

74
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,236
So I'll tell my partners
that we had a good conversation.

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,115
And we'll see what happens. Okay?

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,550
Thank you, Bill.

77
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,193
<i>It's not just about this one deal.</i>

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,910
<i>It's about connecting to people</i>
<i>at the level of Wilf or Taub.</i>

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,153
<i>If only it were that easy.</i>

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,754
<i>Look, I'm meeting a very high Israeli
official at a conference later today.</i>

81
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,759
<i>All I need is to get my Israeli</i>
<i>in a room with one of these guys.</i>

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,356
<i>I don't know if he would get involved</i>
<i>in a political situation.</i>

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,557
<i>Trust me, something good will happen.</i>

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,916
...of chemical warfare on a first name basis.

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,678
Some of them are married to Russian women.

86
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,800
But it should be a real contact
without a drop of arrogance.

87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,156
Well, suppose someone says
you can't trust them.

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,957
You would say it is not a matter of trust
but one of national interest?

89
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,949
There is clearly a problem.

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,593
Is America pushing Russia

91
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,833
away from the West
and into the arms of China?

92
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
Some natural gas experts
in this room will say

93
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,474
that's exactly what they are doing

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,358
by encouraging a pipeline
between Israel and Turkey.

95
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,433
But as I always say,
when dealing with global interests,

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,557
we shouldn't be playing backgammon,
Shesh Besh, you know.

97
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,396
Where you roll your dice
and hope for the best.

98
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,874
We should be playing chess.

99
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,556
The distinguished minister
speaking before me,

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,476
for whom I have a great deal of respect,

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,558
seems to know a lot about everything,
and it is hard to argue with him.

102
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,949
China, Russia, America...

103
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,639
He must know what he is talking about.

104
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,433
He's my boss, after all.

105
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,720
And a very good chess player.

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,235
But, you know, George Bernard Shaw once said,

107
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,919
"Some people see the way things are
and ask, 'Why?'

108
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,074
"I see how things should be
and ask, 'Why not?"'

109
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,190
Thank you, my friend.

110
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,794
- Okay. Hope to see you soon.
- Bye.

111
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,394
...people were there today.

112
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,517
You know, I'd be happy
to introduce you to him.

113
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,471
Shall I tell him that you are in town?
I could do that.

114
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,997
You know, I'm going to a dinner
at his house tonight. You can join me.

115
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,390
How do you know Arthur Taub?

116
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,117
My wife used to babysit him.

117
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,998
And then she ended up working for him,
years later.

118
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,116
They were very close. Very close.

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,999
Why don't I just call Arthur right now
because I'm sure he would be happy...

120
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,152
- Hold on, please, put the phone back.
- Happy to have his...

121
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,992
Welcome to Lanvin. How can I help you today?

122
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,520
Mr. Eshel is speaking in a series of meetings
with businessmen and diplomats.

123
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,831
He is interested in trying out those shoes
in the window.

124
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,516
Sure, may I ask
what line of business you're in?

125
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,877
Well, I don't want to ruin my first
impression, but I'm a politician.

126
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,679
Well, not any politician.

127
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,152
Mr. Micha Eshel is
the Minister of Trade and Labor in Israel,

128
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,640
and Deputy to the Prime Minister.

129
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,838
No, no, no.
I'm the Deputy Minister of Trade and Labor.

130
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,394
My boss, the Minister,
is Deputy to the Prime Minister.

131
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,678
But there are three other deputies,
just to put things in context.

132
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,592
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,273
I'm sorry, but you look too young
to be so important.

134
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,875
Well, thank you for the very flattering lie.

135
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,394
He has a future in politics.

136
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,839
Which is more than I can say for myself.

137
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,594
I might be young, but I'm already washed-up.

138
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,956
- You don't look washed-up.
- Yeah.

139
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,479
That's because I'm in New York now.

140
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,597
New York makes me feel good.
Back home, I look tired.

141
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,716
No. No, you don't.

142
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,520
I've seen your appearances on TV.
You look great.

143
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,711
Yeah, well, that's because
I'm very photogenic.

144
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,471
No, no. It's because
you are one of the few Israeli politicians

145
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,835
who radiates optimism.

146
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,559
Optimism... Yeah.

147
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,632
Well, the shoes I buy today will last longer
than the government I serve in.

148
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,677
Change is good. That's what they tell me.

149
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,070
The fashion world relies on change.

150
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,279
And the Middle East relies on...
How do you say <i>stagnatzia?</i>

151
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,119
- Stagnation.
- Stagnation, yeah.

152
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,275
Once you're in power,
you don't want anything to change.

153
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,192
You can ask my boss about this.

154
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,397
The young Minister shouldn't feel washed-up.

155
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,918
Excuse me for saying, please.

156
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
I can help with this.

157
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,355
Let me try something.

158
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,594
So, you said your wife works for Arthur Taub?

159
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,035
She used to, yes. She passed away.

160
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,196
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,596
It was years ago.

162
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,240
But she was very close to Arthur.

163
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,757
And I would be beyond happy
if you were to join me tonight.

164
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,160
He is someone you should meet.

165
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,078
Yeah, I know. I've been hearing his name
from a few different people recently.

166
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

167
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,560
What's he like?

168
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,994
There are two kinds of moguls.

169
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,712
First kind is like a big ocean liner ship.

170
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,037
Makes a lot of waves, a lot of noise,
everybody sees it coming from miles away.

171
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
Like Jo Wilf.

172
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,153
I think your boss,
Minister Maor, is actually...

173
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,153
- In his close circle of friends, of course.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,876
And then, there is Arthur.

175
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,669
Well, Arthur is more
like a nuclear submarine.

176
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,073
He's quiet. He's fast. He's young.

177
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,512
Extremely sophisticated.

178
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,359
- Interesting.
- Yeah, he's a very interesting fellow.

179
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,558
He likes to surround himself with consultants

180
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,429
who are in influential
political positions, you know.

181
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,675
And he's very good at compensating
his consultants. He's...

182
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,954
Yeah, well, maybe I'll have
my office contact him.

183
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,237
We'll see. I'm not a private person,
you know. Not yet, anyway. So...

184
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,158
Yeah, if you have any trouble reaching him,
please, I'd be happy to help you.

185
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,990
Thank you. Thank you very much.

186
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,991
So where are you staying while you are here?
How can I reach you?

187
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,117
Just a second. Can I look at myself yet?

188
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,270
Please do.

189
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,233
Well, take this away from me
before I get used to it.

190
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,831
There is one rule
every Israeli politician learns

191
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,513
in the beginning of his career.

192
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,196
You cannot wear a suit that costs
more than an ordinary man's car.

193
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
But what if you didn't know what it costs?

194
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,160
I do. It's too late.

195
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,553
Israelis don't like to see
their representatives enjoying themselves.

196
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,790
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

197
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,355
- At least take the shoes.
- No, enough. I don't want them.

198
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,360
Let me buy you the shoes.

199
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,754
It would be my privilege
to buy you these shoes.

200
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,436
- Please...
- If it makes an Israeli leader feel good,

201
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,749
it's the least that I can do.

202
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,071
- I can't...
- No. No. Come on.

203
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,035
Just put them on one more time.
Would you do that?

204
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,190
Put your feet in.

205
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,877
Before you say no, just...

206
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,110
Please.

207
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,910
We'll take them.

208
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,595
I don't want you
walking out of here empty-handed.

209
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,631
- Here.
- No, no, no. I can't let you pay.

210
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,394
- If I take the shoes, I have to pay for it.
- You don't have to. It's done.

211
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,675
It's done. Okay?

212
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,272
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. Yes. Positive.

213
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,110
Mr. Oppenheimer?

214
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,471
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Please.

215
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,550
Is everything okay?

216
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,554
Yeah. Yes, everything is terrific.

217
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,311
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

218
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,600
Jesus. I just realized I'm terribly late.

219
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,670
I have to run.

220
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,152
But I'm glad I bumped into you.

221
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,474
- My pleasure.
- Yeah.

222
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,035
Here, take some chocolates.
They're really delicious.

223
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,070
No, no. I have a severe nut allergy.
One bite, I could drop dead. So...

224
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,434
- Specifically cashews?
- Peanuts, actually. Peanuts.

225
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,797
But this is the one area I don't take
any risks. But thanks for offering.

226
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,793
- Wait a minute. This could really kill you?
- Yeah, yeah.

227
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,039
What happens to you if you take a bite?

228
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,391
Look, if there's even
a smallest trace of a peanut,

229
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,473
my throat closes up, so I can't breathe.

230
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,754
If I don't inject myself with one of these,

231
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,919
I could die in 15 minutes.

232
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,630
Your receipt, Mr. Oppenheimer.

233
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,790
Okay. Thanks.

234
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,110
Mr. Eshel...

235
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,790
Thank you.

236
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,675
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

237
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,629
Please, take some chocolates.

238
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,670
Hey, what about Arthur?

239
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,437
Can I tell him that I'm bringing you tonight?

240
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
Yeah. Sure. Sure, why not.

241
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,760
- Good.
- I'm staying at the Warwick.

242
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,593
You can leave a message for me there
with the details.

243
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,034
Okay. Will do.

244
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
- Thank you. Thank you, Norman...
- Oppenheimer.

245
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,871
- Oppenheimer.
- Norman Oppenheimer. Yeah.

246
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,196
Here. Take this.

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,798
It has my private number in back.

248
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,996
No matter what,

249
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,475
whenever you are in Israel,
Norman Oppenheimer,

250
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,554
if you ever need anything, feel free to call.

251
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,790
This is me.

252
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,834
Micha Eshel. E-S-H-E-L.

253
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,755
Just tell him he is the guy that is in charge
of regulating the energy industry.

254
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,035
Can you do that for me?

255
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
My name?

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,356
My... My name is Norman Oppenheimer.

257
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,393
Yeah. No, Mr. Eshel is
a very, very close friend of mine.

258
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,110
Well, just get back to me, okay?

259
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,350
Could you do that?

260
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,877
Thank you. Thank you.

261
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,560
<i>I got a meeting!</i>

262
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,394
What? With Jo Wilf?

263
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,872
No, no, no. Better. Better. With Arthur Taub.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,640
<i>Yeah, him and my Israeli guy.</i>
<i>At Taub's house, tonight.</i>

265
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,720
<i>How did you manage that?</i>

266
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,032
I told you. I'm a good swimmer.

267
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,790
Yeah, hey.

268
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,349
Could you connect me
to Mr. Eshel's room, please?

269
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,994
Well, could I leave a message?

270
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,794
Norman Oppenheimer.

271
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,275
Did he say what he does?

272
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,671
He's a businessman...
some kind of investment fund.

273
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,877
I'm not sure exactly. A warm Jew...

274
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,916
Micha...

275
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,834
You can't walk in there
with someone you just met.

276
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
What do you know about him?

277
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,635
These things are important.

278
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,429
You want to meet Arthur Taub?

279
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,239
Let me set up a proper meeting.

280
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,472
Are you sure? It seems harmless.

281
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,438
I'm sure. One hundred percent sure.

282
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,838
I hear Taub is like a nuclear submarine.

283
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,596
We don't even know
what this event is all about...

284
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,876
I don't want you walking into
an uncomfortable situation.

285
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,516
Go see a movie. Go have good meal.

286
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,398
I'll book a table...

287
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,910
No, no, it's okay...

288
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,634
Any press about my trip so far?

289
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,077
No, nothing special.

290
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,316
It's better this way.

291
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,837
All right, I'll get something to eat.
Don't worry about me.

292
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,032
OK, but put it on your hotel bill...

293
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,035
the gas company is paying for it.

294
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,994
And do me a favor...
stay away from the Normans, please...

295
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,070
Sure.

296
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,430
Okay, okay...

297
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,070
Wonderful.

298
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,160
Hey. Ronnie, great to see you.

299
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,197
Thanks for coming, I appreciate it.

300
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,070
Thank you.

301
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,790
Excuse me.

302
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,674
Mr. Taub would like to speak with you.
Would you mind joining me?

303
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,078
You can wait for him in here.

304
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,992
All right. Thank you.

305
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,550
Mr. Oppenheimer?

306
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,592
Norman. Norman.

307
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,999
We met, actually, at the Stern auction.

308
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,957
My wife is very friendly with Lili.

309
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,398
By the way, I can't thank you enough
for this last minute invitation for Eshel.

310
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,995
- It was very important...
- And where is he? Mr. Eshel.

311
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,199
He's on his way.
I just spoke to him. I'm sorry.

312
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,877
He apologizes.
He just got held up in a meeting at the UN.

313
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,357
- But he is on this way...
- You just spoke to him now?

314
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,199
Yes. I just spoke to him.

315
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,840
Yeah, he's on his way.

316
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,589
And how do you know Mr. Eshel?

317
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,036
Well, actually I'm helping him out
with some of his American alliances.

318
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,512
He... He's got very interesting ideas
that he's trying to promote right now.

319
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,991
For instance, the tax money
that Israel is withholding.

320
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,436
Well, he has this genius idea
for a third party

321
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,752
- to buy the tax receivables...
- And just so I understand,

322
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,993
Mr. Eshel asked you to ask me
if he can come tonight?

323
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,914
Well, no, I... I told him

324
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,640
about the amazing work
that you have been doing,

325
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,030
you know, especially with the...

326
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,759
The cancer research fund in Israel.

327
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,957
And he was so appreciative.

328
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,631
You do realize that this is
an intimate dinner?

329
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,040
Absolutely. Yes.

330
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,230
And that this is my house.

331
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,317
This is my private home.

332
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,190
- It is a beautiful home...
- Thank you very much.

333
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,956
Now, you can't just walk in it
and sit at my table.

334
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,234
Now I was happy to include Mr. Eshel,

335
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,074
even though I did find it a bit odd
that he would invite himself to a dinner

336
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,560
through someone I don't actually know...

337
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,716
- No. No. We met.
- But,

338
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,156
if he isn't here,
the invitation is not up for grabs.

339
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,835
- I... He's actually going to be here though.
- You understand that, right?

340
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,991
He... He's... I promise you,
he's going to be here very soon.

341
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,673
Okay, well, I'll tell you what.

342
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,513
Why don't you wait for him outside

343
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,593
and when he arrives, I promise you
we will make him feel very comfortable.

344
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,550
You want me to wait outside?

345
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,998
That would be great. Thanks.

346
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,353
Okay. That's fine. That's fine.

347
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,433
I know he's going to be here very, very soon.

348
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,193
Thank you, Arthur.

349
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,156
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,599
Mr. Oppenheimer.

351
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,999
This way, please.

352
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,800
Norman Oppenheimer. If you came
to hear my class, you're a little late.

353
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,714
If I had the time. If I only had the time.

354
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,393
You're busy. That's good.

355
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,437
Someone has to keep
the world out there spinning.

356
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,792
So, what's new? Who's winning? Who's losing?

357
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,633
Tell me something exciting.

358
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,713
Well, I came from
a very special evening tonight.

359
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,156
Very fascinating people
at Arthur Taub's house.

360
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,394
You were in Arthur Taub's house?

361
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,351
Yeah. I took Micha Eshel with me.

362
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,399
Can I introduce you to him sometime?

363
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,994
You know who he is, right?

364
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,912
He's in the Israeli parliament.

365
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,390
He's young and charismatic. He's...

366
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,477
He's... He's sharp. Very sharp. Very sharp.

367
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,995
I'm helping him out a little bit,
showing him the ropes.

368
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,230
I'm helping him raise some money.

369
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,630
Well, he is a lucky man
to have you on his side.

370
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,076
No, actually, I'm the lucky man,
'cause this guy I'm telling you...

371
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,755
This... He's... This guy's the real thing.

372
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,878
He is just an incredible human being.

373
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,716
Well, maybe bring him to us
as a guest lecturer.

374
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,712
- If you say he's good...
- Next time he's in town.

375
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,393
And we should make an evening out of it.

376
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,632
- Sounds like a plan, Norman.
- Good. Good. Done.

377
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,272
I'm heading home. Are you staying?

378
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,351
Yeah, I want to listen a bit.

379
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,280
It relaxes me.

380
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,275
Enjoy.

381
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,115
Hello, sir.

382
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,759
Is it too late to call?

383
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,513
<i>No. No, no. Not at all. No.</i>

384
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,435
<i>I just got back from Arthur's dinner.</i>
<i>Really wonderful.</i>

385
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,751
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

386
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,959
It was a crazy day.
I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry.

387
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,396
No, no. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
It's okay.

388
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,158
No apologies necessary.
We'll find another opportunity.

389
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,840
I told Arthur all about you.

390
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,559
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

391
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,070
- No.
<i>- Do you forgive me, Norman?</i>

392
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,997
Please, don't give it...
Don't give it another thought.

393
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,390
- It's fine.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

394
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,153
Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,636
I'm positive.

396
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,677
I... I want you to know

397
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,636
how much I appreciate
what you did for me today.

398
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,709
I really do. It was...

399
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,036
Nice.

400
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,479
I'm glad.

401
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,233
<i>- Me, too.</i>
- Yeah.

402
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,640
<i>Thank you, Norman.</i>

403
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,076
No, thank you. Thank you.

404
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,952
- Mr. Eshel?
<i>- How do you say</i> galgal anak <i>in English?</i>

405
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,991
<i>You know, the big wheel</i>
<i>in the amusement park, like in London...</i>

406
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,197
A Ferris wheel? It's a Ferris wheel.

407
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,749
Ferris. Ferris, yes. Ferris wheel.

408
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,030
Yeah.

409
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,472
Sometimes you are up

410
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,354
and sometimes you are down.

411
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,119
I just wanted to say that to you, Norman.

412
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,476
<i>I've tasted it on my tongue.</i>

413
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,552
<i>Being on top of everything.</i>

414
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,875
Once you taste it,
you can't settle for anything less.

415
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,199
<i>Do you understand what I am saying?</i>

416
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,316
I do.

417
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,475
I do.

418
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,154
I do, too.

419
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,360
<i>Mr. Eshel?</i>

420
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,039
<i>Mr. Eshel?</i>

421
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,593
<i>It is my great honor to welcome</i>
<i>the Prime Minister of the State of Israel.</i>

422
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>Thank you.</i>

423
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,314
<i>Thank you.</i>

424
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,238
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

425
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,273
For once I bet on the right horse.
It is a miracle.

426
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,073
So, from now on, how does it work?

427
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,358
Are you friends? How close are you?
Do you visit him in his office?

428
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,477
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
I don't know.

429
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,995
I just want him to know
that I'm here for him.

430
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,275
If he needs me.

431
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,760
So have you spoken to him yet?

432
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,274
We've been exchanging messages.

433
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,514
It's not that simple to reach him nowadays.
He's got a lot on his plate.

434
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,876
Well, if you don't go up to him,
he won't know you're here.

435
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,360
Look at him. He is sealed off.

436
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,794
For all you know, he won't return your calls,

437
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,315
even worse, he might not even
receive your messages.

438
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,279
Look, I mean, you need to get on that line.

439
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,514
Jo Wilf, needs no introduction.

440
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,398
- Mr. Wilf.
- Prime Minister.

441
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,233
It is good to finally meet you.

442
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,640
- Great pleasure for me.
- Another picture.

443
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,394
I was very close to your predecessor
as you know.

444
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,278
- Very glad to have you here.
- Thank you very much.

445
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,716
- You doing okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

446
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,637
I might be reacting to something in the room.
I don't know...

447
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,190
Pastor Kermit Little.

448
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,478
Pastor. I'm so honored you are here.

449
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,198
Norman Oppenheimer, from New York.

450
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,114
Norman.

451
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,470
Norman. My friend. Where have you been?

452
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,836
I've been trying to reach you.

453
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,479
- Hanna. Hanna, do you know Norman?
- Nice to meet you.

454
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,439
This is my wife Naomi. Norman Oppenheimer.

455
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,479
Norman is going to be
my special honorary ambassador

456
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,835
to New York Jewry.

457
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,833
My personal, special advisor.

458
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,077
- I am?
- Yes. Of course.

459
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,640
Look around you, Norman.

460
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,600
There are over 500 organizations
represented in this room.

461
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,677
It is a tremendous force of nature.

462
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,319
Unprecedented in our history.

463
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,919
We need to understand
how this incredible force

464
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,596
unites around the issues
that are important to the Jewish people.

465
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,875
And the world.

466
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,110
- Thank you very much.
- No, no, no. Stay with us.

467
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,113
- Congressman Bob Easterly.
- Hello, Bob. How are you?

468
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,429
Do you know Norman Oppenheimer?

469
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,230
No, I don't. Nice to meet you, Norman.
This is my wife, Joyce.

470
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,277
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice meeting you, too.

471
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,750
This is my nephew, Philip Cohen.

472
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,034
I think he is the youngest partner
at Frankle, Zell, Gould and Rudoff

473
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,998
in New York. Right?

474
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,514
- Well, one of the youngest.
- I'm sorry, sorry.

475
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,636
Nice to meet you, Philip.

476
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,519
- We represented Toby Tabatchnik, I think.
- Yeah, yeah, Toby, Toby. Yes.

477
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,432
Yeah, Toby. Toby. He married a Solomon.

478
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,512
Beth. Charlie Solomon's daughter.

479
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,634
Good to see you, this is my nephew.

480
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,675
<i>My job is basically
to help Israeli businesses</i>

481
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,355
communicate with the World Bank
here in Washington.

482
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,272
- My wife, Rita...
- Nice to meet you, Norman.

483
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,955
I'm with the JDC,
Joint Distribution Committee.

484
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,918
Her brother is the chief rabbi of Rome...

485
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,799
- Rabbi Ariel De La Pelgula.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Oppenheimer.

486
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,952
- Please, meet Luis Pascual.
- Very pleased to meet you, Mr. Oppenheimer.

487
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,394
Luis is a Spanish Parliament member.

488
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,352
You know my friend, and lawyer, Philip...

489
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,278
They all come together through Jo Wilf

490
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,756
who is very close to
Rabbi De La Pelgula's family

491
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,194
and of course through him to the Pope...

492
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,436
<i>Amos Chertoff.</i>

493
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,190
Messianic Jewish Alliance of America.
Very pleased to meet you.

494
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,875
I want you to meet a relative of mine,
Norman Oppenheimer.

495
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,555
Norman, this is Jo Wilf.

496
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,715
- Norman is close with Eshel.
- Close?

497
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,959
How close is close?

498
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,556
"Close" close...

499
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,474
- God personally touched me.
- Listen, how come I don't know you?

500
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,880
I know every Oppenheimer in the world.

501
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,759
There's a lot of ideas out there
that are not biblical.

502
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,035
Do you know Steve Goldfarb?

503
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,760
For us at the NJF,
it's all pretty simple and straightforward.

504
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,672
The rule of law. Free and fair elections.

505
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,831
- Meet Sister Agnes.
- Nice to meet you, Norman.

506
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,277
This is Norman Oppenheimer,
a very close friend of Prime Minister Eshel.

507
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,835
<i>- We're the only organization that's doing...</i>
- Gay rights.

508
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,957
...what James, the Lord's brother,
said to do...

509
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,350
<i>The goal is to encourage</i>
<i>positive views of Israel.</i>

510
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,556
<i>Have you met Barbara Klein?</i>

511
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,360
I work with Peter Black
at a hedge fund called Sand...

512
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,797
Our mission is to make sure that
New York doesn't turn into New Havana.

513
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,193
Introduce me to Ariel-what's-his-name.
I saw you talking to him.

514
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,794
- We get you what you want...
- ...and we get what we need.

515
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,956
But everything has to be public.

516
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,190
Next time the Pope is in New York,

517
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,670
there's no reason the only rabbi he sees
is Alan Schweitzer!

518
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,229
Maybe there's something
we have to talk about.

519
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,152
Bill? Bill.

520
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,357
<i>- Be sure we get in touch with Norm...</i>
- Is this a cell?

521
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,239
- Do you have an office?
- ...with Mr. Oppenheimer.

522
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,118
No, but if I want to come visit you,
where would I go?

523
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,272
Startup State doesn't have an address.
That's the point.

524
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,714
- It's abstract.
- We're losing the building,

525
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,918
- that's what's going on.
- That rabbi you spoke with. Blumenthal.

526
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,992
Is he friendly?

527
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,074
Do you think he could help
with Nicole's conversion?

528
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,753
Something physical has to hold us together...

529
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,878
Evidently, there hasn't been a feature film
that's been seductive about Israel

530
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,397
since <i>Exodus,</i> so we're working on
a romantic comedy set in Israel...

531
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,837
Please, don't speak to anyone
on behalf of the Prime Minister.

532
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,235
If he asks you for something,

533
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,040
it is very important that you speak to me
or with Hanna first.

534
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,396
I'm so happy to finally meet you in person.

535
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,551
Feel free to call me.
That's what I'm here for.

536
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,997
My son, Davidy, he wants to go to
Harvard Business School.

537
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,470
He doesn't have the grades,
but he has good instincts,

538
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,313
- believe me, like his mother.
- His grades are good.

539
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,393
But he missed some of his exams
because he had to go to <i>miluim.</i>

540
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,751
You know what <i>miluim</i> is?
It's an Army service.

541
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,320
- ...a few tips.
- What can we do?

542
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,920
- We live in a tough neighborhood.
- To understand

543
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,037
- what they are looking for...
- But he's an excellent student.

544
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,759
Don't worry, all his calls go through me.

545
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,513
So don't use any of the old numbers.

546
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,273
- Thank you, Norman.
- Thank you.

547
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,079
- Thank you.
- Any time.

548
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,237
Here, take my card.

549
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,436
Call me.

550
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,440
Norman Oppenheimer.

551
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,034
Nice to meet you.

552
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,479
Alex Green.

553
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,680
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

554
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,196
So what brought you to the convention?

555
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,240
I work in the legal department of the
Israeli consulate in New York.

556
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,073
Really? No kidding.

557
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,157
You're Israeli?
That's funny, you don't sound Israeli.

558
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,434
I'm not.

559
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,673
Where is your family from?

560
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,080
Excuse me?

561
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,598
Where are you from? Where were you born?
How did you end up here? You know.

562
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,834
I'm from Geneva. Originally.

563
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,354
Really? Geneva.

564
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,433
Any connection to Julian Green? From Basel?

565
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,190
No.

566
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,591
No? Well, he's a big supporter
of the Israel Museum.

567
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,516
Could I introduce you to him some time?

568
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,638
You want to sit here?

569
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,472
If you want to? I mean, you got work to do,
I'm not gonna bother you. I promise.

570
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,960
It's all right.

571
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,437
Can I ask you something?

572
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,635
What is it you actually deal with?

573
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,793
Like commerce agreements or...

574
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,917
That's a different department.

575
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,550
We're an arm of the Israeli Justice Ministry
in the United States.

576
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,671
Okay, so if an Israeli criminal
flees to the U.S.,

577
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,150
it's your job to bring him back?

578
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,516
- We would be involved in that, yeah.
- Yeah.

579
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,674
The same if an American criminal
tries to hide out in Israel.

580
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,274
Yeah, that, too.

581
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,314
You must have some
really interesting stories.

582
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,037
Like, you know, those Russian oligarchs.

583
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,079
They're wanted all over the world,
but they're looking for asylum in Israel.

584
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,437
Can you give me the inside story
on how that whole thing works?

585
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,150
Sorry.

586
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,079
Do you know Carol Raskin?

587
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,951
You know, I may be wrong about this,
but I think she's actually the one who wrote

588
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,396
a lot of those international treaties
they're talking about.

589
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,870
She's a very close friend of mine.

590
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,758
I'd be very happy to introduce you to her.

591
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,354
No, no, no. That's not necessary.

592
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,954
I wouldn't want to bother her.

593
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,953
You have a family? Kids?

594
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,913
- Family?
- I'm sorry. What?

595
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,071
Do you have a family? Kids?

596
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,434
A partner.

597
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,359
You're a lesbian?

598
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,790
- Yeah?
- Yes. I am.

599
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,512
That's great! Good for you. That's terrific.

600
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,754
- What is?
- No, it's just wonderful.

601
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,638
I love that, when people know what they want.

602
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,319
You know, and they just...

603
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,834
No, it's a good thing.

604
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,152
I have a very close friend, a rabbi,
professor Nathaniel Lewis,

605
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,879
he teaches at JTS.

606
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,193
His daughter started a
Jewish lesbian organization.

607
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,397
Abigail Lewis. Do you know her?

608
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,516
No.

609
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,274
No? No? She's a... You would love her.

610
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,999
She's a wonderful, wonderful person.

611
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,549
I'd be happy to put the two of you together.

612
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,314
Look, it's the third time in five minutes

613
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,440
that you've tried to introduce me to someone.

614
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,994
Why are you trying to get me to meet people?

615
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,673
Do I look lonely?

616
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,355
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to embarrass you.

617
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,432
If I did that, I apologize.

618
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,955
I appreciate you trying to help connect me.

619
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,475
It's just that I don't need connections now.

620
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,514
Okay. So what do you need?

621
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,920
- What do I need?
- Yeah.

622
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,434
I'm offering my services.

623
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,910
What do you need? I'll help you get it.

624
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,673
I need many things, but not
necessarily things you can help me with.

625
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,154
Try me.

626
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,399
I need the satisfaction of knowing
that I'm doing good in the world.

627
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,719
That's a big one.

628
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,870
You win.

629
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,795
What about you?

630
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,277
Do you have family? Kids?

631
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,559
Yeah, I have a daughter.

632
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,030
She just finished graduate school.

633
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,231
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

634
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,549
Yeah.

635
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,200
Her mother died when she was three.

636
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,278
Sorry to hear that.

637
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,829
So you raised your daughter alone?

638
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,440
I did the best I could, yeah.

639
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,312
And why were you at the convention?

640
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,074
I noticed you were speaking
with the Prime Minister.

641
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,594
You know him well?

642
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,519
Yes. Yes. I do.

643
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,792
Micha is a close friend.

644
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,318
How did you meet him?

645
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,351
I bought him a pair of shoes.

646
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,950
- What? You bought him a pair of shoes?
- You never know.

647
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,477
You never know, you never know.

648
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,599
What do you mean
you bought him a pair of shoes?

649
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,399
You never know.

650
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,232
A pair of shoes.

651
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,991
The most expensive shoes in all of New York,

652
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,313
but the best investment I made my whole life.

653
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,234
May I ask what you do for a living?

654
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,277
Sure. I'm a businessman.

655
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,112
What sort of business?

656
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,238
Consulting. Mostly.

657
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,958
Who do you consult?

658
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,150
Well, businesses, organizations, individuals.
It varies, you know.

659
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,520
Sometimes I consult other consultants.

660
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,318
But do you have a specific area of expertise?

661
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,873
Can you explain to me
how your business works?

662
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,794
If it is not too complicated. I'm curious.

663
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,150
<i>Hello?</i>

664
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,590
Hi. It's Alex. From the train just now.

665
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,676
<i>Alex. I was just getting into a cab.</i>

666
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,752
<i>Should I give you a ride? Where are you?</i>

667
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,437
I'm still at Penn Station.

668
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,832
<i>Are you on the street?</i>

669
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,278
No. I'm still inside.

670
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,431
I just realized
you didn't have my telephone number.

671
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,716
So I just wanted you to have it.

672
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,592
Norman, are you okay?

673
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,397
<i>Yes, of course I am.</i>
<i>No. Everything is perfect.</i>

674
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,151
<i>Couldn't be better. No.</i>
<i>This whole evening has been like...</i>

675
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,391
<i>Been like floating on a cloud.</i>

676
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,234
<i>May I have your attention, please,</i>
<i>Amtrak passengers?</i>

677
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,232
<i>All ticketed passengers</i>

678
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,553
<i>are required to have valid identification</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

679
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,839
<i>Randomly selected passengers,</i>
<i>their baggage, handbags...</i>

680
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,511
Everybody, go home. Go to sleep.

681
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,916
The historical bond between
the United States and Israel

682
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,640
has never been stronger, you can all relax.

683
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,833
At least till tomorrow morning. Right, Duby?

684
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,515
If I have to shake one more hand tonight,
my fingers will fall off.

685
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,673
One more hand to shake, I'm afraid.

686
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,229
Bruce Schwartz.
Special Middle East Coordinator.

687
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,794
It's good to finally meet in person,
Prime Minister.

688
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,916
We don't have to shake hands.

689
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,400
You're not going to make me
put on my shoes, are you?

690
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,439
No. No. No. This is as informal as could be.

691
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,989
Good. The formal me needs a rest.

692
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,474
Bruce would like to go over some points

693
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,756
before tomorrow's meeting with the President.

694
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,991
Well, it's less about
your meeting with the President

695
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,037
and more about the statements
you will be delivering

696
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,156
elsewhere around town.

697
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,994
Now, as someone who occupies
a fairly tough job himself...

698
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,514
Excuse me, let me stop you. Please.

699
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,240
Tell the President that
I am here to say "yes" to peace.

700
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,710
I'm sorry "state of peace",
as we agreed to call it.

701
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,237
I fully accept his vision.
I understand it and I believe in it.

702
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,950
No internal politics will change
my commitment to the Wye document.

703
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,396
This evening I had to...

704
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,239
How do you say <i>mas sefataim?</i>

705
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,677
- To pay lip service.
- Yeah, I had to pay lip service

706
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,710
to a few organizations on a few minor issues,
but I promise you, it has no substance.

707
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,879
Well, I'm sure the President will be very...

708
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,111
You know what I've found out
in the last couple of weeks

709
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,395
since I was elected?

710
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,790
Maybe the President can identify with me.

711
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,150
For the first time,
I don't have political worries.

712
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,996
Somehow, God put me in this job.

713
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,675
It's not that I didn't work very hard
to get here, I did,

714
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,959
but hundreds of other potential leaders
worked and campaigned just as hard as I did,

715
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,556
and for some reason,
I'm the one sitting in this chair today.

716
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,190
The top spot.
I've reached the top of the ladder.

717
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,552
Why me and not someone else?

718
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,633
Who knows?
Believe me, I'm as surprised as anyone else.

719
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,473
But this is the interesting thing,

720
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,315
instead of feeling the burden
of that great responsibility,

721
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,638
I'm feeling...

722
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,030
How do you say <i>goral?</i>

723
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,472
- Fate.
- Fate. I feel fate.

724
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,916
If God put me here,
he must have had a good reason.

725
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,591
Now, I'm not free to run away from this job,

726
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,115
but to be honest,
no single human being can really claim

727
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,839
to be big enough for this job either.

728
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,037
I would be very happy
to go over our itinerary...

729
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,476
What is it that really worries the President?
Tell me.

730
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,432
What doesn't he want me to say?

731
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,073
Well, you have been saying
different things in different forums.

732
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,391
And I think we're just trying
to get a better understanding

733
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,518
of what is the singular message
you wish to deliver.

734
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,478
The "singular message"?

735
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,393
You were there tonight, right?

736
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,394
Hanna? Hanna, how many
completely opposing organization leaders

737
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,631
came up to me and said, "We're behind you"?

738
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,079
Fifty? 100?

739
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,073
Each with a completely different agenda.

740
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,598
There is no such thing as a singular message.

741
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,956
And anyone who tells you
he's got a singular message

742
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,953
is probably teaching at a university
or writing a blog.

743
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,670
- Okay, I didn't mean it that way, I'm sorry...
- I'll tell you what my singular message is.

744
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,752
I'm going to end this conflict.

745
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,674
How? I'm going to say "yes" to compromise.

746
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,638
To everybody!

747
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,600
Because the opposite of compromise
is not idealism.

748
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,798
The opposite of compromise is not integrity.

749
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,438
The opposite of compromise
is fanaticism and death.

750
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,316
Life is compromise.

751
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,676
I not only believe in that, that is who I am.

752
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,480
That is why I'm here, in this position.

753
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,475
If it works,

754
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,839
I will go down in history
as the leader who ended this epic conflict.

755
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,996
If I'm wrong, and my compromise
leads to another catastrophic bloody war,

756
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,357
I will blame God for giving me a role
I was clearly incapable of performing.

757
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,115
Look who showed up.

758
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,510
Our savior has finally arrived.

759
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,114
Sorry I'm late.

760
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,389
No reason to kill me.
Can you get rid of the nuts, please?

761
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,590
The situation is very simple.

762
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,798
The National Council
has decided to sell the building.

763
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,072
To be practical, we need to raise
approximately $14 million

764
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,232
to save us from the wrecking ball
and ensure our future here.

765
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,760
Or we start wandering
from one temporary arrangement to another

766
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,197
which, in my humble opinion,
would mean the end of this community.

767
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,714
Exactly what we talked about before...

768
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,757
Okay. Well, all right, let's not despair.

769
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,560
This is where our friend
Norman Oppenheimer comes in.

770
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,515
Norman?

771
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,113
Norman, Philip tells me you can help me.

772
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,431
You will have my best effort, yes.

773
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,318
Here, talk to Bill.

774
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,517
- Norman, this is Bill.
- Is Jo still there? Can he hear me?

775
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,795
Jo had to step out.

776
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,872
- Let me tell you what we need.
- Okay.

777
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,715
Colleague of ours needs a friendly
introduction at the State Department.

778
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,029
- State Department?
- Yes.

779
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,600
<i>And if Eshel can help us with that,</i>

780
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,717
<i>we'll see what we can do</i>
<i>about your synagogue situation.</i>

781
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,756
All right, I got it.

782
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,274
Hanna, Hanna, please,

783
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,750
just give me a minute with him on the phone.
One minute.

784
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,674
I'm sorry, Norman. The Prime Minister
is not available to speak right now.

785
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,037
Look, Hanna, this is a special request.

786
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,510
The Prime Minister asked me
to look into it, okay?

787
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,831
<i>These are just very busy days for us.</i>

788
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,118
Unfortunately, I can't be more specific,
but I'm sure you understand.

789
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,396
I understand, of course I understand.

790
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,278
All right. All right, all right, all right.

791
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,589
Please tell the Prime Minister

792
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,876
<i>it would be great</i>
<i>if we had a short conversation</i>

793
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,431
<i>about a certain individual</i>
<i>who's on the board of the dean's advisory</i>

794
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,000
<i>at Harvard Business School.</i>

795
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,432
Okay, Norman. Thank you.

796
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,352
No, no. Thank you, Hanna.
Thank you very much.

797
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,352
You can go back to your
very important work right now.

798
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,636
I know, I'm sorry for interrupting you.

799
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,360
And you're doing a great job.
I mean that, a really great job.

800
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,709
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- The prime minister appreciates it.

801
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,440
Just don't forget me.

802
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,075
What do I do with him?

803
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,676
Norman does not get past you. No matter what.

804
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,155
If he gets obsessive...

805
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,199
...take his call once every few days
so he doesn't get paranoid.

806
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,397
Do you think the PM asked him for something?

807
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,751
Isn't Davidy applying to Harvard?

808
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,796
I don't care.

809
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,234
Don't worry about Norman.

810
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:55,600
In his head, he just had a conversation
with the Prime Minister of Israel.

811
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,480
Yeah, I got a call
with Eshel this evening, but,

812
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,519
you know, I brought it up with his main man,
Duby already.

813
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,717
I think it's going to be okay. He's...

814
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,712
He's being very practical about things.

815
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,918
He says he can fix it,
but he wants the exact information,

816
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,674
so if you can send me an email
with your colleague's name please...

817
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,276
No. No e-mails, Norman.
His name is Matthias Kone.

818
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,757
He is an official in the treasury department
in the Ivory Coast.

819
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,832
<i>Eshel's office will need to reach out to him.</i>

820
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,673
<i>We are not involved.</i>

821
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,955
Rabbi! It's Norman.

822
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,600
I know, I've been calling you all morning.
Why don't you answer your phone?

823
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,319
I'm answering now.
Do you want to hear what I have to say?

824
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,312
Yeah. You spoke to him? What did he say?

825
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,234
Let's just say, get ready for a big surprise.

826
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,516
How many zeros
are at the end of this surprise?

827
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,114
- Can you tell me that at least?
<i>- Come on.</i>

828
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,199
A considerable surprise. That's it.

829
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,316
I gotta go, Rabbi.

830
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,790
No, no, Norman, you realize
how important this is, right?

831
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,200
We are going to get kicked out of here.

832
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,636
You need to give us a firm answer.
No games, Norman.

833
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,995
<i>- Hold on. Hold...</i>
- No time for...

834
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,150
<i>I can't hear a word you're saying.</i>

835
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,720
<i>Norman? Norman?</i>

836
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,633
God damn it!

837
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,677
How is the rabbi
connected to this again, Norman?

838
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,519
<i>Remind me. Why am I doing this?</i>

839
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,195
<i>Do you want Rabbi Blumenthal</i>
<i>to marry you or not?</i>

840
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,233
All you have to do is you pick up the phone,

841
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,030
call one of your buddies at Harvard
on behalf of the Prime Minister of Israel.

842
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,992
Is that really so difficult for you?

843
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,830
Don't belittle what I'm doing, okay?
In the world of Harvard admissions,

844
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,431
this is the biggest no-no in the book.
It's like incest. It's taboo.

845
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,116
That's funny, because Rabbi Blumenthal
is going to think exactly the same thing

846
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,477
when he finds out I'm asking him
to marry a Cohen and a convert,

847
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,155
who hasn't even officially converted.

848
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,516
Fuck.

849
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,953
Jo, something very, very big is going on.

850
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,554
I can't be more specific than that,

851
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,960
but if you saw the papers this morning,

852
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,713
you're gonna have some idea
what I'm talking about...

853
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,269
I'm not following you, Norman.
Did you speak to him or not?

854
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,916
<i>No, but I'm going to read</i>
<i>the latest message I got from Hanna.</i>

855
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,639
<i>Who is Hanna?</i>

856
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,633
Hanna is Duby's assistant.

857
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,632
<i>- Who's Duby?</i>
- Well, that's what I'm trying to explain.

858
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,949
Look, Eshel and Duby

859
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,919
are now at the national security committee
as we speak,

860
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,992
but there's no way
that I'm going to be able to get to them.

861
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,636
Hanna, on the other hand,
is just outside that closed door.

862
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,632
- She's gonna help us...
- Norman, cut the bullshit!

863
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,999
When you get Eshel on the phone
then call me back when he says yes to you!

864
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,355
Until then don't waste my time!

865
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,119
Yeah, Jo, but this is time-sensitive.

866
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,954
Look, I've got to tell Rabbi Blumenthal
that you're gonna give the money

867
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,474
because someone else
is gonna buy that building...

868
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,190
Rabbi Blumenthal is not my fucking problem!

869
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,432
They're going to launch a war in Syria
that's gonna turn into World War III!

870
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,751
I don't give a shit who started
World War III.

871
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,559
He's got a country to run. He's busy!

872
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,677
Yeah, well, so am I. Goodbye, Norman!

873
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,633
Fucking windbag.

874
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,078
Philip, it's a call, it's a call.

875
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,075
<i>Norman, why haven't you</i>
<i>returned my phone calls?</i>

876
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,310
<i>Deliver that rabbi, Norman.</i>

877
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,916
<i>Why do I get the feeling</i>
<i>that nothing you tell me is real?</i>

878
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,397
It's done. Eshel's son is on the list.

879
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,676
You don't want to know what this cost me,
but he is on the list.

880
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,878
Now please, if I decide to marry a camel
with three humps,

881
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,316
this rabbi still better be there
with his <i>tallis.</i>

882
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,960
Thank you, Philip.
You'll have your rabbi tomorrow.

883
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,191
5:00 p.m. I'll call you, okay?

884
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,799
I might have a donor who will match

885
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,879
your pledges up to seven million.

886
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,433
In other words,
if you come up with seven million,

887
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,830
half of the amount, the building's yours.

888
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,036
I mean, ours.

889
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,759
Who's the donor?

890
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,560
I'm sorry, I can't say.

891
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,438
He will remain anonymous.

892
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,319
Who donates $7 million
and wants to stay anonymous?

893
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,193
- That doesn't make sense.
- What do you care?

894
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,312
He's a modest man.
As long as he's good for it.

895
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,039
That's a legitimate question.

896
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,918
It's a lot of money,
we should know who the donor is.

897
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,437
Do we know who this person is?
Is he sitting here right now in this room?

898
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,199
What? Maybe this is
a money laundering scheme.

899
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,272
I have a feeling I know
who we are talking about.

900
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,953
Does his last name start with an R?

901
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,030
Are we playing guessing games now?

902
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,794
If he can say goodbye to $7 million,
why won't he just buy the whole thing?

903
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,360
I mean, it's just a number to these people.

904
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,999
- It's not real money.
- Seven million is real.

905
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,549
When you get to hundreds of millions,
that's another story.

906
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,394
Let's not get greedy.
This is a very generous gift.

907
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,314
And it should motivate our entire community
to become involved.

908
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,552
Thanks to Norman here,
we are only $7 million away

909
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,233
from finally owning our home.

910
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,152
But we need some kind of letter.
I mean, how do we even know

911
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,276
- this guy exists?
- A letter of intent.

912
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,635
- With all due respect, okay?
- We do need a letter.

913
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,870
Some kind of written commitment...

914
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,950
You can get us a letter, right?

915
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,032
- A formal letter...
- It should be notarized. Should be notarized.

916
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,236
And the money should be in escrow.

917
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,834
Okay. Escrow.

918
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,790
You sure you can't tell me who it is?

919
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,560
I probably should know.

920
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,554
I'd like to thank him.

921
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,594
Just between you and me. Is it Arthur Taub?

922
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,080
He was very clear about remaining anonymous.

923
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,353
But, can you tell me why he is doing this?

924
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,955
He can afford it. He knows me.

925
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,397
I told him... I told him about the community,

926
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,880
you know,
the history of the building, everything.

927
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,317
And why does he insist
on remaining anonymous?

928
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,272
If people knew he did this kind of thing,
there would be hundreds of other requests.

929
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,034
You know, this is not the usual

930
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,511
type of charity that he gives to. This...

931
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,956
This is something he did especially for me.

932
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,315
He did it as a favor to me.

933
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,080
Well. It is a good thing.

934
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,279
So please thank him on behalf of all of us.

935
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,635
Yeah. Yeah.

936
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,871
Not that raising the other half
is going to be so easy.

937
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,240
But the challenge, it's good.

938
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,560
- We should all open up our hearts.
- Yeah.

939
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,396
And our wallets.

940
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,355
God knows there are some
big wallets in this community.

941
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,955
And if there's any way
that you think it's appropriate

942
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,750
to honor this mysterious man, or woman,

943
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,513
a dedication of some kind...

944
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,230
Or if there is something
you would like me to do.

945
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,035
Yeah, well, now that you mention it,

946
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,391
you know, the person
who introduced me to Mr. Anonymous

947
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,597
is actually my nephew.

948
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,479
You know, he's a very,
very successful young lawyer.

949
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,472
Maybe I mentioned him to you. Philip Cohen.

950
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:39,310
Yeah, he's getting...
He's engaged to a very, very sweet girl.

951
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,390
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

952
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,474
From a Korean background.

953
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,040
He might need
a little help with her conversion and

954
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,918
officiating the wedding.

955
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,190
Philip Cohen?

956
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,196
If it were simple,
he wouldn't need your help.

957
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,276
Have him give me a call.
I'll see what I can do.

958
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,269
Thank you, Rabbi.

959
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,510
Norman.

960
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,314
Norman called.

961
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,754
I should call him back.

962
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,590
He always helps
that lump in my chest disappear.

963
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,075
And I never understood why.

964
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,880
If anything, he should make it feel worse.

965
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,197
Why do you say that? He's a good friend.

966
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,319
...the most generous person I know.

967
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,275
It's naïve to call him "generous."

968
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,951
He is! He has a tremendous heart.

969
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,233
...always eager to help.

970
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,120
Not to say anything negative,
he's not your "friend."

971
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,353
He's someone you take advantage of
when it's convenient.

972
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,070
I doubt he feels that way.
That's actually pretty insulting.

973
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,594
No. It's just the reality.

974
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,193
When you needed him in New York,
you let him in.

975
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,791
Now that you don't, you ignore him.

976
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,111
Now you're making that lump feel worse.

977
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,233
You think I took advantage of him
consciously?

978
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,433
Maybe not consciously.

979
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,792
I believe that you consider him a friend.

980
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,560
But the right thing to do now

981
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,673
...is not to take any more favors from him

982
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:57,120
...or from any of the other Normans
in your life.

983
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,755
You know...

984
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,993
you didn't protest when Norman offered
to connect us to that Harvard guy for Davidy.

985
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,874
Right.

986
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,874
But I was uncomfortable with it...

987
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,555
But you went along even though
you were "uncomfortable."

988
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,717
Honestly, I thought it was another
of his empty promises

989
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,192
...and if that's the case, why make a fuss?

990
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,676
Plus, you wanted Davidy to get into Harvard.

991
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,879
...so you figured, it can't hurt.

992
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,640
And you let it slide.

993
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,910
- Right?
- No. Absolutely not.

994
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,873
I thought it definitely would hurt.

995
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,039
But I didn't want to hurt Norman's feelings.

996
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,032
I'm glad you didn't hurt his feelings.

997
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,552
That was very nice of you.

998
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:11,432
ACT FOUR
THE PRICE OF PEACE

999
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,754
"SOMETHING STINKS"

1000
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:37,557
"ESHEL FACES POLITICAL RUIN
OVER BRIBES INQUIRY"

1001
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,359
"The speculation about Eshel's future
has weakened him politically

1002
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,354
"even as he undertakes delicate negotiations
with Israel's neighbors."

1003
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,476
Well, now...

1004
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,519
Is this serious? Do we need to
worry about our peace talks next week?

1005
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,717
<i>- I hope not.</i>
- Well, can we help?

1006
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,715
Maybe. Look, I don't know
who this businessman is yet,

1007
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,520
but if he's an American citizen,
he can't testify

1008
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,593
without your justice department
being part of the procedure.

1009
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,149
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>this is just the press spreading rumors</i>

1010
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,436
<i>but let's make sure</i>
<i>it doesn't spin out of control.</i>

1011
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,715
All right. Let me look into this.

1012
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,950
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much, Bruce.</i>

1013
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,156
The Knesset has seen politicians
with no backbone.

1014
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,393
That is not new.

1015
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,670
We've seen opportunists
distort the will of the voters.

1016
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,359
This is also not new.

1017
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,717
But never have we seen

1018
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,635
...a man so morally bankrupt

1019
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,116
...so spiritually empty

1020
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,480
...so hedonistic

1021
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,158
...selfish

1022
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,197
...in a position to do so much damage

1023
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,796
...as the man I'm pointing to right now.

1024
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,472
Do you know who he is,
the New York businessman?

1025
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,950
No. If I did,
is there any way we could help Eshel?

1026
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,152
Careful, Norman. Don't put your nose
into this if you don't have to.

1027
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,880
This kind of investigation
brings out the worst in everyone.

1028
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,590
<i>So, what do you think? How bad is this?</i>
<i>Is this serious?</i>

1029
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,470
It's serious.

1030
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,679
<i>Bribery is tricky, especially in Israel.</i>

1031
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,395
<i>We have the Mid-eastern mentality</i>
<i>of giving baksheesh</i>

1032
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,520
<i>and cutting corners and a legal system</i>
<i>run by tight-assed German</i> yekkes.

1033
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,677
If they can prove he accepted a gift,

1034
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,797
he's done. He could end up in jail.
Look, I gotta go.

1035
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,070
Bye.

1036
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,269
No. He's the last thing I need today.

1037
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,910
<i>Hello?</i>

1038
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,597
Alex. Alex Green?

1039
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,559
It's Norman, from the train.
Norman Oppenheimer.

1040
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,633
I've been meaning to call you.
How are you? How've you been?

1041
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,909
Sorry. Sorry.

1042
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,594
I can't... I can't talk to you right now.

1043
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,752
Yes, you can. Come on down.
I'm just around the corner from you.

1044
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,080
Did you find out who it is?

1045
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,153
Better. I'm meeting the investigator
who is in charge of the whole thing.

1046
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,714
<i>Just come on down, right now.</i>
<i>Give me five minutes...</i>

1047
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,154
- Norman, I can't...
<i>- Bye.</i>

1048
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,872
Thanks for coming down, really.
I appreciate it.

1049
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,599
You're acting like a maniac.

1050
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,236
Look at you. Why are you getting involved?

1051
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,234
This thing is bad for Israel, bad for America,
bad for Jews, bad for everybody. Step away...

1052
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,074
You're right, this is bad for everybody.
That's why I want to help.

1053
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,152
How can you... How can you help?

1054
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,472
This is a political war
going on 7000 miles from here.

1055
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,234
Look, Eshel's rivals
have found this cockamamie story

1056
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,953
and they're going to use it to take him down.

1057
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,398
There is nothing you can do about it.
Don't get involved. It is too big.

1058
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,030
Just one thing, though. One thing.
Just hypothetically, look...

1059
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,192
If this guy, this businessman,
he comes to you for advice,

1060
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,590
he wants you to represent him,
what are you going to tell him?

1061
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,160
You want to approach him? That's a bad idea.

1062
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,960
No! No, I'm just thinking maybe
we can come up with an option for him

1063
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,680
that's not so harmful to Eshel.

1064
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,913
I'd throw him out of my office.

1065
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,358
That's what I'd do.
I wouldn't want anything to do with him.

1066
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,830
He is a threat to a sitting prime minister.

1067
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,440
But even if it doesn't end up
having any criminal implication...

1068
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,752
Okay? Apparently his dealings with Eshel
are embarrassing enough

1069
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,595
so that his political rivals
think they can use him to hurt Eshel.

1070
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,480
Eshel's people can't ignore that.
They have too much to lose.

1071
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,919
They're going to strike back.

1072
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,240
Dig up everything they can find on this guy.
The FBI will get involved...

1073
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,358
I mean, no matter how you look at it,
this guy is fucked.

1074
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,909
And you want to avoid him like the plague.

1075
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,839
Look, I'm just asking if there's
some legal way to defuse this whole thing?

1076
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,870
Okay, all right.
Norman. Now you listen to me.

1077
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,472
Whoever this unnamed businessman is,
he is in very serious trouble.

1078
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,433
And he needs to be very careful
what he says now.

1079
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,152
And who he speaks to.

1080
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:08,757
Yeah, I just was asking, you know, if I'm
meeting with the investigator of this suit

1081
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,036
and I find out who this guy is,

1082
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,396
I want to be able to offer him something.

1083
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,713
So, think creatively with me...

1084
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,792
I'm not sure I can offer him anything.

1085
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,832
This man needs a very good criminal lawyer.

1086
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,189
Don't be creative.

1087
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,951
And do not meet this investigator.

1088
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,190
Can you do that?

1089
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:53,155
A man who isn't strong enough
to say no to gifts

1090
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,313
...too weak to resist
the temptations of power

1091
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,034
...has taken us hostage

1092
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,194
...in his megalomaniacal peace adventure.

1093
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,039
He'll drive me crazy.

1094
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,589
He'll call every 3 minutes.
Easier to just answer.

1095
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,719
Alright, but keep it short.

1096
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,713
Don't let him get involved.

1097
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,838
Before you say "no",
just listen to what I have to say,

1098
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,593
because they're really
going to want to hear this.

1099
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,316
<i>I have a meeting with the woman</i>

1100
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,074
<i>who is in charge of</i>
<i>this investigation that's going on right now.</i>

1101
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,560
<i>Her name is Alex Green.</i>

1102
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,997
She agreed to have a meeting with me today.
At 4 o'clock.

1103
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,151
And I'm going to try to get
all the information I can out of her,

1104
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,277
but I was thinking maybe
Duby would want to give me

1105
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,589
a briefing before the meeting...

1106
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,679
Norman, I don't think it's such a good idea
for you to meet this woman.

1107
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,672
Please, they can use me any way they want.

1108
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,912
I'm... I'm like a puppet in their hands.
I'm just here to help.

1109
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,994
And... Look, this is off the record,
a friendly conversation,

1110
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,073
I have known Alex Green for years.

1111
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,913
- She is a wonderful person.
<i>- Norman...</i>

1112
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,320
My wife used to babysit her.

1113
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,437
Hold on, just wait on the line.

1114
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,397
We must vote against this dangerous agreement

1115
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,480
...masquerading as a peace treaty.

1116
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,634
- Norman...
<i>- Duby!</i>

1117
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,279
Shut up, Norman.

1118
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,194
<i>Shut up and listen to what I'm saying to you.</i>

1119
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,876
I don't want you
meeting anybody on our behalf.

1120
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,599
Creating the impression that in some way

1121
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,276
you are connected to our office
is a severe, punishable crime.

1122
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,113
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

1123
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,520
<i>Stop using the Prime Minister's name.</i>

1124
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,910
<i>Don't do it anymore. He's not your friend.</i>

1125
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,276
<i>And you don't have any relationship with him.</i>

1126
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,432
<i>I forbid you to meet with this woman.</i>

1127
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,352
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

1128
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,119
Answer me!

1129
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,314
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Good.

1130
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,994
I'm not sure if it was a good idea
to insult Norman.

1131
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,757
That's the problem with these Normans.
They're a double-edged sword.

1132
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,240
If you keep them in the loop,

1133
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,716
you're more and more dependent on them
until they own you.

1134
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,391
If you cut them off,
they blackmail you forever.

1135
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,034
He's just trying to help.

1136
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,675
No more Norman.
Find out who this businessman is.

1137
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,194
I need a name!

1138
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,195
In a day, every newspaper will want to know
who this man is.

1139
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,353
We must be ready.

1140
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,755
"WHO IS HE?"

1141
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,635
I don't know.

1142
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,874
Giving in to our enemy's every demand
is not peace.

1143
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,350
It's DEFEAT.

1144
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,877
<i>- Norman.</i>
- Hanna.

1145
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,960
<i>I'm calling for Duby.</i>

1146
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,792
<i>He shouldn't have spoken to you like that</i>
<i>and he asked me to apologize.</i>

1147
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,519
- He did?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1148
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,796
<i>He specifically asked me</i>
<i>to call you and apologize.</i>

1149
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,870
Okay.

1150
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,392
<i>And don't worry. The whole thing</i>
<i>with this unnamed businessman</i>

1151
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,440
<i>is going to disappear</i>
<i>as soon as people find out who this guy is.</i>

1152
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,718
<i>Thank God we're strong.</i>
<i>Nothing like this can really affect us.</i>

1153
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,395
Well, do you know who he is,
this businessman?

1154
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,516
<i>All I can say is</i>

1155
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,280
<i>it is someone the Prime Minister</i>
<i>doesn't even know personally,</i>

1156
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,511
<i>and someone he would never get close to.</i>

1157
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,831
<i>The man's a clown,</i>
<i>someone who makes up stories</i>

1158
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,673
<i>'cause he's got nothing better to do.</i>

1159
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,639
Just between you and me,

1160
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,558
this man is a known crook.

1161
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,838
I can't tell you how relieved I am
to hear you say this, Hanna.

1162
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,149
Thank you.

1163
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,711
And please tell Duby that
I understand his situation completely.

1164
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,360
And if there's
anything that he needs me to do,

1165
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,477
I'm there for him and for the Prime Minister.

1166
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,638
<i>- I will, Norman.</i>
- Yeah. Thank you.

1167
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,874
You're assuming he'll repeat it all
to the investigator?

1168
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,555
He'll want to prove
he's got the inside scoop.

1169
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,400
And not only to her.
He'll spread it all over.

1170
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,279
...exaggerating so that it sounds even worse.

1171
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,319
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1172
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,233
Hey. Hey, you. You. Wait a minute.

1173
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,754
Hey. You.

1174
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,240
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you. What are you doing?

1175
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,549
Why are you following me?

1176
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,677
First of all, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Srul Katz.

1177
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,717
No, don't do that.
Excuse me, don't give it to me.

1178
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,439
I don't want it. Just stop following me.

1179
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,318
Why are you angry? I'm not following you.

1180
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,955
It's sheer coincidence
I'm going the same way you're going.

1181
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,793
You want me to apologize? I'm very sorry.

1182
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,997
I'm truly sorry. I apologize.

1183
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,071
But since...
Since we're already talking together,

1184
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,351
if I could take
one more minute of your valuable time,

1185
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,397
it's such a pleasure to meet you in person.

1186
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,358
You're the Eshel guy, right? Oppenheimer.

1187
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,353
Yeah? Maybe Zvi Fink, he mentioned me to you.

1188
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,396
How do you know Zvi?

1189
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,880
We're very close, me and Zvi.

1190
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,555
My wife, she practically
grew up in his parents' house.

1191
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,199
I'm gonna see him tonight, actually.

1192
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,714
You know, you should come by and say hello.

1193
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,996
He'd be...
<i>Oi,</i> he would be delighted to see you.

1194
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,115
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken up.

1195
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,355
How can I help you? Let me help you.
What do you need?

1196
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,675
Tell me what you need.

1197
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,679
- What do I need?
- Yes, please.

1198
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,117
Could you give me the honor of helping you?
You're a <i>choshuve'</i> man.

1199
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,879
Please, a very important guy.

1200
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,997
Which... We're going to walk together.
Which way... Are you okay?

1201
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,400
- I...
- Which way are you going?

1202
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,598
- The Israeli consulate on Second Ave.
- I'm going that way. Come on.

1203
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,956
- What, you just get bad news?
- Yeah, I ate something.

1204
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,997
- You ate something?
- I have to have a Benadryl.

1205
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,753
Sometimes, I get a little thing in my body...

1206
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,712
You get allergies?

1207
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,400
You know who it is, this...
The New York businessman?

1208
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,630
If I knew, would I tell you?

1209
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,231
Well, no. 'Cause I heard a rumor but,
you know, they swore me to secrecy.

1210
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,039
Yeah, yeah, don't believe the rumors.

1211
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,998
Well, look, obviously you know
more than I do,

1212
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,515
but whoever this guy is,
one thing is for certain,

1213
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,671
it's a conspiracy. Yeah?

1214
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,231
They found a way to assassinate Eshel,
without actually killing him.

1215
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,353
Don't bury Eshel yet. Trust me.
He's not going anywhere.

1216
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,511
Why? What do you know?

1217
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,670
You know something.

1218
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,040
I can't go into details,

1219
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:32,074
but let's just say
that this unnamed businessman...

1220
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,519
He's a nobody. He's a parasite.

1221
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,160
He's trying to
extort money from the Prime Minister.

1222
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,596
He is the lowest of the low, this guy.

1223
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:44,435
He made up a story, you know.
The whole thing is just a made-up thing.

1224
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,239
You know? It's... It's...

1225
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,039
Eshel doesn't even know the man.

1226
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,272
I think I'm okay from here on.

1227
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,556
So, thank you. I... I appreciate it.

1228
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,030
Are you sure?
Because I'm happy to go in with you.

1229
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,714
No. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1230
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,473
You want I should wait out here?

1231
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,199
No, I... I'm good from here, I...

1232
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,595
But, thank you very much, I really...
I appreciate it.

1233
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,320
Norman, are you going to do me a favor?

1234
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,120
You're gonna call me
if you need anything at all.

1235
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,755
You don't understand,
it's going to be my pleasure to help you.

1236
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,038
My name is Norman Oppenheimer.

1237
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,191
I have an appointment with Alex Green.

1238
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,000
Hey, you know what?

1239
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,519
I... I forgot something. I...

1240
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,910
I'm gonna be canceling this meeting, so...

1241
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,354
Look, I don't see my phone in there.
Can you give me my phone?

1242
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,112
Can you give me my phone? Hello?

1243
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,510
Hello?

1244
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,636
Hello! Could you give me...
I don't see my phone!

1245
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,030
Could you... I'm not going in!

1246
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,272
So you might as well
give me my phone back right now, please!

1247
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,837
<i>It's okay. Come.</i>

1248
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,512
<i>They told me not to meet with you.</i>

1249
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,110
<i>Who?</i>

1250
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,792
<i>The Prime Minister's office. Duby.</i>

1251
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,798
<i>I don't want to upset them.</i>
<i>He'll know I was here. I don't...</i>

1252
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,434
<i>It was a mistake.</i>

1253
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,240
<i>No, please. I respect you very much.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I apologize.</i>

1254
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,595
<i>I shouldn't have called you.</i>

1255
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,997
<i>No. It's good that you called.</i>
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

1256
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,677
<i>Norman, I want this conversation</i>
<i>to be as straightforward</i>

1257
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,798
<i>and honest as possible.</i>
<i>Do you think you can do that?</i>

1258
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,277
<i>I spent the past few months</i>

1259
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,398
<i>trying to know more about you.</i>

1260
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,920
<i>Where you come from, what you do,</i>

1261
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,517
<i>who your friends are, your family.</i>

1262
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,511
<i>Your financial situation.</i>

1263
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,358
<i>And what I've discovered is very strange.</i>

1264
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,794
Everybody seems to know who you are.

1265
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,155
But nobody knows anything about you.

1266
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,074
Even people
who say they have known you for years.

1267
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,799
For instance, nobody knows where you live.

1268
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,590
I was able to confirm that
you inherited a small amount of money

1269
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,114
from your mother,

1270
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:13,797
and that she left you
her rent-controlled apartment after she died.

1271
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,999
<i>But I wasn't able to</i>
<i>verify that you have a daughter</i>

1272
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,231
<i>or that you were ever married.</i>

1273
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,596
Were you?

1274
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,040
Do you have a daughter?

1275
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,910
<i>Why are you</i>
<i>gathering this information about me?</i>

1276
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,111
<i>Because you've been unusually generous</i>

1277
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,590
<i>toward the Prime Minister of Israel</i>

1278
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,276
<i>and have created</i>
<i>an intricate network of people</i>

1279
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,920
<i>who benefit from the access you provide.</i>

1280
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,953
The relationship you've established
with the Prime Minister of Israel

1281
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,713
is illegal.

1282
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,592
I think it is corrupt.

1283
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,760
The unnamed New York businessman...

1284
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,758
You are that man, Norman.

1285
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,439
You are our witness.

1286
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,879
No, I'm not.

1287
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,317
We can subpoena you. You have no choice.

1288
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,796
I'm going to go now. I'm sorry, but, I'm...

1289
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,998
Wait. You need to hear what I have to say.

1290
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,830
We're arranging
for an early deposition for you tomorrow.

1291
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,753
I can't force you to stay here now.

1292
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,600
But here is your official notice.

1293
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:12,477
If you testify and speak truthfully
about everything that you've experienced,

1294
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,149
we can protect you from self-incrimination.

1295
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,634
It will be about him. Not about you.

1296
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,276
But what is Eshel going to do?

1297
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,238
What will he do to me?

1298
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,918
They will try to
persuade the court and the public

1299
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,198
that you are an unreliable witness.

1300
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,320
That will most likely be their defense.

1301
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,240
I'm sorry.

1302
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,756
Right now...

1303
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,278
...few people know who Norman Oppenheimer is.

1304
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,117
We have an opportunity to brand him.

1305
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,150
...to disqualify him as a witness

1306
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,670
...portray him as a crook

1307
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:01,114
...and paint the Prime Minister
as an innocent victim.

1308
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,433
How am I a victim?

1309
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,155
We have all the power, Duby.

1310
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,114
Never say that. It is not true.

1311
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,950
You are Mr. Peace right now.

1312
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,073
The press will be on your side.

1313
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,316
Nobody wants to see our peace efforts
go down the drain...

1314
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,480
...because of some shady Jewish macher.

1315
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,276
We need to portray him
as a delusional name-dropper...

1316
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:36,879
...who has been sucking your blood for years.

1317
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,156
You need to say this clearly.

1318
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,958
It's necessary. And it's true.

1319
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,111
There must be another way.

1320
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,475
Norman is a friend. A very generous friend.

1321
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,160
I won't hurt him.

1322
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,677
It is not personal.

1323
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:00,957
It's bigger than
the pain felt by one individual.

1324
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:05,872
He's a threat to our national interests.

1325
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,477
Our personal feelings aside...

1326
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,639
...we must treat him like
any other strategic threat.

1327
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,153
I took your advice.
I didn't go to the meeting.

1328
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,196
I'm stepping back, like you said.

1329
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,195
I'm proud of you. Good move.

1330
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,714
Are you there, Norman?

1331
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,154
<i>I'm here.</i>

1332
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,870
You okay?

1333
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,879
I'm a good swimmer, Philip.

1334
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,391
Don't worry.
As long as my head's above water...

1335
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,434
You are a good swimmer. That's for sure.

1336
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:17,360
Look, I wish I could've
been more helpful but...

1337
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,596
- You know, I...
<i>- You've been a very big help, Philip.</i>

1338
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,591
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1339
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,680
<i>I love you.</i>

1340
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,240
Excuse me. Can I help you?

1341
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,674
Rabbi!

1342
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,796
You!

1343
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,720
What are you doing?

1344
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,553
I need to talk to you.

1345
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:26,792
No, you need to sign those escrow papers,
that's what you need.

1346
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,272
Do you realize
we're going to lose all our pledges?

1347
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,159
Not to mention this building, and my job!

1348
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:35,596
Norman, why haven't you
returned my phone calls?

1349
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,550
Fuck!

1350
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,310
- I'm working on it.
- Fuck!

1351
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,632
I should've known not to trust you!

1352
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,350
What am I going to do now?

1353
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,591
Was there ever a donor? At any point?

1354
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,876
Yeah, but I thought I had someone.

1355
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,679
I still might have them, I just...

1356
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,960
It's not a sure thing.

1357
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,396
Then why would you tell us you had a donor?

1358
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,920
Why? Why would you do that?

1359
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,874
Is that you, Norman?

1360
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,076
Norman, are you there?

1361
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,877
Is it safe for us to talk?

1362
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,880
<i>It probably isn't.</i>

1363
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,194
<i>But there's something I need to tell you</i>

1364
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,875
<i>before the lawyers</i>
<i>and the PR people take over.</i>

1365
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,556
<i>And I'm speaking to you now as Micha Eshel,</i>

1366
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,916
<i>not as the Prime Minister of Israel.</i>

1367
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,715
I'm sorry.

1368
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,995
I'm sorry for what is about to happen to you.

1369
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,074
In the next couple of days,
you're going to hear me say things

1370
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,231
that I don't really believe.

1371
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:50,950
Things about you.

1372
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,830
<i>And it will hurt. It will hurt both of us.</i>

1373
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,355
<i>But the only reason</i>
<i>I will be saying these things</i>

1374
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:03,229
<i>is because there are</i>
<i>hundreds of thousands of lives at stake.</i>

1375
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,359
The enemies of peace

1376
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:10,150
have decided to step all over you
on their way to behead me.

1377
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,551
It is a terrible price to pay.

1378
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,630
But, Norman,

1379
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,078
<i>I can't let them win.</i>

1380
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,038
<i>We can't let them win.</i>

1381
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:29,154
<i>History is full of anonymous heroes, Norman.</i>

1382
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:35,875
<i>The day I walk up to that podium</i>
<i>to sign the peace treaty,</i>

1383
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,993
<i>you will see</i>
<i>a very specific expression on my face.</i>

1384
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,959
Know that I will be thinking of you...

1385
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,998
Norman Oppenheimer.

1386
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,156
<i>Do you accept my apology, Norman?</i>

1387
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,034
<i>Do you forgive me?</i>

1388
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,117
I will never betray you.

1389
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,434
I love you, Norman.

1390
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,400
Thank you.

1391
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,316
Good morning, Bill.

1392
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,950
Why do you do this?

1393
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,157
Why can't anything ever be simple with you?

1394
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,118
Who says simple is good?

1395
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,240
I have a business opportunity for Jo.
He's going to like this.

1396
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,358
No. No, you don't.
Whatever it is, it's too small.

1397
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,320
Norman.

1398
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,950
Wait.

1399
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,636
I'm listening out of respect to my father.

1400
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,793
You knew him, didn't you?

1401
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,753
All right. What have you got?

1402
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,959
If you knew with 100 percent certainty

1403
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,317
that the witness who is
trying to topple down Prime Minister Eshel

1404
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,153
will never testify,

1405
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,552
would you know
how to make money with that information?

1406
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,239
Well, it depends on
where and how I got that information

1407
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:23,510
and if I can verify it.

1408
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,671
You realize
you're not a very reliable source, right?

1409
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,795
You put me in a room with Jo Wilf.

1410
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,758
I'll give him all the certainty he needs.

1411
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,431
Think about it. Go ahead. Think about it.

1412
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,158
Run the numbers, do the whole thing.

1413
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,317
You have until 8:00 a.m. to call me back.

1414
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,879
After that, I'm going to Arthur Taub.

1415
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,520
What's your fee?

1416
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,312
<i>Philip. Nicole.</i>

1417
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:43,872
At times like this,
when we're aware of our blessings,

1418
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,799
we also know that the world
is in desperate need of repair.

1419
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:51,350
Tradition explains
the act of breaking the glass

1420
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:54,399
reminds us to turn our hearts
towards the city of Jerusalem.

1421
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,871
In which the ultimate peace
shall be granted to the world.

1422
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,115
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

1423
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

1424
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:28,275
Thank you.

1425
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,191
Welcome to Harvard, David Eshel.

1426
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,999
Thank you. Happy to be here.

1427
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:44,079
<i>As we turn to the economic implications</i>
<i>of this peace treaty this morning,</i>

1428
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:47,039
<i>one investor, Jo Wilf,</i>
<i>is looking like a big winner.</i>

1429
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:50,477
<i>And when I say big winner, I mean, like,</i>
<i>a-billion-dollars-overnight big winner.</i>

1430
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,473
<i>Wilf, at a series of what now</i>
<i>seem like pretty prescient bets that...</i>

1431
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,199
<i>All the way back to the conversation</i>
<i>we've been having</i>

1432
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:58,199
<i>about the possible impeachment</i>
<i>of Israel's Prime Minister.</i>

1433
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,432
<i>Now, just when everyone thought</i>
<i>the Prime Minister would get the boot,</i>

1434
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,318
<i>Wilf bets the opposite.</i>

1435
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:06,199
<i>He shorts natural gas</i>
<i>and then he magically buys shares</i>

1436
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:09,398
<i>in both Sampton Energy</i>
<i>and the Tel Aviv-based Barkin Group.</i>

1437
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,995
<i>Those are the companies</i>
<i>building the Israel-Turkey pipeline.</i>

1438
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,595
<i>This deal is starting to look like</i>
<i>the trade of the decade.</i>

1439
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:16,755
<i>Genius.</i>
