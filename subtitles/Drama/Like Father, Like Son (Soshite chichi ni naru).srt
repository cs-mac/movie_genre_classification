00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,142
Come in, please.

3
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:29,476
Thank you.

4
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:32,438
November

5
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:37,443
Please tell me your name,

6
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,611
age and date of birth.

7
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:44,158
My name Nonomiya Keita,
I am six years old.

8
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:47,912
My birthday is July 28.

9
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,415
Do you think Keita is more,

10
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:53,458
like his father or mother?

11
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,628
It seems my wife for her peaceful nature

12
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,630
and kindness towards others.

13
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,592
Have any noticeable flaws?

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,929
Probably, therefore,

15
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:07,889
but tends to do it all in stride.

16
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,352
Neither seem to mind losing.

17
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,563
For me, I'm his father,
it's a bit disappointing.

18
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,899
Keita,
What is your favorite season?

19
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,733
Summer.

20
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,946
What did you do last summer?

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,741
I went camping with my father

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,117
And flew kites.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,788
Your father is good at flying kites?

24
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:33,916
He does good.

25
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:45,971

Like Father, Like Son

31
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:49,744
It's changed?

32
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,956
Should do very well.

33
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,043
The stadium is not the one I knew.

34
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,962
Lower your voice.

35
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:08,555
I'm here!
- Have you studied much?

36
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:13,142
Fathers and mothers,
we're done for today.

37
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:15,312
We wish you a safe journey home.

38
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,063
Thank you.

39
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:23,945
Keita.

40
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,452
I've never been camping,
right?

41
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,244
Why do you ask?

42
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:33,998
The teacher advised it.

43
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:38,210
You have learned a lot in the academy.

44
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:41,839
She said: "The
omelet prepared by my mother."

45
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,096
You have fun?
- Yes

46
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:50,764
You have painted balloons?
- Yes

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,684
With a handsome monster.
- A handsome monster?

48
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,832
Wow, I've been caught with their hands in the dough
.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,002
How strange to see you here on a Saturday.

50
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,504
I wanted to leave before you came.

51
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,800
The model is fine.
- Thanks.

52
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,343
I've checked three times.

53
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:30,429
All yours.

54
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,973
I won't bother you anymore, I'm leaving.

55
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:36,144
Not be long,
take something then?

56
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:39,604
Well, I've been with my wife for a movie
.

57
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:42,026
Thanks to you and your delivery

58
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:44,568
I have time to spend with my family.

59
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,488
Counting on you.
- Very grateful.

60
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:50,992
Here is the South and here, the North,
right?

61
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,411
Yes, the sun comes out here.

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,747
For a few families in the park.

63
00:04:57,122 --> 00:05:00,168
With dogs?
- Yes, it will look more everyday.

64
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,376
Listen,

65
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,923
boss invites them to eat something,
it's too late.

66
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,135
Can choose between pizza, rice with meat...

67
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:16,893
I do not dislike you go to a private school.

68
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:21,065
Ryota
believes should now strive for the future.

69
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:26,903
Sounds fixed.

70
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,697
I get it
- Maybe it's Dad.

71
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:31,783
I'll tell you what Aunt, bye.

72
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:33,409
Tell me, what?

73
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:37,998
It's Dad.

74
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,500
Coming to dinner?

75
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:14,243
I thought you'd come back later.

76
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:19,791
Not playing the piano?

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,377
I've finished exams, for once...

78
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,505
You have to have discipline.

79
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:29,675
If you lose one day...
- It takes three to recover it, I know.

80
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,263
Come on, Keita.

81
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,557
It's time for piano.

82
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,936
Come to play.

83
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,691
You've eaten?

84
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,068
The bath is ready.

85
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:48,986
Almost nothing, a piece of pizza.

86
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:51,948
Why didn't you text me a message?

87
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,574
Nothing to say.

88
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,162
I'll make a broth with pasta.

89
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,747
Minura sent us homemade pasta.

90
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,543
That's fine, go ahead.

91
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,171
Go easy with the pasta.

92
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:08,214
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

93
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:13,512
No eggs at night
too much cholesterol.

94
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:16,515
One is not going to make a difference. 
Keita?

95
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,101
Penalized!

96
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,855
Why am I punished?

97
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,463
Come on, try again.

98
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:03,104
I hope Minura
does well with the new job.

99
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,189
Sure, yes.

100
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,859
Is made to live in the countryside.

101
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:09,986
Don't seem important.

102
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:11,780
You always were protecting.

103
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:15,617
Needless to waste time with losers.

104
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:21,248
Wow, I'm so sorry,
I'm also a loser.

105
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,791
Going to sleep?

106
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,961
I was stressed and tired.

107
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:32,466
We did what we could,
now it depends on him.

108
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:36,554
He works hard,
wants to be like you.

109
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,602
Do not you think he has matured?

110
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,062
You think so?

111
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,607
It appears that you have told Daichi
to leave him alone.

112
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,819
I hope it's true.

113
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,073
Today,
goodness is a defect.

114
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:57,992
In the interview you said that it was his strength.

115
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,702
You should praise him more.

116
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,997
Simply one of the two
spoiled him.

117
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,421
Is it possible?

118
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,683
Thanks for taking the day off.

119
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,811
Keita was delighted.

120
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,897
I would like to dedicate at least Sunday.

121
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:33,529
I will have more time when
we finish this project.

122
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,742
Six years I hear you say exactly the
same thing.

123
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:40,078
Really?

124
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,830
Yes, it is.

125
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:45,625
I forgot.

126
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,461
The hospital called, Maebashi.

127
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:50,421
What hospital?

128
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,298
Where I gave birth to Keita.

129
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,551
Yeah, and?

130
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:59,472
I don't know; they want to talk
to us.

131
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:00,766
About what?

132
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,435
They'll tell us when we get there.

133
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm worried.

134
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,987
I hope it's nothing bad.

135
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,960
Exchanged kids?

136
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,422
This has happened before?

137
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:33,507
Yes

138
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,093
Most cases date back
to the end of the sixties.

139
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,097
Following on from that experience,

140
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:43,433
we write the names
with ink

141
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,895
on the soles of
newborns.

142
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,524
Then, what has happened?

143
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:52,819
Well...

144
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,114
How do we know that the child is not the child of someone else?

145
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,828
The blood test for school entry

146
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,995
does not match the parent.

147
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,123
But ours do agree.
- No.

148
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,295
Are you sure?

149
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,714
So, Keita...

150
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,217
is not our son?

151
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,513
Three babies were born male
in the hospital that day.

152
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,894
First we must ask for DNA testing.

153
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,981
Then we will know...

154
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,903
We have two, one left.

155
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,990
CONGRATULATIONS, KEITA

156
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,201
Come together.

157
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,246
Keita, congratulations for passing the entrance exam.

158
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,791
Okay.
- Later.

159
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:52,463
Well done!
- Great.

160
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,174
The tomato is good.
- Really?

161
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,719
So eat.

162
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,762
Open your mouth...

163
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,599
A fried shrimp.

164
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,558
A shrimp.

165
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,144
Take it.

166
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:12,774
Oh, okay.
- Very good.

167
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,818
Now!

168
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,031
Okay.

169
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:19,822
Want to see them?

170
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,449
Click here.

171
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,165
If you click here, see the previous.
- Exactly.

172
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,543
Come on, you can do it.
- Yes, hand here...

173
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,764
The four together.

174
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,142
The four together.

175
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,394
The four together.

176
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,234
The four together.

177
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,773
Open your mouth.

178
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,086
The results of test 1
Nonomiya Ryota,

179
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:58,716
The results of test 2 Nonomiya Midori,

180
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,469
and the results of test 3 Nonomiya Keita

181
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:06,725
Show that they are not blood relatives.

182
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,519
Conclusion of the report.

183
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,204
Now I understand.

184
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,439
That is why I asked

185
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,775
if this provincial hospital was safe.

186
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:58,694
My mother had me there.

187
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:01,780
And my brothers.
- That is not enough.

188
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,490
You were very busy.

189
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,535
I felt very lonely.

190
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,953
At least
my mother could come see me.

191
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,628
Why I didn't realize it?

192
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,425
I am the mother.

193
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,592
Yes, they're here.
- We were delayed.

194
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:05,218
I told you to fill the tank.

195
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:07,763
Here they are.

196
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,725
Excuse use, we're sorry for
the delay.

197
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:13,352
My wife insisted

198
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,939
that I change my clothes
just before leaving home.

199
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,983
Good morning.

200
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:21,777
Family Saiki.
- Good morning.

201
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:25,781
...it's just been a tremendous surprise.

202
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:28,993
I'm his wife, my name is Yukari.

203
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:33,040
- Sirs...
- Nonomiya, my wife Midori.

204
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,086
Ryusei.

205
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,630
He is Keita.

206
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:43,716
We took that last summer, 
we were in Sunpia.

207
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,429
You don't have a clearer picture?

208
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:55,271
This?

209
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:58,189
-Where was this?
-In Karasugawa.

210
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,108
Yes, the Karasu River.

211
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:03,819
In that river, salmon and trout fishing are 
a good catch.

212
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:08,784
Look, look.

213
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,246
Ryusei with his brothers,
-the water gun.

214
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:22,923
What day was he born?

215
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,426
On July 28.

216
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:28,596
The same day.

217
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:33,225
Maybe we met here
then..

218
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,063
After giving birth I was pretty sick,

219
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,689
I had to stay in bed.

220
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,485
He was born on a very bright
sunny day.

221
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:47,114
Reminded us of a sunny day in Okinawa.

222
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,742
That's why we used the name, Ryusei,

223
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,869
as Chinese pictograph for 'sunny day'.

224
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,248
In cases like this,

225
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,627
a hundred percent of parents

226
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:01,253
just opting for the exchange.

227
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,215
For the sake of the future of children,

228
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,509
should be decided soon.

229
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:11,349
-Before the start of primary.
-It's too soon.

230
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:14,767
We talked about April,
less than six months.

231
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:20,106
-They are not pets.
-Although they were.

232
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,109
You're right.

233
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:27,279
Nor is exchanged for a pet.

234
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:29,658
Also,

235
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,702
apart from a drastic solution,

236
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,164
you haven't come up with another possibility?

237
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:39,584
Yes, of course. The hospital lawyer, Mr. Orima,

238
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,544
is studying the case.

239
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:46,424
I imagine, as a parent,
it is a very difficult situation.

240
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,261
However, right now,

241
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:52,348
we must consider the future of children...

242
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,277
It pleases them
What do you see without them?

243
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,197
Yes, we would also like to know
Keita.

244
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,909
Well, we'll be in contact.

245
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,553
-It's too late.
-I know, I'm sorry.

246
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,762
It's not important.

247
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:35,474
Well, how'd it go?
How are they, what do they do?

248
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:38,937
-He's got a shop.
-A merchant?

249
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:40,771
Go on...

250
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:42,523
-Mother.
Yes.

251
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,649
I forgot to give you this, before.

252
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,403
A gift!
From my sweet Tiger!

253
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:50,741
-I think it's sweet beans.
-Simple.

254
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,868
Sweet beans is not so bad, Mom.

255
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,121
If you insult the sweet beans,
you'll wake up the tiger.

256
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,333
-How is Keita?
-Asleep.

257
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,875
We played a lot of tennis on the Wii.

258
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,213
Tomorrow I  will have shoelaces.

259
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,268
I did not say anything then

260
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:03,647
but when the old Yamashita, our neighbor
,

261
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:06,067
saw Keita for the first time, said:

262
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,361
"He doesn’t look like any of them."

263
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:10,781
That was...

264
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:17,162
two years ago.

265
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:19,872
I think.

266
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:27,046
Ryota, your husband

267
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:33,428
is truly privileged,
compared to our family.

268
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:38,600
Some people did not see your marriage
favorably.

269
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:40,893
On second thought, many people.

270
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,897
It is possible that such
negative energy...

271
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:45,272
That's enough!

272
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:48,902
It has nothing to do with people
envying us.

273
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:51,738
Poor little me.

274
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:05,001
This is the area from the west exit of the station
Shunjuku.

275
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:09,173
It is an honor to introduce Shunjuku Spiral Tower.

276
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,928
It's a terrible tragedy.

277
00:22:17,513 --> 00:22:20,476
I will make sure that it will
not affect my work.

278
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,145
But what will you do?

279
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,356
Change them?

280
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,735
No, we have not yet reached that point.

281
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,281
A solution may be to raise
them both.

282
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:39,577
Both of them?

283
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:44,457
Yes, you don't think it's right?

284
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:01,100
What's wrong?

285
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:03,978
You don't want to meet our son?

286
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,688
Course I do.

287
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:10,401
But if we continue like this,
end up ignoring the hospital.

288
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,571
It'll be fine.

289
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,321
Trust me.

290
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,334
Excuse me, excuse us.

291
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,672
He began to pick up when we were already out.

292
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:32,381
Hi, my name Ryusei Saiki.

293
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,134
And I am, Yamato.

294
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,928
I am Miyu.

295
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:38,136
Come, introduce yourself.

296
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:41,182
Hi, my name Nonomiya Keita.

297
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:42,683
Hello, how are you?

298
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,104
Thank you for your patience,
here are the drinks.

299
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:49,065
And here's the meal ticket.

300
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,275
Come Ryusei!

301
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:54,404
Equally. I've asked a lot.

302
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:58,409
That'll be 6,030 yen.

303
00:23:59,033 --> 00:23:59,868
No, no.

304
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,120
-Let me do.
No, no way.

305
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:04,206
Check, please.

306
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:09,587
The name of the Maebashi hospital.
Yes.

307
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,299
And add this as well.
-Yeah, thank you very much.

308
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:26,479
You don't eat, you devour!
You've gobbled up all the potatoes.

309
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:42,828
I'm finished.

310
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,333
You want to play?

311
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,752
I want to go and play.

312
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,171
Go, go.

313
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,593
-Miyu!
-Take your brother.

314
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:58,344
Ryusei, watch them.

315
00:25:14,694 --> 00:25:16,487
Children learn fast.

316
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:23,328
I wonder how much we can remove the
damages.

317
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,329
Damages.

318
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:29,793
The money it not important.

319
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,128
But have you discovered how this could happen.

320
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:33,797
Of course I have.

321
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,300
I think like you, but...

322
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:37,509
You will see,

323
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:42,013
they can only show good faith
compensating us economically.

324
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:44,140
Exactly, that's the way.

325
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,768
Have you already contacted a lawyer?

326
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,152
Being the case, let me handle the issue.

327
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,780
A friend of mine has a law firm.

328
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:02,076
Okay, ask him what he thinks.

329
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,662
-Dad!
-Dad!

330
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:24,807
I'm gonna make a call.

331
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,777
My neck hurts.

332
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,118
My mother!

333
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:48,290
We are not alike.

334
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,250
But he thinks so.

335
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:56,590
A friend frankly accused me of having an affair.

336
00:26:57,257 --> 00:26:59,300
I found it very cruel of him.

337
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:04,348
But I never imagined it would like this.

338
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:21,489
'Goodbye, goodbye!
-Bye, Keita, see you soon.

339
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:34,045
What is it?

340
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,674
A note from Ryusei's mother:
"Stand by Me".

341
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:42,095
"Count on me"?

342
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,973
A rather arrogant comment.

343
00:27:46,307 --> 00:27:47,474
You must be prepared.

344
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:50,561
It is possible that we have to take them to court.

345
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:53,021
A judgment?

346
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,905
Sorry, I had an unexpected
press conference.

347
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:04,700
-I know you're busy.
-I've been groping.

348
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:08,913
I do not care about money,
I want to know how it happened.

349
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:11,248
The hospital's lawyer is a redneck.

350
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,585
Knows bankruptcy and nothing else.

351
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,503
He understands nothing.

352
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,546
Appreciate your interest.

353
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:19,507
Do you mind?

354
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:25,472
I don't want the case to go to court.

355
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:29,477
I would like to have 
custody of the two children.

356
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:33,687
Is an amazing idea.

357
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,484
Want to be the father of another child?

358
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:41,821
I wish they lived with us,
take my blood.

359
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,284
Your blood?
Today that is no longer needed.

360
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:48,621
It's not that, but,
it's the fate of being a father.

361
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:53,251
And even at least you
keep your paternal attachment.

362
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,293
Go, just leave it.

363
00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:58,881
Listen to this.

364
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,508
In England

365
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:06,514
if the State determines that the
parents are unable to care for their children,

366
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:09,557
they end up under the care of an institution.

367
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:11,977
Yes, in the case of drug addicts,

368
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,772
or if the mother uses the house
for prostitution.

369
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:19,778
The mother speaks out immediately and the father cannot do anything.

370
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:23,157
I doubt that a court would deem
that parental neglect.

371
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:24,740
They have rights.

372
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:29,329
We can offer a lot of money
if I legally adopt him.

373
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,121
They will not accept

374
00:29:31,746 --> 00:29:34,042
You could suggest it
at the right time.

375
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:38,546
Nothing's changed, as stubborn as ever.

376
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:42,466
As a lawyer,

377
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:46,137
I advise you to join them
to sue the hospital.

378
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:54,353
January

379
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:02,821
Have you thought about it?
This is our fourth meeting.

380
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,739
Perhaps

381
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:09,410
it's a good idea to start
sleeping in the other house.

382
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:14,207
Children adapt very easily at this age.

383
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,087
We considered this possibility,

384
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:21,507
but it has nothing to do with compensation.

385
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:22,924
Yes, yes, of course.

386
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:25,845
What's your opinion?

387
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,431
Mr. Saiki?

388
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:32,267
Yeah, well...

389
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,435
We've had good meetings,

390
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:37,398
but we should get to a solution, right?

391
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:42,402
He says that we can fix this.
Is there a better way for us then?

392
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,571
Well he said, it's good, but
I don't know if I like the suggestion.

393
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:48,117
But, it can work out.

394
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:51,662
They are of the same blood,
and that is what counts.

395
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,292
Once you understand it,
everything will work out.

396
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,878
We must also think about Miyu and Yamato.

397
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,088
I do not want to rush.

398
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:04,134
Exactly, we see no need to rush.

399
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:07,553
And you, Mr. Nonomiya?

400
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:13,225
I suggest we test it some other weekend.

401
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,770
On Saturday night, for example.

402
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,405
The elders are talking,
go and play.

403
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:15,747
Keita

404
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:18,209
You like to play the piano?

405
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:22,755
You do not have to do if you want.

406
00:32:23,215 --> 00:32:25,924
But, Dad said I was very good at.

407
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:32,056
He's right, and there is the concert.
Shall we continue then?

408
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:34,600
We continue!

409
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:52,994
I'm not good at this.

410
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:55,579
I won!

411
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,126
Keita, eats soba pasta.

412
00:33:03,588 --> 00:33:06,006
But not raw fish.

413
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:08,510
Listen, Keita.

414
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:12,847
Tomorrow we will leave here
at ten in the morning.

415
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,435
Because...

416
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,186
is white.

417
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:21,231
Because tomorrow you'll be

418
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,315
in Ryusei's home.

419
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,195
-Agree?
-Okay.

420
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,947
See,

421
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:34,787
it's kind of a mission,
so you get stronger.

422
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,750
-You know what a mission is?
Yes.

423
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,418
-Really?
Yes.

424
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:45,379
It's part of a strategy

425
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,468
for you to grow up and make you stronger.

426
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,461
Mother...

427
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:27,214
This is really pathetic.

428
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,181
Good morning.
-Hi.

429
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:38,643
Hello.

430
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,061
Please take care of him.

431
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:49,445
Ryusei, in the back, please.

432
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,285
Oh my God.

433
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:47,128
 Chuji.

434
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:06,858
Hey ,

435
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,943
you know that Spiderman

436
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:11,071
is a real spider?

437
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:21,788
-Man, it's cold.
- How are you all right?

438
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,415
Good, good.

439
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,752
I'm changing the bulb in the bathroom.

440
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:28,880
For the bathroom?
Use 60 watts.

441
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,841
Close the door, it's cold.

442
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,176
Want an LED bulb?

443
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,848
Don't need to piss with so much light.

444
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,768
40 watts is fine.

445
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:43,229
190 yen.

446
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:47,900
You have something to do
next Saturday?

447
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:50,986
-Wings--6 a.m.
-Still playing baseball?

448
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,365
You're a little old for that?
You throw.

449
00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:58,826
I'm not for this shit,
my shoulder is old.

450
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:02,205
-He's an man.
-But, you're a boy!

451
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,833
'Come on, we'll see.
-I count on you, thanks.

452
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:10,922
Croquettes ?

453
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:12,507
Yes, croquettes.

454
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,716
Three

455
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:15,427
Four

456
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:17,012
Five

457
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:18,931
Six

458
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,181
Seven

459
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:21,808
Eight

460
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:23,269
Nine

461
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:24,478
Ten

462
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:26,479
Eleven

463
00:37:26,898 --> 00:37:28,941
-Twelve
-That's a good number.

464
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:30,276
Thirteen.

465
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:31,610
Fourteen

466
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,279
Fifteen.

467
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,409
Here is the food.

468
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:41,413
Well, it's time to eat.

469
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:45,291
I'm hungry!

470
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,919
That's good.

471
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:54,842
Hurry or there will be nothing left.

472
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:58,513
It's warm, and tastes great.

473
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:11,694
-And for Dad.
-Only one egg for Dad.

474
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:17,073
Let's eat more eggs with sukiyaki.

475
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,458
-Eat.
-Is it good?

476
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,959
It's too hot. I can't eat it.

477
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:34,508
I'll turn down the flame.

478
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:41,180
It's good.

479
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:42,724
-You like it?
-It's good.

480
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,186
Ryusei.

481
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,688
Chopsticks; I'll teach you how to hold them?

482
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,649
Like this?

483
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:53,944
Look.

484
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:56,947
Wait, look how I do.

485
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:00,867
Move it like this.

486
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:08,376
Come on, you try it.

487
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:18,112
Keita, son.

488
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:22,618
You put this on the altar, please?

489
00:40:26,538 --> 00:40:27,414
There.

490
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:32,878
Above!

491
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,131
It's time?

492
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,717
Can I ring the bell?

493
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:40,677
-Of course.
-Good morning.

494
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:42,721
Good morning.
-Good morning.

495
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,480
- Have you done this before?
- In Grandma's house.

496
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:53,483
-At your grandmother's?
- Yes.

497
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,526
Well, hello all.
-Hi.

498
00:40:56,818 --> 00:40:58,696
Good morning.
-Good morning.

499
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:01,156
Grandpa, this is Keita.

500
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:03,325
Please greet him.

501
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:10,707
Don't go near it.

502
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:20,802
It's smoke.

503
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:25,181
I think it works.

504
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,852
The batteries for the car.

505
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:37,903
Good!

506
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:01,134
-Which one?
-That one.

507
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:05,223
-That is "Skytree".
Yes, it is.

508
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:22,114
Oh, my God.

509
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,409
What time is it?

510
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,331
- It's quarter to three.
- Thank you.

511
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:40,925
-Want to go home?
-What?

512
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:43,301
- You want to go home?
Yes, let's go home.

513
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:55,856
I'm back!

514
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:00,819
Welcome home!

515
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:04,448
You've done well?

516
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,661
We came from far away.

517
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,164
Don't worry,
I was born in this city.

518
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,958
- And Ryota?
-He had a very important meeting.

519
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:17,004
He works hard.

520
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,838
I wish my husband would do the same.

521
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:23,342
"Leave for tomorrow
what you can do today,"

522
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:24,968
is my motto.

523
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:29,265
Yeah, keep it up and you'll be dead
before you do anything.

524
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:33,353
Do not try to scare me
I still have a few years.

525
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:36,398
Wow, what is this?

526
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,902
Nothing, an incident in the park.

527
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,114
I ran a lot and fell.

528
00:43:45,615 --> 00:43:48,076
Bled a little, but it finally
stopped.

529
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,247
The bleeding stopped?

530
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:54,042
Does it hurts?

531
00:43:57,419 --> 00:44:00,629
So you bathed?

532
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,507
It's very small.

533
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:05,010
As half of ours.

534
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,142
And how's Ryusei's mother?

535
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:17,022
In the beginning, she was scary, but
she's very good.

536
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:19,733
Very good.

537
00:44:26,782 --> 00:44:27,741
Keita.

538
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,161
Do you think we should escape?

539
00:44:32,455 --> 00:44:33,622
Where?

540
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,128
-Far.
-How far?

541
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,173
Someplace where nobody knows us.

542
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:50,766
What would Dad do?

543
00:44:52,976 --> 00:44:54,142
Yeah, Dad...

544
00:44:57,646 --> 00:44:59,649
Dad is very busy with his work.

545
00:45:20,796 --> 00:45:21,963
Wait, Ryusei!

546
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:23,674
Yamato!

547
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:26,843
Wait, Yamato!

548
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:29,930
I caught you.

549
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:34,768
You're hair is soaked.

550
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:38,813
Wait, come here.

551
00:45:40,024 --> 00:45:43,109
-Be still, I will dry you off.
-Now, it's dry.

552
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,113
Of course is not dry!

553
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:50,701
-It's dry!
-Behind is very wet.

554
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,204
-Turn around.
-Not my face.

555
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:54,371
Come here.

556
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,125
Come on, now we sleep together.

557
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:07,051
They create damage,

558
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:09,844
but don't, even bother to apologize.

559
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:13,348
For this, you should come with me.

560
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:17,269
No good to mess with me.

561
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:20,065
I'll put on a dressing

562
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:26,529
In Ryusei's house,

563
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:29,240
it's called a bandage.

564
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:30,825
Really?

565
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:34,871
Well, that's it.

566
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:37,289
Come, go say goodnight to Daddy
.

567
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,586
Good night, Dad.
-Sleep well.

568
00:46:51,346 --> 00:46:53,139
How was the food, good?

569
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:58,769
A success. Kaoru found a college boyfriend.

570
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:00,897
The director was a great disappointment.

571
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:05,067
They say anything about me, make any comment?

572
00:47:07,946 --> 00:47:10,908
They wondered why,
as a mother, I didn't notice?

573
00:47:12,826 --> 00:47:14,620
Nothing at all.

574
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:20,208
Basically, I'll question you, then.

575
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:24,922
-I do not question it.
-Lying.

576
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:27,716
You think it's all my fault.

577
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:39,478
When can I go back to Ryusei's
house again to spend the night?

578
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:41,939
Next Saturday.

579
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,566
Can I take this?

580
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:46,610
Of course.

581
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:48,570
That's fantastic.

582
00:47:48,862 --> 00:47:50,948
He's able to fix anything.

583
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:53,284
How marvelous!

584
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:55,536
Now,

585
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,081
ask him to fix the radiator.

586
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:05,253
Mom, do you want to stay?

587
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:06,964
April

588
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,467
I have...I must go.

589
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:12,721
It also gives me the feeling of being in a
hotel

590
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:14,389
I prefer to go home.

591
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,601
During the war,

592
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:22,314
many children were separated from their parents or lost,

593
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:23,898
and others just simply adapted.

594
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,151
In reality, what matters
it is who you raised.

595
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,945
I have not decided to raise him.

596
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:31,615
But then why all of this?

597
00:48:31,905 --> 00:48:33,741
Why let them come and go?

598
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,034
We'll talk about it,

599
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:38,080
and see what decision we make.

600
00:48:38,788 --> 00:48:40,415
Excuse me.

601
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:43,293
An old woman like me should not intrude.

602
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:46,254
On the contrary, your opinion counts a lot

603
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:47,588
I appreciate that.

604
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:49,507
We are prepared.

605
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:51,008
You're dressed well.

606
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:54,053
You're more handsome than the most handsome prince.

607
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:02,145
Good morning.

608
00:49:04,648 --> 00:49:06,109
I'm here.
Yes.

609
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:09,653
Mr. Saiki.

610
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:12,531
Good morning.

611
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:16,701
The hospital has paid my
trip by train.

612
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:18,286
Please come in.

613
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:21,832
-For you.
-Thank you.

614
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:26,796
Nice place.

615
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,758
Ryusei already said looked like a hotel.

616
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:34,720
Keita, hello!

617
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,267
You're handsome!

618
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,479
You must be
prince from a distant country.

619
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:46,024
Is a pleasure to meet you, I'm his
grandmother.

620
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:49,484
Course, you are Keita's grandmother,
pleased to meet you.

621
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,034
But you are very young.

622
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,577
You do not get anything with flattery.

623
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,246
I guess that around you,
it's not needed.

624
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,342
-Can I?
-Don't worry.

625
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,887
Keita, what have you found?

626
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,811
-Here..
-A lovely petal.

627
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,443
-Take a picture.
-No need, no.

628
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:32,822
Look, I filmed myself
see?

629
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,534
Tsuyuki  Mao.

630
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,416
Mao-Tsuyuki, answered.
Yes.

631
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:49,421
Nonomiya Keita.

632
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:50,630
Yes!

633
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,807
I do not quite understand.

634
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,354
When I saw the face of Keita,
I saw Ryusei.

635
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,235
But now look at him,
and his face is that of Keita,

636
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,570
True?

637
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,834
Mr. Nonomiya.

638
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,585
Ryota!

639
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,172
Ryota!

640
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,174
He plays!

641
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,467
Look up!

642
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,011
What pain, what pain!

643
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,944
It can not go on, it's over.

644
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:54,070
I'm exhausted.

645
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,785
I should have had them before 40

646
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:01,869
I am too old.

647
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,374
Ryota is younger than me.

648
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,337
You should find the time
to be more with your child.

649
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:16,092
Well, in this world there are many types of families.

650
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,430
They don't bathe together?

651
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:23,100
At home, our idea is that it is separate.

652
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,562
Your idea
certainly is very respectable.

653
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,816
But believe me,
it's worth spending time.

654
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,652
Let's be honest,
in these last six months

655
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:37,239
I've spent far more time with him than you.

656
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:40,492
Come on, there's plenty of time.

657
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:44,496
Make no mistake,
for children, time is everything.

658
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,334
There are things in my job
that only I can do.

659
00:52:53,214 --> 00:52:56,550
But no one can replace him
in his role of father.

660
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:08,855
Hey!

661
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:10,899
Ryusei!

662
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:13,568
We're going.

663
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:16,403
They look like brothers, it's incredible!

664
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:21,326
A pork curry take out, please.

665
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:23,370
A moment, please.

666
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,791
My father is at home
he's hungry.

667
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:32,254
Slowly, he's returning to childhood.

668
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,338
It is as if we had four children.

669
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,091
More like five, I think.

670
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:38,134
I can not take care for them all.

671
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:40,470
You mean me?

672
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,599
If so, perhaps
we can take care of the two.

673
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:48,145
Two?

674
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:50,479
Keita and Ryusei.

675
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:53,233
Wait,

676
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,318
are you serious?

677
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,070
Yes

678
00:53:58,362 --> 00:53:59,740
Doesn't it seem possible?

679
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:07,039
I can not believe it.

680
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,167
Now you insults us.

681
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:13,754
-If we think of their future...
-Ours don't have a future?

682
00:54:14,128 --> 00:54:16,340
I have more economic opportunities.

683
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:20,010
There are many things that money
can not buy.

684
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:24,223
Trying to buy a child,
that is it now?

685
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:27,142
He said before that he was interested
in money?

686
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:30,520
Excuse him, he's tired,
He doesn't know what he's saying.

687
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:33,774
The children are looking at us.

688
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:37,446
Your pork curry is ready.

689
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,451
He has never lost a game, right?

690
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,371
You don't understand how others feel.

691
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:57,215
How can you fix it?

692
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:02,136
Once, you get it, it's nothing

693
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:05,390
I still don't believe it...
clearly they're angry.

694
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,308
Please shut up a minute, let me think.

695
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:11,812
Now we started to get along.

696
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:16,818
Why should I tolerate a shopkeeper
giving me advice?

697
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:18,529
Do not start that again.

698
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,030
You're back!

699
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:24,450
-Latte for Mom.
Thanks.

700
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:28,622
Coffee just for dad.

701
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:30,289
Thank you.

702
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:37,714
-You're change, Mom.
-Thank you.

703
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:45,847
Well, here goes!

704
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:48,643
You have returned to give!

705
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:50,311
Well, way to go!

706
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:55,190
You left out, Keita,
must bounce within the track.

707
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:59,153
It's not okay, be careful
that doesn't leave the track.

708
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:02,740
You remember the nurse Miyazaki?

709
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:03,824
No.

710
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,078
- Maybe when you see...
- Are you going to testify?

711
00:56:08,704 --> 00:56:11,332
Guess the hospital will try to show

712
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,835
working conditions of the staff were correct.

713
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:18,589
They were ironing, when we were leaving...

714
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,008
Please,
is not the time for nonsense.

715
00:56:21,217 --> 00:56:23,885
I apologize for the other day.

716
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:27,807
Yes, of course.

717
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:30,351
No, no, it was our fault.

718
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:33,187
I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,

719
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:35,816
according to the dictates of my conscience,

720
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:40,152
concealing nothing, and speaking the truth.

721
00:56:41,028 --> 00:56:43,449
-Saiki Yukari.
-Nonomiya Midori.

722
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,242
Miyazaki Shoko.

723
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:50,247
Assuming the hospital commits a mistake,

724
00:56:51,038 --> 00:56:53,375
shouldn't you have realized it?

725
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:55,084
As the baby's mother,

726
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:00,422
under normal conditions.

727
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,468
But I had a postpartum hemorrhage.

728
00:57:03,676 --> 00:57:06,972
I was barely conscious
for several days.

729
00:57:09,475 --> 00:57:12,853
Do you think that children are
exchanged without difficulties?

730
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:14,605
I don't know.

731
00:57:15,688 --> 00:57:18,024
Even if we decided to exchange them,

732
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:20,611
there are no guarantees that the 
children would adapt.

733
00:57:21,987 --> 00:57:24,823
The pain this mistake has caused our family

734
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,367
is not easily erased.

735
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:31,747
It is a suffering that will continue
with us for many years.

736
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,669
Tell me, about the times,

737
00:57:37,336 --> 00:57:40,589
you worked the night shift 
several days in a row?

738
00:57:41,883 --> 00:57:42,883
No.

739
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:46,930
Compared to other hospitals,
shifts were very good.

740
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:51,892
Being so, why do you suppose 
this accident happened?

741
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,899
It was not an accident.

742
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:02,153
It was not an accident?

743
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,281
What do you mean?

744
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:10,869
The Nonomiya's seemed very happy with their child.

745
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,290
I did it on purpose.

746
00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:28,512
I've had many problems raising my
children.

747
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:32,642
I took out my frustrations with other
babies...

748
00:58:35,354 --> 00:58:38,356
Nonomiya's room most was the 
expensive of all.

749
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:41,693
She told me that her husband was
in a large company.

750
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,822
His family came to see her all the time.

751
00:58:47,406 --> 00:58:48,951
In comparison,

752
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,036
I had nothing.

753
00:58:54,373 --> 00:58:57,710
Can you try to describe how you felt then?

754
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:02,172
Honestly, I think I was very happy.

755
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:05,174
That, I was not the only one with problems.

756
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:09,721
Well,

757
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:11,181
let's see.

758
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,478
Why are you confessing now?

759
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:20,983
...because of my children.

760
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:26,696
...and what I did then, was really monstrous.

761
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:30,743
I want you to punish me for what I did.

762
00:59:34,663 --> 00:59:36,415
I apologize. Please forgive me.

763
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,002
I'm so sorry.

764
00:59:42,756 --> 00:59:47,010
You can't relieve their frustrations.

765
00:59:48,344 --> 00:59:51,556
I knew that her husband had children
when she married him.

766
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,516
Seemed relieved.

767
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,977
For her
is like stealing from a store.

768
00:59:56,353 --> 00:59:59,022
Not seeming to understand the consequences of their actions.

769
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,651
Now he says he is happy.

770
01:00:03,276 --> 01:00:05,195
How can someone be so selfish?

771
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:06,655
I think...it seems to me,

772
01:00:07,322 --> 01:00:10,159
that the hospital must pay more for
damages.

773
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,367
- It's obvious.
- Yes, of course, much more.

774
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,039
Please ,

775
01:00:15,496 --> 01:00:17,792
do not forget to ask Mr. Suzumoto.

776
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:20,919
Yes.

777
01:00:22,713 --> 01:00:25,005
-She will go to jail, right?
-Yes.

778
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:26,675
Of course, that she will go to jail.

779
01:00:27,008 --> 01:00:30,178
Now, about 5 or 6 years,
does not seem enough.

780
01:00:31,722 --> 01:00:34,474
Unfortunately, the crime has prescribed this.

781
01:00:36,017 --> 01:00:37,061
Prescribed?

782
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:40,147
Yes, I said it Suzumoto.

783
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:43,400
We could accuse her of child abduction,

784
01:00:43,609 --> 01:00:46,195
but the statute of limitations is 5 years.

785
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:48,613
She apologizes and that's it, that's it?

786
01:00:49,073 --> 01:00:51,242
-It's ridiculous!
-Please, lower your voice.

787
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:55,245
We can not allow it to be so easy for her.

788
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,957
We will always suffer,

789
01:00:58,248 --> 01:01:00,084
yet, nothing happens to this woman.

790
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:05,756
She realized that the statue had 
expired, so she confessed.

791
01:01:06,131 --> 01:01:07,342
I know,

792
01:01:09,175 --> 01:01:10,676
I will never forgive her.

793
01:01:11,554 --> 01:01:12,513
Never.

794
01:01:13,223 --> 01:01:14,139
Ever.

795
01:01:17,017 --> 01:01:18,935
June

796
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:21,106
Let's see what you're doing.

797
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,317
See what flower stalk Megumi prepared.

798
01:01:25,902 --> 01:01:27,362
She did so very well.

799
01:01:41,877 --> 01:01:44,630
I was taking pills for the tension and
stress.

800
01:01:45,712 --> 01:01:46,881
Is this the second?

801
01:01:47,215 --> 01:01:48,134
The third.

802
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,177
Luckily it was Mr. Nobuko.

803
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:54,431
Well, yes.

804
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:57,851
Try calling her "mother"
when you see her, right?

805
01:01:58,726 --> 01:01:59,352
Yes.

806
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:01,229
Don't you?

807
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:07,153
Imagine Dad is so weak that he asked,

808
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:09,028
his children to go to see him.

809
01:02:10,406 --> 01:02:13,699
Just as well, you will not be bad at all
somewhat weakened.

810
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:17,244
When he see the roses, he'll cry.

811
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:24,587
-Change.
Thanks.

812
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:28,048
-Thank you for calling.
-Thanks for coming.

813
01:02:34,346 --> 01:02:36,891
It's the only restaurant in
the neighborhood.

814
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,354
You are fully recovered from your illness?

815
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:46,359
Otherwise, you would not be here
visiting.

816
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,028
I told you the last time
I can not give more money.

817
01:02:50,446 --> 01:02:52,030
I do not need money.

818
01:02:52,448 --> 01:02:55,618
I work in a building in the Minowa district.

819
01:02:56,785 --> 01:02:57,579
And she,

820
01:02:58,536 --> 01:02:59,956
works part time.

821
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:03,250
-Stop playing the stock market.
-Silent, Ryota.

822
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:07,629
You like the salmon eggs? Eat as much as you want.

823
01:03:09,466 --> 01:03:11,467
I love to do that.

824
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,346
But I must be careful with
uric acid.

825
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:17,891
I'll make an exception.

826
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:30,445
Why you know so much about salmon eggs?

827
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:35,659
And horse racing?

828
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,663
By your expression,
because you lose a lot.

829
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:46,003
You bet again on the wrong number.

830
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:47,962
Why you insist on suffering?

831
01:03:48,337 --> 01:03:50,173
You have the wrong horse.

832
01:03:50,715 --> 01:03:53,135
As you can see, it gives me no pleasure.

833
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:55,971
It appears that I am like you.

834
01:03:59,224 --> 01:04:01,811
Well, that's married life.

835
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:06,524
You are completely devoted to him.

836
01:04:07,025 --> 01:04:08,818
You work more than a nurse.

837
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,487
If I'm your nurse, you must pay me
thousand yen per hour.

838
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:16,116
That's what they pay me.

839
01:04:22,247 --> 01:04:24,292
Takes three years with the piano,

840
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:27,961
but always plays the same,
"Delicate Flower".

841
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:31,048
There is no rest.

842
01:04:31,256 --> 01:04:32,799
Quiet, or he'll hear you.

843
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:35,344
Exactly, I want him to hear me.

844
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:46,523
Well, you know him?

845
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:51,902
I mean your real son.

846
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:55,114
Yes, I recognize him.
- And you think he looks like you?

847
01:04:57,576 --> 01:04:58,868
Sure yes.

848
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:02,872
That is the meaning of family.

849
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:06,084
Your children seems like you, 
although they don't live with you.

850
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:09,003
Come on, Dad, don't start with this.

851
01:05:10,089 --> 01:05:11,005
Right?

852
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:15,468
Listen to me, it's a matter of blood.

853
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:19,765
It's the same in humans,
as it is in horses.

854
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:24,060
That child will look increasingly like
you.

855
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:27,439
But, Keita

856
01:05:28,106 --> 01:05:31,777
increasingly will resemble his 
blood father, trust me.

857
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,947
Interact with the child soon

858
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:39,534
or, you'll never see that family.

859
01:05:43,538 --> 01:05:45,249
It's not that simple.

860
01:05:53,423 --> 01:05:55,301
It's slippery, so be careful.

861
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,721
I know it's slippery,
don't be so demanding.

862
01:06:00,055 --> 01:06:01,347
Are you my wife?

863
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,643
I just try to be nice to you.

864
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:06,478
You keep it up and you'll be 
without friends.

865
01:06:07,354 --> 01:06:09,105
I haven't had friends for a long time.

866
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:16,156
In spite of what your father says,

867
01:06:16,656 --> 01:06:20,325
just live, blood is unimportant.

868
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:23,245
You want other people to be like her.

869
01:06:23,454 --> 01:06:25,248
It happens between married couples.

870
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:29,044
And, probably the same thing happens with children.

871
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:31,629
In my case,

872
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:34,174
it's what I felt in my heart

873
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,426
over the years as I grew up.

874
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:44,141
-Come back soon.
Yes.

875
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:47,186
Tell Manami that I'll see their beautiful quilts, soon.

876
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:48,605
Yes, please come.

877
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,190
Goodbye.

878
01:06:53,193 --> 01:06:54,526
And next time,

879
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:57,406
bring something to drink, forget the flowers.

880
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:05,457
-I'm glad your Dad is okay.
-I played it off.

881
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:07,499
I had to ask off at work.

882
01:07:08,874 --> 01:07:10,752
He said something about Keita?

883
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,339
No, nothing major.

884
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,217
Keita, Dad is in the house.

885
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,303
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

886
01:07:25,643 --> 01:07:27,978
For Father's Day, he did it in school.

887
01:07:35,736 --> 01:07:36,696
Keita

888
01:07:37,946 --> 01:07:38,905
Thank you very much.

889
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,826
The second is for Ryusei's Dad.

890
01:07:43,911 --> 01:07:46,498
I want to thank him for fixing the robot.

891
01:07:49,957 --> 01:07:51,210
I understand.

892
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:55,131
You are very kind and generous.

893
01:08:24,993 --> 01:08:27,789
How come we don't follow,
like so far?

894
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,293
As if nothing had happened.

895
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:35,672
Every day that passes,

896
01:08:36,882 --> 01:08:39,677
Keita will look more like you.

897
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,971
And Ryusei,

898
01:08:44,807 --> 01:08:46,724
will look more like us.

899
01:08:49,894 --> 01:08:51,063
You can

900
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:54,733
love him as before knowing

901
01:08:56,985 --> 01:08:58,737
he is not the same blood.

902
01:08:59,237 --> 01:09:00,779
It has nothing to do with that.

903
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:04,868
I'm just concerned

904
01:09:06,454 --> 01:09:08,372
that your child won't like it,

905
01:09:09,748 --> 01:09:12,751
because it does not feel like a real union
with him.

906
01:09:17,256 --> 01:09:19,342
The longer we delay,

907
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:21,969
the harder it will be.

908
01:09:24,139 --> 01:09:25,014
For us.

909
01:09:27,766 --> 01:09:28,768
For the kids.

910
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:38,568
Keita , you take care of them.

911
01:09:39,946 --> 01:09:41,321
I have to go.

912
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:44,743
-Go, goodbye.
-Bye!

913
01:09:50,748 --> 01:09:52,750
The bento is ready.

914
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,635
400 yen, please.

915
01:10:04,303 --> 01:10:07,014
Keita, you get another piece 
of fried chicken.

916
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:11,144
-Be careful on the way home.
-Bye.

917
01:10:44,553 --> 01:10:47,514
When summer arrives,

918
01:10:47,764 --> 01:10:50,476
we'll launch flares in the garden.

919
01:10:51,142 --> 01:10:53,186
We'll swim in the pool

920
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:56,648
and eat a lot of freshly cut watermelon.

921
01:10:58,275 --> 01:10:59,902
-You too, Keita!
Yes.

922
01:11:09,955 --> 01:11:11,539
How funny!

923
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:13,958
I'm home.

924
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:17,128
He's arrived, now.

925
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:20,924
Yes, you've been very helpful, thanks.

926
01:11:21,674 --> 01:11:22,716
We'll talk.

927
01:11:27,138 --> 01:11:28,097
Good.

928
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,142
Where is Ryusei?

929
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:33,894
Bathing.

930
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,943
I have not noticed the time.

931
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:46,448
I feel that you should take care of him.

932
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:50,703
I have the day off tomorrow.

933
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:53,749
It has always been so, as
nothing happens.

934
01:11:54,499 --> 01:11:55,626
It's not important.

935
01:12:01,089 --> 01:12:02,507
Who were you talking to?

936
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:04,885
With Yukari.

937
01:12:05,636 --> 01:12:08,805
Yudai says, she wants to open a surf shop.

938
01:12:09,014 --> 01:12:10,391
when she turns 50

939
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:13,184
But, she knows nothing about surfing!

940
01:12:18,022 --> 01:12:20,192
You should not have contacted her.

941
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:23,737
As mothers, we need to share many things.

942
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:26,156
But you do not.

943
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,460
She plays good.

944
01:13:19,877 --> 01:13:20,879
Of course.

945
01:13:25,007 --> 01:13:26,510
Keita, I do not understand.

946
01:13:28,803 --> 01:13:31,180
if you lack willingness to play well,

947
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,849
you'd better let her.

948
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:36,853
Not everyone is able to work like you.

949
01:13:39,272 --> 01:13:41,400
Now work is a defect?

950
01:13:42,275 --> 01:13:45,278
Not everyone can work, although we want to.

951
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,367
I think Keita is a lot like me.

952
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:12,598
He's asleep?

953
01:14:20,481 --> 01:14:22,316
I've done what you asked.

954
01:14:23,734 --> 01:14:26,153
However, you want Keita to leave.

955
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,241
Said you that's the solution.

956
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:32,617
Liar.

957
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,916
I didn't think that it would end well.

958
01:14:38,124 --> 01:14:40,209
I had decided from the beginning.

959
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,838
Six years with Keita, is enough time.

960
01:14:44,297 --> 01:14:47,758
-Blood is important.
-You're wrong, it's not.

961
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:49,427
Didn't you tell me...

962
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,852
Did you say when you know that Keita was not ours?

963
01:14:57,643 --> 01:14:58,936
You do not remember?

964
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,855
Yes, I remember.

965
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:09,615
I don't understand why I did not see.

966
01:15:14,535 --> 01:15:15,871
Excuse me.

967
01:15:16,705 --> 01:15:18,123
-Not your fault.
-No!

968
01:15:18,707 --> 01:15:20,125
Not about that.

969
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:24,921
I remember what you said.

970
01:15:26,172 --> 01:15:27,799
"Get it now".

971
01:15:29,718 --> 01:15:31,387
Now, it makes sense.

972
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:37,559
What makes sense now?

973
01:15:40,354 --> 01:15:41,480
Nothing.

974
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,652
Can't you accept that Keita
does not have the same ability as you.

975
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:51,281
I will never forget,

976
01:15:53,659 --> 01:15:55,327
what you said then.

977
01:16:07,088 --> 01:16:08,298
Ready?

978
01:16:14,221 --> 01:16:15,515
You're doing great.

979
01:16:24,064 --> 01:16:25,358
Tremendous!

980
01:16:26,151 --> 01:16:28,194
Ready? Here we go.

981
01:16:32,865 --> 01:16:34,117
Can I have it?

982
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:40,331
There.

983
01:16:49,132 --> 01:16:49,925
The camera,

984
01:16:50,717 --> 01:16:52,094
you wish for the Royal family?

985
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:56,515
Why?

986
01:16:57,265 --> 01:16:58,016
You don't want it?

987
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,976
That, I do not want.

988
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:03,939
I understand.

989
01:17:10,446 --> 01:17:11,947
Listen, Keita,

990
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:14,616
when you go home,

991
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:18,411
better that you call Dad 
and Mom; Uncle and Aunt.

992
01:17:20,122 --> 01:17:22,165
Although there are times you feel alone,

993
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:24,417
you can not call us.

994
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:26,086
Promise.

995
01:17:27,128 --> 01:17:28,381
Is a mission?

996
01:17:29,465 --> 01:17:31,299
Yes, it's a mission.

997
01:17:34,136 --> 01:17:35,553
Will I have a goal?

998
01:17:37,556 --> 01:17:38,640
It's not yet clear.

999
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:43,103
Keita,

1000
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:47,066
Now, you don't really understand
what's coming in this mission.

1001
01:17:48,942 --> 01:17:52,030
But surely, in ten years,
you'll understand.

1002
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:55,408
Ryusei's house.

1003
01:17:56,409 --> 01:17:57,994
I will play the piano, again?

1004
01:18:00,246 --> 01:18:01,373
As you wish.

1005
01:18:02,706 --> 01:18:06,460
If you want to keep playing,
talk to them and work it out.

1006
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:48,773
Hey, nothing but kites here.

1007
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:51,860
Is the time of spawning...

1008
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:56,365
They have wires to protect them 
from the birds.

1009
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:00,368
Come on!

1010
01:20:01,077 --> 01:20:02,036
Enough!

1011
01:20:02,453 --> 01:20:03,496
Ryusei!

1012
01:20:14,633 --> 01:20:16,426
When we were young...

1013
01:20:16,842 --> 01:20:17,718
Well,

1014
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:20,596
the truth, I'm a little older than you.

1015
01:20:21,722 --> 01:20:23,183
But my father

1016
01:20:23,559 --> 01:20:27,020
made kites with bamboo sticks
and fine white paper.

1017
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:31,942
Trimmed strips of newspaper to make the kite tapes.

1018
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,615
Now, flying kites is nothing.

1019
01:20:38,949 --> 01:20:41,786
It cost much more then it does to make them fly.

1020
01:20:45,581 --> 01:20:46,832
My father

1021
01:20:47,582 --> 01:20:50,961
didn't fly kites with his children.

1022
01:20:54,966 --> 01:20:55,925
Of course.

1023
01:20:56,676 --> 01:21:00,136
But nothing forces you to act
as your father did.

1024
01:21:04,517 --> 01:21:07,268
Please, go to fly kites
with Ryusei.

1025
01:21:11,522 --> 01:21:12,442
Yes

1026
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:23,578
It's a train.

1027
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:25,371
It's been!

1028
01:21:28,249 --> 01:21:30,793
Not likely, but a lot of things give fear.

1029
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,673
It took him to overcome his fear to go 
to the bathroom alone at night.

1030
01:21:36,799 --> 01:21:38,634
I always had to accompany him.

1031
01:21:41,387 --> 01:21:44,431
But when Yamato was born, it made him
the big brother.

1032
01:21:47,268 --> 01:21:51,231
I promised that when Yamato
was no longer in diapers,

1033
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:53,900
he would accompany him to 
the bathroom at night.

1034
01:22:00,197 --> 01:22:01,283
Keita

1035
01:22:03,325 --> 01:22:05,579
often tells me he wants a brother.

1036
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:09,540
But

1037
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,294
I can not have more children.

1038
01:22:17,298 --> 01:22:18,258
Therefore

1039
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:22,013
I think he'll be happy

1040
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,016
with a brother

1041
01:22:28,102 --> 01:22:29,145
and sister

1042
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:33,315
the way things are.

1043
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,269
Keita

1044
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:13,064
when you go home,

1045
01:23:14,398 --> 01:23:16,400
don't worry about anything.

1046
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:20,696
Ryusei's parents

1047
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:23,907
love you very much.

1048
01:23:27,662 --> 01:23:29,038
More than you, Dad?

1049
01:23:35,588 --> 01:23:36,504
More than me.

1050
01:23:42,302 --> 01:23:43,220
Hey,

1051
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,888
we take a picture together?

1052
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:47,807
-Yes.
-Come on.

1053
01:24:08,703 --> 01:24:09,997
Ready?

1054
01:24:10,539 --> 01:24:12,125
Come on!

1055
01:24:16,003 --> 01:24:16,837
Smiles.

1056
01:24:18,381 --> 01:24:19,673
We always smile.

1057
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,968
Come on, get ready!

1058
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,763
One,

1059
01:24:26,347 --> 01:24:27,222
two

1060
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:28,306
and three!

1061
01:24:39,194 --> 01:24:41,361
-Why are you laughing?
-Why am I laughing?

1062
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:43,532
-I don't see what's funny.
-Me neither.

1063
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:53,041
Don't bite the straws.

1064
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:56,836
I'm going to English class every day
and studying hard.

1065
01:24:57,837 --> 01:24:59,963
I feel when I go to the toilet.

1066
01:25:00,172 --> 01:25:03,426
I bathe alone, quietly.

1067
01:25:04,385 --> 01:25:05,887
I just watch TV

1068
01:25:06,136 --> 01:25:08,598
or play on the game console for a 
half hour.

1069
01:25:09,515 --> 01:25:11,893
Should I call you Mom and Dad?

1070
01:25:12,102 --> 01:25:13,143
Why?

1071
01:25:16,773 --> 01:25:18,150
You're not my dad.

1072
01:25:19,025 --> 01:25:20,318
You're not my dad.

1073
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:24,740
From now on, I will be your dad.

1074
01:25:25,114 --> 01:25:25,907
Why?

1075
01:25:31,495 --> 01:25:32,582
That does not matter.

1076
01:25:33,539 --> 01:25:34,458
Why?

1077
01:25:37,711 --> 01:25:38,879
Well,

1078
01:25:40,339 --> 01:25:41,047
they...

1079
01:25:46,887 --> 01:25:48,097
I'll explain.

1080
01:25:49,724 --> 01:25:51,308
Your dad and your mom

1081
01:25:52,476 --> 01:25:53,518
live there.

1082
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:55,395
As always.

1083
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:57,188
But now

1084
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,567
You can call us

1085
01:26:00,442 --> 01:26:02,944
father and mother, right?

1086
01:26:03,153 --> 01:26:03,905
Why?

1087
01:26:05,656 --> 01:26:06,615
That does not matter.

1088
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:09,951
You must explain to me why it's the same.

1089
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:18,669
-Someday you'll understand.
-Why?

1090
01:26:20,004 --> 01:26:21,172
That does not matter.

1091
01:26:22,924 --> 01:26:23,883
Anyway?

1092
01:26:24,425 --> 01:26:25,175
Why?

1093
01:26:32,099 --> 01:26:34,101
-That's what I'm asking.
-Why?

1094
01:27:00,503 --> 01:27:01,754
Brush your teeth.

1095
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:04,007
Take.

1096
01:27:13,684 --> 01:27:15,186
That's better.

1097
01:27:44,447 --> 01:27:45,490
Hey

1098
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:47,218
What's the matter?

1099
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:56,310
You broke it?

1100
01:27:56,769 --> 01:27:57,686
Okay.

1101
01:27:58,354 --> 01:28:00,899
Let's see if we can fix it.

1102
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:13,328
Here?

1103
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:16,498
Here, here, here?

1104
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:20,417
Already fixed?

1105
01:28:45,693 --> 01:28:48,196
August

1106
01:28:52,534 --> 01:28:55,579
Utsunomiya Engineering Department

1107
01:28:56,538 --> 01:28:57,330
Yes

1108
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:02,001
Why send it to me?
Nohara can deal with that.

1109
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,128
Good...

1110
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:08,258
It's almost time for the trial date.

1111
01:29:09,718 --> 01:29:11,095
Excuse me, sir,

1112
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,763
but I am the plaintiff.

1113
01:29:13,972 --> 01:29:15,808
Yes, I know perfectly.

1114
01:29:17,768 --> 01:29:18,768
See,

1115
01:29:19,269 --> 01:29:21,896
You've always been in a hurry.

1116
01:29:23,272 --> 01:29:25,359
At some point it must stop.

1117
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:28,152
But you are where you are 
because you failed to stop.

1118
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:30,615
It's not the same,
times are changing.

1119
01:29:31,656 --> 01:29:34,035
Try to spend more time with the family.

1120
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,999
Ramen pasta boxes can be red or blue.

1121
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:45,629
- And what do you prefer?
-I like the red.

1122
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,092
Red carries soy sauce.

1123
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,261
- Right?
- I didn't know that.

1124
01:29:59,893 --> 01:30:00,687
What did you say?

1125
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:17,953
Dad hasn't arrived yet,
-We won't tell anyone.

1126
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,714
Why have you drawn this?

1127
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:30,717
You're done crying to Mom?

1128
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,804
You asked for forgiveness?

1129
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:36,306
No?

1130
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:42,187
Okay.

1131
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:44,189
Go to bed.

1132
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:47,859
You don't say, 'goodnight?'

1133
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,487
Goodnight.

1134
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:03,626
Dad---Mom

1135
01:31:26,357 --> 01:31:27,400
You're making a lot of noise.

1136
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:28,776
Stop it.

1137
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,280
I've said enough!

1138
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:15,448
Enough of this...

1139
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:19,245
This does not work, it's broken.

1140
01:32:20,496 --> 01:32:22,289
Tell your mother to buy you another.

1141
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,962
When I go home, Dad will fix it.

1142
01:32:29,297 --> 01:32:30,464
Ryusei.

1143
01:32:38,765 --> 01:32:40,932
You'll never return to that house.

1144
01:32:43,019 --> 01:32:44,978
From now on, you will live here.

1145
01:32:48,524 --> 01:32:50,483
I am your real father.

1146
01:32:56,323 --> 01:32:57,575
Let me see it.

1147
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:41,221
I just told you that you've won, 
but you do not seem very happy.

1148
01:34:42,055 --> 01:34:44,099
I have not gained or lost.

1149
01:34:45,726 --> 01:34:47,353
Well, in many trials,

1150
01:34:47,562 --> 01:34:50,230
is not clear who wins and who loses.

1151
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,609
No, I do not mean that.

1152
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,113
It's not typical of you,

1153
01:34:59,573 --> 01:35:01,701
it might start to be like you.

1154
01:35:04,453 --> 01:35:06,206
I do not fall well.

1155
01:35:07,372 --> 01:35:09,418
You worried about the opinion of others?

1156
01:35:09,668 --> 01:35:11,586
You have really changed.

1157
01:35:15,005 --> 01:35:16,175
I almost forgot it.

1158
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,636
This.

1159
01:35:21,096 --> 01:35:22,597
I got it from the nurse,

1160
01:35:23,264 --> 01:35:25,475
In addition to the amount of the hospital.

1161
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:31,064
This is the maximum contribution
in good faith.

1162
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:44,911
Good afternoon.

1163
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:47,081
Good afternoon.

1164
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:50,417
Look,

1165
01:35:51,918 --> 01:35:53,419
I come to return it.

1166
01:35:54,422 --> 01:35:55,882
Your good faith.

1167
01:35:57,632 --> 01:35:59,010
I'm so sorry.

1168
01:36:01,721 --> 01:36:03,097
What has happened

1169
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:06,392
has destroyed my family.

1170
01:36:10,105 --> 01:36:11,272
Teru.

1171
01:36:12,983 --> 01:36:14,817
It has nothing to do with you.

1172
01:36:15,735 --> 01:36:17,278
This is about me.

1173
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,114
It's my mother.

1174
01:37:28,267 --> 01:37:30,852
Nonomiya's house,
Talk to me.

1175
01:37:32,104 --> 01:37:33,147
I'm Ryota.

1176
01:37:33,565 --> 01:37:37,024
Ryota, how are you?
Thanks for coming the other day.

1177
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:41,614
Listen.

1178
01:37:42,448 --> 01:37:43,782
You want to speak to your father?

1179
01:37:44,783 --> 01:37:45,533
No.

1180
01:37:49,413 --> 01:37:51,040
I called to apologize.

1181
01:37:52,916 --> 01:37:56,253
No, Ryota, do not get serious
at this point.

1182
01:37:58,130 --> 01:37:59,339
As of then.

1183
01:37:59,757 --> 01:38:03,344
I never want to go back there, 
it's ancient history.

1184
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:07,055
I won't talk of nonsense with you, it's
not important.

1185
01:38:07,264 --> 01:38:11,310
Which famous wears a wig and what else has he operated.

1186
01:38:14,564 --> 01:38:15,732
I agree.

1187
01:38:19,277 --> 01:38:22,197
Your father is calling, he's out of sa-ke.

1188
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:29,828
Okay.

1189
01:38:32,124 --> 01:38:32,832
I understand.

1190
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:44,093
We use much less water in the Green Roof Project

1191
01:38:44,302 --> 01:38:46,763
now we channel rain water.

1192
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:50,183
If all the water is added

1193
01:38:50,392 --> 01:38:52,726
for watering plants and filling the pit

1194
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,731
does not exceed 42.6 cubic meters.

1195
01:39:19,546 --> 01:39:20,590
I also started

1196
01:39:21,757 --> 01:39:23,717
being an architect, like you.

1197
01:39:27,263 --> 01:39:30,141
This forest has been created by man,

1198
01:39:30,599 --> 01:39:32,309
for research.

1199
01:39:41,277 --> 01:39:42,445
And this,

1200
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,531
is it born here?

1201
01:39:46,448 --> 01:39:47,283
Yes

1202
01:39:49,285 --> 01:39:52,413
Insects
reproduce here easily.

1203
01:39:53,957 --> 01:39:56,751
But they need 15 years from the time

1204
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:59,712
that a cicada lays eggs

1205
01:40:00,296 --> 01:40:03,383
to become larvae
and leaving the ground.

1206
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:05,719
So much time?

1207
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:12,225
It seems much?

1208
01:41:39,481 --> 01:41:40,397
I say it is.

1209
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:56,706
Excuse me, Nonomiya.

1210
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:01,838
Forgive me for taking so long.

1211
01:42:02,337 --> 01:42:03,754
Hello, how are you?

1212
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:08,634
Apparently he decided he 
wanted to fly a kite.

1213
01:42:09,552 --> 01:42:10,553
A kite?

1214
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:14,140
He sneaked into the commuter train
behind an adult.

1215
01:42:14,724 --> 01:42:17,561
He's smart doing things like that.

1216
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,314
It's not a source of pride.

1217
01:42:22,108 --> 01:42:24,735
-You should punish him.
-What do you suggest?

1218
01:42:25,693 --> 01:42:28,071
That he return with an empty stomach?

1219
01:42:28,363 --> 01:42:29,657
We are not like that.

1220
01:42:30,532 --> 01:42:32,450
Yes, I understand your point of view.

1221
01:42:34,286 --> 01:42:35,871
If you think that it isn't fitting,

1222
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:38,707
he can stay with us for a while.

1223
01:42:38,916 --> 01:42:39,667
Clear.

1224
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:43,754
We have no objection in having Ryusei and Keita.

1225
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,634
It'll be fine.

1226
01:42:50,136 --> 01:42:51,429
I'll see.

1227
01:42:55,766 --> 01:42:56,684
Ryusei!

1228
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,352
Ryusei , come home.

1229
01:43:14,243 --> 01:43:15,578
You don't need

1230
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:20,041
We'll call your father and mother immediately.

1231
01:43:34,096 --> 01:43:36,141
Bathe and don't do anything stupid.

1232
01:43:50,781 --> 01:43:51,824
Keita.

1233
01:44:16,724 --> 01:44:18,350
If I rub well,

1234
01:44:21,019 --> 01:44:22,187
it's like

1235
01:44:24,732 --> 01:44:26,066
if it were you.

1236
01:44:31,239 --> 01:44:33,032
I also ran away from home.

1237
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:40,080
I wanted to see my mother.

1238
01:44:48,589 --> 01:44:51,718
But my father came and dragged me quickly
home.

1239
01:45:30,756 --> 01:45:33,303
- And now what?
- We go to father!

1240
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:58,202
Oh, my God!

1241
01:46:00,621 --> 01:46:01,497
Ryusei!

1242
01:46:01,706 --> 01:46:03,583
Ryusei, Ryusei, are you okay?

1243
01:46:12,634 --> 01:46:13,759
Father!

1244
01:46:14,384 --> 01:46:15,302
You hurt?

1245
01:46:15,636 --> 01:46:17,138
Father, are you hurt?

1246
01:46:17,514 --> 01:46:18,473
Enough!

1247
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:21,768
Be careful!

1248
01:46:39,827 --> 01:46:41,328
You're gonna win. You're gonna win.

1249
01:46:43,915 --> 01:46:44,832
I won!

1250
01:46:46,542 --> 01:46:48,586
-What did you find?
- That's it?

1251
01:46:49,962 --> 01:46:52,173
-It’s really small.
-Thank you.

1252
01:46:55,592 --> 01:46:57,679
Prepared attention...

1253
01:46:57,888 --> 01:46:58,930
Go!

1254
01:47:03,976 --> 01:47:05,812
- You've fished for your father.
- Be careful.

1255
01:47:35,551 --> 01:47:36,884
Cancer, Scorpio,

1256
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,721
Gemini.

1257
01:47:40,889 --> 01:47:42,058
Sagittarius.

1258
01:47:42,891 --> 01:47:43,767
Libra.

1259
01:47:45,603 --> 01:47:46,729
Aquarius.

1260
01:47:48,355 --> 01:47:49,481
-Virgo.
-Look...

1261
01:47:49,647 --> 01:47:51,192
A shooting star...

1262
01:47:51,901 --> 01:47:53,277
Make a wish.

1263
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:04,456
What have you wished for?

1264
01:48:05,414 --> 01:48:08,125
I can get back with mom and dad.

1265
01:48:10,044 --> 01:48:11,212
Ryusei.

1266
01:48:16,592 --> 01:48:17,718
I'm sorry.

1267
01:48:21,263 --> 01:48:22,474
It's okay.

1268
01:48:24,684 --> 01:48:25,809
It's okay.

1269
01:48:50,668 --> 01:48:51,670
What's wrong

1270
01:48:55,799 --> 01:48:57,884
I also want what Ryusei wants.

1271
01:49:03,222 --> 01:49:04,016
Then

1272
01:49:05,684 --> 01:49:06,851
why are you crying?

1273
01:49:08,896 --> 01:49:09,938
Because

1274
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,442
I feel terrible about Keita.

1275
01:49:17,905 --> 01:49:20,073
It is as if you betray him.

1276
01:49:24,411 --> 01:49:26,205
How will Keita feel?

1277
01:51:09,144 --> 01:51:10,811
Want some breakfast?

1278
01:51:18,027 --> 01:51:19,486
Do you want to eat?

1279
01:52:08,579 --> 01:52:09,871
Good.

1280
01:52:10,413 --> 01:52:12,833
Bulbs, right?
In how many watts?

1281
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,211
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

1282
01:52:16,419 --> 01:52:17,879
Ryusei, how's it going?

1283
01:52:18,255 --> 01:52:19,214
Keita.

1284
01:52:21,424 --> 01:52:22,217
Keita!

1285
01:52:22,593 --> 01:52:23,550
Keita!

1286
01:53:08,346 --> 01:53:09,390
Keita!

1287
01:53:11,725 --> 01:53:12,851
Sorry.

1288
01:53:14,562 --> 01:53:15,562
Dad

1289
01:53:18,233 --> 01:53:19,901
It could not be more without seeing you.

1290
01:53:20,734 --> 01:53:22,654
I've jumped the rules to see you.

1291
01:53:23,363 --> 01:53:25,489
Dad is not my dad.

1292
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:31,330
You're right.

1293
01:53:32,747 --> 01:53:34,082
But listen,

1294
01:53:35,374 --> 01:53:36,710
for 6 years...

1295
01:53:38,044 --> 01:53:39,921
For 6 years I was your Dad.

1296
01:53:42,006 --> 01:53:43,300
I was not a good Dad,

1297
01:53:44,007 --> 01:53:45,511
but I was your Dad.

1298
01:53:52,099 --> 01:53:53,434
The flower you gave me...

1299
01:53:57,981 --> 01:53:59,608
Sorry, I lost it.

1300
01:54:05,113 --> 01:54:06,239
I'm sorry.

1301
01:54:11,787 --> 01:54:12,955
In the camera

1302
01:54:15,915 --> 01:54:18,127
where all the photos are that I took

1303
01:54:29,012 --> 01:54:30,264
And the piano...

1304
01:54:34,018 --> 01:54:35,979
Dad also stopped playing the piano.

1305
01:54:47,155 --> 01:54:48,242
Listen

1306
01:54:50,325 --> 01:54:52,203
the mission is over.

1307
01:55:44,464 --> 01:55:45,757
They've already returned.

1308
01:55:54,015 --> 01:55:55,267
Good.

1309
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,334
Let's go inside.

1310
01:56:21,752 --> 01:56:22,587
Yes

1311
01:56:34,181 --> 01:56:36,476
-Let's
Yes, let's.

1312
01:56:40,438 --> 01:56:43,440
Did you know that Spiderman 
is a real spider?

1313
01:56:46,152 --> 01:56:47,487
I had no idea.

1314
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,062
