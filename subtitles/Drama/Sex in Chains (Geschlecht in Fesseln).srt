{631}{690}SEX AND LUCIA
{3214}{3309}I'm sorry, Lorenzo.|For everything I said when I left.
{3315}{3372}Yeah, but you were right
{3389}{3434}You live with a sick person
{3459}{3510}No, that's not true.
{3542}{3584}I was too hard on you.
{3589}{3640}Don't worry, Lucia|That's it
{3655}{3750}I'm in a hole I've tried to|get out, but I can't
{3775}{3821}I'm lost forever
{3838}{3902}I'll take a few days off|and we'll take a trip.
{3926}{3956}To your island.
{3967}{4020}You can show me.|How about it?
{4063}{4142}Just the two of us.|It's calm this time of year.
{4147}{4209}We'll swim and lay in the sun.
{4221}{4272}I don't want to go to the island
{4329}{4413}I don't understand you.|You always wanted to go back.
{4671}{4729}Relax, honey. Don't worry.
{4783}{4828}Look, wait up for me
{4842}{4886}and tell me tonight.
{4905}{4957}I'll listen to anything you say.
{5107}{5176}Is that why you're so screwed up?
{5181}{5222}Something about the island?
{5227}{5290}I'm sorry, I can't tell you about it
{5295}{5373}You don't deserve this|You shouldn't know
{5378}{5422}Lucía, we're slammed.
{5455}{5505}Sorry, I have to hang up.
{5510}{5601}- We're slammed, but later...|- Yeah, slammed Bye
{6295}{6352}Sorry, but I have to go.|Lorenzo needs me.
{6357}{6444}If I were you, I'd take him to a shrink
{6867}{6894}Lorenzo.
{6978}{7004}Lorenzo.
{7943}{7966}Lorenzo?
{7971}{8038}- Lorenzo Alvarez residence?|- Yes.
{8063}{8120}Are you a family member?
{8127}{8192}I'm his girlfriend,|I live with him. What is it?
{8197}{8276}This is the police department|calling to inform you that
{8281}{8317}I've got some bad news
{8331}{8362}Don't wait up
{8367}{8432}I may never be back
{8437}{8470}You see, he
{8475}{8518}A car came along and
{8550}{8608}I don't know where to,|but faraway
{8613}{8662}I leave you everything
{8667}{8748}but me Forgive me|That's my last request
{13898}{13937}I'll live alone.
{13954}{13986}With no one else.
{14005}{14044}I don't need people.
{14293}{14328}What'll it be?
{15583}{15610}Alone.
{15626}{15662}Alone in the sun.
{15738}{15760}No.
{15777}{15841}I'm not gonna swim.|I'll stay in the sun.
{16030}{16057}Alone.
{16079}{16130}Alone in the sun.
{16146}{16202}Alone.|Alone in the sun.
{18073}{18184}SEX|6 YEARS EARLIER
{19667}{19716}The best fuck of my life.
{19761}{19810}I don't even know your name.
{19815}{19886}It's better that way.|Less complicated.
{19975}{20010}Give me a hint.
{20021}{20081}Anything. I'd like that.
{20115}{20173}Like a souvenir.|Where are you from?
{20217}{20241}Madrid.
{20270}{20298}I'm from Valencia.
{20323}{20354}Another one.
{20381}{20453}Two more hints each|and we go our separate ways.
{20511}{20560}I'm a paella expert.
{20583}{20662}- That's logical.|- Not quite. Keep in mind
{20667}{20745}that you just fucked|a world-class cook.
{20811}{20837}You're right.
{20850}{20906}Everything was delicious.
{20911}{20938}Of course.
{21001}{21058}A little salty, though.
{21063}{21092}What about you?
{21097}{21126}Sure, lots.
{21131}{21188}- Let's hear one.|- I was born in Madrid
{21205}{21238}on this very day.
{21251}{21282}Around this time.
{21345}{21381}It's your birthday!
{21399}{21424}Yes.
{21457}{21508}My birthday boy from Madrid.
{21523}{21572}What a great way to celebrate!
{21577}{21637}I'm your paella chef|from Valencia.
{21642}{21681}And your birthday gift.
{21693}{21734}Hey, that's three things!
{21781}{21822}You gave me only two.
{21838}{21900}I'm going to look for the third.
{22633}{22702}I've been calling all morning.
{22706}{22760}It's not my fault he's so busy
{22765}{22845}- Then whose fault is it?|- It's his job's fault
{22850}{22937}Tell him to work less.|I'll call back later.
{23469}{23514}He still can't talk
{23521}{23558}Can I leave him a message?
{23563}{23640}Of course I'll pass it on
{23645}{23676}Well, let's see.
{23679}{23722}I'm pregnant.
{23738}{23794}Since I know it's not his,
{23799}{23833}and I don't need him,
{23838}{23894}tell him I'm going to find|my child's father.
{23899}{23949}- You're leaving?|- That's right.
{23962}{24021}I'll give you two|a little hint.
{24050}{24086}He's not from Valencia.
{24103}{24168}Fine, one more hint.
{24205}{24270}I'm leaving right now for...|Madrid.
{24314}{24401}They'll advance you 20 percent|of what they gave you last time.
{24410}{24486}- I couldn't ask for more.|- No, it's fine. Thanks, Pepe.
{24491}{24529}It'll get me through winter.
{24534}{24588}I'll have it ready by summer.
{24593}{24662}Really?|You've been blocked two years.
{24733}{24760}I'm figuring out
{24765}{24796}if I'm really a writer.
{24842}{24866}You? A writer?
{24907}{24940}To the core.
{25047}{25138}What about that other story?|The one about the island.
{25143}{25174}And the Valencian girl?
{25209}{25234}Maybe.
{25267}{25310}I'm going to buy smokes.
{25338}{25409}Put lots of sex in it.|That's always nice.
{25442}{25470}Yeah, very.
{25551}{25585}Can I talk to you?
{25642}{25664}Now?
{25674}{25708}Later, then.
{25762}{25796}I'm with a friend.
{25958}{25981}What about?
{26195}{26221}Well...
{26239}{26274}Is something wrong?
{26347}{26370}Yes.
{26394}{26416}Tell me.
{26498}{26522}Now?
{26547}{26570}Yes.
{27029}{27056}What's your name?
{27086}{27112}Lucía.
{27127}{27154}I'm Lorenzo.
{27159}{27190}I know. I know you.
{27247}{27288}I read your novel.
{27314}{27354}Many times, and...
{27362}{27402}I can't read anything else.
{27439}{27481}It grabbed me inside
{27495}{27536}and won't let go.
{27578}{27602}But...
{27615}{27662}I've also followed you.
{27670}{27704}When I see you
{27727}{27778}I like to follow behind
{27783}{27817}and see where you go,
{27821}{27845}in secret.
{27877}{27909}I know where you live.
{27953}{27976}It's nearby.
{27991}{28017}And sometimes
{28023}{28096}I see you here.|Do you recognize me?
{28115}{28138}No.
{28211}{28246}I'm a waitress
{28267}{28301}in that restaurant.
{28315}{28361}You've never come in.
{28455}{28494}My boss is fine.
{28518}{28558}He's a good cook.
{28593}{28645}But he wants to live together,
{28663}{28694}and the truth is,
{28706}{28744}I was really glad.
{28758}{28786}Because...
{28791}{28820}I felt needed.
{28855}{28885}And I even like him.
{28918}{28946}So...
{28994}{29028}I've decided...
{29134}{29157}What?
{29210}{29285}The person I really want|to live with is you.
{29291}{29338}It's not that you're lonely.
{29350}{29400}I'm completely in love with you.
{29450}{29489}Madly, as you can see.
{29634}{29665}You're so brave.
{29689}{29712}Yeah.
{29745}{29808}And it's over. I tried.
{29863}{29898}Did you enjoy that?
{30047}{30086}Feel free to leave.
{31177}{31222}Is there anything else|you want?
{31258}{31281}Yes.
{31331}{31389}With time, living together,
{31437}{31513}you'll end up falling in love|with me, of course.
{32146}{32190}I think I just did.
{32353}{32418}Let's go get drunk and celebrate.
{33534}{33561}What pretty lights
{33566}{33594}you have at home.
{33870}{33930}I'm so happy.|You can't imagine.
{34038}{34073}Go ahead and undress me.
{34273}{34297}Forgive me, Lorenzo.
{34313}{34356}I'm not used to|things working out.
{34735}{34809}Do whatever you want to me.
{35367}{35440}You start, okay?
{37110}{37164}A ray of sunshine
{37190}{37234}Brought your love to me
{37974}{37998}Slowly.
{38003}{38068}With love.|We're just starting.
{38175}{38244}Like that.|So it lasts longer.
{39333}{39378}I'm dying, I'm dying!
{39438}{39461}My love!
{39547}{39582}I'm gonna die!
{40009}{40056}It's delicious, Lorenzo.
{40059}{40121}Wait until you try the fish.
{40162}{40228}I've always been|around good cooks.
{40235}{40266}I don't know why.
{40287}{40349}Though my boss isn't around|much anymore.
{40377}{40414}My grandmother, yes.
{40418}{40464}With her home cooking...
{40506}{40534}just for me.
{40558}{40614}I moved in with her|when I was six.
{40629}{40674}She said my parents and brother
{40678}{40736}had opened a newsstand in heaven
{40741}{40792}in front of the angel school.
{40819}{40909}And a bookshop. Their stand|in the village never paid much.
{40939}{41020}The three of them were killed|in a car crash.
{41034}{41094}And my poor grandmother|two years ago...
{41119}{41174}told me the whole story.
{41179}{41210}I still believe it.
{41217}{41282}I always liked people|who tell good stories.
{41310}{41340}I trust them.
{41355}{41425}Did your mother|teach you to cook?
{41430}{41510}No. She left my dad real quick,|when I was young.
{41514}{41561}I had to cook for him.
{41566}{41610}Until one day he got stabbed.
{41765}{41790}I may be
{41795}{41869}a shitty cook,|but I'm a great waitress.
{41913}{41942}I have a camera.
{43674}{43720}How about a striptease?
{43809}{43881}Right now, without getting up.
{43886}{43921}If you do one later.
{43931}{43962}You wouldn't.
{44329}{44386}I've got just what you want.
{44538}{44589}Oh, how I knew...
{44594}{44650}I've got just what you want
{44661}{44776}Oh, how I knew|I've got just what you want
{44786}{44838}It's all been taken care of,
{44843}{44917}I'll settle the score,|remember
{44927}{44954}I've got a map
{44983}{45006}Gorgeous.
{45011}{45093}and I'm one nosy bitch|I'm working on it
{45115}{45204}I gotta do it,|I don't want to end up broke
{45219}{45266}My feet are my ticket
{45270}{45317}Had to be good at something
{45342}{45393}I'm working on it
{45398}{45437}I'm working on it
{45442}{45472}I'm working on it
{45477}{45524}I'm resourceful, baby!
{45529}{45594}You turn me on,|saliva, milk and stuff
{45601}{45640}I'm in control
{48098}{48124}Lorenzo...
{48150}{48189}Lorenzo, my love.
{48211}{48249}I can't take anymore.
{48290}{48341}So much love will kill me.
{48591}{48617}I'm dying!
{48638}{48665}I'm dying!
{48797}{48849}Don't scream, it's no big deal!
{48975}{49001}Push.
{49022}{49074}That's it, a little more.
{49151}{49189}Here it comes.
{49195}{49226}A little more.
{49234}{49272}Here it comes.
{49619}{49650}I'll get the dad.
{49669}{49696}Yes, please.
{49882}{49948}You see?|Shouting makes no difference.
{50118}{50145}There's no one there.
{50161}{50240}It's all right, my little girl|will help me find him.
{50277}{50306}Have you ever...
{50311}{50350}with another girl...
{50358}{50398}had better sex?
{50411}{50434}No.
{50458}{50498}Tell me the truth.
{50555}{50618}Maybe on an isolated occasion.
{50635}{50674}But it's different.
{50702}{50760}Isolated on the island, right?
{50802}{50825}Yes.
{50891}{50932}A random somebody,
{50941}{50981}a total stranger,
{50990}{51030}with a full moon...
{51118}{51213}We should go to your island.|Separately, and meet there,
{51218}{51250}like strangers.
{51254}{51310}We'd have the best sex ever.
{51578}{51618}Which do you prefer?
{51639}{51705}Wild sex with a stranger?
{51734}{51788}Or sex with someone you know,
{51795}{51830}someone you love,
{51835}{51870}but also wild?
{51934}{51961}What?
{52018}{52056}You have to choose.
{52066}{52122}Wild sex with a stranger,
{52134}{52210}or wild sex with someone
{52223}{52285}who's crazy about you,|and who you love.
{52291}{52314}Go ahead.
{52319}{52373}- Be frank.|- With you.
{52438}{52465}Finally.
{52585}{52633}I'd never imagined|being so lucky.
{52651}{52682}Girls like you
{52687}{52752}never like guys like me.
{52883}{52922}You're a gift.
{53541}{53592}The restaurant in Madrid|grew famous
{53597}{53657}thanks to the paellas|made by the silent girl
{53677}{53782}She still recalled her grandmother,|buried back home with her parents
{53799}{53882}When asked where she was from,|she was so timid that
{53887}{53942}she'd say she was from Malta
{53990}{54106}Her destiny changed that night,|when she ran into a real Maltese
{54134}{54202}A ray of sunshine
{54231}{54293}Brought your love to me
{54319}{54358}A ray of sunshine
{54415}{54460}Straight to my heart
{56818}{56868}- How's it going?|- Fine.
{56882}{56946}Getting used to all this clean air.
{56959}{56982}Yeah.
{57007}{57102}You get used to everything here.|This island's easy.
{57131}{57162}And you're a pro.
{57178}{57242}Of course. You have oxygen.
{57254}{57314}I'm renting scuba equipment|this summer.
{57386}{57425}I'm testing it.
{57462}{57501}You like diving?
{57506}{57569}No, not me. Just the opposite.
{57587}{57618}Sorry, but...
{57623}{57693}I prefer open air.|Open air and sunshine.
{57715}{57741}Too bad.
{57773}{57818}These waters are special.
{57827}{57862}To each his own.
{58159}{58228}This really isn't an island.
{58278}{58304}It isn't?
{58322}{58361}It's a giant lid.
{58367}{58418}A floating piece of earth.
{58427}{58462}Like a raft.
{58521}{58578}But it isn't moving.
{58631}{58698}People get dizzy here|during high tide.
{58703}{58748}And no one knows why.
{58771}{58802}Except you.
{58823}{58888}I've dived underneath|the whole island.
{58910}{58957}It's totally hollow.
{58975}{59017}Thousands of caves,
{59053}{59088}but nothing else.
{59109}{59201}Not a single rock connects it|to the seafloor.
{59209}{59236}What's your name?
{59269}{59294}Carlos.
{59318}{59345}I'm Lucía.
{59382}{59417}Trust me, Lucía.
{59433}{59469}I'll show you someday.
{59479}{59505}Okay.
{59543}{59586}But I'll stay up here.
{59591}{59672}Right. The girl waits|on the pretty side,
{59681}{59716}and the crab explores the ugly,
{59733}{59764}rocky,
{59782}{59818}horrible side.
{60026}{60062}You want to see the good things
{60067}{60098}on this island?
{60157}{60178}Yeah.
{60219}{60266}I want you to meet Elena.
{60823}{60857}Hi, I'm Elena.
{60878}{60905}Lucía.
{61007}{61045}Stay for dinner?
{61111}{61137}Okay.
{61142}{61174}You can sleep here, too.
{61178}{61220}It's a guest house.
{61235}{61268}Carlos is alone,
{61273}{61354}so I have 9 rooms free.|Want to see them?
{61403}{61429}Come on.
{61511}{61546}This is my room.
{61706}{61762}Next to the kitchen|so I can cook on-line.
{61822}{61842}Come on in.
{61858}{61890}No, I'm sorry.
{61898}{61932}I'm not ready to see
{61937}{61974}other people up close.
{62049}{62078}I know which room.
{62174}{62212}It's perfect for you.
{62230}{62257}Come on.
{62327}{62401}I leave the second floor vacant|until summer.
{62899}{62945}3,000 a day in low season,
{62955}{63002}but you can have it for 2,000.
{63006}{63056}Plus 2,000 if you want board.
{63065}{63145}I recommend it,|I'm the best cook around.
{63178}{63254}Can I skip dinner|and stay tonight?
{63258}{63293}We'll talk tomorrow.
{63323}{63349}Of course.
{63446}{63526}Something terrible happened|and I had to run.
{63618}{63676}We'll take care of you here.
{63806}{63852}A ray of sunshine
{63899}{63946}Straight to my heart
{63974}{64048}Brought your love to me
{64067}{64144}I'd searched for so long
{64161}{64201}And finally it's mine
{64206}{64238}I have a new guest.
{64259}{64306}She's a fantastic singer.
{64329}{64386}So from now on,|I'll cook even better.
{64390}{64417}If possible.
{64462}{64492}Can I name you?
{64535}{64608}Name? Yeah, Lucía.
{64738}{64777}Are you writing it?
{64814}{64850}It's still unsent.
{64887}{64946}You can change your name|if you want.
{64951}{65002}We all use nicknames.
{65069}{65109}HER NAME'S LUCIA.
{65186}{65230}A RAY OF SUNSHINE.
{65242}{65273}Is that okay?
{65321}{65350}It's great.
{65542}{65569}Look.
{65574}{65610}This is for you.
{65661}{65706}"Sing us something, Lucía".
{65903}{65953}A RAY OF SUNSHINE...
{66038}{66098}STRAIGHT TO MY HEART...
{66215}{66317}"Welcome, Lucía. Nice song.|Where are you?".
{66394}{66489}EVERYDAY FURTHER AWAY|FROM WHERE I WAS.
{66506}{66544}I like that.
{66591}{66622}So would Carlos.
{66633}{66658}For himself.
{66666}{66712}He's been here 6 months.
{66721}{66785}I sense he's still tied|to the mainland.
{66825}{66897}He's someone|who gains your trust easily.
{66930}{66973}Is there anything between you?
{66978}{67029}Yeah, sex.
{67067}{67105}Every now and then.
{67139}{67178}Without intimacy.
{67233}{67312}I prefer it,|this way I don't get hooked.
{67334}{67393}Just wild sex.
{67430}{67476}It must be the island.
{67517}{67550}Yeah, but...
{67590}{67682}Carlos has the biggest dick|I've ever seen.
{67694}{67725}How lucky.
{67802}{67874}I don't know where he got it.|It's enormous.
{69341}{69374}Where are you?
{69381}{69414}The abortion part.
{69643}{69682}Is that a hint?
{69690}{69724}Why don't you take a stroll?
{69730}{69756}I am.
{69782}{69817}In the street.
{69835}{69890}You're like an expectant father.
{69898}{69924}Exactly.
{69991}{70029}And you're the mother.
{71069}{71157}It's very positive.|There's lots of happiness.
{71178}{71245}It's me. I was expecting|something tragic.
{71250}{71290}Like in your first novel.
{71355}{71432}I should have read it|while you were writing,
{71446}{71492}to get used to the idea.
{71546}{71601}I screwed up. I'm sorry.
{71611}{71656}I'm going for a walk.
{71747}{71802}I didn't grab your heart|this time.
{71817}{71864}I guess I already have it.
{72179}{72256}Remember that birthday|when you were on the island?
{72261}{72312}You sure got a great gift.
{72341}{72441}Get ready, because tonight|I've got another for you.
{72446}{72518}- From me.|- Are you proposing?
{72551}{72586}Remember my sister?
{72594}{72629}The one who's a nurse?
{72651}{72729}Well, she's become|close friends with a girl
{72762}{72849}whose baby she helped deliver|four years ago.
{72863}{72898}A little girl.
{73043}{73089}Speaking of girls...
{73110}{73173}How's the novel? All the stalling...
{73178}{73232}What do I tell my editors?
{73241}{73301}- You always think of something.|- Sure,
{73306}{73400}that's why you get|all your stories from me.
{73466}{73526}Write this one as is.|It's unbelievable.
{73555}{73582}Why's that?
{73594}{73630}By the way, don't worry
{73635}{73726}about my sister, she doesn't know|it's you. Or the mother
{73730}{73796}who gave birth,|I don't even know her.
{73813}{73858}I kept you secret.
{73875}{73901}Why secret?
{73934}{73958}Well,
{73967}{74025}the baby girl was born|here in Madrid.
{74042}{74098}But she was conceived|on a beach,
{74115}{74146}on an island,
{74173}{74213}a night like tonight,
{74242}{74281}with a stranger...
{74286}{74317}from Madrid.
{74342}{74389}It was his birthday.
{74474}{74538}If you write this well,|it'll be the story of your life
{74558}{74618}and my birthday gift to you.
{74677}{74770}I know where to find the kid.|Afternoons in a square.
{74806}{74838}Without the mother.
{74865}{74898}What's her name?
{74902}{74929}The mother?
{74934}{74982}No, the daughter.
{74998}{75036}Your daughter's name is Luna.
{75110}{75157}Of course. Luna.
{76945}{76970}What's your name?
{76998}{77020}Luna.
{77226}{77270}What's the sun's name?
{77353}{77401}- Lorenzo.|- Lorenzo.
{77435}{77470}Just like me.
{77478}{77525}What's the moon's name?
{77530}{77554}You want the job?
{77562}{77582}Yes.
{77590}{77641}Then the moon's name is Luna.
{77858}{77904}Today was an important day.
{78271}{78309}You don't know your father?
{78331}{78357}You've never seen him?
{78385}{78421}Do you know his name?
{78474}{78494}No.
{78530}{78581}Don't worry, names don't matter.
{78683}{78716}Would you like it if
{78783}{78812}I were your dad?
{78886}{78913}Could you be?
{78929}{78981}Yeah, if you want me to be.
{79022}{79053}But in secret.
{79063}{79101}My real father?
{79207}{79317}He thought it was a very big secret|for such a small little girl
{79322}{79360}His smile faded
{79370}{79457}Then he went over|and sat alongside her
{79463}{79550}You know what happens|if someone discovers the secret
{79559}{79613}between the moon and the sun?
{79691}{79730}The tide would drop...
{79761}{79789}and drop...
{79818}{79858}with a sound like:
{80150}{80190}Like mountains caving in.
{80385}{80465}Maybe someday he'd find a way|to tell her,
{80470}{80545}so for the time being|he left it at that
{80570}{80626}What was the point of being a father
{80633}{80676}if she didn't know?
{80749}{80809}He knew then that|if he'd told her,
{80826}{80886}she'd have kept the secret
{80946}{80973}Secret
{81174}{81206}You have a daughter?
{81265}{81308}Lorenzo, honey.
{81362}{81386}Do you?
{81421}{81450}Why do you ask?
{81463}{81504}I saw it on your computer.
{81539}{81569}And I loved it.
{81582}{81626}I can't keep writing it.
{81633}{81658}Why not?
{81662}{81710}I don't know what it is|to be a father.
{81714}{81773}Then make it up.
{82137}{82189}I'm glad you're writing again.
{82202}{82249}I was feeling guilty.
{82281}{82318}None of it is your fault.
{82595}{82642}Luna doesn't know her dad.
{82674}{82714}She lives alone with her mom?
{82718}{82778}No, with a dumb soccer player.
{82854}{82905}I've never seen my dad.
{82987}{83014}Me, neither.
{83082}{83126}My mother's an actress.
{83138}{83206}A porn actress.
{83262}{83289}I like that.
{83298}{83342}She quit last year.
{83358}{83404}She met this amazing guy
{83411}{83476}who was a client,|and fell for him.
{83505}{83545}Now we live together.
{83566}{83612}He retired her.
{83627}{83662}Sounds nice.
{83674}{83718}He's the sweetest guy...
{83723}{83796}He has the biggest heart ever
{83806}{83853}And he's handsome
{83862}{83906}He's really sexy
{83942}{83972}You like him, too?
{83986}{84008}Me?
{84058}{84094}Why? Can you tell?
{84218}{84250}You like him a lot?
{84286}{84318}Okay, drop it.
{84454}{84493}Would you do him?
{84498}{84586}No! He's my mother's lover.
{84602}{84660}Poor thing,|she's in love for once.
{84705}{84754}Do you think he likes you?
{84905}{84989}If he offered,|and your mom never found out?
{84994}{85037}Just once, as a test.
{85050}{85086}A test, right?
{85114}{85166}This is between you and me.
{85247}{85278}Just once?
{85299}{85357}Yeah. Why not?
{85419}{85506}Because. I don't know...|I hope I never get
{85517}{85565}put to the test.
{85610}{85658}But she put him to the test
{85686}{85757}One morning when her mother|was shopping,
{85779}{85852}she took a shower|and left the door open
{87050}{87094}It almost happened.
{87099}{87125}What did?
{87165}{87210}The test. With Antonio.
{87294}{87326}Tell me about it.
{87382}{87446}Last night,|when they went to bed,
{87478}{87544}I put one of my mom's movies on.
{87574}{87610}It's strange, but...
{87623}{87681}Seeing her in action|gets me hot.
{87709}{87749}You masturbated.
{87754}{87794}You always guess.
{87842}{87888}I took one of her dildos
{87893}{87949}from her room while they slept.
{88014}{88078}I lay naked on the sofa,
{88110}{88140}in the dark,
{88150}{88188}in front of the TV.
{88205}{88269}I started copying|her sexual positions.
{89706}{89748}Their lust almost killed them
{89819}{89850}He covered her mouth
{89855}{89908}so her mother wouldn't wake up
{90633}{90693}We decided not to tell my mom
{90702}{90761}And to never do it again
{90810}{90898}I promised Antonio|I'd find myself a boyfriend
{90910}{90982}right away so I'd have someone|to play with.
{91067}{91154}Here, I'll loan you my mom|for a couple days.
{91318}{91376}I masturbated because of you,
{91379}{91433}but ended up thinking of him.
{91466}{91505}But we didn't do it.
{91527}{91582}I'm not even sure I saw him
{91613}{91649}I just felt him
{91654}{91712}Spying on me from behind
{91746}{91780}At least I think so.
{92678}{92713}How nice!
{92723}{92785}You never greet me this way anymore.
{92859}{92921}I should get home early every night.
{92992}{93027}Your mom was great.
{93038}{93063}Quite an actress.
{93089}{93117}You got off?
{93134}{93157}Yes.
{93195}{93225}If only I'd seen you
{93275}{93328}through a hole in the wall.
{93341}{93389}Are you Belén's boyfriend?
{93444}{93483}Would you like him to be?
{93486}{93535}Yeah, sure.
{93547}{93588}Then that's that.
{94025}{94062}I have to sleep
{94065}{94129}at Luna's tonight.|Her parents are going out.
{94226}{94286}I can ask if my boyfriend|can come along.
{94321}{94354}She's really cool.
{94405}{94445}What's her name?
{94458}{94487}Elena.
{94522}{94545}Well,
{94596}{94685}I'd prefer just to see you and Luna,|no one else.
{94916}{94952}Why the boyfriend?
{94955}{94998}Can't they wait?
{95001}{95073}She asked me as a special favor.|Maybe they can't.
{95076}{95129}- They'll fuck.|- Good for them.
{95131}{95203}We don't even know him.|And in our bed?
{95236}{95285}You're just like your dog.
{95415}{95476}Hi, boyfriend.|The doors are open.
{95685}{95759}Be nice to him|or I'll have you fixed.
{95762}{95793}You hear me?
{96128}{96152}Delicious.
{96178}{96213}You're a great cook.
{96312}{96375}And what do you do?
{96588}{96622}You won't tell me?
{96822}{96851}I'll find out later.
{97088}{97113}I want some water.
{97234}{97302}Before I met Luna|I thought I'd never have kids.
{97374}{97432}Wouldn't you want|a daughter like her?
{97517}{97545}Of course.
{97571}{97594}To me...
{97634}{97664}You'll always be my first.
{97692}{97716}And to you?
{97745}{97787}The first and only.
{98473}{98506}Can I watch TV?
{98576}{98617}It's late, go to bed.
{98658}{98705}If Lorenzo tucks me in.
{98707}{98769}You'll have to show me where.
{98862}{98885}And a kiss?
{99558}{99648}- Can you tell stories?|- Of course, that's my job.
{100290}{100364}Did you know that island|has the lowest moon?
{100430}{100493}That's right.|But only a few of us
{100498}{100557}in the world know it.|It also has
{100562}{100633}great weather,|and it grants wishes.
{100653}{100732}If you need something,|the rocks below the shore
{100737}{100782}give it to you as a gift.
{100808}{100876}But watch out for the holes|in the ground.
{100962}{101007}Though it doesn't matter,|because
{101012}{101052}no one ever dies there.
{101057}{101153}For example, if you fall,|you can choose any life you want.
{101164}{101210}You can be your favorite fish.
{101857}{101929}The island was glad|when the girl arrived,
{101933}{101979}especially the rocks|below the shore,
{101982}{102045}so they decided|to give her something.
{102050}{102073}But what?
{102118}{102147}A raft.
{102162}{102191}Bigger.
{102221}{102244}A dog.
{102252}{102316}No. Something she didn't have.
{102332}{102360}Her father.
{102412}{102465}Bull's-eye, butterfly.
{103270}{103323}Tonight you keep watch outside.
{103426}{103476}All she had to do was
{103484}{103563}look everywhere for him|until she found him.
{103593}{103663}Her father could be|whoever she wanted.
{103730}{103801}But then the girl had doubts,|like everyone.
{103814}{103899}Would she choose a lighthouse keeper|or a fisherman?
{103910}{103980}She knew one thing:|what she really wanted
{103985}{104065}was her mother to become|a beautiful mermaid.
{104310}{104342}She's asleep.
{104564}{104632}Belén, I want you to know something.
{104692}{104753}I changed into this,|do you mind?
{110462}{110512}Hi, it's Elena
{110529}{110563}Is Belén there?
{110582}{110604}Yes.
{110626}{110661}It's Elena.
{110856}{110879}Hello?
{110894}{110950}- How are you?|- Better.
{110954}{111000}I'm improving.
{111034}{111060}And you?
{111074}{111127}Well, I haven't cried.
{111152}{111210}I can't.|I haven't seen her.
{111214}{111291}They told me,|but I don't understand.
{111309}{111385}I don't want to imagine it.|That's why I came here.
{111393}{111481}To be closer to her|by swimming in the sea.
{111576}{111601}Cry, Belén
{111618}{111651}Now that you can.
{111760}{111828}It helps me to hear you cry.
{111898}{111929}That's it
{111937}{111961}Cry
{111965}{111987}Cry
{111994}{112029}You need to cry.
{112102}{112144}She hears you, too
{112178}{112249}A big kiss from the sea...
{112260}{112292}from both of us.
{112552}{112607}Lately you're always in bed.
{112612}{112651}You know what time it is?
{112708}{112783}It's a beautiful day.|Sunny and clear.
{112826}{112867}And it's my day off.
{112881}{112927}Get up, lazybones!
{113036}{113064}You need all
{113068}{113116}these pills just to sleep?
{113144}{113211}You never had problems|sleeping before.
{113293}{113327}Lorenzo, honey.
{113365}{113451}I'm worried about you.|You've been depressed for days.
{113456}{113485}Trouble with the novel?
{113526}{113553}Is that it?
{113608}{113647}You look terrible.
{113680}{113709}Something's happened.
{113714}{113737}What?
{113838}{113869}You're sweating.
{113886}{113964}I've left,|and there's no coming back.
{113969}{113995}Your life
{114000}{114048}is more important|than your novel.
{114052}{114086}Than any novel.
{114090}{114172}Writing is vital to you, but|you need to take care of yourself.
{114181}{114288}You're too good a person to see|the shit I have inside.
{114292}{114316}Stop, that's enough.
{114321}{114349}I have a confession.
{114354}{114409}So you see how close I am.
{114433}{114472}I've been reading the novel.
{114489}{114529}Everything you've written.
{114533}{114611}At night, when you're asleep.|Do you mind?
{114628}{114653}I understand
{114658}{114725}why you're so affected,|why you reject it,
{114730}{114785}and why it's hard for you|to go on.
{114790}{114841}It can't be easy, living there,
{114846}{114880}in that house,
{114885}{114939}with that stormy relationship.
{114942}{115032}So much repressed desire,|impossible to control.
{115060}{115140}He's coming between|a mother and her daughter,
{115145}{115184}breaking a sacred bond.
{115192}{115259}But the passion's there, too.|The lust.
{115440}{115481}I identify with her.
{115486}{115543}I understand exactly|how she feels.
{115550}{115616}Disgusted, guilty, selfish...
{115621}{115649}Her mom's jealousy...
{115654}{115705}But she's forced to choose
{115709}{115767}between passionate love|for a man,
{115772}{115809}and love for a mother.
{115824}{115917}I'd have chosen the same.|Such decisions are made
{115922}{115964}by gut instinct.
{115969}{115993}Sex...
{115998}{116056}The thick, burning lust
{116062}{116095}filled the mother,
{116100}{116139}the man and the daughter.
{116180}{116211}They were sex-crazed
{116214}{116259}The stench of raw sex
{116282}{116307}The mother and the man,
{116401}{116429}the man and the daughter,
{116452}{116481}the daughter and the man
{116513}{116543}All the man's poisoned love...
{116548}{116616}Alone with the daughter,|the daughter and the man
{116620}{116649}The smell was...
{116654}{116712}heavy, hot, overwhelming
{116717}{116741}Stuffy
{116746}{116778}Stale air.
{116808}{116835}Exhausted
{117110}{117173}The paint fell from the corners|of the room
{117182}{117236}and the walls became rocky,
{117264}{117309}Like those in a cave.
{117336}{117387}A filthy den of...
{117428}{117450}Get out!
{117500}{117522}Relax.
{117553}{117615}Just wanted to let you know|that I'm here.
{118066}{118129}The man was selfish, a coward.
{118144}{118244}He hated himself so deeply,|so utterly, there wasn't even
{118254}{118300}time for forgiveness.
{118320}{118363}Only time for death.
{118372}{118412}Death, death,
{118436}{118482}death, death.
{118509}{118535}Belén's fine.
{118541}{118593}She's home with her family.
{118605}{118647}Forget the whole thing.
{118654}{118691}You've suffered enough.
{118726}{118777}Will I ever read the novel?
{118781}{118805}Of course.
{118896}{118923}Another thing.
{118954}{119004}Tell me about Elena, too.
{119014}{119061}My sister writes to her on-line.
{119066}{119141}She's on that Mediterranean|cooking chat everyday.
{119146}{119200}- Her user name is "Alsi".|- "Alsi"?
{119205}{119227}A-L-S-l.
{119281}{119348}That's Spanish|for "island" backwards.
{119358}{119403}Hi, Alsi How are you?
{119478}{119513}I don't know you.
{119530}{119599}It's better that way.|I'm here to help.
{119665}{119691}What's your user name?
{119694}{119739}I don't understand the icon.
{119760}{119813}It's a lighthouse for your island.
{119818}{119852}Are you the keeper?
{119860}{119885}Yeah.
{119925}{120009}I have a story for you,|it's full of advantages.
{120032}{120061}I'd like that.
{120109}{120132}Thanks.
{120202}{120281}The first advantage|is at the end of the story.
{120286}{120364}It doesn't finish,|it falls in a hole.
{120433}{120502}And the story|starts again halfway.
{120530}{120588}The other advantage,|and the biggest,
{120608}{120684}is that you can change course|along the way
{120692}{120761}If you let me.|If you give me time.
{120820}{120893}All the time you want.
{120928}{120969}Go on, please
{121829}{121861}To be continued
{122081}{122138}What happened?|Why are you so late?
{122142}{122191}My boss invited me to dinner.
{122196}{122259}He wanted me to try a new dish.
{122269}{122305}Did you screw him?
{122318}{122345}What?
{122368}{122421}Did you go to bed with him?
{122521}{122597}That's right, you guessed it.
{122714}{122760}And how was it?
{122770}{122821}- Tell me about it.|- No.
{122832}{122861}You first.
{122884}{122919}What's going on?
{122924}{122955}What's your problem?
{122977}{123029}I lost track of you ages ago.
{123042}{123079}You're not alive!
{123112}{123151}Was it the first time with him?
{123186}{123213}The second.
{123236}{123289}The first was before we met.
{123313}{123352}Or should I say|before I proposed?
{123364}{123404}So it doesn't count.
{123466}{123551}You could have told me before.
{123568}{123615}Yeah, I could have.
{123652}{123675}And today?
{123718}{123741}Well...
{123777}{123817}It doesn't count, either.
{123825}{123849}It's a lie.
{123874}{123915}But we came close.
{123988}{124010}How close?
{124045}{124081}Did you stop or did he?
{124090}{124155}What about you stopping with me?
{124436}{124515}Lorenzo, do you love me?
{124540}{124623}I need to hear you say it|right now.
{124729}{124785}Yes. Deeply.
{124810}{124873}More than myself. But I'm lost.
{124912}{124952}Then let me help you.
{124961}{125001}You don't deserve this.
{125006}{125064}Why not? I'm your girlfriend,
{125086}{125139}and I love you more than myself.
{125142}{125208}Come on, it's obvious.|You're draining my life away.
{125212}{125295}I'm doing all I can to get back,|and accept myself,
{125300}{125343}but if I can't,
{125357}{125401}don't wait for me.
{125446}{125492}I wouldn't, either.
{125534}{125571}What happened to you?
{125710}{125760}Belén, it's Elena.
{125810}{125837}How are you?
{125880}{125912}It's real hot here.
{125917}{125979}Why don't you come out?|The sea will do you good
{125984}{126051}I have a guesthouse|for the whole summer.
{126060}{126145}I'll have a room free in August.|Upstairs.
{126153}{126210}My best room.|You'll watch the sunset
{126214}{126286}from your bed.|Bring someone if you want.
{126301}{126323}Well?
{126333}{126409}The truth is,|I'd love to visit an island...
{126449}{126477}with someone.
{126488}{126517}Then that's it
{126554}{126611}- It's difficult, Elena.|- Difficult?
{126616}{126695}Nothing is here|All the bad's left behind
{126700}{126757}- Just bring along the good|- Right.
{126796}{126827}The good up front.
{126849}{126887}I really want to see you,
{126892}{126915}but here
{126942}{126988}I don't want to lose touch
{127048}{127085}Say you'll come
{127110}{127137}Promise me
{127198}{127225}I promise.
{127238}{127268}I'll try.
{127296}{127323}Good bye.
{128118}{128187}Forgive me, Lucía.|I've got to end this.
{128237}{128313}I'm going to kill them|for once and for all.
{128330}{128356}Both of them.
{128404}{128429}Right now.
{128904}{128977}If you've stopped being a writer,|you have to
{128982}{129009}explain why.
{129065}{129093}You're holding back.
{129214}{129241}If you don't tell me,
{129246}{129277}I'll never forgive you!
{129282}{129318}You hear me? Never!
{129328}{129357}I can't talk like this.
{129362}{129384}Talk?
{129422}{129484}You're the one who won't talk.
{129508}{129554}You keep it all inside.
{129558}{129607}You won't let me help you.
{129618}{129649}Everything's you.
{129653}{129698}I'm crumpled up in the corner.
{129722}{129745}Look.
{129753}{129793}You were meant to live alone,
{129834}{129865}and to suffer alone.
{129886}{129973}And to drive yourself fucking crazy,|which I don't understand.
{129993}{130035}You're sick, Lorenzo.
{130046}{130156}Sick of yourself, of your|own standards, and nothing else.
{130174}{130215}Of your fucking secrets!
{130226}{130289}You keep me around,|but in the dark.
{130318}{130363}Because my complaints|don't count.
{130382}{130416}Because you don't give
{130420}{130466}a fuck what happens to me.
{130470}{130514}Your troubles are so deep,
{130524}{130561}I'm fucking stupid,
{130566}{130633}and all you care about|is if I screw my boss or not.
{130781}{130815}I'm exhausted.
{130838}{130872}You're driving me nuts.
{130880}{130920}I'll be late to work.
{130985}{131019}Enjoy your hole.
{131070}{131124}Have fun rotting by yourself.
{131334}{131392}Look, I've never been this mean
{131397}{131427}to anyone.
{131456}{131513}It's the last time|I'll let myself talk like this.
{131526}{131567}It's for me, not you.
{131654}{131681}That's right.
{131730}{131783}It's time to think of myself,
{131796}{131831}of my own needs.
{131860}{131921}Because I see no future with you.
{133166}{133184}Lucía!
{133248}{133303}Come over here|and lie next to me.
{134091}{134129}Relax, Lucía.
{134145}{134208}Let the mud absorb all the bad.
{134217}{134289}Later it'll wash away in the sea.
{135145}{135177}I don't want sex.
{135237}{135274}I'm not ready yet.
{135517}{135548}Don't worry.
{135617}{135668}We'll just lie here,
{135721}{135765}drying out in the sun.
{136001}{136053}Yeah, he looks like Carlos.
{136246}{136316}"Missing for 6 months".
{136329}{136382}"Manuela and Belén Lozano,|mother and daughter,
{136387}{136456}and Antonio Castillo,|were all living together.
{136461}{136570}If anyone knows where they are,|please contact the police."
{136582}{136608}The police?
{136611}{136641}We'll...
{136657}{136702}act like we didn't see this,
{136721}{136764}Like nothing's happened.
{136878}{136924}We know he lived with two women.
{136934}{136972}Mother and daughter.
{136977}{137018}Yeah, and the daughter...
{137069}{137090}What?
{137138}{137205}The daughter was taking care of...
{137221}{137252}my daughter.
{137518}{137568}They left without him,
{137577}{137634}quietly, without saying good bye
{137643}{137690}As he slept,
{137694}{137725}Like in a dream
{137737}{137802}When he woke, he felt|the two lifeless women
{137819}{137852}were still with him,
{137873}{137905}Like any morning
{137917}{137948}at that hour
{137965}{138030}And he lay still,|wishing his life would also
{138035}{138108}leave him, through his blood
{138125}{138178}What good was his blood now?
{138203}{138265}He wished it softly,|without real intent
{138286}{138338}And he chose to escape,|to start over,
{138350}{138378}to be new
{138383}{138428}To change his blood
{138433}{138466}So he said good bye
{138485}{138508}and left
{138614}{138660}We should give him a chance.
{138714}{138760}Don't we all deserve one?
{138817}{138861}Just in case, if in doubt,
{138887}{138940}isn't it better to trust people?
{138953}{138976}Right?
{139053}{139125}So when he gets back,|we'll ask him to explain.
{139141}{139176}It's better this way.
{139195}{139249}- Especially for you.|- For me?
{139265}{139312}I just want to forget.
{139346}{139392}You can't forget some things.
{139395}{139472}In this house you can.|That's why we're here.
{139510}{139544}Then it's too late.
{139570}{139624}I should have come before.
{139659}{139693}When there was time...
{139774}{139800}for Lorenzo.
{139873}{139933}I wanted him to show me|the island.
{139958}{140020}I asked him to, but he wouldn't.
{140086}{140142}It would have been|his birthday soon.
{140277}{140332}- What day?|- The 23rd.
{140594}{140614}Of May?
{140767}{140810}We could have celebrated
{140818}{140852}here on the island.
{140858}{140885}Maybe even with you.
{140919}{140945}Who knows if
{140950}{140997}we'd have met, right?
{141015}{141037}Right.
{141106}{141140}When was Lorenzo here?
{141189}{141221}A long time ago.
{141255}{141292}Before we met.
{141301}{141328}How long ago?
{141339}{141399}About six years ago.
{141447}{141471}Yeah.
{141477}{141513}I think he turned 25 here.
{141559}{141581}Lucía...
{141618}{141641}What is it?
{141698}{141735}I'm overwhelmed...
{141745}{141790}But I can't cry.
{141819}{141845}Don't worry.
{141855}{141894}You don't have to.
{141915}{141972}I'm the one|who should cry over him.
{142165}{142200}I'll just faint, then.
{142259}{142288}It's the sea.
{142302}{142345}Must be high tide.
{142629}{142670}I'll never cry again.
{142769}{142802}I'm going to bed.
{143073}{143100}What's going on?
{144223}{144254}"Luna,
{144259}{144312}spring of 1988".
{144418}{144441}Luna.
{144729}{144790}"Why bother being a father
{144809}{144846}if she didn't know?"
{144894}{144957}He knew then that|if he'd told her,
{144975}{145029}she'd have kept the secret
{145154}{145206}Lucía, never talk to me|about this.
{145219}{145264}I don't want to hear it.
{145573}{145600}Well, I do.
{147085}{147120}He's out diving.
{147181}{147216}Beneath the island.
{147285}{147320}Do you like Carlos?
{147366}{147401}I don't anymore.
{147414}{147506}Go ahead, he's all yours.|I won't even be jealous.
{147633}{147666}What are you doing?
{147713}{147756}Asking a friend for advice.
{147761}{147794}I don't know him,
{147801}{147852}but I'm getting to like him.
{147999}{148082}He's been writing me since|I got here. He made up
{148087}{148140}a sweet story to help me.
{148150}{148196}He taught me to forget.
{148201}{148237}And to escape pain.
{148310}{148336}Want to read it?
{148367}{148398}You could get into it.
{148415}{148466}It's full of advantages.
{148486}{148512}Because in the end...
{148525}{148552}there's a hole
{148563}{148612}to escape through.
{148765}{148796}Back to the middle.
{148845}{148889}To change course,
{148921}{148946}if you want.
{149118}{149200}That's his icon,|it's a lighthouse.
{149251}{149302}But it has no keeper,
{149325}{149376}it must be a computer.
{149415}{149446}Maybe his.
{149637}{149688}You'll meet my daughter.
{149813}{149848}I can't read this.
{149857}{149882}Why not?
{149998}{150044}It will grab me.
{150066}{150103}And won't let go.
{150115}{150146}That's good.
{150185}{150226}Did you finally do it?
{150233}{150260}Do what?
{150266}{150300}Change course?
{150339}{150411}Not all the way,|there wasn't time.
{150433}{150473}That's why I'm writing him.
{150534}{150596}WHERE'S THE KEEPER?
{150627}{150657}Don't write him.
{150743}{150812}There's nothing more he can do.
{151025}{151100}Has he written you|since I first got here?
{152730}{152800}Hi, Lorenzo. How are you?
{152841}{152882}Your face says it all.
{152886}{152941}They called to say|you were more awake.
{153029}{153060}Do you know who I am?
{153093}{153112}Pepe.
{153149}{153177}Thank God.
{153246}{153332}Glad to have you back.|You'll be writing in no time.
{153373}{153404}Where's Lucía?
{153531}{153569}It says here that
{153578}{153638}your cranial hematoma|has subsided.
{153653}{153740}And the rest of your bruises|are history.
{153775}{153801}Where's Lucía?
{153913}{153956}You were in bad shape.
{153998}{154056}We didn't think you'd make it.
{154101}{154130}How long have I been here?
{154157}{154182}Well...
{154221}{154266}One week in a coma,
{154281}{154337}with this horrible respirator...
{154349}{154392}And two more weeks
{154403}{154480}breathing on your own,|but unconscious.
{154502}{154586}And in this room|since four or five days ago,
{154615}{154672}blabbering in your sleep.
{154683}{154754}And when you'd wake up,|you were out of it.
{154885}{154945}We haven't heard from Lucía.
{154962}{155012}I looked everywhere.
{155021}{155112}She hasn't been to your place,|nor the restaurant, since the night
{155117}{155142}of your accident.
{155341}{155365}Lorenzo.
{155410}{155488}I think Lucía|believes you're dead.
{155515}{155550}That's why she left.
{155555}{155596}I talked to the ambulance guy.
{155613}{155670}He said a cop called your house
{155675}{155706}and talked to her.
{155711}{155757}He mentioned the car
{155765}{155792}and she hung up.
{155829}{155861}He tried to call back
{155890}{155925}but she wouldn't answer.
{155979}{156012}I need to pee.
{156039}{156068}Do it there,
{156073}{156120}- in the pan.|- No way!
{156126}{156154}Wait, wait.
{156165}{156221}Thanks, Pepe, but I can manage.
{156301}{156344}Lose the attitude.
{156350}{156408}I've helped you all week.
{156419}{156457}You just don't remember.
{156887}{156921}I know where she might be.
{156989}{157015}You came by car?
{157058}{157098}As soon as they called.
{157739}{157766}Good morning.
{157790}{157856}Tell me right now why|you're here and Belén isn't.
{157930}{157956}You see?
{157961}{158041}I don't want to forget anymore.|Thanks to you, honey.
{158113}{158136}Well?
{158153}{158189}Won't you answer me?
{158229}{158316}It's time to show you who|I really am, no more stories.
{158322}{158393}Were you there with Belén,|in my room,
{158477}{158548}when that fucking dog|killed my daughter?
{158583}{158626}- It wasn't me.|- It wasn't?
{158631}{158700}Then why are the cops|looking for you?
{158789}{158829}Belén was with some guy
{158834}{158909}who met her in the park|with your daughter.
{158937}{159024}But he disappeared|after that night.
{159287}{159316}What about Belén?
{159321}{159373}Where is she?|Since you know everything.
{159410}{159489}She left with her mom|but didn't tell me where.
{159522}{159600}She changed in the end,|and chose her mom over me.
{159725}{159760}Can't blame her.
{159777}{159838}A mother always comes first.
{159921}{160004}I don't trust you anymore,|Antonio...
{160041}{160102}I won't ask you|any more questions.
{160107}{160153}I'll leave that to the police.
{160169}{160214}Lying to them won't be so easy.
{160241}{160300}Look how brave I got|all of a sudden.
{160309}{160326}Wait.
{160361}{160433}Please don't call the police.
{160458}{160484}Why not?
{160497}{160545}Are you holding back|anything else?
{160634}{160668}I've no one left
{160687}{160722}who I can trust.
{160759}{160793}Where are you going?
{160805}{160838}Making a getaway?
{160843}{160888}They'll track you down!
{160917}{160952}If you call the cops,
{160986}{161017}I'll leave, too.
{161033}{161058}Are you stupid?
{161070}{161092}Yes.
{162533}{162568}Where are you going?
{162594}{162621}I don't understand.
{162642}{162722}I trust Carlos, and I believe him.|I want to know more.
{162726}{162768}That's the easy part.
{162781}{162822}Believing what you want.
{162829}{162860}What pleases you.
{162865}{162916}I did that, too.|Until tonight.
{162921}{162965}I'll chase whomever I please!
{162985}{163044}Men matter less and less to me.
{163050}{163075}That's my lot.
{163092}{163132}They've never given me anything.
{163142}{163168}Except sex.
{163174}{163240}No? What about the keeper?
{163277}{163316}What? Besides wild sex
{163321}{163347}and a daughter?
{163387}{163422}Don't forget that story
{163427}{163496}full of advantages that|he wrote just for you!
{163510}{163540}That's right.
{163558}{163608}Maybe your boyfriend|was the last
{163613}{163657}- good man on earth.|- No, he wasn't.
{163691}{163769}You're wrong,|but that's my business.
{163781}{163852}And I suppose Carlos|is also your business.
{163862}{163892}Yours alone.
{163905}{163954}You're the only one chasing him.
{163990}{164012}Yeah.
{164034}{164071}Come to think of it,
{164076}{164140}I always chase men.|When I like them.
{164153}{164193}To each his own, right?
{164301}{164338}Where could he be?
{164369}{164433}I don't know. I'm going home.
{164438}{164481}You guys cook tonight.
{169207}{169246}I'm so sorry.
{171141}{171182}Carlos! It's me, Lucía.
{171187}{171236}I want to come down.
{171275}{171310}Come and help me.
{171334}{171398}I know how to dive, too.|What did you think?
{171542}{171591}Lucía. It's me, Elena.
{171871}{171898}Where's Carlos?
{171908}{171940}Down there.
{171948}{171980}Did he escape?
{172034}{172060}Maybe he's dead.
{172166}{172251}If he turns up,|we have to believe him, okay?
{172277}{172310}Whatever you want.
{172326}{172353}That's right.
{172383}{172413}He's a crab.
{172499}{172526}Let's go home.
{172532}{172556}What for?
{172562}{172587}To eat.
{172593}{172612}So early?
{172653}{172679}I'm not hungry.
{172689}{172754}Tough. It's about time|you helped me cook.
{172794}{172876}We'll make a special meal|and we'll be together
{172897}{172928}and have fun.
{173341}{173392}You're a gift to this earth.
{173423}{173500}Elena. You're crying.
{173584}{173662}Tears of happiness,|which is what I am from now on.
{173667}{173716}Great. I hope it's contagious.
{173721}{173761}Piece of cake.|Let's go.
{178296}{178380}The first advantage|is at the end of the story
{178385}{178409}It doesn't finish,
{178414}{178460}it falls in a hole
{178565}{178621}And the story|starts again halfway
{178659}{178731}The other advantage,|and the biggest,
{178747}{178824}is that you can change course|along the way
{178828}{178901}If you let me|If you give me time
{179972}{180002}A ray of sunshine
